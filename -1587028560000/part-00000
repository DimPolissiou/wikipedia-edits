His resurgence continued as he marked his 31st birthday with a goal against Bolton Wanderers. He made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 16 April 2006. However, Fowler's fitness remained a concern. In March 2006, manager [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]] commented on Fowler's work and progress by saying, \"to buy a Robbie Fowler who is fit and scoring goals would cost a lot, maybe \u00a310m or more\". Despite concerns about his fitness, Fowler finished the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306 season]] scoring on a more consistent basis than Liverpool's other strikers.

Bizarrely, all three of his League goals were penalties against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. One of these was in the away game on the opening day of the season, and the other two in the reverse fixture at [[Anfield]]. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Ben\u00edtez's [[squad rotation system|squad rotation policy]]. On 25 October 2006 Fowler was named as Liverpool's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] for the first time since his return in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], scoring just before half-time in a 4\u20133 win.\n\nOn 5 December, Fowler scored his first two goals in the [[UEFA Champions League]] competition proper against [[Galatasaray S.K.

Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, although Ian Rush had scored more goals in the league.

In the same season he scored twice in a 4\u20133 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first [[FA Cup final]] that season, but was on the losing side as Manchester United won 1\u20130. He had scored four goals against United in the league that season, scoring twice in a 2\u20132 draw at [[Old Trafford]] on 1 October 1995, and twice in a 2\u20130 win at [[Anfield]] on 16 December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/columns/story?id=264175&root=england&cc=5739|title=Ten years and counting|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=4 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6L9ZdoHcd?url=http://espnfc.com/columns/story?id=264175|archivedate=15 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFowler received a call-up to the [[England national football team|full England squad]] and won his first cap on 27 March 1996 as a substitute in a [[friendly match|friendly]] against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]].<ref name=\"MEN factfile\"/> His first start at international level was against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] which was the England game following his substitute appearance.

These devices are commonly marketed as being beneficial to [[allergy]] sufferers and [[asthma]]tics, and at reducing or eliminating [[passive smoking|second-hand tobacco smoke]]. The commercially graded air purifiers are manufactured as either small stand-alone units or larger units that can be affixed to an air handler unit (AHU) or to an [[HVAC]] unit found in the medical, industrial, and commercial industries. Air purifiers may also be used in industry to remove impurities from air before processing. [[Pressure swing adsorption|Pressure swing adsorbers]] or other adsorption techniques are typically used for this.\n\n==History==\nIn 1830, a patent was awarded to [[Charles Anthony Deane]] for a device comprising a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long leather hose attached to the rear of the helmet was to be used to supply air, the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double [[bellows]]. A short pipe allowed breathed air to escape. The garment was to be constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Newton | first = William | last2 = Partington | first2 = Charles Frederick | title = Charles Anthony Deane - 1823 patent | journal = Newton's London Journal of Arts and Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 341 | year = 1825 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=IwA1AAAAMAAJ | doi = | id = | publisher = W.

As of 2005, the most common methods were high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005-11-01|title=Air Cleaning Technologies|journal=Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series|volume=5|issue=17|pages=1\u201352|issn=1915-7398|pmc=3382390|pmid=23074468}}</ref>\n\n=== Filtration ===\n[[Air filter]] purification traps airborne particles by size exclusion. Air is forced through a filter and particles are physically captured by the filter. Various filters exist notably including:\n* High-efficiency particulate arrestance ([[HEPA]]) filters remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles and are usually more effective at removing larger particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a [[clean room]], must be arranged so that no air bypasses the HEPA filter. In dusty environments, a HEPA filter may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the HEPA filter needs cleaning or replacing less frequently. HEPA filters do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts in the course of operation.\n* Filter HVAC at [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value|MERV]] 14 or above are rated to remove airborne particles of 0.3 micrometers or larger. A high-efficiency MERV 14 filter has a capture rate of at least 75% for particles between 0.3 and 1.0 micrometers. Although the capture rate of a MERV filter is lower than that of a HEPA filter, a central air system can move significantly more air in the same period of time. Using a high-grade MERV filter can be more effective than using a high-powered HEPA machine at a fraction of the initial capital expenditure. Unfortunately, most furnace filters are slid in place without an [[hermetic seal|airtight seal]], which allows air to pass around the filters. This problem is worse for the higher-efficiency MERV filters because of the increase in [[drag (physics)|air resistance]]. Higher-efficiency MERV filters are usually denser and increase air resistance in the central system, requiring a greater [[air pressure]] drop and consequently increasing energy costs.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n[[File:\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u2116 3. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a.\u041e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u0430.jpg|thumb|right|192px|<center> {{PAGENAME}} </center>]]\n*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]] - UVGI can be used to sterilize air that passes UV lamps via forced air. Air purification UVGI systems can be freestanding units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is the placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pan of the cooling system will keep micro-organisms from forming in these naturally damp places. The most effective method for treating the air rather than the coils is in-line duct systems, these systems are placed in the center of the duct and parallel to the airflow.\n\n*[[Activated carbon]] is a [[porosity|porous]] material that can [[adsorption|adsorb]] volatile chemicals on a molecular basis, but does not remove larger particles. The adsorption process when using activated carbon must reach equilibrium thus it may be difficult to completely remove contaminants.<ref name=\"zeltner\" /> Activated carbon is merely a process of changing contaminants from a gaseous phase to a solid phase, when aggravated or disturbed contaminants can be regenerated in indoor air sources.<ref name=\"lee\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Ao | first1 = C.

Most polarized-media electronic air cleaners use safe 24-volt DC voltage to establish the polarizing electric field. Most airborne particles have a charge and many are even bi-polar.  As airborne particles pass through the electric field the polarized field re-orients the particle to  adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic air cleaners increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n*[[Photocatalysis|Photocatalytic oxidation]] (PCO) is an emerging technology in the HVAC industry.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In addition to the prospect of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) benefits, it has the added potential for limiting the introduction of unconditioned air to the building space, thereby presenting an opportunity to achieve energy savings over previous prescriptive designs.

UV sterilization bulbs must be replaced about once a year; manufacturers may require periodic replacement as a condition of [[warranty]]. Photocatalytic Oxidation systems often have high commercial costs.<ref name=\"zeltner\" />\n:A related technology relevant to air purification is photoelectrochemical oxidation (PECO) [[Photoelectrochemical oxidation]]. While technically a type of PCO, PECO involves electrochemical interactions among the catalyst material and reactive species (e.g., through emplacement of cathodic materials) to improve quantum efficiency; in this way, it is possible to use lower energy UVA radiation as the light source and yet achieve improved effectiveness.<ref name=\"goswami\">{{cite patent|invent1=Goswami, D.

These ions attach to airborne particles which are then [[electrostatic]]ally attracted to a charged collector plate. This mechanism produces trace amounts of [[ozone]] and other oxidants as by-products.<ref name=\"ang\" /> Most ionizers produce less than 0.05 [[parts per million|ppm]] of ozone, an industrial safety standard. There are two major subdivisions: the fanless ionizer and fan-based ionizer. Fanless ionizers are noiseless and use little power, but are less efficient at air purification. Fan-based ionizers clean and distribute air much faster. Permanently mounted home and industrial ionizer purifiers are called [[electrostatic precipitator]]s.\n*[[Immobilized Cell Technology|Immobilized cell technology]] removes microfine particulate matter from the air by attracting charged particulates to a bio-reactive mass, or bioreactor, which enzymatically renders them inert.\n*[[Ozone generator]]s are designed to produce ozone and are sometimes sold as whole-house air cleaners. Unlike ionizers, ozone generators are intended to produce significant amounts of ozone, a strong [[oxidant]] gas which can oxidize many other chemicals. The only safe use of ozone generators is in unoccupied rooms, utilising \"shock treatment\" commercial ozone generators that produce over 3000&nbsp;mg of ozone per hour. Restoration contractors use these types of ozone generators to remove smoke odors after fire damage, musty smells after flooding, [[mold remediation|mold]] (including [[toxic mold]]s), and the stench caused by decaying flesh which cannot be removed by bleach or anything else except for ozone. However, it is not healthy to breathe ozone gas, and one should use extreme caution when buying a room air purifier that also produces ozone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/house-domes/electron/cleaners-air-purificateurs-eng.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104211545/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/house-domes/electron/cleaners-air-purificateurs-eng.php |archive-date=2010-01-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*[[Titanium dioxide]] (TiO<sub>2</sub>) technology - [[nanoparticles]] of TiO<sub>2</sub>, together with [[Limestone|calcium carbonate]] to neutralize any [[acid]]ic gasses that may be adsorbed, is mixed into slightly porous paint.

Ozone production is typical for air ionizing purifiers. Although a high concentration of ozone is dangerous, most air ionizers produce low amounts (< 0.05 ppm{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}). The noise level of a purifier can be obtained through a customer service department and is usually reported in [[decibel]]s (dB). The noise levels for most purifiers are low compared to many other home appliances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Frequency of filter replacement and electrical consumption are the major operation costs for any purifier. There are many types of filters; some can be cleaned by water, by hand or by [[vacuum cleaner]], while others need to be replaced every few months or years. In the United States, some purifiers are certified as [[Energy Star]] and are [[efficient energy use|energy efficient]].\n\nHEPA technology is used in portable air purifiers as it removes common airborne allergens. The [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] has requirements manufacturers must pass to meet HEPA requirements. The HEPA specification requires removal of at least 99.97% of 0.3 micrometers airborne pollutants. Products that claim to be \"HEPA-type\", \"HEPA-like\", or \"99% HEPA\" do not satisfy these requirements and may not have been tested in independent laboratories.\n\nAir purifiers may be rated on a variety of factors, including [[Clean Air Delivery Rate]] (which determines how well air has been purified); efficient area coverage; [[air changes per hour]]; energy usage; and the cost of the replacement filters. Two other important factors to consider are the length that the filters are expected to last (measured in months or years) and the noise produced (measured in [[decibel]]s) by the various settings that the purifier runs on. This information is available from most manufacturers.\n\n==Potential ozone hazards==\nAs with other health-related appliances, there is controversy surrounding the claims of certain companies, especially involving [[air ioniser|ionic air purifiers]]. Many air purifiers generate some ozone, an energetic [[allotrope]] of three [[oxygen]] atoms, and in the presence of humidity, small amounts of [[nitrogen oxide|NO<sub>x</sub>]]. Because of the nature of the ionization process, ionic air purifiers tend to generate the most ozone.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This is a serious concern because ozone is a [[criteria air pollutant]] regulated by health-related US federal and state standards.

As of 2005, the most common methods were high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005-11-01|title=Air Cleaning Technologies|journal=Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series|volume=5|issue=17|pages=1\u201352|issn=1915-7398|pmc=3382390|pmid=23074468}}</ref>\n\n=== Filtration ===\n[[Air filter]] purification traps airborne particles by size exclusion. Air is forced through a filter and particles are physically captured by the filter. Various filters exist notably including:\n* High-efficiency particulate arrestance ([[HEPA]]) filters remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles and are usually more effective at removing larger particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a [[clean room]], must be arranged so that no air bypasses the HEPA filter. In dusty environments, a HEPA filter may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the HEPA filter needs cleaning or replacing less frequently. HEPA filters do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts in the course of operation.\n* Filter HVAC at [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value|MERV]] 14 or above are rated to remove airborne particles of 0.3 micrometers or larger. A high-efficiency MERV 14 filter has a capture rate of at least 75% for particles between 0.3 and 1.0 micrometers. Although the capture rate of a MERV filter is lower than that of a HEPA filter, a central air system can move significantly more air in the same period of time. Using a high-grade MERV filter can be more effective than using a high-powered HEPA machine at a fraction of the initial capital expenditure. Unfortunately, most furnace filters are slid in place without an [[hermetic seal|airtight seal]], which allows air to pass around the filters. This problem is worse for the higher-efficiency MERV filters because of the increase in [[drag (physics)|air resistance]]. Higher-efficiency MERV filters are usually denser and increase air resistance in the central system, requiring a greater [[air pressure]] drop and consequently increasing energy costs.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n[[File:\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u2116 3. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a.\u041e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u0430.jpg|thumb|right|192px|<center> {{PAGENAME}} </center>]]\n*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]] - UVGI can be used to sterilize air that passes UV lamps via forced air. Air purification UVGI systems can be freestanding units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is the placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pan of the cooling system will keep micro-organisms from forming in these naturally damp places. The most effective method for treating the air rather than the coils is in-line duct systems, these systems are placed in the center of the duct and parallel to the airflow.\n\n*[[Activated carbon]] is a [[porosity|porous]] material that can [[adsorption|adsorb]] volatile chemicals on a molecular basis, but does not remove larger particles. The adsorption process when using activated carbon must reach equilibrium thus it may be difficult to completely remove contaminants.<ref name=\"zeltner\" /> Activated carbon is merely a process of changing contaminants from a gaseous phase to a solid phase, when aggravated or disturbed contaminants can be regenerated in indoor air sources.<ref name=\"lee\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Ao | first1 = C.

Most polarized-media electronic air cleaners use safe 24-volt DC voltage to establish the polarizing electric field. Most airborne particles have a charge and many are even bi-polar.  As airborne particles pass through the electric field the polarized field re-orients the particle to  adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic air cleaners increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n*[[Photocatalysis|Photocatalytic oxidation]] (PCO) is an emerging technology in the HVAC industry.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In addition to the prospect of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) benefits, it has the added potential for limiting the introduction of unconditioned air to the building space, thereby presenting an opportunity to achieve energy savings over previous prescriptive designs.

These ions attach to airborne particles which are then [[electrostatic]]ally attracted to a charged collector plate. This mechanism produces trace amounts of [[ozone]] and other oxidants as by-products.<ref name=\"ang\" /> Most ionizers produce less than 0.05 [[parts per million|ppm]] of ozone, an industrial safety standard. There are two major subdivisions: the fanless ionizer and fan-based ionizer. Fanless ionizers are noiseless and use little power, but are less efficient at air purification. Fan-based ionizers clean and distribute air much faster. Permanently mounted home and industrial ionizer purifiers are called [[electrostatic precipitator]]s.\n*[[Immobilized Cell Technology|Immobilized cell technology]] removes microfine particulate matter from the air by attracting charged particulates to a bio-reactive mass, or bioreactor, which enzymatically renders them inert.\n*[[Ozone generator]]s are designed to produce ozone and are sometimes sold as whole-house air cleaners. Unlike ionizers, ozone generators are intended to produce significant amounts of ozone, a strong [[oxidant]] gas which can oxidize many other chemicals. The only safe use of ozone generators is in unoccupied rooms, utilising \"shock treatment\" commercial ozone generators that produce over 3000&nbsp;mg of ozone per hour. Restoration contractors use these types of ozone generators to remove smoke odors after fire damage, musty smells after flooding, [[mold remediation|mold]] (including [[toxic mold]]s), and the stench caused by decaying flesh which cannot be removed by bleach or anything else except for ozone.

Ozone production is typical for air ionizing purifiers. Although a high concentration of ozone is dangerous, most air ionizers produce low amounts (< 0.05 ppm{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}). The noise level of a purifier can be obtained through a customer service department and is usually reported in [[decibel]]s (dB). The noise levels for most purifiers are low compared to many other home appliances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Frequency of filter replacement and electrical consumption are the major operation costs for any purifier. There are many types of filters; some can be cleaned by water, by hand or by [[vacuum cleaner]], while others need to be replaced every few months or years. In the United States, some purifiers are certified as [[Energy Star]] and are [[efficient energy use|energy efficient]].\n\nHEPA technology is used in portable air purifiers as it removes common airborne allergens. The [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] has requirements manufacturers must pass to meet HEPA requirements. The HEPA specification requires removal of at least 99.97% of 0.3 micrometers airborne pollutants. Products that claim to be \"HEPA-type\", \"HEPA-like\", or \"99% HEPA\" do not satisfy these requirements and may not have been tested in independent laboratories.\n\nAir purifiers may be rated on a variety of factors, including [[Clean Air Delivery Rate]] (which determines how well air has been purified); efficient area coverage; [[air changes per hour]]; energy usage; and the cost of the replacement filters. Two other important factors to consider are the length that the filters are expected to last (measured in months or years) and the noise produced (measured in [[decibel]]s) by the various settings that the purifier runs on. This information is available from most manufacturers.\n\n==Potential ozone hazards==\nAs with other health-related appliances, there is controversy surrounding the claims of certain companies, especially involving [[air ioniser|ionic air purifiers]]. Many air purifiers generate some ozone, an energetic [[allotrope]] of three [[oxygen]] atoms, and in the presence of humidity, small amounts of [[nitrogen oxide|NO<sub>x</sub>]]. Because of the nature of the ionization process, ionic air purifiers tend to generate the most ozone.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This is a serious concern because ozone is a [[criteria air pollutant]] regulated by health-related US federal and state standards.

They have been based out of [[Bengaluru]], [[Karnataka]], since 2013, after their return from Hong Kong (2012 - 2013).<ref name=\"metalassault.com\">http://metalassault.com/Interviews/2013/02/07/a-detailed-conversation-with-vocalist-extraordinaire-girish-pradhan/</ref><ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news-and-interviews/Musical-journey-of-Girish-Pradhan/articleshow/10115401.cms</ref>  \n\n==History==\nThe line up started in 2006 with Guitarist Suraz Karki and Girish Pradhan. Nagen Sarki, a drummer who was working with the band Still Waters, joined the line-up, on Suraz\u2019s recommendation. The guitarist\u2019s long time friend Vishal Pradhan also joined the band as the bass player.\n\nPrior to this, Girish was a part of a band named Anarchy, from Gangtok, of which his brother Yogesh Pradhan was the drummer. He later became the bassist and producer of GATC.  Suraz, Nagen and Vishal collectively were also a part of a band named Mukti, in the district of [[Namchi]], in Sikkim. The new group formed decided to keep the name Mukti. They started playing small gigs in Gangtok and [[Darjeeling]]. \n\nFrom 2007 to 2009, the line up was broken. In April 2008, Girish temporarily moved back to Gangtok and reunited with Suraz to form a line up to take part in a local band competition. The group was named \u201cRevolving Barrel\u201d, with drummer Ronald Pradhan and bassist Noel Lepcha. \n\nThe later half of 2008 saw Pradhan travel to Nepal, Kathmandu. Ronald had moved to the city and suggested that they reform Revolving Barrel there. Joined by bassist Lokesh Thapa (Gingerfeet/Still waters) and an old time friend of Ronald, Jatin Pradhan on the guitars, Revolving Barrel was now based out of Kathmandu. Back in Gangtok, Suraz and Nagen joined/formed \u201cA.live!\u201d.  A.Live went on to win the Mangan Rock Fest in the district of Mangan, Sikkim, and the line up of Revolving Barrel came to an end. \n\nGirish returned to Gangtok in the later half of 2009 where Yogesh had come too. As the two brothers met, Yogesh suggested that they record a single original. His YouTube channel, then named \u201cGirish Pradhan\u201d, could be used as a platform to promote it.  They started working on a song which Girish had been working on during his stay in Nepal. It was named, \u201dAngel\u201d. It was completed in autumn 2009 and was first released by the magazine T.N.T ([[The North East Times|The Northeast Times]]) in their seasonal CD release, Great Eastern Rock Volume II<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.assamtimes.org/node/3466|title=TNT- Great eastern Rock volume 2 Cd features 17 bands from the Northeast|date=2010-01-05|website=Assam Times|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>. The brothers started performing acoustic sets in Cafe Live and Loud. However, Yogesh had to leave to complete his course. Girish started doing solo unplugged sessions in the pub. Soon, Noel and Nagen, who no longer worked with \u201cA.live!\u201d, joined on bass and drums. Girish took up the role of a vocalist and a lead guitarist. The YouTube channel, the solo single, \u201cAngel\u201d and Cafe Live and Loud had turned the singer\u2019s name into a small brand of its own. The line-up was finally named Girish and The Chronicles, with Yogesh acting as the producer for the band. The band had weekly performances at Cafe Live and Loud and did a debut open concert with the spastic society on Friday the 13 October 2009, sharing the stage with [[Lou Majaw]].\n\nThe band was invited to participate in various competitions and went on to headline small college fests. The first competition they took part in was Alcheringa, Rock o Phoenix, annually held at IIT Guwahati. They were temporarily joined by violinist/keyboardist Mischael Jiwandan Pradhan, a college mate of Girish. Soon in the weeks that followed, participating in such competitions because a regular routine for the band from January till April. Parts of Assam, West Bengal and other parts of the country were covered. In April, the band won auditions to a music awards festival named \u201c[[Sun\u010dane Skale|Suncane Skale]]\u201d, to be held in [[Montenegro]]. The band recorded an original single which was to be complied in the festival\u2019s CD release. The tracks were sent to Yogesh for drums/keyboards and arrangement. The lyrics was written in collaboration with an old friend of Girish, Mausami Khushbu Rai. The song was named \u201cAngel\u2019s Angel\u201d and later changed to \u201cYesteryears\u201d.  They travelled to Montenegro, where the band was awarded first runners up to the title of \u201cSummer song\u201d. The song was played in European radio. On returning to Delhi, the band was covered by various TV channels such as Aaj Tak and CNN IBN along with printed media like The Telegraph<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/suncane-invite-for-sikkim-band-girish-n-the-chronicles-off-to-rock-europe/cid/506719|title=Suncane invite for Sikkim band - Girish 'N' The Chronicles off to rock europe|website=www.telegraphindia.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>. They were also invited to the Sikkim Governor\u2019s office and The Chief Minister\u2019s office of Sikkim for receiving congratulations. Later the same year, the band was empaneled in the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]] ([[ICCR]]). \n\nIn 2011, the band was invited for a performance at the [[The Heritage Academy, Kolkata|Heritage academ]]<nowiki/>y, Kolkata when Noel decided to leave the band. They called Yogesh, who was originally a drummer-turned-guitarist to fill in for the bass. While the YouTube channel was doing a good job of marketing the band, it was around September when an event organising company Ojone - O3 events led by entrepreneur Ujjwal Mukhia, invited the band to perform at the Hard Rock Cafe Bangalore.  The band did a series of small shows around the city. During this time an earthquake struck Sikkim. The band still in Bengaluru, worried for their families, came up with the song \u201c''A New Beginning''\u201d. In two days, the song was recorded at Sound Glitz Studio, and released. Girish also participated in the Yamaha Asian Beat national Finals with his other project Silver Tears during this time, where he won the best vocalist award.<ref>https://www.deccanherald.com/amp/content/187255/metal-singer-girish-pradhan-wins.htm</ref> The band got a chance to participate in the finals of the same competition on an international level, held at [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].<ref>https://id.yamaha.com/id/news_events/contents/asianbeat/history/2011/index.htm</ref> At around the same time, Girish was offered a contract in the clubs of Hong Kong as a vocalist. Back in Gangtok, it was decided that the band would take in Abhishek Lemo Gurung (Still Waters/Gingerfeet) as their temporary vocalist. They decided to take part in the ''[[Hornbill Festival]]''  held at ''[[Nagaland]],'' where they were runners up, with Suraz named best guitarist and Abhishek best vocalist. In their return to Gangtok, they formed a blues trio and were performing regular gigs in the town.\n\n2012 saw the frontman of the band spending a few months in various clubs of Hong Kong as a singer. One club in particular was named ''Escape'', located in the streets of Wanchai . After a few months of working. He successfully made a deal with the club owners for bringing GATC to Hong Kong for a small tour and then join the clubs under contract for a year. After a year long stay the band finally decided on going back home and compile an album.  \n\nAfter returning to India, Pradhan started with a solo performance at the Punjab Engineering College Fest. In early 2013, the band stayed in Gangtok for three months (January-March), where the album was completed. It was backed up by the editor of TNT magazine Pradyot Manikya. Although the album was complete, the band wanted to re-record everything replacing the Fender Stratocaster guitar takes with Gibson Les Pauls. Angel was re-recorded wholly along with the other songs. The band reconnected with Ojone and decided to relocate to Bengaluru, Karnataka. They started off by co-headlining BMS college fest along with Lagori and [[Kryptos (band)|Kryptos]]. Soon with Ujjwal Mukhia as their new manager, the band took an independent house in the city where they started finishing off the album. The band got a chance to open for [[Hoobastank]], who were to perform<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rollingstoneindia.com/hoobastank-to-perform-in-shillong/|title=Hoobastank To Perform In Shillong -|date=2013-06-08|website=My Site|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> in Shillong, Meghalaya. It was organised by TNT magazine. GATC started performing frequently in the Bengaluru city\u2019s prominent venues such as Take 5, B-Flat, Hard Rock Cafe and Vapour.  \n\nGATC released their first album - 'Back On Earth\u2019 consisting of 14 Tracks in August, 2014 under [[Universal Music Group]] label. The album release was followed by a national Hard Rock Cafe Tour. The album was promoted by Contrabands, which was a property of [[Universal Music Group]], [[VH1]] & [[Hard Rock Cafe]].

They have been based out of [[Bengaluru]], [[Karnataka]], since 2013, after their return from Hong Kong (2012 - 2013).<ref name=\"metalassault.com\">http://metalassault.com/Interviews/2013/02/07/a-detailed-conversation-with-vocalist-extraordinaire-girish-pradhan/</ref><ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news-and-interviews/Musical-journey-of-Girish-Pradhan/articleshow/10115401.cms</ref>  \n\n==History==\nThe line up started in 2006 with Guitarist Suraz Karki and Girish Pradhan. Nagen Sarki, a drummer who was working with the band Still Waters, joined the line-up, on Suraz\u2019s recommendation. The guitarist\u2019s long time friend Vishal Pradhan also joined the band as the bass player.\n\nPrior to this, Girish was a part of a band named Anarchy, from Gangtok, of which his brother Yogesh Pradhan was the drummer. He later became the bassist and producer of GATC.  Suraz, Nagen and Vishal collectively were also a part of a band named Mukti, in the district of [[Namchi]], in Sikkim. The new group formed decided to keep the name Mukti. They started playing small gigs in Gangtok and [[Darjeeling]]. \n\nFrom 2007 to 2009, the line up was broken. In April 2008, Girish temporarily moved back to Gangtok and reunited with Suraz to form a line up to take part in a local band competition. The group was named \u201cRevolving Barrel\u201d, with drummer Ronald Pradhan and bassist Noel Lepcha. \n\nThe later half of 2008 saw Pradhan travel to Nepal, Kathmandu. Ronald had moved to the city and suggested that they reform Revolving Barrel there. Joined by bassist Lokesh Thapa (Gingerfeet/Still waters) and an old time friend of Ronald, Jatin Pradhan on the guitars, Revolving Barrel was now based out of Kathmandu. Back in Gangtok, Suraz and Nagen joined/formed \u201cA.live!\u201d.  A.Live went on to win the Mangan Rock Fest in the district of Mangan, Sikkim, and the line up of Revolving Barrel came to an end. \n\nGirish returned to Gangtok in the later half of 2009 where Yogesh had come too. As the two brothers met, Yogesh suggested that they record a single original. His YouTube channel, then named \u201cGirish Pradhan\u201d, could be used as a platform to promote it.  They started working on a song which Girish had been working on during his stay in Nepal. It was named, \u201dAngel\u201d. It was completed in autumn 2009 and was first released by the magazine T.N.T ([[The North East Times|The Northeast Times]]) in their seasonal CD release, Great Eastern Rock Volume II<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.assamtimes.org/node/3466|title=TNT- Great eastern Rock volume 2 Cd features 17 bands from the Northeast|date=2010-01-05|website=Assam Times|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>. The brothers started performing acoustic sets in Cafe Live and Loud. However, Yogesh had to leave to complete his course. Girish started doing solo unplugged sessions in the pub. Soon, Noel and Nagen, who no longer worked with \u201cA.live!\u201d, joined on bass and drums. Girish took up the role of a vocalist and a lead guitarist. The YouTube channel, the solo single, \u201cAngel\u201d and Cafe Live and Loud had turned the singer\u2019s name into a small brand of its own. The line-up was finally named Girish and The Chronicles, with Yogesh acting as the producer for the band. The band had weekly performances at Cafe Live and Loud and did a debut open concert with the spastic society on Friday the 13 October 2009, sharing the stage with [[Lou Majaw]].\n\nThe band was invited to participate in various competitions and went on to headline small college fests. The first competition they took part in was Alcheringa, Rock o Phoenix, annually held at IIT Guwahati. They were temporarily joined by violinist/keyboardist Mischael Jiwandan Pradhan, a college mate of Girish. Soon in the weeks that followed, participating in such competitions because a regular routine for the band from January till April. Parts of Assam, West Bengal and other parts of the country were covered. In April, the band won auditions to a music awards festival named \u201c[[Sun\u010dane Skale|Suncane Skale]]\u201d, to be held in [[Montenegro]]. The band recorded an original single which was to be complied in the festival\u2019s CD release. The tracks were sent to Yogesh for drums/keyboards and arrangement. The lyrics was written in collaboration with an old friend of Girish, Mausami Khushbu Rai. The song was named \u201cAngel\u2019s Angel\u201d and later changed to \u201cYesteryears\u201d.  They travelled to Montenegro, where the band was awarded first runners up to the title of \u201cSummer song\u201d. The song was played in European radio. On returning to Delhi, the band was covered by various TV channels such as Aaj Tak and CNN IBN along with printed media like The Telegraph<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/suncane-invite-for-sikkim-band-girish-n-the-chronicles-off-to-rock-europe/cid/506719|title=Suncane invite for Sikkim band - Girish 'N' The Chronicles off to rock europe|website=www.telegraphindia.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>. They were also invited to the Sikkim Governor\u2019s office and The Chief Minister\u2019s office of Sikkim for receiving congratulations. Later the same year, the band was empaneled in the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]] ([[ICCR]]). \n\nIn 2011, the band was invited for a performance at the [[The Heritage Academy, Kolkata|Heritage academ]]<nowiki/>y, Kolkata when Noel decided to leave the band. They called Yogesh, who was originally a drummer-turned-guitarist to fill in for the bass. While the YouTube channel was doing a good job of marketing the band, it was around September when an event organising company Ojone - O3 events led by entrepreneur Ujjwal Mukhia, invited the band to perform at the Hard Rock Cafe Bangalore.  The band did a series of small shows around the city. During this time an earthquake struck Sikkim. The band still in Bengaluru, worried for their families, came up with the song \u201c''A New Beginning''\u201d. In two days, the song was recorded at Sound Glitz Studio, and released. Girish also participated in the Yamaha Asian Beat national Finals with his other project Silver Tears during this time, where he won the best vocalist award.<ref>https://www.deccanherald.com/amp/content/187255/metal-singer-girish-pradhan-wins.htm</ref> The band got a chance to participate in the finals of the same competition on an international level, held at [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].<ref>https://id.yamaha.com/id/news_events/contents/asianbeat/history/2011/index.htm</ref> At around the same time, Girish was offered a contract in the clubs of Hong Kong as a vocalist. Back in Gangtok, it was decided that the band would take in Abhishek Lemo Gurung (Still Waters/Gingerfeet) as their temporary vocalist. They decided to take part in the ''[[Hornbill Festival]]''  held at ''[[Nagaland]],'' where they were runners up, with Suraz named best guitarist and Abhishek best vocalist. In their return to Gangtok, they formed a blues trio and were performing regular gigs in the town.\n\n2012 saw the frontman of the band spending a few months in various clubs of Hong Kong as a singer. One club in particular was named ''Escape'', located in the streets of Wanchai . After a few months of working. He successfully made a deal with the club owners for bringing GATC to Hong Kong for a small tour and then join the clubs under contract for a year. After a year long stay the band finally decided on going back home and compile an album.  \n\nAfter returning to India, Pradhan started with a solo performance at the Punjab Engineering College Fest. In early 2013, the band stayed in Gangtok for three months (January-March), where the album was completed. It was backed up by the editor of TNT magazine Pradyot Manikya. Although the album was complete, the band wanted to re-record everything replacing the Fender Stratocaster guitar takes with Gibson Les Pauls. Angel was re-recorded wholly along with the other songs. The band reconnected with Ojone and decided to relocate to Bengaluru, Karnataka. They started off by co-headlining BMS college fest along with Lagori and [[Kryptos (band)|Kryptos]]. Soon with Ujjwal Mukhia as their new manager, the band took an independent house in the city where they started finishing off the album. The band got a chance to open for [[Hoobastank]], who were to perform<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rollingstoneindia.com/hoobastank-to-perform-in-shillong/|title=Hoobastank To Perform In Shillong -|date=2013-06-08|website=My Site|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> in Shillong, Meghalaya. It was organised by TNT magazine. GATC started performing frequently in the Bengaluru city\u2019s prominent venues such as Take 5, B-Flat, Hard Rock Cafe and Vapour.  \n\nGATC released their first album - 'Back On Earth\u2019 consisting of 14 Tracks in August, 2014 under [[Universal Music Group]] label. The album release was followed by a national Hard Rock Cafe Tour. The album was promoted by Contrabands, which was a property of [[Universal Music Group]], [[VH1]] & [[Hard Rock Cafe]].

Its natural [[habitat]]s are [[tropical moist lowland forest]] and [[tropical moist montane forest]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe fernwren was first described by the English zoologist and ornithologist, [[Charles Walter De Vis]], in 1889, and grouped with the scrubwrens as ''[[Sericornis]] gutturalis''. It was later included in the genus ''[[Crateroscelis]]'', along with three species of mouse-warblers found in New Guinea, but was subsequently moved to the monotypic genus ''Oreoscopus'' (established by [[Alfred John North|North]] in 1905). The fernwren is a basal (subfamily) member of Acanthizidae and sister to the genus ''[[Pachycare]]''.<ref>Schodde, R. and Christidis, L.
