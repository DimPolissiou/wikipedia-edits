The head of the valley is called Back Dale and there is a side valley called Horseshoe Dale. Wye Dale is at the foot of the valley to the north. The valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]], fed by the Deepdale Side Resurgence spring and another spring by Thirst House Cave further up the valley. The stream runs into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]].<ref name=\"OS2\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThirst House Cave's name is derived from Th'Hurst House as it was earlier called Hob Hurst House, named after a goblin believed to live in the cave (not to be confused with Hob Hurst's House prehistoric burial mound on Beeley Moor). The cave is is 58m long. Local men Micah Salt and Robert Milletts excavated the cave in the 1880s and 1890s, after boys found a bear's skull in the cave. They discovered [[Roman Empire|Roman]] artefacts, including bronze jewelery, enamelled brooches, pottery fragments, coins and an iron and bone knife.

It is distinct from another Deep Dale, near [[Sheldon, Derbyshire|Sheldon]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} to the east.\n\nThe dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies just south west of the hamlet of [[King Sterndale]]. The head of the valley is called Back Dale and there is a side valley called Horseshoe Dale. Wye Dale is at the foot of the valley to the north. The valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]], fed by the Deepdale Side Resurgence spring and another spring by Thirst House Cave further up the valley. The stream runs into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]].<ref name=\"OS2\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThirst House Cave's name is derived from Th'Hurst House as it was earlier called Hob Hurst House, named after a goblin believed to live in the cave (not to be confused with Hob Hurst's House prehistoric burial mound on Beeley Moor). The cave is is 58m long. Local men Micah Salt and Robert Milletts excavated the cave in the 1880s and 1890s, after boys found a bear's skull in the cave. They discovered [[Roman Empire|Roman]] artefacts, including bronze jewelery, enamelled brooches, pottery fragments, coins and an iron and bone knife. Many of these objects are on display in the Buxton Museum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wondersofthepeak.org.uk/facts/thirst-house-cave/|title=Thirst House Cave|last=|first=|date=|website=Wonders of the Peak|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peakdistrictcaving.info/home/the-caves/buxton/thirst-house-cave|title=Thirst House Cave - peakdistrictcaving.info|last=|first=|date=|website=Peak District Caving|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nDeep Dale and Topley Pike is a protected [[nature reserve]], which is overseen by the [[Derbyshire Wildlife Trust]]. The reserve contains [[whitebeam]], [[Taxus|yew]], [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[hazel]] trees  and [[Gymnocarpium robertianum|limestone fern]] on the lower scree slopes, with [[bilberry]], [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|cowberry]] and wild flowers on the steep upper slopes, including [[Geranium sanguineum|bloody crane's bill]], [[Campanula glomerata|clustered bellflower]], [[Cistaceae|rock rose]] and [[Silene nutans|Nottingham catchfly]]. Without sheep grazing, the native grasses of [[Helictotrichon pratense|meadow oat]] and [[Carex panicea|carnation sedge]] flourish. The limestone cliffs are an attractive habitat for [[Common kestrel|kestrels]] and [[Western jackdaw|jackdaws]]. Topley Pike and Deep Dale is also a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.derbyshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/deep-dale-and-topley-pike|title=Deep Dale and Topley Pike {{!}} Derbyshire Wildlife Trust|website=www.derbyshirewildlifetrust.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1000145.pdf|title=TOPLEY PIKE & DEEP DALE SSSI|last=|first=|date=|website=Designated Site - Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Buxton to [[Chelmorton]] section of the [[Midshires Way]] long-distance footpath runs across Deep Dale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ldwa.org.uk/|title=Midshires Way|last=|first=|date=|website=Long Distance Walkers Association|language=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The Priest's Way path runs through the valley floor of Deep Dale and Horseshoe Dale.<ref name=\"OS2\" />\n\nThe crags of carboniferous limestone in Deep Dale are popular with rock climbers.

Dacian ruins have been discovered recently near [[Obreja]], a village 7&nbsp;km away. As the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] invaded [[Dacia]], they built a [[castrum]] named [[Tibiscum]], which was dug up by archaeologists near the nearby village of Jupa, a castrum which later grew to be a full city. Tibiscum is considered one of the gates of [[Christianity]] in [[Dacia]], having an important role also in the [[Roman culture|Romanization]] of the local people.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the local people continuously inhabited the area. The region became part of the [[Hungarian Kingdom]], then later under the rule of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Transylvanian Principality]], and under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1787 a self-inflicted defeat, the [[Battle of Kar\u00e1nsebes|Battle of Caransebe\u0219]], is supposed (the historical accuracy is in doubt) to have taken place here. Later, the [[Habsburgs]] took the control of the region, after prolonged wars against the Ottomans. As part of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Principality of Transylvania]], in 1804 it became part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], it became again part of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].\n\nAfter railroads began to appear, the role of Caransebe\u0219 grew continuously. In the late 19th century, the Romanian people of the settlement elected to the Parliament of Hungary the Hungarian Lajos Mocs\u00e1ry, who was a progressive democratic politician fighting for the cultural and administrative rights of all nationalities (including the Romanians) living in the Hungarian Kingdom of that time. After the [[Treaty of Trianon]], in 1920 Caransebe\u0219 became part of [[Greater Romania]]. After the rise of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] in 1947, an [[Caransebe\u0219 Airport|airport]] and an airbase were built close to the city.

[[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]] unveiled him with the persona of \"[[Narcissism|Narcissus]]\" at [[Royal Rumble (1993)|Royal Rumble 1993]]. Shortly thereafter, his name was altered slightly to \"The Narcissist\".

This caused a number of his opponents to demand that he wear a cover over it during matches when he had a streak of [[Knockout|knocking people out]]. This eventually led to WWF officials demanding that Luger wear an elbow pad, though he would often remove it. The Narcissist's one major feud was with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]]. The feud was based on Heenan, his advisor, referring to him as being \"Beyond Perfection\", in a slight at Mr. Perfect, his former managerial client.

In it, he exempted widows and orphans from taxes; compelled the city to pay funeral expenses (including the ritual food and drink [[libations]] for the journey of the dead into the lower world); and decreed that the rich must use silver when purchasing from the poor, and if the poor does not wish to sell, the powerful man (the rich man or the priest) cannot force him to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117032017/http://history-world.org/reforms_of_urukagina.htm |title=The Reforms of Urukagina |publisher=History-world.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\nHe also participated in several conflicts, notably a losing border conflict with [[Uruk]].

Urukagina greatly expanded the royal \"Household of Women\" from about 50 persons to about 1500 persons, renamed it the \"Household of goddess [[Bau (goddess)|Bau]]\", gave it ownership of vast amounts of land confiscated from the former priesthood, and placed it under the supervision of his wife, Shasha (or Shagshag).<ref>Katherine I.

First, he seems to have abolished the former custom of [[polyandry]] in his country, on pain of the woman taking multiple husbands being stoned with rocks upon which her crime is written.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qNAEjt_Yh5cC&lpg=PA40&dq=pwers%20%22walter%20wink%22%20%22known%20law%20code%22&lr=&pg=PA40#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''The Powers'' p. 40] by Walter Wink, 1992</ref> Second is a statute stating that \"if a woman says [text illegible...] to a man, her mouth is crushed with burnt bricks.\"  No comparable laws from Urukagina addressing penalties for [[adultery]] by men have survived.

While the kings may not always live up to this praise they show the type of achievements that they wished to be remembered by. Extracts below praise Urukagina who appears as a social reformer, getting rid of gross abuses of power that had taken hold in Lagash.\n\n# Since time immemorial, since life began, in those days, the head boatman appropriated boats, the livestock official appropriated asses, the livestock official appropriated sheep, and the fisheries inspector appropriated.... The shepherds of wool sheep paid a duty in silver on account of white sheep, and the surveyor, chief lamentation-singer, supervisor, brewer and foremen paid a duty in silver on account of young lambs. . . These were the conventions of former times!\n# When Ningirsu, warrior of Enlil, granted the kingship of Lagash to Urukagina, selecting him from among the myriad people, he replaced the customs of former times, carrying out the command that Ningirsu, his master, had given him.\n# He removed the head boatman from control over the boats, he removed the livestock official from control over asses and sheep, he removed the fisheries inspector from control....\n# He removed the silo supervisor from control over the grain taxes of the ''guda''-priests, he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the paying of duties in silver on account of white sheep and young lambs, and he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the delivery of duties by the temple administrators to the palace.\n# The... administrators no longer plunder the orchards of the poor. When a high quality ass is born to a ''[[shublugal]]'', and his foreman says to him, \"I want to buy it from you\"; whether he lets him buy it from him and says to him \"Pay me the price I want!,\" or whether he does not let him buy it from him, the foreman must not strike at him in anger.\n# When the house of an aristocrat adjoins the house of a ''[[shublugal]]'', and the aristocrat says to him, \"I want to buy it from you\"; whether he lets him buy it from him, having said to him, \"Pay me the price I want! My house is a large container\u2014fill it with barley for me!,\" or whether he does not let him buy it from him, that aristocrat must not strike at him in anger.\n# He cleared and cancelled obligations for those indentured families, citizens of Lagash living as debtors because of grain taxes, barley payments, theft or murder.\n# Urukagina solemnly promised Ningirsu that he would never subjugate the waif and the widow to the powerful.<ref>[http://www.humanistictexts.org/sumer.htm#4%20Praise%20of%20Urukagina Praise of Urukagina]</ref>\n\n===Excerpt of some regulations from the Reform document===\n[[File:Sumerian Cuneiform Stone Cone - King Urukagina.jpg|thumb|Sumerian cuneiform stone cone of Urukagina.

Urukagina greatly expanded the royal \"Household of Women\" from about 50 persons to about 1500 persons, renamed it the \"Household of goddess [[Bau (goddess)|Bau]]\", gave it ownership of vast amounts of land confiscated from the former priesthood, and placed it under the supervision of his wife, Shasha (or Shagshag).<ref>Katherine I.

While the kings may not always live up to this praise they show the type of achievements that they wished to be remembered by. Extracts below praise Urukagina who appears as a social reformer, getting rid of gross abuses of power that had taken hold in Lagash.\n\n# Since time immemorial, since life began, in those days, the head boatman appropriated boats, the livestock official appropriated asses, the livestock official appropriated sheep, and the fisheries inspector appropriated.... The shepherds of wool sheep paid a duty in silver on account of white sheep, and the surveyor, chief lamentation-singer, supervisor, brewer and foremen paid a duty in silver on account of young lambs. . . These were the conventions of former times!\n# When Ningirsu, warrior of Enlil, granted the kingship of Lagash to Urukagina, selecting him from among the myriad people, he replaced the customs of former times, carrying out the command that Ningirsu, his master, had given him.\n# He removed the head boatman from control over the boats, he removed the livestock official from control over asses and sheep, he removed the fisheries inspector from control....\n# He removed the silo supervisor from control over the grain taxes of the ''guda''-priests, he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the paying of duties in silver on account of white sheep and young lambs, and he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the delivery of duties by the temple administrators to the palace.\n# The... administrators no longer plunder the orchards of the poor. When a high quality ass is born to a ''[[shublugal]]'', and his foreman says to him, \"I want to buy it from you\"; whether he lets him buy it from him and says to him \"Pay me the price I want!,\" or whether he does not let him buy it from him, the foreman must not strike at him in anger.\n# When the house of an aristocrat adjoins the house of a ''[[shublugal]]'', and the aristocrat says to him, \"I want to buy it from you\"; whether he lets him buy it from him, having said to him, \"Pay me the price I want! My house is a large container\u2014fill it with barley for me!,\" or whether he does not let him buy it from him, that aristocrat must not strike at him in anger.\n# He cleared and cancelled obligations for those indentured families, citizens of Lagash living as debtors because of grain taxes, barley payments, theft or murder.\n# Urukagina solemnly promised Ningirsu that he would never subjugate the waif and the widow to the powerful.<ref>[http://www.humanistictexts.org/sumer.htm#4%20Praise%20of%20Urukagina Praise of Urukagina]</ref>\n\n===Excerpt of some regulations from the Reform document===\n[[File:Sumerian Cuneiform Stone Cone - King Urukagina.jpg|thumb|Sumerian cuneiform stone cone of Urukagina.

He attended [[Lakenheath]] American High School for a year before moving back to the United States and graduating from [[James W. Robinson Secondary School]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] in 1991. After entering the [[United States Air Force Academy]], he joined the Air Force Parachuting Team.  In 1995, he received a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in [[Mandarin Chinese]] from the Air Force Academy. In 1996, he received a master of science degree in cardiovascular physiology from [[Colorado State University]] (CSU), in part for his work completing cardiovascular countermeasure research at NASA's Space Physiology Lab. He also received a doctorate of medicine from the [[University of Colorado]] in 2002, and went on to complete a three-year residency in emergency medicine at [[Hennepin County Medical Center]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]. In 2006, he completed a post-doctoral fellowship and master of health informatics (MHI) at the [[University of Minnesota]]. He also completed a master of public health at the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in 2007 and a residency in [[aerospace medicine]] in 2008.<ref name=jsc>{{cite web|title=Biographical Data|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/lindgren-kn.pdf|website=jsc.nasa.gov|publisher=Lyndon B.

He went on to support ISS training operation at [[Star City, Russia]] and became the deputy crew surgeon for [[STS-130]] and [[Expedition 24]].\n\nIn June 2009, he was one of nine astronaut candidates selected by NASA out of 3500 applications and began training as part of [[NASA Astronaut Group 20]]. The nine Americans, as well as two [[Canadian Space Agency]] candidates and three [[JAXA]] candidates, started training at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in August 2009<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/ascans2009.html</ref>. The 14 candidates carried trained in various different fields including [[T-38]] flight training, [[Extravehicular activity]] training, survival, [[International Space Station]] operations and other various skills. The group completed their training and Lindgren and his 13 classmates became eligible for future flight assignments on 4 November 2011.\n\nIn between finishing training, he worked in the Spacecraft Communicator and [[Extravehicular Activity]] branches of NASA, and he was the Spacecraft Communicator lead for [[Expedition 30]]. \n\nFrom 18 June to 27 June 2017 Lindgren was Commander of the [[NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations|NEEMO 22]] mission to the [[Aquarius Reef Base]], located 19 meters underwater off the coast of [[Florida]]. The NEEMO 22 mission focused on both exploration spacewalks and objectives related to the International Space Station and deep space missions. As an analogue for future planetary science concepts and strategies, marine science also will be performed under the guidance of Florida International University\u2019s marine science department. Objectives for the crew included testing spaceflight countermeasure equipment, technology for precisely tracking equipment in habitat and studies of body composition and sleep. The crew also will assess hardware sponsored by ESA that will help crew members evacuate someone who has been injured on a lunar spacewalk.\n\n===Expedition 44/45===\nIn 2013, he began training at the [[Gagarin Space Center]] and was assigned as backup Flight Engineer for [[Expedition 42]]/[[Expedition 43|43]] which launched on [[Soyuz TMA-15M]].<ref>{{cite news|title=NASA ASTRONAUT KJELL N.

In November 2015, while on the ISS, Kjell played a set of [[bagpipes]] manufactured by [[McCallum Bagpipes Ltd]] as a memorial to [[Victor Hurst]], who died in October of that year. McCallum Bagpipes was chosen to manufacture the bagpipes because they make them in plastic, which is easily sanitized and transported, ideal for space exploration.
