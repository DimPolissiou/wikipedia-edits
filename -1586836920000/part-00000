This can be released for [[record sales|sale]] to the public in a variety of different formats. In most cases, a single is a song that is released separately from an album, although it usually also appears on an album. Typically, these are the songs from albums that are released separately for [[Promotional single|promotional uses]] such as [[Music download|digital download]] or commercial radio airplay and are expected to be the most popular. In other cases a recording released as a single may not appear on an album.\n\nDespite being referred to as a single, in the era of [[music download|digital distribution]], singles can include up to as many as three tracks. The biggest digital music distributor, [[iTunes Store]], accepts as many as three tracks less than ten minutes each as a single.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emubands.com/blog/single-and-ep-definitions-on-itunes/|title=Single and EP Definitions on iTunes |website=Emubands.com|date=22 April 2013|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> Any more than three tracks on a musical release or thirty minutes in total running time is an [[extended play]] (EP) or, if over six tracks long, an album.\n\nHistorically, when mainstream music was purchased via vinyl records, singles would be released double-sided. That is to say, they were released with an [[A-side and B-side]], on which two singles would be released, one on each side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://udel.edu/~mm/beatles/music/singles.html|title=Beatles Singles Discography|website=University of Delaware|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> Moreover, traditionally, only the most popular songs from a previously released album would be released as a single. In more contemporary forms of music consumption, artists release most, if not all, of the tracks on an album as singles.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Early history==\nThe origins of the single are in the late 19th century, when music was distributed on [[phonograph cylinder]]s that held two to four minutes' worth of audio. These were then superseded by disc [[phonograph record]]s, which initially also had a short duration of playing time per side. In the first two to three decades of the 20th century, almost all commercial music releases were, in effect, singles (the exceptions were usually for [[classical music]] pieces, where multiple physical storage media items were bundled together and sold as an [[album]]). Phonograph records were manufactured with a range of playback speeds (from 16 to 78 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]]) and in several sizes (including {{convert|12|inch|cm|disp=or}}). By about 1910, however, the {{convert|adj=on|10|inch|cm}}, 78-rpm [[shellac]] disc had become the most commonly used format.\n\nThe inherent technical limitations of the gramophone disc defined the standard format for commercial recordings in the early 20th century. The relatively crude disc-cutting techniques of the time and the thickness of the needles used on [[phonograph|record player]]s limited the number of grooves per inch that could be inscribed on the disc surface, and a high rotation speed was necessary to achieve acceptable recording and playback fidelity. 78 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically-powered [[synchronous motor|synchronous turntable motor]] in 1925, which ran at 3,600 rpm with a 46:1 gear ratio, resulting in a rotation speed of 78.26 rpm.\n\nWith these factors applied to the 10-inch format, songwriters and performers increasingly tailored their output to fit the new medium. The three-minute single remained the standard into the 1960s, when the availability of microgroove recording and improved mastering techniques enabled recording artists to increase the duration of their recorded songs. The breakthrough came with [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\": Although [[Columbia Records]] tried to make the record more \"radio-friendly\" by cutting the performance into halves and separating them between the two sides of the [[polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] [[phonograph record|disc]], both Dylan and his fans demanded that the full six-minute [[take]] be placed on one side, and that radio stations play the song in its entirety.<ref>[[Greil Marcus]], 2005, ''Like a Rolling Stone'', p. 145.</ref>\n\n==Digital era==\nAs digital downloading and audio streaming have become more prevalent, it has become possible for every track on an album to also be available separately. Nevertheless, the concept of a single for an album has been retained as an identification of a more heavily promoted or more popular song (or group of songs) within an album collection. The demand for music downloads skyrocketed after the launch of [[Apple Computer|Apple's]] [[iTunes Store]] (then called [[iTunes version history|iTunes Music Store]]) in January 2001 and the creation of portable music and [[digital audio player]]s such as the [[iPod]].\n\nIn September 1997, with the release of [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[Electric Barbarella]]\" for paid downloads, [[Capitol Records]] became the first [[major label]] to sell a digital single from a well-known artist. Previously, [[Geffen Records]] also released [[Aerosmith]]'s \"[[Get a Grip|Head First]]\" digitally for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7964771/history-music-industry-first-ever-digital-single-20-years-later|title=The History of the Music Industry's First-Ever Digital Single For Sale, 20 Years After Its Release|website=Billboard|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref> In 2004, [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) introduced digital single certification due to significant sales of digital formats, with [[Gwen Stefani]]'s \"[[Hollaback Girl]]\" becoming RIAA's first platinum digital single.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/riaa-adds-digital-streams-to-historic-gold-platinum-awards-2/|title=RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold & Platinum Awards - RIAA|date=6 May 2013|website=Riaa.com|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref> In 2013, RIAA incorporated on-demand streams into the digital single certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/05/09/gold-and-platinum-song-certifications/2146985/|title=Digital streams to count for Gold and Platinum songs|website=USA Today|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nSingle sales in the United Kingdom reached an all-time low in January 2005, as the popularity of the compact disc was overtaken by the then-unofficial medium of the music download.

The names are derived from its play speed, 45&nbsp;rpm, and the standard diameter, 7&nbsp;inches.\n\nThe 7-inch 45&nbsp;rpm record was released 31 March 1949 by [[RCA Victor]] as a smaller, more durable and higher-[[fidelity]] replacement for the [[78 rpm]] shellac discs.<ref name=ffrsing>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H1tWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7u8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6991%2C6756292 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |agency=(''Los Angeles Daily News'') |last=Britt |first=Bruce |title=The 45-rpm single will soon be history |date=10 August 1989 |page=C4}}</ref> The first 45&nbsp;rpm records were [[monaural]], with recordings on both sides of the disc. As [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] recordings became popular in the 1960s, almost all 45&nbsp;rpm records were produced in stereo by the early 1970s. [[Columbia Records]], which had released the {{frac|33|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm 12-inch [[LP record|vinyl LP]] in June 1948, also released {{frac|33|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm 7-inch vinyl singles in March 1949, but they were soon eclipsed by the RCA Victor 45. The first regular production 45&nbsp;rpm record pressed was \"PeeWee the Piccolo\" RCA Victor 47-0146 pressed 7 December 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant in [[Indianapolis]], R.O. Price, plant manager.<ref>Indiana State Museum document no. 71.2010.098.0001</ref>\nThe claim made that 48-0001 by [[Eddy Arnold]] was the first 45 is evidently incorrect (even though as of this writing 48-0000 has not turned up) since all 45s were released simultaneously with the 45 player on the 29 March date. There was plenty of information 'leaked' to the public about the new 45 rpm system through front-page articles in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine on 4 December 1948 and again on 8 January 1949. RCA was trying to blunt the lead Columbia had established in releasing their {{frac|33|1|3}}&nbsp; LP system back in June 1948.<ref>Billboard</ref>\n\n===={{anchor|12-inch}}12-inch format====\n[[File:12 Inch Single BBQ Band.jpg|thumb|right|A twelve-inch gramophone record]]\n{{Main|12-inch single}}\nAlthough 7 inches remained the standard size for vinyl singles, [[12-inch single]]s were introduced for use by [[DJs]] in [[discotheque|discos]] in the 1970s. The longer playing time of these singles allowed the inclusion of extended dance mixes of tracks. In addition, the larger surface area of the 12-inch discs allowed for wider grooves (larger amplitude) and greater separation between grooves, the latter of which results in less cross-talk. Consequently, they are less susceptible to wear and scratches. The 12-inch single is still considered a standard format for [[dance music]], though its popularity has declined in recent years.\n\n==Culture==\nThe sales of singles are recorded in [[record charts]] in most countries in a [[Top 40]] format. These charts are often published in magazines and numerous [[Television program|television show]]s and [[radio programming|radio]] programs count down the list. In order to be eligible for inclusion in the charts the single must meet the requirements set by the charting company, usually governing the number of songs and the total playing time of the single.\n[[File:Gold record for Put a Little Love in Your Heart.JPG|thumb|The single of \"Put a Little Love in Your Heart\" was a hit record for [[Jackie DeShannon]] in 1968. It was certified Gold in the United States when it sold more than 1,000,000 copies.]]\nIn [[popular music]], the commercial and artistic importance of the single (as compared to the [[Extended play|EP]] or [[album]]) has varied over time, technological development, and according to the audience of particular artists and genres. Singles have generally been more important to artists who sell to the youngest purchasers of music (younger [[teenager]]s and [[pre-teen]]s), who tend to have more limited financial resources.<ref name=ffrsing/> Starting in the mid-sixties, albums became a greater focus and more important as artists created albums of uniformly high quality and coherent themes, a trend which reached its apex in the development of the [[concept album]]. Over the 1990s and early 2000s, the single generally received less and less attention in the United States as albums, which on [[compact disc]] had virtually identical production and distribution costs but could be sold at a higher price, became most retailers' primary method of selling music. Singles continued to be produced in the UK and Australia, surviving the transition from compact disc to digital download.\n\nThe discontinuation of the single has been cited as a major marketing mistake by the record companies considering it eliminated an inexpensive recording format for young fans to use to become accustomed to purchasing music. In its place was the predominance of the album which alienated customers by the expense of purchasing an expensive format for only one or two songs of interest. This in turn encouraged interest in [[file sharing]] software on the [[internet]] like [[Napster]] for single recordings initially which began to seriously undercut the music recording market.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knopper|first=Steve|title=Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=105\u20137}}</ref>\n\n[[Dance music]], however, has followed a different commercial pattern, and the single, especially the 12-inch vinyl single, remains a major method by which dance music is distributed.\n\nA curious development has been the popularity of mobile phone [[ringtone]]s based on pop singles (on some modern phones, the actual single can be used as a ringtone). In September 2007, [[Sony BMG]] announced they would introduce a new type of CD single, called \"ringles\", for the 2007 holiday season. The format included three songs by an artist, plus a ringtone accessible from the user's computer. Sony announced plans to release 50 ringles in October and November, while [[Universal Music Group]] expected to release somewhere between 10 and 20 titles.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN0921673020070912|title = Music industry betting on 'ringle' format|first = Ed|last = Christman|date = 9 September 2007|accessdate = 21 May 2008|agency = [[Reuters]]}}</ref>\n\nIn a reversal of this trend, a single has been released based on a ringtone itself. The [[Crazy Frog]] ringtone, which was a cult hit in Europe in 2004, was released as a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] with \"[[Axel F]]\" in June 2005 amid a massive publicity campaign and subsequently hit No. 1 on the UK charts.\n\nThe term ''single'' is sometimes regarded as a misnomer, since one record usually contains two songs: the [[A-side and B-side]]. In 1982, CBS marketed one-sided singles at a lower price than two-sided singles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT17|title=99 CENTS|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date = 15 May 1982}}</ref>\n\n===In South Korea===\nIn [[Music of South Korea|South Korean music]], the terminology for \"albums\" and \"singles\" is unique and includes an additional term, the \"'''single album'''\" ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=\uc2f1\uae00 \uc74c\ubc18|rr=singgeul eumban}}), a category of releases that is not found outside of Korea. In English, the word \"album\" in ordinary usage refers to an LP-length music release with multiple tracks. By contrast, the Korean word for \"album\" ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=\uc74c\ubc18|rr=eumban}}) denotes a musical recording of any length released on physical media; it is closer in meaning to the English words \"record\" or \"release\". Although the terms \"single albums\" and \"singles\" are similar and sometimes may even overlap in meaning, depending on context, they are considered two distinct release types in South Korea. A \"single album\" refers to a physical release (like CD, LP, or some other media) collecting one or more singles, while a \"single\" is only a song itself, typically as a downloaded file or streamable song. The [[Gaon Album Chart]] tracks sales of all \"offline\" albums released as physical media, meaning that single albums compete alongside full-length studio albums (and all other albums). The [[Gaon Digital Chart]], which tracks downloads and streams, is regarded as the official \"singles\" chart.\n\nAs a distinct release type, the single album developed during the CD era in the 1990s. Single albums, typically including about two or three songs, were marketed as a more affordable alternative to a full-length CD album.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jun |first=Yes Yeong |url=https://news.joins.com/article/3175234 |title=Gangsuji sing-geul-eumban chulsi-dan dugog sulog gagyeog-eun bissanpyeon |script-title=ko:\uac15\uc218\uc9c0 \uc2f1\uae00\uc74c\ubc18 \ucd9c\uc2dc-\ub2e8 \ub450\uace1 \uc218\ub85d \uac00\uaca9\uc740 \ube44\uc2fc\ud3b8 |trans-title=Kang Sooji Single Album Release |website=[[JoongAng Ilbo]] |date=7 December 1995 |accessdate=17 January 2019 |language=Korean}}</ref> The term \"single album\" is sometimes used to refer to a release that would simply be called a \"single\" in western contexts, such as a 7-inch 45{{nbsp}}rpm record released before the advent of downloadable music.\n\nTo give an example of the differences between full-length albums, single albums, and singles: the K-pop boy band [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] has a full-length studio album, titled ''[[Made (Big Bang album)|MADE]]'', which was originally released as a series of four single albums: ''[[M (Big Bang single)|M]]'', ''[[A (Big Bang single)|A]]'', ''[[D (Big Bang single)|D]]'', and ''[[E (Big Bang single)|E]]''.

The demand for music downloads skyrocketed after the launch of [[Apple Computer|Apple's]] [[iTunes Store]] (then called [[iTunes version history|iTunes Music Store]]) in January 2001 and the creation of portable music and [[digital audio player]]s such as the [[iPod]].\n\nIn September 1997, with the release of [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[Electric Barbarella]]\" for paid downloads, [[Capitol Records]] became the first [[major label]] to sell a digital single from a well-known artist. Previously, [[Geffen Records]] also released [[Aerosmith]]'s \"[[Get a Grip|Head First]]\" digitally for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7964771/history-music-industry-first-ever-digital-single-20-years-later|title=The History of the Music Industry's First-Ever Digital Single For Sale, 20 Years After Its Release|website=Billboard|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref> In 2004, [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) introduced digital single certification due to significant sales of digital formats, with [[Gwen Stefani]]'s \"[[Hollaback Girl]]\" becoming RIAA's first platinum digital single.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/riaa-adds-digital-streams-to-historic-gold-platinum-awards-2/|title=RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold & Platinum Awards - RIAA|date=6 May 2013|website=Riaa.com|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref> In 2013, RIAA incorporated on-demand streams into the digital single certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/05/09/gold-and-platinum-song-certifications/2146985/|title=Digital streams to count for Gold and Platinum songs|website=USA Today|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nSingle sales in the United Kingdom reached an all-time low in January 2005, as the popularity of the compact disc was overtaken by the then-unofficial medium of the music download. Recognizing this, On 17 April 2005, [[UK Singles Chart|Official UK Singles Chart]] added the download format to the existing format of physical CD singles. [[Gnarls Barkley]] was the first act to reach No.1 on this chart through downloads alone in April 2006, for their debut single [[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|\"Crazy\"]], which was released physically the following week.

Other, less common, formats include singles on [[Digital Compact Cassette]], [[DVD]], and [[Laserdisc]], as well as many non-standard sizes of vinyl disc ({{convert|5|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}, {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}, etc.).\n\n===={{anchor|7-inch}}7-inch format====\n[[File:140405 Wega-Dual-300-01.jpg|thumb|45 rpm EP on a turntable, ready to be played]]\nThe most common form of the vinyl single is the \"45\" or \"7-inch\". The names are derived from its play speed, 45&nbsp;rpm, and the standard diameter, 7&nbsp;inches.\n\nThe 7-inch 45&nbsp;rpm record was released 31 March 1949 by [[RCA Victor]] as a smaller, more durable and higher-[[fidelity]] replacement for the [[78 rpm]] shellac discs.<ref name=ffrsing>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H1tWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7u8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6991%2C6756292 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |agency=(''Los Angeles Daily News'') |last=Britt |first=Bruce |title=The 45-rpm single will soon be history |date=10 August 1989 |page=C4}}</ref> The first 45&nbsp;rpm records were [[monaural]], with recordings on both sides of the disc. As [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] recordings became popular in the 1960s, almost all 45&nbsp;rpm records were produced in stereo by the early 1970s. [[Columbia Records]], which had released the {{frac|33|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm 12-inch [[LP record|vinyl LP]] in June 1948, also released {{frac|33|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm 7-inch vinyl singles in March 1949, but they were soon eclipsed by the RCA Victor 45. The first regular production 45&nbsp;rpm record pressed was \"PeeWee the Piccolo\" RCA Victor 47-0146 pressed 7 December 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant in [[Indianapolis]], R.O. Price, plant manager.<ref>Indiana State Museum document no. 71.2010.098.0001</ref>\nThe claim made that 48-0001 by [[Eddy Arnold]] was the first 45 is evidently incorrect (even though as of this writing 48-0000 has not turned up) since all 45s were released simultaneously with the 45 player on the 29 March date. There was plenty of information 'leaked' to the public about the new 45 rpm system through front-page articles in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine on 4 December 1948 and again on 8 January 1949. RCA was trying to blunt the lead Columbia had established in releasing their {{frac|33|1|3}}&nbsp; LP system back in June 1948.<ref>Billboard</ref>\n\n===={{anchor|12-inch}}12-inch format====\n[[File:12 Inch Single BBQ Band.jpg|thumb|right|A twelve-inch gramophone record]]\n{{Main|12-inch single}}\nAlthough 7 inches remained the standard size for vinyl singles, [[12-inch single]]s were introduced for use by [[DJs]] in [[discotheque|discos]] in the 1970s. The longer playing time of these singles allowed the inclusion of extended dance mixes of tracks. In addition, the larger surface area of the 12-inch discs allowed for wider grooves (larger amplitude) and greater separation between grooves, the latter of which results in less cross-talk. Consequently, they are less susceptible to wear and scratches. The 12-inch single is still considered a standard format for [[dance music]], though its popularity has declined in recent years.\n\n==Culture==\nThe sales of singles are recorded in [[record charts]] in most countries in a [[Top 40]] format. These charts are often published in magazines and numerous [[Television program|television show]]s and [[radio programming|radio]] programs count down the list. In order to be eligible for inclusion in the charts the single must meet the requirements set by the charting company, usually governing the number of songs and the total playing time of the single.\n[[File:Gold record for Put a Little Love in Your Heart.JPG|thumb|The single of \"Put a Little Love in Your Heart\" was a hit record for [[Jackie DeShannon]] in 1968. It was certified Gold in the United States when it sold more than 1,000,000 copies.]]\nIn [[popular music]], the commercial and artistic importance of the single (as compared to the [[Extended play|EP]] or [[album]]) has varied over time, technological development, and according to the audience of particular artists and genres. Singles have generally been more important to artists who sell to the youngest purchasers of music (younger [[teenager]]s and [[pre-teen]]s), who tend to have more limited financial resources.<ref name=ffrsing/> Starting in the mid-sixties, albums became a greater focus and more important as artists created albums of uniformly high quality and coherent themes, a trend which reached its apex in the development of the [[concept album]]. Over the 1990s and early 2000s, the single generally received less and less attention in the United States as albums, which on [[compact disc]] had virtually identical production and distribution costs but could be sold at a higher price, became most retailers' primary method of selling music. Singles continued to be produced in the UK and Australia, surviving the transition from compact disc to digital download.\n\nThe discontinuation of the single has been cited as a major marketing mistake by the record companies considering it eliminated an inexpensive recording format for young fans to use to become accustomed to purchasing music. In its place was the predominance of the album which alienated customers by the expense of purchasing an expensive format for only one or two songs of interest. This in turn encouraged interest in [[file sharing]] software on the [[internet]] like [[Napster]] for single recordings initially which began to seriously undercut the music recording market.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knopper|first=Steve|title=Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=105\u20137}}</ref>\n\n[[Dance music]], however, has followed a different commercial pattern, and the single, especially the 12-inch vinyl single, remains a major method by which dance music is distributed.\n\nA curious development has been the popularity of mobile phone [[ringtone]]s based on pop singles (on some modern phones, the actual single can be used as a ringtone). In September 2007, [[Sony BMG]] announced they would introduce a new type of CD single, called \"ringles\", for the 2007 holiday season. The format included three songs by an artist, plus a ringtone accessible from the user's computer. Sony announced plans to release 50 ringles in October and November, while [[Universal Music Group]] expected to release somewhere between 10 and 20 titles.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN0921673020070912|title = Music industry betting on 'ringle' format|first = Ed|last = Christman|date = 9 September 2007|accessdate = 21 May 2008|agency = [[Reuters]]}}</ref>\n\nIn a reversal of this trend, a single has been released based on a ringtone itself. The [[Crazy Frog]] ringtone, which was a cult hit in Europe in 2004, was released as a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] with \"[[Axel F]]\" in June 2005 amid a massive publicity campaign and subsequently hit No. 1 on the UK charts.\n\nThe term ''single'' is sometimes regarded as a misnomer, since one record usually contains two songs: the [[A-side and B-side]]. In 1982, CBS marketed one-sided singles at a lower price than two-sided singles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT17|title=99 CENTS|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date = 15 May 1982}}</ref>\n\n===In South Korea===\nIn [[Music of South Korea|South Korean music]], the terminology for \"albums\" and \"singles\" is unique and includes an additional term, the \"'''single album'''\" ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=\uc2f1\uae00 \uc74c\ubc18|rr=singgeul eumban}}), a category of releases that is not found outside of Korea. In English, the word \"album\" in ordinary usage refers to an LP-length music release with multiple tracks. By contrast, the Korean word for \"album\" ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=\uc74c\ubc18|rr=eumban}}) denotes a musical recording of any length released on physical media; it is closer in meaning to the English words \"record\" or \"release\". Although the terms \"single albums\" and \"singles\" are similar and sometimes may even overlap in meaning, depending on context, they are considered two distinct release types in South Korea. A \"single album\" refers to a physical release (like CD, LP, or some other media) collecting one or more singles, while a \"single\" is only a song itself, typically as a downloaded file or streamable song. The [[Gaon Album Chart]] tracks sales of all \"offline\" albums released as physical media, meaning that single albums compete alongside full-length studio albums (and all other albums). The [[Gaon Digital Chart]], which tracks downloads and streams, is regarded as the official \"singles\" chart.\n\nAs a distinct release type, the single album developed during the CD era in the 1990s. Single albums, typically including about two or three songs, were marketed as a more affordable alternative to a full-length CD album.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jun |first=Yes Yeong |url=https://news.joins.com/article/3175234 |title=Gangsuji sing-geul-eumban chulsi-dan dugog sulog gagyeog-eun bissanpyeon |script-title=ko:\uac15\uc218\uc9c0 \uc2f1\uae00\uc74c\ubc18 \ucd9c\uc2dc-\ub2e8 \ub450\uace1 \uc218\ub85d \uac00\uaca9\uc740 \ube44\uc2fc\ud3b8 |trans-title=Kang Sooji Single Album Release |website=[[JoongAng Ilbo]] |date=7 December 1995 |accessdate=17 January 2019 |language=Korean}}</ref> The term \"single album\" is sometimes used to refer to a release that would simply be called a \"single\" in western contexts, such as a 7-inch 45{{nbsp}}rpm record released before the advent of downloadable music.\n\nTo give an example of the differences between full-length albums, single albums, and singles: the K-pop boy band [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] has a full-length studio album, titled ''[[Made (Big Bang album)|MADE]]'', which was originally released as a series of four single albums: ''[[M (Big Bang single)|M]]'', ''[[A (Big Bang single)|A]]'', ''[[D (Big Bang single)|D]]'', and ''[[E (Big Bang single)|E]]''.

{"title_page": "Uncertainty quantification", "text_new": "'''Uncertainty quantification (UQ)''' is the science of quantitative characterization and reduction of [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in both computational and real world applications. It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known. An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if we exactly knew the speed, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense.\n\nMany problems in the natural sciences and engineering are also rife with sources of uncertainty. [[Computer experiment]]s on [[computer model|computer simulation]]s are the most common approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2245858|title=Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments|last1=Sacks|first1=Jerome|last2=Welch|first2=William J.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Toby J.|last4=Wynn|first4=Henry P.|journal=Statistical Science|year=1989|volume=4|issue=4|pages=409\u2013423|doi=10.1214/ss/1177012413}}</ref><ref>Ronald L.

One way to categorize the sources of uncertainty is to consider:<ref name=\"KennedyOHagan\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-9868.00294|title=Bayesian calibration of computer models|year=2001|last1=Kennedy|first1=Marc C.|last2=O'Hagan|first2=Anthony|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology)|volume=63|issue=3|pages=425\u2013464}}</ref>\n\n; Parameter uncertainty: This comes from the model parameters that are inputs to the computer model (mathematical model) but whose exact values are unknown to experimentalists and cannot be controlled in physical experiments, or whose values cannot be exactly inferred by [[statistical methods]]. Some examples of this are the local [[free fall|free-fall]] acceleration in a falling object experiment, various material properties in a finite element analysis for engineering, and [[multiplier uncertainty]] in the context of [[macroeconomic policy]] optimization.\n; Parametric variability: This comes from the variability of input variables of the model. For example, the dimensions of a work piece in a process of manufacture may not be exactly as designed and instructed, which would cause variability in its performance.\n; Structural uncertainty: Also known as model inadequacy, model bias, or model discrepancy, this comes from the lack of knowledge of the underlying physics in the problem. It depends on how accurately a mathematical model describes the true system for a real-life situation, considering the fact that models are almost always only approximations to reality. One example is when modeling the process of a falling object using the free-fall model; the model itself is inaccurate since there always exists air friction. In this case, even if there is no unknown parameter in the model, a discrepancy is still expected between the model and true physics.\n; Algorithmic uncertainty: Also known as numerical uncertainty, or discrete uncertainty. This type comes from numerical errors and numerical approximations per implementation of the computer model. Most models are too complicated to solve exactly. For example, the [[finite element method]] or [[finite difference|finite difference method]] may be used to approximate the solution of a [[partial differential equation]] (which introduces numerical errors). Other examples are numerical integration and infinite sum truncation that are necessary approximations in numerical implementation.\n; Experimental uncertainty: Also known as observation error, this comes from the variability of experimental measurements. The experimental uncertainty is inevitable and can be noticed by repeating a measurement for many times using exactly the same settings for all inputs/variables.\n; Interpolation uncertainty: This comes from a lack of available data collected from computer model simulations and/or experimental measurements. For other input settings that don't have simulation data or experimental measurements, one must interpolate or extrapolate in order to predict the corresponding responses.\n\n===Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty===\nUncertainty is sometimes classified into two categories,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.strusafe.2008.06.020|title=Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter?|year=2009|last1=Der Kiureghian|first1=Armen|last2=Ditlevsen|first2=Ove|journal=Structural Safety|volume=31|issue=2|pages=105\u2013112}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-5656-7_4|chapter=Quantifying Uncertainty: Modern Computational Representation of Probability and Applications|title=Extreme Man-Made and Natural Hazards in Dynamics of Structures|series=NATO Security through Science Series|year=2007|last1=Matthies|first1=Hermann G.|pages=105\u2013135|isbn=978-1-4020-5654-3}}</ref> prominently seen in medical applications.<ref>Abhaya Indrayan, ''Medical Biostatistics'', Second Edition, Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, 2008, pages 8, 673</ref>\n\n; Aleatoric uncertainty: Aleatoric uncertainty is also known as statistical uncertainty, and is representative of unknowns that differ each time we run the same experiment. For example, a single arrow shot with a mechanical bow that exactly duplicates each launch (the same acceleration, altitude, direction and final velocity) will not all impact the same point on the target due to random and complicated vibrations of the arrow shaft, the knowledge of which cannot be determined sufficiently to eliminate the resulting scatter of impact points.  The argument here is obviously in the definition of \"cannot\".  Just because we cannot measure sufficiently with our currently available measurement devices does not preclude necessarily the existence of such information, which would move this uncertainty into the below category.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} ''Aleatoric'' is derived from the Latin alea or dice, referring to a game of chance.\n; Epistemic uncertainty: Epistemic uncertainty is also known as systematic uncertainty, and is due to things one could in principle know but do not in practice. This may be because a measurement is not accurate, because the model neglects certain effects, or because particular data has been deliberately hidden. An example of a source of this uncertainty would be the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] in an experiment designed to measure the acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface. The commonly used gravitational acceleration of 9.8&nbsp;m/s^2 ignores the effects of air resistance, but the air resistance for the object could be measured and incorporated into the experiment to reduce the resulting uncertainty in the calculation of the gravitational acceleration.\n\nIn real life applications, both kinds of uncertainties are present. Uncertainty quantification intends to work toward reducing epistemic uncertainties to aleatoric uncertainties. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties can be relatively straightforward to perform, depending on the application. Techniques such as the [[Monte Carlo method]] are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] (in the [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] case, the [[mean]] and [[covariance]] suffice, although, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as [[Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve theorem|Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve]] and [[polynomial chaos]] expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to gain better knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Methods such as [[probability bounds analysis]], [[fuzzy logic]] or evidence theory ([[Dempster\u2013Shafer theory]] \u2013 a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability) are used.\n\n==Two types of uncertainty quantification problems==\nThere are two major types of problems in uncertainty quantification: one is the '''forward''' propagation of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) and the other is the '''inverse''' assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems.\n\n===Forward uncertainty propagation===\n{{See also|Propagation of uncertainty}}\nUncertainty propagation is the quantification of uncertainties in system output(s) propagated from uncertain inputs. It focuses on the influence on the outputs from the ''parametric variability'' listed in the sources of uncertainty. The targets of uncertainty propagation analysis can be:\n* To evaluate low-order moments of the outputs, i.e. [[mean]] and [[variance]].\n* To evaluate the reliability of the outputs. This is especially useful in [[reliability engineering]] where outputs of a system are usually closely related to the performance of the system.\n* To assess the complete probability distribution of the outputs.

It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known. An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if we exactly knew the speed, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense.\n\nMany problems in the natural sciences and engineering are also rife with sources of uncertainty. [[Computer experiment]]s on [[computer model|computer simulation]]s are the most common approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification.<ref>Jerome Sacks, William J. Welch, Toby J.

One way to categorize the sources of uncertainty is to consider:<ref name=\"KennedyOHagan\">Marc C. Kennedy, Anthony O'Hagan, \"Bayesian calibration of computer models\", ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B'' Volume 63, Issue 3, pages 425\u2013464, 2001</ref>\n\n; Parameter uncertainty: This comes from the model parameters that are inputs to the computer model (mathematical model) but whose exact values are unknown to experimentalists and cannot be controlled in physical experiments, or whose values cannot be exactly inferred by [[statistical methods]]. Some examples of this are the local [[free fall|free-fall]] acceleration in a falling object experiment, various material properties in a finite element analysis for engineering, and [[multiplier uncertainty]] in the context of [[macroeconomic policy]] optimization.\n; Parametric variability: This comes from the variability of input variables of the model. For example, the dimensions of a work piece in a process of manufacture may not be exactly as designed and instructed, which would cause variability in its performance.\n; Structural uncertainty: Also known as model inadequacy, model bias, or model discrepancy, this comes from the lack of knowledge of the underlying physics in the problem. It depends on how accurately a mathematical model describes the true system for a real-life situation, considering the fact that models are almost always only approximations to reality. One example is when modeling the process of a falling object using the free-fall model; the model itself is inaccurate since there always exists air friction. In this case, even if there is no unknown parameter in the model, a discrepancy is still expected between the model and true physics.\n; Algorithmic uncertainty: Also known as numerical uncertainty, or discrete uncertainty. This type comes from numerical errors and numerical approximations per implementation of the computer model. Most models are too complicated to solve exactly. For example, the [[finite element method]] or [[finite difference|finite difference method]] may be used to approximate the solution of a [[partial differential equation]] (which introduces numerical errors). Other examples are numerical integration and infinite sum truncation that are necessary approximations in numerical implementation.\n; Experimental uncertainty: Also known as observation error, this comes from the variability of experimental measurements. The experimental uncertainty is inevitable and can be noticed by repeating a measurement for many times using exactly the same settings for all inputs/variables.\n; Interpolation uncertainty: This comes from a lack of available data collected from computer model simulations and/or experimental measurements. For other input settings that don't have simulation data or experimental measurements, one must interpolate or extrapolate in order to predict the corresponding responses.\n\n===Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty===\nUncertainty is sometimes classified into two categories,<ref>Armen Der Kiureghiana, Ove Ditlevsen, \"Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter?\", ''Structural Safety'', Volume 31, Issue 2, March 2009, Pages 105\u2013112</ref><ref>Hermann G. Matthies, \"Quantifying uncertainty: modern computational representation of probability and applications\", ''Extreme Man-Made and Natural Hazards in Dynamics of Structures'', NATO Security through Science Series, 2007, 105\u2013135, {{doi| 10.1007/978-1-4020-5656-7_4}}</ref> prominently seen in medical applications.<ref>Abhaya Indrayan, ''Medical Biostatistics'', Second Edition, Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, 2008, pages 8, 673</ref>\n\n; Aleatoric uncertainty: Aleatoric uncertainty is also known as statistical uncertainty, and is representative of unknowns that differ each time we run the same experiment. For example, a single arrow shot with a mechanical bow that exactly duplicates each launch (the same acceleration, altitude, direction and final velocity) will not all impact the same point on the target due to random and complicated vibrations of the arrow shaft, the knowledge of which cannot be determined sufficiently to eliminate the resulting scatter of impact points.  The argument here is obviously in the definition of \"cannot\".  Just because we cannot measure sufficiently with our currently available measurement devices does not preclude necessarily the existence of such information, which would move this uncertainty into the below category.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} ''Aleatoric'' is derived from the Latin alea or dice, referring to a game of chance.\n; Epistemic uncertainty: Epistemic uncertainty is also known as systematic uncertainty, and is due to things one could in principle know but do not in practice. This may be because a measurement is not accurate, because the model neglects certain effects, or because particular data has been deliberately hidden. An example of a source of this uncertainty would be the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] in an experiment designed to measure the acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface. The commonly used gravitational acceleration of 9.8&nbsp;m/s^2 ignores the effects of air resistance, but the air resistance for the object could be measured and incorporated into the experiment to reduce the resulting uncertainty in the calculation of the gravitational acceleration.\n\nIn real life applications, both kinds of uncertainties are present. Uncertainty quantification intends to work toward reducing epistemic uncertainties to aleatoric uncertainties. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties can be relatively straightforward to perform, depending on the application. Techniques such as the [[Monte Carlo method]] are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] (in the [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] case, the [[mean]] and [[covariance]] suffice, although, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as [[Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve theorem|Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve]] and [[polynomial chaos]] expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to gain better knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Methods such as [[probability bounds analysis]], [[fuzzy logic]] or evidence theory ([[Dempster\u2013Shafer theory]] \u2013 a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability) are used.\n\n==Two types of uncertainty quantification problems==\nThere are two major types of problems in uncertainty quantification: one is the '''forward''' propagation of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) and the other is the '''inverse''' assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems.\n\n===Forward uncertainty propagation===\n{{See also|Propagation of uncertainty}}\nUncertainty propagation is the quantification of uncertainties in system output(s) propagated from uncertain inputs.

This single step accomplishes the calibration;\n# Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function.\n\nHowever, the approach has significant drawbacks:\n* For most cases, <math> p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta},\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}\\mid\\text{data}) </math> is a highly intractable function of <math> \\boldsymbol{\\varphi} </math>. Hence the integration becomes very troublesome. Moreover, if priors for the other hyperparameters <math> \\boldsymbol{\\varphi} </math> are not carefully chosen, the complexity in numerical integration increases even more.\n* In the prediction stage, the prediction (which should at least include the expected value of system responses) also requires numerical integration. [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) is often used for integration; however it is computationally expensive.\n\nThe fully Bayesian approach requires a huge amount of calculations and may not yet be practical for dealing with the most complicated modelling situations.<ref name=\"Liu\" />\n\n==Known issues==\nThe theories and methodologies for uncertainty propagation are much better established, compared with inverse uncertainty quantification. For the latter, several difficulties remain unsolved:\n# Dimensionality issue: The computational cost increases dramatically with the dimensionality of the problem, i.e. the number of input variables and/or the number of unknown parameters.\n# Identifiability issue:<ref> Paul D. Arendt, Daniel W.
