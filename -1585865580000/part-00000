Introduced as a school boy in 1988, Ricky is one of the longest-running male protagonists to feature in ''EastEnders''. Owen originally left the role in 2000 to pursue a music career. However, he reprised the role in 2002 before being axed by producer [[Louise Berridge]] in 2004. In 2008, producer [[Diederick Santer]] reintroduced the character for a third time, along with his wife [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). Ricky is portrayed as unintelligent, simplistic, easily led and bossed around by dominant personalities. On 26 February 2011, it was announced that Owen would take a temporary break from the show.  The character exited on 19 July 2011, returning five months later on 13 December 2011. Ricky left ''EastEnders'' on 17 January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soapland's joiners, movers and leavers |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/information/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=London: [[Hearst Magazines]] |accessdate=8 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102120122/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/information/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html |archivedate=2 January 2013 |df= }}</ref> Ricky returned to ''EastEnders'' on 20 June 2012 for the wedding of his sister, [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), before departing for the final time on 29 June 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/3FN0WVm1xWY5Fq42f0h4Y20/ricky-butcherdate|title=BBC One-EastEnders:Ricky Butcher character profiles|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> In April 2016 he had voiced his interest in returning to ''EastEnders'' during an appearance on ''[[Celebrity Juice]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/07/eastenders-spoilers-sid-owen-confirms-hes-ready-to-bring-back-ricky-butcher-5802378/ | title=EastEnders spoilers: Sid Owen confirms he's ready to bring back Ricky Butcher| date=7 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Storylines==\n===1988\u20132000===\nA teenage Ricky arrives in [[Albert Square]] when his father [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) becomes landlord of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] in May 1988. Non-academic, Ricky proves to be a troublesome teenager and is frequently berated by his father. He begins dating [[Shireen Karim]] (Nisha Kapur), an Asian Muslim, much to Shireen's father [[Ashraf Karim|Ashraf]]'s (Tony Wredden) disgust. Ashraf forces Shireen into an [[arranged marriage]], prompting Ricky to retaliate by terrorizing Ashraf for a while with a gang of racists.\n\nLater on, Ricky shows talent mending cars, so the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), take him on at their auto repair shop as an apprentice [[mechanic]] in 1990. Ricky begins dating the Mitchell brothers' younger sister [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]) and when she decides she wants to get married at 16, she and Ricky elope to [[Gretna Green]] in 1991. Their marriage is short-lived, as Sam grows bored and starts to look for entertainment elsewhere; she leaves Ricky in 1993.\n\nDespite a one-night stand with [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) in January 1994, Ricky does not enter into another serious relationship until August, when he begins dating [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend [[Natalie Evans|Natalie Price]] ([[Lucy Speed]]), in 1995. Natalie falls in love with Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with [[Lenny Wallace]] ([[Des Coleman]]), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both [[spina bifida]] and [[hydrocephalus]]; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, Ricky becomes acquainted with Bianca's mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) and her boyfriend [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]). He quickly gets along with the pair, but this changes when Carol tells him that Bianca and Dan have embarked on an affair - as the pair had previously had a relationship prior to Dan falling in love with Carol. When the affair becomes public knowledge, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Ricky, devastated by his marriage breakdown, begins to clash with Dan when the latter taunts him - as well as becoming unhappy with his own life and work. This escalates when Ricky learns that Phil has recently befriended Dan, who later tells Ricky that Phil and Frank have been working together on a motor scam. In response, Ricky confronts Phil and the two have an argument as Ricky attempts to leave Walford. Phil apologizes to Ricky for hurting him and promises that he'll deal with Dan for him. Ricky initially agrees to return to Walford, but secretly leaves without Phil's consent.\n\n===\"Ricky & Bianca\"===\nIn May 2002, Ricky arrives to Bianca\u2019s flat in Manchester to visit Liam alongside his fianc\u00e9e - Cassie. He discovers that Bianca has stolen \u00a350,000 of drug money from her boss, Vince. An unimpressed Ricky convinces Bianca to return the money before she gets hurt. Vince sends the pair to a drug deal which is a set up. Ricky and Bianca escape to a hotel where they briefly rekindle their romance. Bianca reveals that she is struggling as a single parent and is manipulated by Cassie into believing that Ricky's life would be ruined if Bianca returns to him. Bianca decides to leave Liam with Ricky and hitches a ride to a destination unknown.\n\n===2002\u20132004===\nRicky returns to Walford in August 2002 with Liam after hearing from his former stepmother [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]), that his sister [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) has resorted to [[prostitution]] and [[drug abuse]]. Ricky remains to help Janine and returns to his old job as a mechanic at the Arches. He begins a second affair with Natalie, which ruins her marriage to Roy's son [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]). By then, Roy and Pat have formed a marriage together. Roy soon passes away after suffering a fatal heart attack amid learning about the affair and that Pat had kept it secret at the time she found out about it herself.\n\nRicky and Natalie subsequently plan to leave Walford together in 2003, but when Janine informs Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with his ex-wife Sam (now [[Kim Medcalf]]), an outraged Natalie dumps him. Janine goes on to marry Barry for his money and accidentally kills him during an argument. Discovering his sister's role in Barry's death, Ricky disowns Janine and leaves Walford again in February 2004 - horrified and ashamed.\n\n===2008\u20132012===\nOn 31 March 2008, Ricky returns to Walford unexpectedly with his sister [[Diane Butcher]] ([[Sophie Lawrence]]) to inform Pat that Frank has died. Frank is cremated in Walford the following day. Ricky's fianc\u00e9e [[Melinda (EastEnders)|Melinda]] ([[Siobhan Hayes]]) attends, but soon finishes with Ricky when she discovers he is penniless. The Butcher siblings and Pat scatter Frank's ashes in Albert Square gardens after the reading of his will. Ricky returns the following week when he discovers Bianca and Liam are living with Pat after being made homeless. Despite initial hostilities, Ricky helps Bianca regain custody of her four children, who have been put into care, and then decides to remain in Walford himself, to be near Liam. Ricky hopes for a reconciliation with Bianca, but she is involved with [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), and when Tony is released from prison later that year, he moves in with the Butchers. Unbeknown to the rest of the family, Tony is a paedophile and is having a secret relationship with Bianca's stepdaughter [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]). When this is uncovered, Bianca finishes with Tony and he is imprisoned. Bianca reveals that her youngest daughter, [[Tiffany Butcher|Tiffany]] ([[Maisie Smith]]), is actually the daughter of Ricky, conceived on their one-night stand in 2002. This is confirmed when Ricky takes a paternity test.\n\nPhil orders Ricky to locate Sam in Brazil and he brings her home with him. When Bianca is about to admit her love for him, Ricky reveals that he loves Sam. Ricky and Sam get engaged. However, Sam embarks on an affair with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and when Bianca discovers this, she tells Ricky and the engagement is called off. Bianca surprises Ricky by proposing and they marry for a second time in February 2010. Ricky then discovers Sam is pregnant. It is unknown whether Ricky or Jack fathered Sam's baby. To Bianca's chagrin, Sam names Ricky as the father, but a paternity test reveals she is lying and the baby is Jack's.\n\nWhen Bianca is jailed for attacking [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]) in 2011, Ricky struggles to support his children, so he accepts a job in [[Dubai]] where he is arrested for [[indecency]] after being caught [[Nude swimming|swimming naked]] in the sea. He is fined and deported, leaving him with no money upon his return to Walford. From prison, Bianca blames her family's money problems on Ricky, and Ricky seeks comfort from Mandy who has returned to Walford. After reliving their youth and taking drugs, Ricky and Mandy have sex again. Later, Mandy confesses that their one-night stand in 1994 left her pregnant, but their baby daughter, Kira, died shortly after birth. Ricky immediately regrets having sex with Mandy and decides not to tell Bianca upon her release from prison; however, Bianca discovers the truth on New Year's Day 2012, the same night the Butchers are left distraught by Pat's death from cancer. Following Pat's funeral, Bianca realises she cannot forgive Ricky's latest infidelity; she ends their marriage, forcing Ricky to leave Walford. He returns in June for Janine's wedding to [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]), along with Tiffany, Morgan and Diane. Janine goes into premature labour and Ricky sits with his newborn niece, [[Scarlett Moon]], as she fights for survival. Later, he argues with Morgan's biological father, [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]), about their parenting methods, but they call a truce. He becomes Scarlett's godfather at her baptism before leaving with the children again.\n\nIn August 2015, he agrees to let Liam and his girlfriend [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]) live with him in Germany. He advises Liam against taking money from the Beales and offers to train him to become a mechanic.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Background===\n''EastEnders'' had been on air for three years before the character of Ricky made his first screen appearance in May 1988. At the time, big changes were occurring \"behind-the-scenes\".<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Co-creator [[Julia Smith]] took \"a more back-seat role\" as Series Producer, which allowed producer [[Mike Gibbon]] to take control of the making of the programme.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nThe arrival of the Butcher family in May 1988 signified an end of an era for the soap, as [[Den Watts|Den]] and [[Angie Watts]] vacated their positions as landlord and landlady of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], leaving the head of the Butcher family, [[Frank Butcher|Frank]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]), and his girlfriend [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) to take over.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Along with Frank came his two teenage children, Ricky ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Diane Butcher|Diane]] ([[Sophie Lawrence]]). Later they were joined by Frank's mother [[Mo Butcher|Mo]] ([[Edna Dor\u00e9]]), and Frank's youngest daughter [[Janine Evans|Janine]] (Rebecca Michael).

He's just bungling his way through life the best way he can. All right, so he'll never win any prizes for his brain power. So what? He's a good bloke, a good mate to his friends and he can work miracles with motors [...] What you see is what you get where he's concerned.\"<ref name=\"thicky\"/>\n\nAuthor Kate Lock has described Ricky as hapless and a figure of fun, \"completely lacking in tact and rarely opens his mouth without putting his foot in it.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=EastEnders Who's Who |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-55178-2|title-link= EastEnders books}}</ref> Noting the changes his character went through in 2000, Owen said, \"[Ricky] grew up over the years just as all of us have to change. He became more sensitive and more mature.\"<ref name=\"thickrick\"/>\n\n===Marriage to Sam Mitchell===\n[[File:Ricky22.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ricky as he appeared in 1988.]]\nDuring the early 1990s, Ricky's narrative concentrated upon his teen elopement to [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Westbrook has said that \"the public couldn't get enough of the simmering relationship between Ricky and Sam and the show was inundated with calls from the press [...] [Sam and Ricky] were involved in a plotline about under-age sex, so the press swooped in on that.\"<ref name=\"biog\">{{cite book|last=Westbrook|first= Danniella|title=The Other Side of Nowhere|year=2006|publisher=Hodder|isbn=978-0-340-89887-1}}</ref>\n\nTo the anger of her family, Sam persuaded Ricky to elope to Gretna Green in July 1991. The week's worth of episodes focusing on their marriage were filmed on-location and have been described by former ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter, [[Colin Brake]], as a \"farce-like chase round the country\". Written by Debbie Cook, the storyline saw Ricky and Sam's families, including Sam's mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Jo Warne]]; introduced specifically for this plotline) attempting to stop the couple from saying \"I do\". The storyline climaxed in the registry office wedding, but despite the Scottish setting, the recording of the episodes took place in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Later in the month, Sam and Ricky had a more official \"grand church blessing\" with all their family in attendance. The Butchers' blessing was screened in the same episode as the funeral of another character, [[Charlie Cotton]].<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=9780563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nThe marriage was portrayed as problematic, fraught with interference from their families, lack of money, and Ricky's jealousy of Sam's partying and her modeling career, including a topless photoshoot.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> In 1993 Westbrook left the soap.<ref>{{cite news |title=The digested read: The Other Side of Nowhere by Daniella Westbrook|url= https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61158065|newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|date=3 April 2006 |accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref> On-screen, Sam's marriage to Ricky ended following an affair with a yuppie named Clive ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]).\n\n===Marriage to Bianca Jackson===\nRicky's relationship with [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) has been central to his narrative; their affiliation began in 1994. Palmer and Owen already knew each other before working together on the soap, as both attended the Anna Scher theatre school. Owen has said, \"We practically grew up together. We'd known each other for years. It was weird when she started on the show and we began playing the 'Ricky & Bianca Get To Know Each Other' bit. I had already spent a lot of time with Patsy.

In the book ''Seeing Things: Television in the Age of Uncertainty'', author John Ellis uses the couple's combustible relationship as an example of emotional intensity and pathos: \"A couple like Ricky and Bianca...can have constantly sniped at each other for several episodes, for no apparent dramatic purpose except that it is the nature of their relationship. Then they will suddenly be confronted by a life-changing decision...There is suddenly a shift in emotional intensity for the audience.

Introduced as a school boy in 1988, Ricky is one of the longest-running male protagonists to feature in ''EastEnders''. Owen originally left the role in 2000 to pursue a music career. However, he reprised the role in 2002 before being axed by producer [[Louise Berridge]] in 2004. In 2008, producer [[Diederick Santer]] reintroduced the character for a third time, along with his wife [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). Ricky is portrayed as unintelligent, simplistic, easily led and bossed around by dominant personalities. On 26 February 2011, it was announced that Owen would take a temporary break from the show.  The character exited on 19 July 2011, returning five months later on 13 December 2011.

Non-academic, Ricky proves to be a troublesome teenager and is frequently berated by his father. He begins dating [[Shireen Karim]] (Nisha Kapur), an Asian Muslim, much to Shireen's father [[Ashraf Karim|Ashraf]]'s (Tony Wredden) disgust. Ashraf forces Shireen into an [[arranged marriage]], prompting Ricky to retaliate by terrorizing Ashraf for a while with a gang of racists.\n\nLater on, Ricky shows talent mending cars, so the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), take him on at their auto repair shop as an apprentice [[mechanic]] in 1990. Ricky begins dating the Mitchell brothers' younger sister [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]) and when she decides she wants to get married at 16, she and Ricky elope to [[Gretna Green]] in 1991. Their marriage is short-lived, as Sam grows bored and starts to look for entertainment elsewhere; she leaves Ricky in 1993.\n\nDespite a one-night stand with [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) in January 1994, Ricky does not enter into another serious relationship until August, when he begins dating [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend [[Natalie Evans|Natalie Price]] ([[Lucy Speed]]), in 1995. Natalie falls in love with Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with [[Lenny Wallace]] ([[Des Coleman]]), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both [[spina bifida]] and [[hydrocephalus]]; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, Ricky becomes acquainted with Bianca's mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) and her boyfriend [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]). He quickly gets along with the pair, but this changes when Carol tells him that Bianca and Dan have embarked on an affair - as the pair had previously had a relationship prior to Dan falling in love with Carol. When the affair becomes public knowledge, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Ricky, devastated by his marriage breakdown, begins to clash with Dan when the latter taunts him - as well as becoming unhappy with his own life and work. This escalates when Ricky learns that Phil has recently befriended Dan, who later tells Ricky that Phil and Frank have been working together on a motor scam. In response, Ricky confronts Phil and the two have an argument as Ricky attempts to leave Walford. Phil apologizes to Ricky for hurting him and promises that he'll deal with Dan for him. Ricky initially agrees to return to Walford, but secretly leaves without Phil's consent.\n\n===\"Ricky & Bianca\"===\nIn May 2002, Ricky arrives to Bianca\u2019s flat in Manchester to visit Liam alongside his fianc\u00e9e - Cassie. He discovers that Bianca has stolen \u00a350,000 of drug money from her boss, Vince. An unimpressed Ricky convinces Bianca to return the money before she gets hurt. Vince sends the pair to a drug deal which is a set up. Ricky and Bianca escape to a hotel where they briefly rekindle their romance. Bianca reveals that she is struggling as a single parent and is manipulated by Cassie into believing that Ricky's life would be ruined if Bianca returns to him. Bianca decides to leave Liam with Ricky and hitches a ride to a destination unknown.\n\n===2002\u20132004===\nRicky returns to Walford in August 2002 with Liam after hearing from his former stepmother [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]), that his sister [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) has resorted to [[prostitution]] and [[drug abuse]]. Ricky remains to help Janine and returns to his old job as a mechanic at the Arches. He begins a second affair with Natalie, which ruins her marriage to Roy's son [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]). By then, Roy and Pat have formed a marriage together. Roy soon passes away after suffering a fatal heart attack amid learning about the affair and that Pat had kept it secret at the time she found out about it herself.\n\nRicky and Natalie subsequently plan to leave Walford together in 2003, but when Janine informs Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with his ex-wife Sam (now [[Kim Medcalf]]), an outraged Natalie dumps him. Janine goes on to marry Barry for his money and accidentally kills him during an argument. Discovering his sister's role in Barry's death, Ricky disowns Janine and leaves Walford again in February 2004 - horrified and ashamed.\n\n===2008\u20132012===\nOn 31 March 2008, Ricky returns to Walford unexpectedly with his sister [[Diane Butcher]] ([[Sophie Lawrence]]) to inform Pat that Frank has died. Frank is cremated in Walford the following day. Ricky's fianc\u00e9e [[Melinda (EastEnders)|Melinda]] ([[Siobhan Hayes]]) attends, but soon finishes with Ricky when she discovers he is penniless. The Butcher siblings and Pat scatter Frank's ashes in Albert Square gardens after the reading of his will. Ricky returns the following week when he discovers Bianca and Liam are living with Pat after being made homeless. Despite initial hostilities, Ricky helps Bianca regain custody of her four children, who have been put into care, and then decides to remain in Walford himself, to be near Liam. Ricky hopes for a reconciliation with Bianca, but she is involved with [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), and when Tony is released from prison later that year, he moves in with the Butchers. Unbeknown to the rest of the family, Tony is a paedophile and is having a secret relationship with Bianca's stepdaughter [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]). When this is uncovered, Bianca finishes with Tony and he is imprisoned. Bianca reveals that her youngest daughter, [[Tiffany Butcher|Tiffany]] ([[Maisie Smith]]), is actually the daughter of Ricky, conceived on their one-night stand in 2002. This is confirmed when Ricky takes a paternity test.\n\nPhil orders Ricky to locate Sam in Brazil and he brings her home with him. When Bianca is about to admit her love for him, Ricky reveals that he loves Sam. Ricky and Sam get engaged. However, Sam embarks on an affair with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and when Bianca discovers this, she tells Ricky and the engagement is called off. Bianca surprises Ricky by proposing and they marry for a second time in February 2010. Ricky then discovers Sam is pregnant. It is unknown whether Ricky or Jack fathered Sam's baby. To Bianca's chagrin, Sam names Ricky as the father, but a paternity test reveals she is lying and the baby is Jack's.\n\nWhen Bianca is jailed for attacking [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]) in 2011, Ricky struggles to support his children, so he accepts a job in [[Dubai]] where he is arrested for [[indecency]] after being caught [[Nude swimming|swimming naked]] in the sea. He is fined and deported, leaving him with no money upon his return to Walford. From prison, Bianca blames her family's money problems on Ricky, and Ricky seeks comfort from Mandy who has returned to Walford. After reliving their youth and taking drugs, Ricky and Mandy have sex again. Later, Mandy confesses that their one-night stand in 1994 left her pregnant, but their baby daughter, Kira, died shortly after birth. Ricky immediately regrets having sex with Mandy and decides not to tell Bianca upon her release from prison; however, Bianca discovers the truth on New Year's Day 2012, the same night the Butchers are left distraught by Pat's death from cancer. Following Pat's funeral, Bianca realises she cannot forgive Ricky's latest infidelity; she ends their marriage, forcing Ricky to leave Walford. He returns in June for Janine's wedding to [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]), along with Tiffany, Morgan and Diane. Janine goes into premature labour and Ricky sits with his newborn niece, [[Scarlett Moon]], as she fights for survival. Later, he argues with Morgan's biological father, [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]), about their parenting methods, but they call a truce.

Written by Debbie Cook, the storyline saw Ricky and Sam's families, including Sam's mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Jo Warne]]; introduced specifically for this plotline) attempting to stop the couple from saying \"I do\". The storyline climaxed in the registry office wedding, but despite the Scottish setting, the recording of the episodes took place in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Later in the month, Sam and Ricky had a more official \"grand church blessing\" with all their family in attendance.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]]. [[Clive Barnes]] wrote, \"She epitomizes flustered charm almost as if it were a style of acting ... She is one of those actors ... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.\"<ref>Barnes, Clive. \"Stage:Unseen White Rabbit Returns:James Stewart Stars in Phoenix's 'Harvey'\", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 1970, p.41</ref> She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:SHAKESPEARE CENTER DEDICATION HELEN HAYES 4 small.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982.]]\nHayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City. Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier. Hayes was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Nyack.<ref name=pace>Pace, Eric.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF123DF93BA25750C0A965958260 \"Helen Hayes, Flower of the Stage, Dies at 92\"]''The New York Times'' (requires registration), March 18, 1993</ref> In 2011, she was honored with a US postage stamp.<ref>[http://www.beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes Postage Stamp\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611152808/https://beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/helen-hayes |date=2011-06-11 }} beyondtheperf.com, April 25, 2011, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDiminutive and homespun, Helen Hayes was distinctly less glamorous than the other Great Ladies, but the qualities of modesty and practicality that she projected helped create her lasting appeal.

Series creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]] and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] initially conceived of him as a fashionable [[homosexual|gay]] [[countertenor]] who is routinely [[bullying|bullied]] at school. Kurt is portrayed by actor [[Chris Colfer]], and has appeared as a character on the show since its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on May 19, 2009. ''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]], of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] focus on his struggle with his sexuality as he comes out to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for [[Finn Hudson]], the straight co-captain of the glee club.\n\nIn the show's [[Glee (season 2)|second season]], Kurt is forced to transfer to a private school for his own safety after a [[closeted]] classmate bullies him relentlessly and then threatens to kill him. Kurt joins the Dalton Academy Warblers, the school's glee club, which is a competition rival of New Directions, and is befriended by their openly gay lead singer [[Blaine Anderson]]. Later on, the two become romantically involved. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named \"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name=\"NYP\"/> Kurt eventually transfers back to McKinley and rejoins New Directions, but continues his relationship with Blaine, who transfers to McKinley in the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]]. In the [[Glee (season 4)|fourth season]], Kurt moves to New York City with his best friend [[Rachel Berry]], where he pursues his musical education while interning for [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue.com]]. For the remainder of the series, ''Glee'' charts Kurt's life in Lima and New York as he grapples with young adulthood and realizing his career ambitions.\n\nColfer describes Kurt as projecting a very confident \"I'm better than you\" personality, despite being a typically scared and anxious teenager.<ref name=\"starry\"/> Kurt's solos for New Directions tend to be songs\u2014usually [[show tunes]]\u2014traditionally performed by women, which best suit his countertenor voice. His occasionally complex\u2014but always loving\u2014relationship with his father has been a focus for the show. Colfer's portrayal of Kurt has received much critical praise, and he has been the recipient of several awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] at the 2011 [[Golden Globe Awards]]. He has also garnered many award nominations, which include the 2010 and 2011 [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. In April 2011, Colfer was named one of the 2011 [[Time 100]], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s list of the 100 most influential people.\n\n==Casting and creation==\nPrior to being cast in ''Glee'', Colfer had no professional acting experience.<ref name=\"rewrite\">{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-gleestage26-2009apr26,0,1653470.story | title=Video: 'Glee' team rewrites the school musical | first=Denise |last=Martin | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]] | date=April 26, 2009 | accessdate=May 19, 2009 }}</ref> He originally auditioned for the role of [[Artie Abrams]], performing \"[[Chicago (musical)#Musical numbers|Mr. Cellophane]]\" from the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.

After the encouragement of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.\n\nKurt continues working at Vogue throughout the season, and Isabelle encourages him to try to forgive Blaine, and at Thanksgiving, she brings her friends over to their loft and throws him a \"kiki.\" When Kurt reauditions for NYADA, he is initially rejected, because Carmen Tibideaux sees his technical skill and tells him that he can sell a number, but doesn't believe that he is emotional enough to be an artist. Later, when Kurt is at the Winter Showcase to support Rachel, she sees him moved by Rachel's piece, and announces that he will be auditioning after the intermission. Though he initially panics, Rachel convinces him that he doesn't need his bells and whistles to perform, and he chooses to sing \"Being Alive\" from Company, which impresses the NYADA audience, and he later gets a letter telling him that he has gotten in.\n\nAt Christmas, Kurt elects not to go back home, and so his father comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and spend some time with him.

While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together.

Still working at Vogue, Kurt is put in charge of a ballet gala, and invites Rachel and Santana to help. He and Rachel reveal that they both had experiences with ballet as children, and Kurt started ballet at the age of three years when his mother decided to take him. He bribes Santana to go with a designer dress, and once they are at the gala, she admits she was in ballet as a child too and loved it. When Kurt returns to Lima, it is to be there for his father's doctor's visit, and his anxiety is apparent throughout his interactions with his friends.

However, after Blaine cheats on him, Kurt breaks up with Blaine. The two later agree to remain friends, though Kurt is unwilling to resume their relationship. That winter, Kurt begins to see Adam Crawford, a senior at his new school, NYADA. Despite this, Kurt has sex with Blaine when in Ohio to attend a wedding, putting into question whether Kurt still wants to be with Blaine.\n\nDespite all this, Kurt and Blaine do get back together in a romantic relationship in the first episode of the fifth season, \"Love Love Love\", which is incidentally the same episode that Blaine proposes marriage. Kurt says yes immediately.\n\nKurt heads back to New York while Blaine finishes high school back in Lima. Eventually, midway through the fifth season, Blaine graduates and moves in with Kurt. They have difficulties and agree that it would be best for them to continue with their engagement but as Blaine lives somewhere else for now as they both need their space. They will cohabitate in the season five finale.\n\nAt the beginning for the sixth season, it seems as though Kurt and Blaine have broken off the engagement due to difficulties living together and Blaine has moved back to Lima. Kurt later regrets this and decides to continue his schooling in Lima, to try to win Blaine back.\n\nWhen Kurt returns, he finds that Blaine is in a relationship with Karofsky. Despite everything that goes on in the beginning of the sixth season, Kurt and Blaine get back together in the beginning of the episode, \"A Wedding\". Later in the same episode, Brittany and Sue Sylvester persuade the couple to get married at Brittany and Santana's wedding to make a double gay wedding.\n\nThey continue through the rest of the sixth season as a wed couple and in the season six finale, \"Dreams Come True\", it is revealed that five years in the future, Rachel is carrying their child, a daughter.\n\n==Musical performances==\nAs Kurt, Colfer features in many songs that have been released as [[Single (music)|singles]] available for [[Music download|digital download]] and are also included in the show's [[soundtrack album]]s.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/104/1041554p1.html |title=Glee: The Music&nbsp;\u2013 Vol. 1 Review |last=Linder |first=Brian |date=November 4, 2009 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |accessdate=December 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLW7cmC?url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/104/1041554p1.html |archivedate=February 13, 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"IGNV2\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/105/1053108p1.html |title=Glee: The Music, Vol. 2 Review |last=Linder |first=Brian |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004603/http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/105/1053108p1.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In the episode \"[[Wheels (Glee)|Wheels]]\", Kurt performs \"Defying Gravity\" from the Broadway musical ''Wicked''.

Series creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]] and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] initially conceived of him as a fashionable [[homosexual|gay]] [[countertenor]] who is routinely [[bullying|bullied]] at school. Kurt is portrayed by actor [[Chris Colfer]], and has appeared as a character on the show since its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on May 19, 2009. ''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]], of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] focus on his struggle with his sexuality as he comes out to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for [[Finn Hudson]], the straight co-captain of the glee club.\n\nIn the show's [[Glee (season 2)|second season]], Kurt is forced to transfer to a private school for his own safety after a [[closeted]] classmate bullies him relentlessly and then threatens to kill him. Kurt joins the Dalton Academy Warblers, the school's glee club, which is a competition rival of New Directions, and is befriended by their openly gay lead singer [[Blaine Anderson]]. Later on, the two become romantically involved. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named \"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name=\"NYP\"/> Kurt eventually transfers back to McKinley and rejoins New Directions, but continues his relationship with Blaine, who transfers to McKinley in the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]]. In the [[Glee (season 4)|fourth season]], Kurt moves to New York City with his best friend [[Rachel Berry]], where he pursues his musical education while interning for [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue.com]]. For the remainder of the series, ''Glee'' charts Kurt's life in Lima and New York as he grapples with young adulthood and realizing his career ambitions.\n\nColfer describes Kurt as projecting a very confident \"I'm better than you\" personality, despite being a typically scared and anxious teenager.<ref name=\"starry\"/> Kurt's solos for New Directions tend to be songs\u2014usually [[show tunes]]\u2014traditionally performed by women, which best suit his countertenor voice. His occasionally complex\u2014but always loving\u2014relationship with his father has been a focus for the show. Colfer's portrayal of Kurt has received much critical praise, and he has been the recipient of several awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] at the 2011 [[Golden Globe Awards]]. He has also garnered many award nominations, which include the 2010 and 2011 [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]].

After the encouragement of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.\n\nKurt continues working at Vogue throughout the season, and Isabelle encourages him to try to forgive Blaine, and at Thanksgiving, she brings her friends over to their loft and throws him a \"kiki.\" When Kurt reauditions for NYADA, he is initially rejected, because Carmen Tibideaux sees his technical skill and tells him that he can sell a number, but doesn't believe that he is emotional enough to be an artist. Later, when Kurt is at the Winter Showcase to support Rachel, she sees him moved by Rachel's piece, and announces that he will be auditioning after the intermission. Though he initially panics, Rachel convinces him that he doesn't need his bells and whistles to perform, and he chooses to sing \"Being Alive\" from Company, which impresses the NYADA audience, and he later gets a letter telling him that he has gotten in.\n\nAt Christmas, Kurt elects not to go back home, and so his father comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and spend some time with him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has prostate cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.\n\nWhen Santana moves in with him and Rachel, Kurt tries to keep Santana from telling Rachel about Brody prostituting himself. But Santana tells Rachel anyway, much to Kurt's dismay. Later, Kurt and Rachel confront Santana for working at a club dancing and try to encourage her to take a dance class from the extension school of NYADA to keep her skills honed. Still working at Vogue, Kurt is put in charge of a ballet gala, and invites Rachel and Santana to help. He and Rachel reveal that they both had experiences with ballet as children, and Kurt started ballet at the age of three years when his mother decided to take him. He bribes Santana to go with a designer dress, and once they are at the gala, she admits she was in ballet as a child too and loved it. When Kurt returns to Lima, it is to be there for his father's doctor's visit, and his anxiety is apparent throughout his interactions with his friends. However, in the doctor's office, Kurt, Burt, and Carole learn that Burt's cancer has gone into remission, and Kurt takes his father to the Glee club to sing \"Sunshine of My Life\" to him, which Kurt says Burt used to sing to him when he was little.\n\n===Season 5===\nIn the season premiere, \"[[Love, Love, Love (Glee)|Love, Love, Love]]\", Kurt, who is still in Lima, agrees to get back together with Blaine.
