(Their province was part of the wider [[Diocese of the East]] and contained areas to the east of [[Mount Lebanon]]). Bouzes was stationed at [[Palmyra]], while Coutzes at [[Damascus]]. Both brothers are described as being young at the time by Procopius.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nTheir first known mission sent the two brothers to the front lines of the [[Iberian War]] against the [[Sassanid Empire]], reinforcing [[Belisarius]] at Mindouos.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> Belisarius was attempting to construct a fortress at this location.  \"When the emperor ([[Justinian I]]) heard this, inasmuch as Belisarius was not able to beat off the Persians from the place with the army he had, he ordered another army to go thither, and also Coutzes and Bouzes, who at that time commanded the soldiers in Libanus. These two were brothers from [[Thrace]], both young and inclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy. So both armies were gathered together and came in full force to the scene of the building operations, the Persians in order to hinder the work with all their power, and the Romans to defend the labourers. And a fierce battle took place in which the Romans were defeated, and there was a great slaughter of them, while some also were made captive by the enemy. Among these was Coutzes himself. All these captives the Persians led away to their own country, and, putting them in chains, confined them permanently in a cave; as for the fort, since no one defended it any longer, they razed what had been built to the ground.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 1, Chapter 13 (cf.

On the right of these, outside the trench, at the angle formed by the cross trench and the straight section which extended from that point, were [[Sunicas]] and Aigan, [[Massagetae]] ([[Huns]]) by birth, with six hundred horsemen, in order that, if those under Bouzes and Pharas should be driven back, they might, by moving quickly on the flank, and getting in the rear of the enemy, be able easily to support the Romans at that point.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n\"In the late afternoon a certain detachment of the horsemen who held the right wing [of the Sassanids], separating themselves from the rest of the army, came against the forces of Bouzes and Pharas. And the Romans retired a short distance to the rear. The Persians, however, did not pursue them, but remained there, fearing, I suppose, some move to surround them on the part of the enemy. Then the Romans who had turned to flight suddenly rushed upon them. And the Persians did not withstand their onset and rode back to the phalanx, and again the forces of Bouzes and Pharas stationed themselves in their own position. In this skirmish seven of the Persians fell, and the Romans gained possession of their bodies; thereafter both armies remained quietly in position.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n\"But one Persian, a young man, riding up very close to the Roman army, began to challenge all of them, calling for whoever wished to do battle with him. And no one of the whole army dared face the danger, except a certain Andreas, one of the personal attendants of Bouzes, not a soldier nor one who had ever practised at all the business of war, but a trainer of youths in charge of a certain [[wrestling]] school in [[Constantinople|Byzantium]]. Through this it came about that he was following the army, for he cared for the person of Bouzes in the bath; his birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the courage, without being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of his own accord to meet the man in single combat. And he caught the [[barbarian]] while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his [[spear]] on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a sacrificial animal as he lay on his back, and a mighty shout was raised both from the city wall and from the Roman army.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n\"But the Persians were deeply vexed at the outcome and sent forth another horseman for the same purpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to bodily size, but not a youth, for some of the hair on his head already shewed grey. This horseman came up along the hostile army, and, brandishing vehemently the [[whip]] with which he was accustomed to strike his horse, he summoned to battle whoever among the Romans was willing. And when no one went out against him, Andreas, without attracting the notice of anyone, once more came forth, although he had been forbidden to do so by [[Hermogenes (magister officiorum)|Hermogenes]]. So both rushed madly upon each other with their spears, and the weapons, driven against their corselets, were turned aside with mighty force, and the horses, striking together their heads, fell themselves and threw off their riders. And both the two men, falling very close to each other, made great haste to rise to their feet, but the Persian was not able to do this easily because his size was against him, while Andreas, anticipating him (for his practice in the wrestling school gave him this advantage), smote him as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again to the ground dispatched him. Then a roar went up from the wall and from the Roman army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians broke their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising the [[paean]], went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing dark. Thus both armies passed that night.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Siege of Martyropolis===\n{{Main|Siege of Martyropolis (531)}}\nIn 531, Bouzes was unable to participate at the [[Battle of Callinicum]] (19 April, 531). He was reportedly stationed at [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]], an illness preventing him from campaigning. [[Zacharias Rhetor]] mentions that Bouzes tasked his nephew [[Domnentiolus]] with leading an army to Abhgarsat. This location is only mentioned by Zacharias.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> The Byzantine forces faced the [[Sassanid army]] and were defeated. Domnentiolus himself was captured by his enemies and transported to the interior of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. In 532, the [[Eternal Peace (532)|Eternal Peace]] was concluded between the two powers. Domnentiolus was released \"in an exchange of prisoners\"<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 413</ref>\n\nIn September/October 531, Bouzes and [[Bessas (general)|Bessas]] were joint commanders of the garrison at [[Silvan, Diyarbak\u0131r|Martyropolis]]. The city was besieged by a strong Sassanid force. The death of [[Kavadh I]] resulted in the premature end of the siege.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> Procopius details: \"And the Persians once more invaded [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] with a great army under command of [[Kanarang|Chanaranges]] and Aspebedes and Mermeroes. Since no one dared to engage with them, they made camp and began the siege of Martyropolis, where Bouzes and Bessas had been stationed in command of the garrison. This city lies in the land called [[Sophene|Sophanene]], two hundred and forty stades distant from the city of Amida toward the north; it is just on the River [[Batman River|Nymphius]] which divides the land of the Romans and the Persians. So the Persians began to assail the fortifications, and, while the besieged at first withstood them manfully, it did not seem likely that they would hold out long. For the circuit-wall was quite easily assailable in most parts, and could be captured very easily by a Persian siege, and besides they did not have a sufficient supply of provisions, nor indeed had they engines of war nor anything else that was of any value for defending themselves.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 1, Chapter 21</ref>\n\n\"Thus then [[Khosrau I|Chosroes]] secured the power. But at Martyropolis, [[Sittas]] and Hermogenes were in fear concerning the city, since they were utterly unable to defend it in its peril, and they sent certain men to the enemy, who came before the generals and spoke as follows: \"It has escaped your own notice that you are becoming wrongfully an obstacle to the king of the Persians and to the blessings of peace and to each state. For ambassadors sent from the emperor are even now present in order that they may go to the king of the Persians and there settle the differences and establish a treaty with him; but do you as quickly as possible remove from the land of the Romans and permit the ambassadors to act in the manner which will be of advantage to both peoples. For we are ready also to give as hostages men of repute concerning these very things, to prove that they will be actually accomplished at no distant date.\" Such were the words of the ambassadors of the Romans. It happened also that a messenger came to them from the palace, who brought them word that Cabades had died and that Chosroes, son of Cabades, had become king over the Persians, and that in this way the situation had become unsettled. And as a result of this the generals heard the words of the Romans gladly, since they feared also the attack of the Huns. The Romans therefore straightway gave as hostages Martinus and one of the body-guards of Sittas, Senecius by name; so the Persians broke up the siege and made their departure promptly.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n==Armenian revolt==\n\nBouzes resurfaces in 539, when he succeeded the deceased [[Sittas]] in command of [[Roman Armenia]]. He was tasked with ending an ongoing Armenian revolt. His efforts included the assassination of John, a descendant of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]]. John was survived by his son [[Artabanes (general)|Artabanes]].<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> \"After the death of Sittas the emperor commanded Bouzes to go against the Armenians; and he, upon drawing near, sent to them promising to effect a reconciliation between the emperor and all the Armenians, and asking that some of their notables should come to confer with him on these matters. Now the Armenians as a whole were unable to trust Bouzes, nor were they willing to receive his proposals. But there was a certain man of the Arsacidae who was especially friendly with him, John by name, the father of Artabanes, and this man, trusting in Bouzes as his friend, came to him with his son-in-law, Bassaces, and a few others; but when these men had reached the spot where they were to meet Bouzes on the following day, and had made their [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac]] there, they perceived that they had come into a place surrounded by the Roman army. Bassaces, the son-in-law, therefore earnestly entreated John to fly. And since he was not able to persuade him, he left him there alone, and in company with all the others eluded the Romans, and went back again by the same road. And Bouzes found John alone and slew him; and since after this the Armenians had no hope of ever reaching an agreement with the Romans, and since they were unable to prevail over the emperor in war, they came before the Persian king led by Bassaces, an energetic man.\" The events led to a new conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires.<ref>Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 3</ref>\n\nIn 540, Justinian I appointed Belisarius and Bouzes joint [[magister militum|magistri militum]] per Orientem. Bouzes would personally command the area between the [[Euphrates]] and the Persian border. He also temporarily held command over Belisarius' areas. Belisarius had just been recalled from the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] and was still in the [[Italian Peninsula]]. He would not reach his new post until the spring of 541.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> \"The emperor had divided into two parts the military command of the East, leaving the portion as far as the River Euphrates under the control of Belisarius who formerly held the command of the whole, while the portion from there as far as the Persian boundary he entrusted to Bouzes, commanding him to take charge of the whole territory of the East until Belisarius should return from Italy.\"  <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 6</ref>\n\nIn the spring of the same year (540), the Sassanids invaded Byzantine areas. They avoided the fortresses of Mesopotamia, heading for the easier targets of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Cilicia]]. Bouzes was stationed at [[Hierapolis]] at the beginning of this campaign season. By mid-summer, the Sassanids had captured [[Sura (city)|Sura]]. Bouzes left Hierapolis at the head of his best troops. He promised to return if the city came under Persian threat, but Procopius accuses Bouzes of simply vanishing, with neither the Hierapolitans or the Sassanids able to locate him.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /><ref>Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapters 5-6</ref> \"Bouzes therefore at first remained at Hierapolis, keeping his whole army with him; but when he learned what had befallen Sura, he called together the first men of the Hierapolitans and spoke as follows: \"Whenever men are confronted with a struggle against an assailant with whom they are evenly matched in strength, it is not at all unreasonable that they should engage in open conflict with the enemy; but for those who are by comparison much inferior to their opponents it will be more advantageous to circumvent their enemy by some kind of tricks than to array themselves openly against them and thus enter into foreseen danger. How great, now, the army of Chosroes is, you are assuredly informed. And if, with this army, he wishes to capture us by siege, and if we carry on the fight from the wall, it is probable that, while our supplies will fail us, the Persians will secure all they need from our land, where there will be no one to oppose them. And if the siege is prolonged in this way, I believe too that the fortification wall will not withstand the assaults of the enemy, for in many places it is most susceptible to attack, and thus irreparable harm will come to the Romans. But if with a portion of the army we guard the wall of the city, while the rest of us occupy the heights about the city, we shall make attacks from there at times upon the camp of our antagonists, and at times upon those who are sent out for the sake of provisions, and thus compel Chosroes to abandon the siege immediately and to make his retreat within a short time; for he will not be at all able to direct his attack without fear against the fortifications, nor to provide any of the necessities for so great an army.\" So spoke Bouzes; and in his words he seemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of what was necessary he did nothing. For he chose out all that portion of the Roman army which was of marked excellence and was off. And where in the world he was, neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor the hostile army was able to learn.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nHe is mentioned again later that year at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. The local citizens were attempting to pay ransom for the safe return of prisoners held at [[Antioch]]. Bouzes prevented them from doing so.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> \"Chosroes ...wished to sell off all the captives from Antioch. And when the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they displayed an unheard-of zeal. For there was not a person who did not bring ransom for the captives and deposit it in the sanctuary according to the measure of his possessions. And there were some who even exceeded their proportionate amount in so doing. For the harlots took off all the adornment which they wore on their persons, and threw it down there, and any farmer who was in want of plate or of money, but who had an ass or a sheep, brought this to the sanctuary with great zeal. So there was collected an exceedingly great amount of gold and silver and money in other forms, but not a bit of it was given for ransom. For Bouzes happened to be present there, and he took in hand to prevent the transaction, expecting that this would bring him some great gain. Therefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the captives.\" <ref>Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 13</ref>\n\n==Lazic War==\n[[File:Lazica in Late Antiquity.svg|thumb|250px|Map of [[Lazica]]]]\nThe hostilities of 540 gave way to the long-running [[Lazic War]] (541-562). In 541, Bouzes is recorded as one of the various Roman (Byzantine) commanders gathering at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] to decide on a course of action. He was among those in favor of an invasion into Sassanid areas.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> Procopius mentions: \"At this time Belisarius had arrived in Mesopotamia and was gathering his army from every quarter, and he also kept sending men into the land of Persia to act as spies. And wishing himself to encounter the enemy there, if they should again make an incursion into the land of the Romans, he was organizing on the spot and equipping the soldiers, who were for the most part without either arms or armour, and in terror of the name of the Persians. Now the spies returned and declared that for the present there would be no invasion of the enemy; for Chosroes was occupied elsewhere with a war against the [[Huns]]. And Belisarius, upon learning this, wished to invade the land of the enemy immediately with his whole army. ... And Peter and Bouzes urged him to lead the army without any hesitation against the enemy's country. And their opinion was followed immediately by the whole council. \" <ref>Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 16</ref>\n\nWhile Bouzes probably served under Belisarius in this campaign, his specific activities are not mentioned. The Byzantine invasion force failed to capture [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]], though they did capture Sisauranon. In the campaign season of 542, Khosrau I once again invaded Byzantine-held areas. Bouzes, [[Justus (cousin of Justinian I)|Justus]] and others retreated within the walls of Hierapolis. He was one of the co-writers of a letter asking Belisarius to join them there. Belisarius instead moved towards Europum, summoning the other leaders there.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> Procopius narrates: \"At the opening of spring Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for the third time began an invasion into the land of the Romans with a mighty army, keeping the River Euphrates on the right. ... The Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians, again sent Belisarius against them. And he came with great speed to [[Euphratesia]] since he had no army with him, riding on the government post-horses, which they are accustomed to call \"veredi,\" while Justus, the nephew of the emperor, together with Bouzes and certain others, was in Hierapolis where he had fled for refuge.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 20</ref>\n\n\"And when these men heard that Belisarius was coming and was not far away, they wrote a letter to him which ran as follows: \"Once more Chosroes, as you yourself doubtless know, has taken the field against the Romans, bringing a much greater army than formerly; and where he is purposing to go is not yet evident, except indeed that we hear he is very near, and that he has injured no place, but is always moving ahead. But come to us as quickly as possible, if indeed you are able to escape detection by the army of the enemy, in order that you yourself may be safe for the emperor, and that you may join us in guarding Hierapolis.\" Such was the message of the letter. But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates. From there he sent about in all directions and began to gather his army, and there he established his camp; and the officers in Hierapolis he answered with the following words: \"If, now, Chosroes is proceeding against any other peoples, and not against subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is well considered and insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for it is great folly for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet and being rid of trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if, immediately after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall upon some other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an exceptionally good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured that to perish valorously is better in every way than to be saved without a fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but treason. But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as [[God]] permits.\" And when the officers saw this message, they took courage, and leaving there Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all the others with the rest of the army came to Europum.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\n==Falling out of favor==\nIn the Summer of 542, [[Constantinople]] was affected by the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]]. The emperor Justinian himself caught the plague and there were discussions of an imminent succession. Belisarius and Bouzes, both absent in campaign, reportedly swore to oppose any emperor chosen without their consent. [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]] took offense and had them both recalled at Constantinople to face her judgement. Bouzes was captured upon his return. He reportedly spent two years and four months (late 542-early 545) held in an underground chamber, located below the women's quarters of the palace. While eventually released, Procopius suggests that Bouzes continued to suffer from a failing eyesight and ill health for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nProcopius narrates: \"The plague which I mentioned in the previous narrative was ravaging the population of Byzantium. And the Emperor Justinian was taken very seriously ill, so that it was even reported that he had died. And this report was circulated by rumour and was carried as far as the Roman army. There some of the commanders began to say that, if the Romans should set up a second Justinian as Emperor over them in Byzantium, they would never tolerate it. But a little later it so fell out that the Emperor recovered, and the commanders of the Roman army began to slander one another. For Peter the General and John whom they called the Glutton declared that they had heard Belisarius and Bouzes say those things which I have just mentioned. The Empress Theodora, declaring that these slighting things which the men had said were directed against her, became quite out of patience. So she straightway summoned them all to Byzantium and made an investigation of the report.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Procopius, Secret History, Book 2, Chapter 4</ref>\n\n\"She [Theodora] called Bouzes suddenly into the woman's apartment as if to communicate to him something very important. Now there was a suite of rooms in the Palace, below the ground level, secure and a veritable [[labyrinth]], so that it seemed to resemble [[Tartarus]], where she usually kept in confinement those who had given offence. So Bouzes was hurled into this pit, and in that place he, a man sprung from a line of consuls, remained, forever unaware of time. For as he sat there in the darkness, he could [not] distinguish whether it was day or night, nor could he communicate with any other person. For the man who threw him his food for each day met him in silence, one as dumb as the other, as one beast meets another. And straightway it was supposed by all that he had died, but no one dared mention or recall him. But two years and four months later she was moved to pity and released the man, and he was seen by all as one who had returned from the dead. But thereafter he always suffered from weak sight and his whole body was sickly.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/>\n\n\"Such was the experience of Bouzes. As for Belisarius, though he was convicted of none of the charges, the Emperor, at the insistence of the Empress, relieved him of the command which he held and appointed Martinus to be General of the East in his stead, and instructed him to distribute the spearmen and guards of Belisarius and all his servants who were notable men in war to certain of the officers and Palace eunuchs. So these cast lots for them and divided them all up among themselves, arms and all, as each happened to win them. And many of those who had been his friends or had previously served him in some way he forbade to visit Belisarius any longer. And he went about, a sorry and incredible sight, Belisarius a private citizen in Byzantium, practically alone, always pensive and gloomy, and dreading a death by violence.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/>\n\n==Later years==\nIn either the late summer or early autumn of 548, [[Germanus (cousin of Justinian I)|Germanus]] confided to Bouzes and Constantianus about the ongoing conspiracy of [[Artabanes (general)|Artabanes]], a plot to assassinate Justinian. While Justinian had the conspirators arrested, Germanus and his sons also came under suspicion for their contact. In particular, they had to explain why they alerted generals loyal to Justinian but failed to inform the emperor himself. Bouzes, Constantianus, [[Marcellus (comes excubitorum)|Marcellus]] and Leontius testified under oath to the innocence of Germanus.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /><ref>Bury (1958), p. 68</ref>\n\nIn spring 549, Bouzes was once again active on campaign. He led (along with [[Aratius]], Constantianus, and John) an army of 10,000 cavalry men. They were sent to assist the [[Lombards]] against the [[Gepids]]. This campaign was short-lived as the two opponents concluded a peace treaty, making the presence of Byzantine forces unnecessary. This is the last time Bouzes is mentioned by Procopius.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nHe is next mentioned by [[Agathias]] c. 554-556 as one of the generals in charge of the army in [[Egrisi|Lazica]]. In 554, [[Bessas (general)|Bessas]] was the chief commander in this area. [[Martin (general under Justinian I)|Martin]], magister militum per Armeniam, seems to have been the second-in-command. [[Justin (consul 540)|Justin]] served as a deputy to Martinus and was apparently third in line. Leaving Bouzes as fourth in the chain of command. Agathias reports that all four men were veterans of previous wars.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /><ref>Greatrex & Lieu (2002), pp. 120, 122</ref><ref>Evans (1996), p. 168</ref>\n\nBessas was dismissed from office in 554/555, leaving Martin as the chief commander. Bouzes is explicitly said to be third-in-command. In September/October, 555 the three of them and the ''[[sacellarius]]'' [[Rusticus (sacellarius)|Rusticus]] went to meet [[Gubazes II of Lazica]]. Justin and Bouzes reportedly thought that they were to discuss a planned attack on the Sassanid forces in Onoguris (a local fort). Martin and Rusticus had Gubazes murdered, reportedly shocking Bouzes. However, he soon suspected that Justinian himself had ordered the assassination. He thus held his tongue from too much protesting.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nPreparations for [[Siege of Onoguris|an attack at Onoguris]] continued, but Sassanid reinforcements started arriving. Bouzes suggested that they should deal with the new arrivals first, postponing the planned attack. He was overruled. The Byzantines lost the battle of Onoguris. Bouzes is credited with successfully guarding a bridge crossing, during the subsequent retreat. His efforts saved the lives of many soldiers who crossed the bridge to safety.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nIn early 556, Bouzes was ordered to defend Nesus (a minor island) at the [[Rioni River|River Phasis]]. He was later joined there by Justin. The two continued guarding the island, while the rest of the army was campaigning against the [[Misimiani]] (a local tribe). He is not mentioned again.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation | title= History of the Later Roman Empire: From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian, Volume 2 | first = John Bagnell | last = Bury | authorlink=J.

Both brothers are described as being young at the time by Procopius.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nTheir first known mission sent the two brothers to the front lines of the [[Iberian War]] against the [[Sassanid Empire]], reinforcing [[Belisarius]] at Mindouos.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> Belisarius was attempting to construct a fortress at this location.  \"When the emperor ([[Justinian I]]) heard this, inasmuch as Belisarius was not able to beat off the Persians from the place with the army he had, he ordered another army to go thither, and also Coutzes and Bouzes, who at that time commanded the soldiers in Libanus. These two were brothers from [[Thrace]], both young and inclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy. So both armies were gathered together and came in full force to the scene of the building operations, the Persians in order to hinder the work with all their power, and the Romans to defend the labourers. And a fierce battle took place in which the Romans were defeated, and there was a great slaughter of them, while some also were made captive by the enemy. Among these was Coutzes himself. All these captives the Persians led away to their own country, and, putting them in chains, confined them permanently in a cave; as for the fort, since no one defended it any longer, they razed what had been built to the ground.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 1, Chapter 13 (cf. Lillington-Martin, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2013).</ref>\n\n===Battle of Dara===\n{{further|Battle of Dara}}\nBouzes survived the defeat. He is next mentioned taking part in the [[Battle of Dara]] (June, 530). He served in command of the cavalry alongside [[Pharas the Herulian]]. Among his attendants was Andreas, who distinguished himself in the first day of the battle.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> \"The extremity of the left straight trench which joined the cross trench, as far as the hill which rises here, was held by Bouzes with a large force of horsemen and by Pharas the Erulian with three hundred of [[Heruli|his nation]]. On the right of these, outside the trench, at the angle formed by the cross trench and the straight section which extended from that point, were [[Sunicas]] and Aigan, [[Massagetae]] ([[Huns]]) by birth, with six hundred horsemen, in order that, if those under Bouzes and Pharas should be driven back, they might, by moving quickly on the flank, and getting in the rear of the enemy, be able easily to support the Romans at that point.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n\"In the late afternoon a certain detachment of the horsemen who held the right wing [of the Sassanids], separating themselves from the rest of the army, came against the forces of Bouzes and Pharas. And the Romans retired a short distance to the rear. The Persians, however, did not pursue them, but remained there, fearing, I suppose, some move to surround them on the part of the enemy. Then the Romans who had turned to flight suddenly rushed upon them. And the Persians did not withstand their onset and rode back to the phalanx, and again the forces of Bouzes and Pharas stationed themselves in their own position. In this skirmish seven of the Persians fell, and the Romans gained possession of their bodies; thereafter both armies remained quietly in position.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n\"But one Persian, a young man, riding up very close to the Roman army, began to challenge all of them, calling for whoever wished to do battle with him. And no one of the whole army dared face the danger, except a certain Andreas, one of the personal attendants of Bouzes, not a soldier nor one who had ever practised at all the business of war, but a trainer of youths in charge of a certain [[wrestling]] school in [[Constantinople|Byzantium]]. Through this it came about that he was following the army, for he cared for the person of Bouzes in the bath; his birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the courage, without being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of his own accord to meet the man in single combat. And he caught the [[barbarian]] while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his [[spear]] on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a sacrificial animal as he lay on his back, and a mighty shout was raised both from the city wall and from the Roman army.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n\"But the Persians were deeply vexed at the outcome and sent forth another horseman for the same purpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to bodily size, but not a youth, for some of the hair on his head already shewed grey. This horseman came up along the hostile army, and, brandishing vehemently the [[whip]] with which he was accustomed to strike his horse, he summoned to battle whoever among the Romans was willing. And when no one went out against him, Andreas, without attracting the notice of anyone, once more came forth, although he had been forbidden to do so by [[Hermogenes (magister officiorum)|Hermogenes]]. So both rushed madly upon each other with their spears, and the weapons, driven against their corselets, were turned aside with mighty force, and the horses, striking together their heads, fell themselves and threw off their riders. And both the two men, falling very close to each other, made great haste to rise to their feet, but the Persian was not able to do this easily because his size was against him, while Andreas, anticipating him (for his practice in the wrestling school gave him this advantage), smote him as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again to the ground dispatched him. Then a roar went up from the wall and from the Roman army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians broke their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising the [[paean]], went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing dark. Thus both armies passed that night.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Siege of Martyropolis===\n{{Main|Siege of Martyropolis (531)}}\nIn 531, Bouzes was unable to participate at the [[Battle of Callinicum]] (19 April, 531). He was reportedly stationed at [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]], an illness preventing him from campaigning. [[Zacharias Rhetor]] mentions that Bouzes tasked his nephew [[Domnentiolus]] with leading an army to Abhgarsat. This location is only mentioned by Zacharias.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> The Byzantine forces faced the [[Sassanid army]] and were defeated. Domnentiolus himself was captured by his enemies and transported to the interior of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. In 532, the [[Eternal Peace (532)|Eternal Peace]] was concluded between the two powers. Domnentiolus was released \"in an exchange of prisoners\"<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 413</ref>\n\nIn September/October 531, Couzes and [[Bessas (general)|Bessas]] were joint commanders of the garrison at [[Silvan, Diyarbak\u0131r|Martyropolis]]. The city was besieged by a strong Sassanid force. The death of [[Kavadh I]] resulted in the premature end of the siege.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> Procopius details: \"And the Persians once more invaded [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] with a great army under command of [[Kanarang|Chanaranges]] and Aspebedes and Mermeroes. Since no one dared to engage with them, they made camp and began the siege of Martyropolis, where Bouzes and Bessas had been stationed in command of the garrison. This city lies in the land called [[Sophene|Sophanene]], two hundred and forty stades distant from the city of Amida toward the north; it is just on the River [[Batman River|Nymphius]] which divides the land of the Romans and the Persians. So the Persians began to assail the fortifications, and, while the besieged at first withstood them manfully, it did not seem likely that they would hold out long. For the circuit-wall was quite easily assailable in most parts, and could be captured very easily by a Persian siege, and besides they did not have a sufficient supply of provisions, nor indeed had they engines of war nor anything else that was of any value for defending themselves.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 1, Chapter 21</ref>\n\n\"Thus then [[Khosrau I|Chosroes]] secured the power. But at Martyropolis, [[Sittas]] and Hermogenes were in fear concerning the city, since they were utterly unable to defend it in its peril, and they sent certain men to the enemy, who came before the generals and spoke as follows: \"It has escaped your own notice that you are becoming wrongfully an obstacle to the king of the Persians and to the blessings of peace and to each state. For ambassadors sent from the emperor are even now present in order that they may go to the king of the Persians and there settle the differences and establish a treaty with him; but do you as quickly as possible remove from the land of the Romans and permit the ambassadors to act in the manner which will be of advantage to both peoples. For we are ready also to give as hostages men of repute concerning these very things, to prove that they will be actually accomplished at no distant date.\" Such were the words of the ambassadors of the Romans. It happened also that a messenger came to them from the palace, who brought them word that Cabades had died and that Chosroes, son of Cabades, had become king over the Persians, and that in this way the situation had become unsettled. And as a result of this the generals heard the words of the Romans gladly, since they feared also the attack of the Huns. The Romans therefore straightway gave as hostages Martinus and one of the body-guards of Sittas, Senecius by name; so the Persians broke up the siege and made their departure promptly.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n==Armenian revolt==\n\nBouzes resurfaces in 539, when he succeeded the deceased [[Sittas]] in command of [[Roman Armenia]]. He was tasked with ending an ongoing Armenian revolt. His efforts included the assassination of John, a descendant of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]]. John was survived by his son [[Artabanes (general)|Artabanes]].<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> \"After the death of Sittas the emperor commanded Bouzes to go against the Armenians; and he, upon drawing near, sent to them promising to effect a reconciliation between the emperor and all the Armenians, and asking that some of their notables should come to confer with him on these matters. Now the Armenians as a whole were unable to trust Bouzes, nor were they willing to receive his proposals. But there was a certain man of the Arsacidae who was especially friendly with him, John by name, the father of Artabanes, and this man, trusting in Bouzes as his friend, came to him with his son-in-law, Bassaces, and a few others; but when these men had reached the spot where they were to meet Bouzes on the following day, and had made their [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac]] there, they perceived that they had come into a place surrounded by the Roman army. Bassaces, the son-in-law, therefore earnestly entreated John to fly. And since he was not able to persuade him, he left him there alone, and in company with all the others eluded the Romans, and went back again by the same road. And Bouzes found John alone and slew him; and since after this the Armenians had no hope of ever reaching an agreement with the Romans, and since they were unable to prevail over the emperor in war, they came before the Persian king led by Bassaces, an energetic man.\" The events led to a new conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires.<ref>Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 3</ref>\n\nIn 540, Justinian I appointed Belisarius and Bouzes joint [[magister militum|magistri militum]] per Orientem. Bouzes would personally command the area between the [[Euphrates]] and the Persian border. He also temporarily held command over Belisarius' areas. Belisarius had just been recalled from the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] and was still in the [[Italian Peninsula]]. He would not reach his new post until the spring of 541.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> \"The emperor had divided into two parts the military command of the East, leaving the portion as far as the River Euphrates under the control of Belisarius who formerly held the command of the whole, while the portion from there as far as the Persian boundary he entrusted to Bouzes, commanding him to take charge of the whole territory of the East until Belisarius should return from Italy.\"  <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 6</ref>\n\nIn the spring of the same year (540), the Sassanids invaded Byzantine areas. They avoided the fortresses of Mesopotamia, heading for the easier targets of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Cilicia]]. Bouzes was stationed at [[Hierapolis]] at the beginning of this campaign season. By mid-summer, the Sassanids had captured [[Sura (city)|Sura]]. Bouzes left Hierapolis at the head of his best troops. He promised to return if the city came under Persian threat, but Procopius accuses Bouzes of simply vanishing, with neither the Hierapolitans or the Sassanids able to locate him.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /><ref>Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapters 5-6</ref> \"Bouzes therefore at first remained at Hierapolis, keeping his whole army with him; but when he learned what had befallen Sura, he called together the first men of the Hierapolitans and spoke as follows: \"Whenever men are confronted with a struggle against an assailant with whom they are evenly matched in strength, it is not at all unreasonable that they should engage in open conflict with the enemy; but for those who are by comparison much inferior to their opponents it will be more advantageous to circumvent their enemy by some kind of tricks than to array themselves openly against them and thus enter into foreseen danger. How great, now, the army of Chosroes is, you are assuredly informed. And if, with this army, he wishes to capture us by siege, and if we carry on the fight from the wall, it is probable that, while our supplies will fail us, the Persians will secure all they need from our land, where there will be no one to oppose them. And if the siege is prolonged in this way, I believe too that the fortification wall will not withstand the assaults of the enemy, for in many places it is most susceptible to attack, and thus irreparable harm will come to the Romans. But if with a portion of the army we guard the wall of the city, while the rest of us occupy the heights about the city, we shall make attacks from there at times upon the camp of our antagonists, and at times upon those who are sent out for the sake of provisions, and thus compel Chosroes to abandon the siege immediately and to make his retreat within a short time; for he will not be at all able to direct his attack without fear against the fortifications, nor to provide any of the necessities for so great an army.\" So spoke Bouzes; and in his words he seemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of what was necessary he did nothing. For he chose out all that portion of the Roman army which was of marked excellence and was off. And where in the world he was, neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor the hostile army was able to learn.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nHe is mentioned again later that year at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. The local citizens were attempting to pay ransom for the safe return of prisoners held at [[Antioch]]. Bouzes prevented them from doing so.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> \"Chosroes ...wished to sell off all the captives from Antioch. And when the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they displayed an unheard-of zeal. For there was not a person who did not bring ransom for the captives and deposit it in the sanctuary according to the measure of his possessions. And there were some who even exceeded their proportionate amount in so doing. For the harlots took off all the adornment which they wore on their persons, and threw it down there, and any farmer who was in want of plate or of money, but who had an ass or a sheep, brought this to the sanctuary with great zeal. So there was collected an exceedingly great amount of gold and silver and money in other forms, but not a bit of it was given for ransom. For Bouzes happened to be present there, and he took in hand to prevent the transaction, expecting that this would bring him some great gain. Therefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the captives.\" <ref>Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 13</ref>\n\n==Lazic War==\n[[File:Lazica in Late Antiquity.svg|thumb|250px|Map of [[Lazica]]]]\nThe hostilities of 540 gave way to the long-running [[Lazic War]] (541-562). In 541, Bouzes is recorded as one of the various Roman (Byzantine) commanders gathering at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] to decide on a course of action. He was among those in favor of an invasion into Sassanid areas.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> Procopius mentions: \"At this time Belisarius had arrived in Mesopotamia and was gathering his army from every quarter, and he also kept sending men into the land of Persia to act as spies. And wishing himself to encounter the enemy there, if they should again make an incursion into the land of the Romans, he was organizing on the spot and equipping the soldiers, who were for the most part without either arms or armour, and in terror of the name of the Persians. Now the spies returned and declared that for the present there would be no invasion of the enemy; for Chosroes was occupied elsewhere with a war against the [[Huns]]. And Belisarius, upon learning this, wished to invade the land of the enemy immediately with his whole army. ... And Peter and Bouzes urged him to lead the army without any hesitation against the enemy's country. And their opinion was followed immediately by the whole council. \" <ref>Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 16</ref>\n\nWhile Bouzes probably served under Belisarius in this campaign, his specific activities are not mentioned. The Byzantine invasion force failed to capture [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]], though they did capture Sisauranon. In the campaign season of 542, Khosrau I once again invaded Byzantine-held areas. Bouzes, [[Justus (cousin of Justinian I)|Justus]] and others retreated within the walls of Hierapolis. He was one of the co-writers of a letter asking Belisarius to join them there. Belisarius instead moved towards Europum, summoning the other leaders there.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /> Procopius narrates: \"At the opening of spring Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for the third time began an invasion into the land of the Romans with a mighty army, keeping the River Euphrates on the right. ... The Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians, again sent Belisarius against them. And he came with great speed to [[Euphratesia]] since he had no army with him, riding on the government post-horses, which they are accustomed to call \"veredi,\" while Justus, the nephew of the emperor, together with Bouzes and certain others, was in Hierapolis where he had fled for refuge.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 20</ref>\n\n\"And when these men heard that Belisarius was coming and was not far away, they wrote a letter to him which ran as follows: \"Once more Chosroes, as you yourself doubtless know, has taken the field against the Romans, bringing a much greater army than formerly; and where he is purposing to go is not yet evident, except indeed that we hear he is very near, and that he has injured no place, but is always moving ahead. But come to us as quickly as possible, if indeed you are able to escape detection by the army of the enemy, in order that you yourself may be safe for the emperor, and that you may join us in guarding Hierapolis.\" Such was the message of the letter. But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates. From there he sent about in all directions and began to gather his army, and there he established his camp; and the officers in Hierapolis he answered with the following words: \"If, now, Chosroes is proceeding against any other peoples, and not against subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is well considered and insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for it is great folly for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet and being rid of trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if, immediately after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall upon some other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an exceptionally good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured that to perish valorously is better in every way than to be saved without a fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but treason. But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as [[God]] permits.\" And when the officers saw this message, they took courage, and leaving there Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all the others with the rest of the army came to Europum.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\n==Falling out of favor==\nIn the Summer of 542, [[Constantinople]] was affected by the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]]. The emperor Justinian himself caught the plague and there were discussions of an imminent succession. Belisarius and Bouzes, both absent in campaign, reportedly swore to oppose any emperor chosen without their consent. [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]] took offense and had them both recalled at Constantinople to face her judgement. Bouzes was captured upon his return. He reportedly spent two years and four months (late 542-early 545) held in an underground chamber, located below the women's quarters of the palace. While eventually released, Procopius suggests that Bouzes continued to suffer from a failing eyesight and ill health for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nProcopius narrates: \"The plague which I mentioned in the previous narrative was ravaging the population of Byzantium. And the Emperor Justinian was taken very seriously ill, so that it was even reported that he had died. And this report was circulated by rumour and was carried as far as the Roman army. There some of the commanders began to say that, if the Romans should set up a second Justinian as Emperor over them in Byzantium, they would never tolerate it. But a little later it so fell out that the Emperor recovered, and the commanders of the Roman army began to slander one another. For Peter the General and John whom they called the Glutton declared that they had heard Belisarius and Bouzes say those things which I have just mentioned. The Empress Theodora, declaring that these slighting things which the men had said were directed against her, became quite out of patience. So she straightway summoned them all to Byzantium and made an investigation of the report.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Procopius, Secret History, Book 2, Chapter 4</ref>\n\n\"She [Theodora] called Bouzes suddenly into the woman's apartment as if to communicate to him something very important. Now there was a suite of rooms in the Palace, below the ground level, secure and a veritable [[labyrinth]], so that it seemed to resemble [[Tartarus]], where she usually kept in confinement those who had given offence. So Bouzes was hurled into this pit, and in that place he, a man sprung from a line of consuls, remained, forever unaware of time. For as he sat there in the darkness, he could [not] distinguish whether it was day or night, nor could he communicate with any other person. For the man who threw him his food for each day met him in silence, one as dumb as the other, as one beast meets another. And straightway it was supposed by all that he had died, but no one dared mention or recall him. But two years and four months later she was moved to pity and released the man, and he was seen by all as one who had returned from the dead. But thereafter he always suffered from weak sight and his whole body was sickly.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/>\n\n\"Such was the experience of Bouzes. As for Belisarius, though he was convicted of none of the charges, the Emperor, at the insistence of the Empress, relieved him of the command which he held and appointed Martinus to be General of the East in his stead, and instructed him to distribute the spearmen and guards of Belisarius and all his servants who were notable men in war to certain of the officers and Palace eunuchs. So these cast lots for them and divided them all up among themselves, arms and all, as each happened to win them. And many of those who had been his friends or had previously served him in some way he forbade to visit Belisarius any longer. And he went about, a sorry and incredible sight, Belisarius a private citizen in Byzantium, practically alone, always pensive and gloomy, and dreading a death by violence.\" <ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/>\n\n==Later years==\nIn either the late summer or early autumn of 548, [[Germanus (cousin of Justinian I)|Germanus]] confided to Bouzes and Constantianus about the ongoing conspiracy of [[Artabanes (general)|Artabanes]], a plot to assassinate Justinian. While Justinian had the conspirators arrested, Germanus and his sons also came under suspicion for their contact. In particular, they had to explain why they alerted generals loyal to Justinian but failed to inform the emperor himself. Bouzes, Constantianus, [[Marcellus (comes excubitorum)|Marcellus]] and Leontius testified under oath to the innocence of Germanus.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /><ref>Bury (1958), p. 68</ref>\n\nIn spring 549, Bouzes was once again active on campaign. He led (along with [[Aratius]], Constantianus, and John) an army of 10,000 cavalry men. They were sent to assist the [[Lombards]] against the [[Gepids]]. This campaign was short-lived as the two opponents concluded a peace treaty, making the presence of Byzantine forces unnecessary. This is the last time Bouzes is mentioned by Procopius.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nHe is next mentioned by [[Agathias]] c. 554-556 as one of the generals in charge of the army in [[Egrisi|Lazica]]. In 554, [[Bessas (general)|Bessas]] was the chief commander in this area. [[Martin (general under Justinian I)|Martin]], magister militum per Armeniam, seems to have been the second-in-command. [[Justin (consul 540)|Justin]] served as a deputy to Martinus and was apparently third in line. Leaving Bouzes as fourth in the chain of command. Agathias reports that all four men were veterans of previous wars.<ref name=\"PLRE\" /><ref>Greatrex & Lieu (2002), pp. 120, 122</ref><ref>Evans (1996), p. 168</ref>\n\nBessas was dismissed from office in 554/555, leaving Martin as the chief commander. Bouzes is explicitly said to be third-in-command. In September/October, 555 the three of them and the ''[[sacellarius]]'' [[Rusticus (sacellarius)|Rusticus]] went to meet [[Gubazes II of Lazica]]. Justin and Bouzes reportedly thought that they were to discuss a planned attack on the Sassanid forces in Onoguris (a local fort). Martin and Rusticus had Gubazes murdered, reportedly shocking Bouzes. However, he soon suspected that Justinian himself had ordered the assassination. He thus held his tongue from too much protesting.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nPreparations for [[Siege of Onoguris|an attack at Onoguris]] continued, but Sassanid reinforcements started arriving. Bouzes suggested that they should deal with the new arrivals first, postponing the planned attack. He was overruled. The Byzantines lost the battle of Onoguris. Bouzes is credited with successfully guarding a bridge crossing, during the subsequent retreat. His efforts saved the lives of many soldiers who crossed the bridge to safety.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\nIn early 556, Bouzes was ordered to defend Nesus (a minor island) at the [[Rioni River|River Phasis]]. He was later joined there by Justin. The two continued guarding the island, while the rest of the army was campaigning against the [[Misimiani]] (a local tribe). He is not mentioned again.<ref name=\"PLRE\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation | title= History of the Later Roman Empire: From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian, Volume 2 | first = John Bagnell | last = Bury | authorlink=J.

It consists of three buildings: the farmhouse, a complex two-storey house of approximately 99 square metres; an adjacent barn; and a later cowshed.\n\n==Construction==\n\nThe present farmhouse is 16th century, with an earlier [[medieval]] core, and may have been a [[tower]] house, a form more associated with [[Pembrokeshire]]. It is built from local [[sandstone]] quarried from a [[quarry]] located in its own land, known as Garreg Llwyd Quarry.\nCourt Farm has a line of [[corbels]] on the south facing walls which are a particular feature of old [[Carmarthenshire]] buildings and, because of its size and visible location it was, together with the nearby [[St. Illtud's Church, Pembrey]], used a navigational point on local shipping charts to help captains of vessels navigate the treacherous [[Burry Inlet]].\n\nOriginally, there were seven square [[chimney]]s, two of which were unusually set [[diagonally]] in the chimney breast in the east wall. It appears that every room had a fireplace, yet the 1672 [[hearth tax]] lists the Court as only having two fireplaces, probably to avoid paying tax of two [[shillings]]. Similarly, many of the early windows were blocked up to avoid paying the half-yearly [[window tax]] of 3 shillings. One room retained its [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] [[panelling]] until Court Farm was abandoned in around 1948.\n\nCourt Farm has an interesting large [[barn]], with a defensive military appearance, due its [[embattled]] [[parapet]] on the south [[elevation]]. It is not known if the barn had a defensive function of any kind, although it could be part of a more  extensive [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. The Pembrey area was \"frontier land\" in [[Medieval]] times, lying between the [[Norman people|Norman]] occupied areas of the east, and the [[Wales|Welsh]] kingdom, north-west of [[Kidwelly]], which continued to attack the Norman strongholds.\n\n==Ownership by the Le Botelers==\n\nEvidence suggests that the Le Boteler family were the first to occupy a manor on the site of the present Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\">Nicholson, J., A., Pembrey and Burry Port, published by Llanelli Borough Council</ref>\n\n[[Maurice de Londres]] granted the Manor of Pembrey to Sir John Butler of [[Dunraven, Wales|Dunraven]] in 1128.<ref name=\"Roberts, Pertwee\">Roberts, E., & Pertwee, H., A., \"St. Illtyd\u2019s Church, Pembrey\", published 1898</ref> Maurice de Londres was the son of [[William de Londres]], who was a knight to [[Robert Fitzhamon]], a [[Norman people|Norman]] [[baron]] from [[Gloucestershire]].\n\nFitzhamon invaded [[Wales]] between 1091 and 1093, established himself as Lord of [[Glamorgan]] and built [[Cardiff Castle]]. The [[knight]]s protecting his castle included William de Londres. As a reward for his services, Fitzhamon gave William the lordship of Ogmore. William went on to help Roger, [[Bishop of Salisbury]], defend his [[lordship]] at [[Kidwelly]] from attacks by the adjacent Welsh [[monarchy|kingdom]] of [[Deheubarth]]. On one of his expeditions to Kidwelly, the inhabitants of Glamorgan attacked [[Ogmore Castle]]. William\u2019s butler, called Arnold, successfully repulsed the attack and was rewarded with the castle and manor of Dunraven. To mark his loyalty, Arnold called himself  [[Arnold le Boteler]]; the Norman word for butler is Le Boteler, or Boteler. The family [[surname]] was later [[anglicized]] to Butler.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nMaurice de Londres succeeded to the lordship of Ogmore, upon the death of his father, William, in 1126. In 1128, Maurice also became Lord of Kidwelly when Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, returned his lordship to [[The Crown]], having found it too difficult to protect from the attacks of Deheubarth. The Crown then gave the lordship to Maurice. In the same year, Maurice granted the Manor of Pembrey to Arnold Butler\u2019s son, Sir John Butler, whose male line of issue included seven generations, most of them named John Butler.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The line became extinct when Arnold Butler, of Pembrey and Dunraven, died without issue. Arnold\u2019s sister, Ann Butler, then inherited both estates.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe [[Manorialism|manor]] of Pembrey was held under military [[tenure]] under the Lordship of Kidwelly.<ref name=\"Lancaster\">Duchy of Lancaster Records, 43/12</ref> The occupation of the Manor of Pembrey required each Butler occupant, in time of war, to provide five [[archery|archer]]s \"according to ancient custom\" to help the Lord of Kidwelly within the limits of the land under his control.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The Butlers also had to order one [[knight]] to attend the \"Court of Foreignry of Kidwelly\", which was held every month.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Each Butler [[heir]] also had an obligation to pay a sum of money to the Lord of Kidwelly of ten [[shilling]]s,<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> to give a day\u2019s ploughing and to help with the [[hay]] for one day.<ref name=\"NLW\">Ashburnham Document Collection N 297, [[National Library of Wales]]</ref>\n\nOne of the woods that originally lay on the manorial land of Court Farm is known as Coed Marchog (Knight's Wood, in the [[English language]]), it lies on the eastern side of the Pembrey to [[Pinged]] Road, below Garreg Lwyd.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe Butler's [[coat of arms]] appears in Pembrey Church. Its [[heraldic device]] is [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], three cups covered, [[or (heraldry)]].<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The Butler [[coat of arms]] can be found in the south east window of the [[nave]] of St Illtud\u2019s Church, Pembrey.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> A [[monument]] and [[altar]]-[[tomb]] of Sir John le Boteler, of circa 1250, can be found at [[St Brides Major]] church<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n   \nIn addition to the land surrounding Court Farm, the Butlers also controlled the vast area of flatlands known as [[Pembrey Burrows]], or the Warren, and the greater part of Pinged Marsh, which is now part of [[Pembrey Country Park]].<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The Butlers were granted rights to all wrecks found on the [[Cefn Sidan]] sands as far as [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]] Point or [[Tywyn Point]]<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe original [[caput]] of the Manor of Pembrey was probably the mound [[castle]] now called \u2018the Twmpath\u2019, which is located about a mile and a half to the north-east of [[Burry Port]] Station. This [[tumulus]] is {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter, with a [[ditch]] of about {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide and about {{convert|5|ft|m}} deep surrounding it. The Twmpath has extensive views, but at some stage it became inconvenient and the caput of the Manor was relocated to the site of the present location of Court Farm.<ref name=\"RCAHMW\">[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]], National Monuments Record</ref>\n\n==Ownership by the Vaughans==\n\nAnn Butler was the last of the Pembrey Butlers. She married Sir Richard Vaughan of [[Bredwardine]], in [[Herefordshire]],<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> the Court Farm and Dunraven estates then became part of the Vaughan family estates.\n\nThe Vaughans claimed to be direct descendants of the Welsh king Moreiddig Warwyn of [[Breconshire]] and north Carmarthenshire.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The family has an unusual coat of arms: three boys' heads with snakes coupled around their necks. This is based on a family legend. When the pregnant mother of Moreiddig Warwyn (Warwyn means \"fair neck\" in Welsh) was resting in the garden, she was frightened by an [[Vipera berus|adder]]. Moreiddig was born with a mark, resembling the bite of the adder, on his neck.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nSir Richard Vaughan was born in 1460 and was knighted at [[Tournai]], in 1513. He became [[High sheriff of Herefordshire]] in 1530, and again in 1541.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />  Sir Richard was succeeded by his son, Sir Walter Vaughan (1500\u20131584), who inherited the three estates of Pembrey, Dunraven and Bredwardine. Sir Walter was born at [[Dunraven Castle]], where his parents had decided to live. After his marriage, he moved to Pembrey, and Court Farm was built as a wedding present for him by his father, in about 1530. The Vaughan part of the current building is the main L-shaped section, facing south and east.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Sir Walter was [[High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire]] in 1557 and also a Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />  His son, Sir Thomas Vaughan, inherited the three estates and added to it the Fullerston Estate, in [[Wiltshire]]. Sir Thomas was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1566 and 1570.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Sir Thomas had a son, also called Sir Walter Vaughan,  who inherited the estates but decided to live at Fullerston. He added Caldicot Farm to the estate holdings, in around 1607.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> During this period, Court Farm was occupied by Sir Walter\u2019s nephew, Roland Vaughan, until the next Vaughan heir, Sir Charles Vaughan, was old enough to take possession. Charles was Sir Walter\u2019s son by his first wife. He bought [[Porthaml]] Mansion, near [[Talgarth]] in Breconshire, and Court Farm was then occupied by his son, Sir George Vaughan.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nSir George Vaughan was a fervent [[Royalist]]s and supported [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against [[Oliver Cromwell]], in the [[English Civil War]]. As a consequence, in 1648, Sir George Vaughan was imprisoned by Cromwell for a short time at [[Southwark]] and fined \u00a32,609 for his \"[[Juvenile delinquency|Delinquency]]\". Cromwell is believed to have passed through the [[parish]] of Pembrey in 1648, on his way to [[Ireland]] and his soldiers may have visited Court Farm to charge and apprehend Sir George at that time.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Sir George returned to Court Farm, but the huge fine meant that he had to sell the Dunraven estate, in 1648, and the Fullerston estate, in 1649.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nSir George died without issue and the remaining Pembrey and Porthaml estates passed to his younger brother, the [[Reverend]] Frederick Vaughan, who had been blind from infancy as a result of [[smallpox]]. Frederick Vaughan\u2019s only son, Sir Walter Vaughan, married Alice Bond of Wiltshire, in 1653. They lived, in turn, on both estates and had two children, Bridget and Walter.  The male line of the Vaughans of Pembrey ended when Sir Walter\u2019s son died in his first year.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nAfter the death of Sir Walter Vaughan, Alice Vaughan married William Ball in 1655. He was a lawyer of [[Gray's Inn]] and became High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1682 and died in 1701. They lived, in turn, at the Porthaml and Pembrey estates.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nMany famous people are said to have been entertained at the Court, including the [[Painting|painter]]s [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyke]], [[Peter Lely|Lely]] and [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]], who painted the Vaughan family. Some of these [[portrait]]s can now be seen in [[Carmarthen]] museum.\n\n==Relationship with the Dalton family==\n\nUnder the Vaughans, the Pembrey Estate was administered by agents comprising at least three generations of the \"capable and loyal\" Dalton family.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> It was probably during this period that a number of fireplaces were blocked up. One of Court Farm\u2019s more impressive architectural features comprises seven tall chimneys, made up of five single stacks and two diagonal twin stacks. These reflect a house of substance with many hearths, but the 1672 [[Hearth Tax]] records the house as having only two fireplaces. As an economy measure, many of the original fireplaces were blocked-up in order to avoid paying Hearth Tax at the then substantial rate of two shillings per hearth.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe Dalton family appear to originate from [[Witney]] in [[Oxfordshire]], and some of the family are buried at St. Illtud\u2019s Church, Pembrey, where entries can be found  in the Church\u2019s burial register.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Relationship with the Ashburnhams==\n\nBridget Vaughan married [[John Ashburnham, 1st Earl of Ashburnham]], in 1677 at [[Henry VII's Chapel]], in [[Westminster Abbey]]. She was 17 and he was 21 years old. Thereafter they lived at the family's ancestral mansion, [[Ashburnham Place]], in [[Ashburnham and Penhurst|Ashburnham]], near [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]], [[Sussex]] and made only occasional visits to the other estates.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe Ashburnham family had been settled in Sussex for many generations, taking their name from a village called [[Ashburnham and Penhurst|Ashburnham]] located in the parish of [[Ashburnham and Penhurst]] about {{convert|8|mi|km}} north-west of [[Hastings]]. Like the Vaughan family, the Ashburnham family were fervent [[Royalist]]s. They suffered heavy fines and imprisonment by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s.  After the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the family was given numerous crown leases to compensate for losses under the commonwealth, and the post of [[Groom of the Bedchamber]].<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones, Francis, \"Pembrey Court: An Old Carmarthenshire Manor House, A Tale of Continuity\", The Carmarthenshire Antiquary</ref>\n\nLord John Ashburnham was married 10 years before he saw Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> He noted in his diary, on Sunday, 3 July 1687, that:\n\n<blockquote>\"I saw Pembrey House (Court), which is an old stone house, large enough and kept in pretty good repaire. The land hereabouts is very good.\"</blockquote><ref name=\"Mee\">Mee Arthur, Ed., \"Carmarthenshire Miscellany\", 1892</ref>\n\nIn 1697 the government introduced a [[window tax]] of three shillings per window. In order to reduce the amount of tax payable, the Ashburnham estate arranged for many of Court Farm\u2019s stone and wooden mullion windows to be blocked up. Window tax was [[repeal]]ed in 1851, but the large windows on the west of the house have remained blocked to the present day.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nJohn Ashburnham died at his London residence in Southampton Street, [[Bloomsbury]], on 21 January 1709 aged 44. His eldest son, William, succeeded him as second [[baron]] but died of smallpox on 16 June 1710. The Ashburnham Estates then passed to his brother John, who became third baron. On 14 May 1730, he became Viscount St Asaph of the [[Principality of Wales]] and [[Earl of Ashburnham]]. The family had been elevated in the [[peerage]], because a [[viscount]] is one step above the lowest rank of baron. He died on 10 March 1736\u20137 at the age of 49 and his only son, John, succeeded to the estate as [[John Ashburnham, 2nd Earl of Ashburnham]]. The second Earl died on 8 April 1812 aged 87 and his only son, George Ashburnham, succeeded as [[George Ashburnham, 3rd Earl of Ashburnham]].<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nIn 1813, George Ashburnham took legal action to bar the [[entail]] of his Pembrey Estate so that he could regain the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]]. After that he could [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] the estate, which he did on 15 June 1824, together with his other Carmarthenshire and Breconshire properties. [[Lord Lovaine]] and Robert Vyner, Esq. of [[Gautby]], [[Lincolnshire]] were the [[mortgagee]]s, and the loan was \u00a319,403,4s, 6d.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nGeorge Ashburnham died on 27 October 1830 and his son Bertram became the fourth earl. When visiting the Pembrey Estate George Ashburnham usually stayed at Pembrey House, which the family had built on the slope to the north east of St Illtud's Church, Pembrey, in 1823 and which has since been demolished. The house was occasionally let, with rooms being reserved for family use. However, in the 1891 [[census]], Lord Ashburnham, 5th Earl, is recorded as staying at the Ashburnham Hotel.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Relationship with the Mansel family==\n\nAfter the death of Bridget Vaughan\u2019s stepfather, William Ball, in 1701, Court Farm was leased to Rawleigh Mansel, of [[Llangunnor]] Parish. He was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1679 and, according to The Red Dragon periodical (1886), he went to live at Court Farm:\n\n<blockquote>\u201cthoroughly repairing that old mansion for the purpose, and lived there for three or four years, and died there on 27 November 1702 in his 73rd year\u201d</blockquote>\n\nHis grandson, Rawleigh Dawkin Mansel, who was High Sheriff in 1730, then lived as [[tenant farmer|tenant]] at Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nDuring the tenancy of Rawleigh Dawkin Mansel the house was divided into two separate living sections and accommodated two separate families. Walls were added or removed, several doors and windows were blocked and new ones opened, additional stairs were fitted and at least two attic rooms were added. During this period David Thomas (1738/39-1788) was born at Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nRawleigh Dawkin Mansel was High Sheriff for Carmarthenshire in 1730 and died \u2018under the agonizing pains of the [[Gout]]\u2019 in his 44th year in 1749. Thereafter, Court Farm was home to several Ashburnham agents, [[steward (office)|steward]]s and other estate officials.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nOn Kitchen\u2019s map of 1701 Court Farm is clearly marked as:  \u2018Court, Mansel, Esq.\u2019\n\n==Edward Lluyd\u2019s visit==\n\nIn 1700, [[Edward Lluyd]], a graduate of [[Jesus College, Oxford]], keeper of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, and a noted [[Celts|Celtic]] scholar and antiquary, visited Pembrey Court and reported as follows:-\n\n<blockquote>\u201cPenbre Court, ye Seat formerly of the Butlers and afterwards of the Vaughans, and now belonging (in right of his Lady) to [William] Ball, Esqr, whence it descends to my Ld Ashburnham\u2019s Lady\u2026\u2026\u2026..Diwlais Brook divides this parish from Llan Elhi, springing at Croslaw Mountain and falls into the sea\u2026\u2026\u2026Here are 2 lakes close together called Swan Pool where there are plenty of Eels, and in the Winter store of Fowls such as Ducks and Teal, sometimes wild Swans or Elks and wild Geese. The adjoining one, stored with Turbot, Bret and Sole. They take here a large sort of fish called Friers or Monk fish (in Hereford, Gloucester, and Worcester, whither they carry them, Soucing Fish) about May, June and July. This Pool (or Pools for both may be called one) is called Swan Pool because the Lord of the Manor (Mr Ball) has thereon about 40 Swans. Before the hard frost there were about 80, which all died to 6.\"</blockquote>\n\nSwan Pool was located near Towyn Mawr, and has since been drained. Appropriately, the location is now known as Swan Pool Drain.\n\nA picturesque pond, located near to the house, and close to the Mountain Road, was also drained in about 1937.\n\n==Relationship with the Thomas family==\n\nDavid Thomas was born at Court Farm during the tenancy of the Mansels, when the house was divided into two. He was a gifted, but unqualified, [[bone setter]] from an illustrious family practising bone setting, and is buried in St Illtud's Church, Pembrey.  The Thomas family proved to have other talents, and many vocations. Three generations are listed in the Church's registers as farmers, butchers, shopkeepers, and [[shipowner]]s of vessels that traded from Pembrey, Old Harbour.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nOn 24 July 1843, John Thomas, a farmer, and David Thomas, a shopkeeper, jointly registered a [[brigantine]] of 185 tons burthen known as the \"ELIZA\" at [[Llanelli]]. Its master was John Thomas junior and it traded to [[Liverpool]], [[Malta]], [[Ancona]], [[Venice]] and as far as San Francisco, where the whole crew deserted the ship to join the Californian [[gold rush]]. Consequently, the ship was anchored, with hundreds of others, in San Francisco harbour for several years. She was later sold, along with many other ships, by the [[United States Marshall]].<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nJohn Thomas also owned a [[sloop]] of 29 tons burthen called the \"SEDULOUS\", which was built in [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] and registered at Llanelli on 15 February 1842. Its registry was cancelled on 19 March 1842.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nHugh Thomas, together with some other investors, owned the \"MARGARET JANE\", a vessel built at [[Pwllheli]] in 1850, and whose registry was cancelled on 13 December 1865.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nIn 1831, Mr. Edward Driver, a [[Surveying|surveyor]], made a \"[[Surveying|Survey]] and Valuation of the Manor of Pembrey and Estate\" on behalf of Bertram Ashburham. At this time, Court Farm comprised 194 [[acre]]s plus {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of marshland. The tenant was recorded as John Thomas (later succeeded by his son Hugh) who paid a yearly rent of \u00a388.10s. John Thomas occupied a part of the Mansion, whilst a Mr. T.E. Biederman occupied the other part. Mr. Driver reported as follows:<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n<blockquote>\"One portion of the Old Court House is occupied by Mr. Biederman. The other portion comprises a very good large kitchen, small cellar, old Entrance Hall, a parlour not inhabitable but now undergoing repairs and filling up, and a new staircase has been lately made to lead to two new formed bedrooms. At the back of the House is a range of offices comprising (besides some held by Mr. Biederman) a dairy and a cheese loft. A newly erected cowhouse and stable with slated roof, and enclosed yard. Adjoining the House is a good barn with cowhouse; coach-house at the end, hereafter described, and held by Mr. Biederman; a stock yard with cowhouse, and another barn, slated, and a lean-to carthouse, thatched, at the back\u2026\"</blockquote>\n\nLater in the survey, Mr. Driver wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\u201cPart of the Court House and buildings, heretofore generally used by the Agent, but for the last 3 or 4 years was occupied by his brother and T. E. Biederman. The buildings comprise the old Court House, and was formerly a good residence; it is stone built with slated roof; part has been kept for the accommodation of the Agent to the Estate, and this is now occupied, and has so been for 3 or 4 years by Mr T. E. Biederman, and consists of the large principal room, now subdivided, leaving a good Parlor, a bedroom without a fireplace, and a passage leading to another bedroom; another bedroom, kitchen, and small scullery, and a small bedroom for a servant; a cellar under a part; coalhouse and room over; and a coach-house at the end of the barn; a stable in two divisions for four horses: all the above occupied by Mr. Biederman.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nDuring its early period, Court Farm had a high, open-trussed roof, visible from the floor of the main hall and of an elaborate design, with double roll and hollow moulding. Bredwardine Court and Porthaml Mansion, two other ancestral homes of the Vaughans, have similar surviving roofs.<ref name=\"Poppy\">Vaughan-Poppy, Ithiel, \"The Homes of the Vaughans of Carmarthenshire\", Volume 2, March 1981</ref> However, part of the original roof of Court Farm was lowered and flattened during alterations made during the 19th century, and the carved ornamental detail of the original trussed roof was lost. In addition, the original stone tiles, which needed a more steeply pitching roof, were replaced with Caernarvon slates (as reported in Mr. Driver\u2019s survey), and the roof valleys were finished off with lead flashing.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe 1878 [[Ordnance Survey]] map gives the first known [[ground plan]] of Court Farm, this shows the original Vaughan L-shaped structure, with two wings enclosing a courtyard in the rear. Nearby, on the south side, is the barn. A large enclosed garden is outlined, together with Court Wood, said to have been planted by the Vaughans.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nA [[Tithe]] Schedule and map dated 7 June 1839 shows Court Farm with {{convert|209|acre|km2}}, a slight increase in landholding since the survey of Mr Driver, with Mr. John Thomas still the tenant. The Thomas family were tenants of Court Farm from 1738 to 1902, and most of their baptisms, marriages and burials are recorded in the registers of St Illtyd Church, Pembrey.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nThe Tithe Schedule also includes the names of all the surrounding fields, including Clos Edwin, Wedlanis, Abel Dawnsi, Hunting Knap, and Mumble Head. Two fields, Garreg Lwyd and Maes Graig Lwyd, may have had a religious origin.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n==Industrial activities==\n\nIt was during the ownership of the Pembrey Estate by the Ashburnhams that trial workings for coal were made. These proved to be successful and a number of levels and pits were opened in Coed y Marchog (Knight\u2019s Wood) and Coed Rhial (Royal Wood) on the western slope of Pembrey Mountain.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nManagement of the [[colliery]] was undertaken from an office at Court Farm and the coal was carried by [[packhorse]] to the [[estuary]] of the [[River Gwendraeth]] and to the Burry Inlet, from here it was shipped to the west of England and [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"Morris\">Morris, W., H., \"The Canals of the Gwendraeth Valley\" (Part I), The Carmarthenshire Antiquary</ref>\n\nThe second Earl Ashburnham, impressed by the success of a canal built by [[Thomas Kymer]] in the [[Gwendraeth valley]], decided upon a similar scheme for his Pembrey colliery. [[Kymer\u2019s Canal]] was built between 1766 and 1768 in order to carry coal from pits and levels at [[Pwll y Llygod]] and Great Forest (near [[Carway]]) to a place of shipment on the Lesser Gwendraeth river near Kidwelly.<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\nThe Ashburnham canal ran from the foot of Pembrey Mountain to the Gwendraeth estuary and its aim was to improve the transport of coal from the Pembrey colliery to the sea. The plan initially encountered opposition from [[colliery|collier]]s, whose ponies used to do the job, but by 1796 work on the canal had begun below Coed Farm, close to the Llandyry-Pinged road. By 1799, the canal had extended across the Kidwelly-Pembrey road, near to Saltrock Farm, and by the end of 1801 it had reached the sea at Pill Towyn, a creek running in from the south bank of the Gwendraeth Fawr river. Two shipping places were built on the canal, one of them at Pill Ddu, and the total length of the canal was about two miles (3&nbsp;km). Flat terrain meant that there were no locks, and in 1805 a short branch was constructed towards [[Ffrwd]] when new levels were opened in Coed Rhial. The entrance to Pill Ddu was deepened in 1816 and a [[dry dock]] was added in 1817. By 1818, however, the colliery had become exhausted and the canal became redundant.<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\nIn the returns of Owners of Land in 1873, Bertram Ashburnham is shown as having substantial estates in Wales, with {{convert|5685|acre|km2}} producing an estimated annual rental of \u00a33,547 in Carmarthenshire, and {{convert|1881|acre|km2}} producing an estimated annual rental of \u00a31,963 in Breconshire. In Sussex, the family seat, {{convert|14051|acre|km2}} produced \u00a313,069.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n==Sale of the Ashburnham estate==\n\nBertram Ashburnham died on 22 June 1878 aged 80. His eldest of seven sons, also named Bertram, succeeded as fifth Earl and actively participated in the development of industry in Pembrey. He died in 1913 leaving an only child, Lady Mary Cathleen Charlotte Ashburnham. The title thus passed to his younger brother, Thomas, the sixth and last Earl of Ashburnham, who had married Maria Elizabeth Anderson of [[Fredericton]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]] in 1903.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nGeorge Ashburnham had taken out a mortgage on his Welsh estates in 1824 for \u00a319,403,4s, 6d after he had freed the Welsh properties from entail on certain leases. By 1897 the mortgage debt on the Welsh properties had increased to \u00a387,600, as the loan had not been repaid on its due date. In order to repay the loan, the Porthaml estate was sold in 1913 and the Pembrey estate in 1922. Thomas Ashburnham died without issue on 12 May 1924, leading to the extinction of the Ashburnham title.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nCourt Farm was tenanted by the Thomas family until around 1902. After that, William Bonnell (senior), and his family, were tenants. The house once again became a single dwelling. The Bonnell family farmed Court Farm until August 1922, when the whole of the Ashburnham Estate was sold. The sale was a major local event. The Ashburnhams had, for 245 years, controlled much of Pembrey Parish, and been intimately involved in turning it into a centre of industry. At the auction Mr William Bonnell (senior) purchased Penllwyn Uchaf Farm and thereafter vacated Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nCourt Farm was advertised for sale by [[auction]] on 14 September 1929, subject to tenancy, and plans could be inspected at the [[auctioneer]]'s office or the local butchers. Mr James Butler of [[Treorchy]] bought Court Farm at the auction. The Manor was then let to the family of Mr Sidney Thomas. They remained as tenants after the death of Mr Butler, in 1937, and the purchase of the Manor by Mr Charles Harding from the Links, Pembrey.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nMr Harding bought Pembrey Court as a business proposition. He developed the Garreg Lwyd quarries, located on Court Farm land, as a [[brickworks]], and used material from the quarry for his [[brick]] mixture. The brickwork project failed when the brick making machinery ran into technical difficulties. Probably as a result of these activities, a large front section of the quarry collapsed.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Ownership by the Bonnell family==\n\nIn 1942, Mr Harding sold Court Farm to William Bonnell (junior), who lived at Penllwyn Uchaf farm. However, the Thomas family remained as tenants until about 1948, after which Court Farm was left empty. Mr William Bonnell (Junior) continued to live at Penllwyn Uchaf Farm until his death in January 1962 and during this time Pembrey Court was used for storage. After William Bonnell's death, Court Farm passed to his younger brother, Mr Owen Bonnell.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nDuring the 1970s, Court Farm remained unoccupied and thieves twice stole the [[lead flashing]]s from the roof. After the first theft, Mr Owen Bonnell replaced the lead, but after the second theft he could see little point in replacing it again. It was at this stage that the structure of the house began to deteriorate. Nevertheless, in 1972, he appointed Messrs, Peter Howell and Donald Jones, Architects, of [[Uplands, Swansea]] to apply for grant aid from the Historic Buildings Council. The [[Marquis of Anglesey]] and representatives of the Historic Buildings Council visited Court Farm in order to assess the property for grant aid, but their report to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] pointed out that the property was beyond repair and so a grant was refused.<ref name=\"Feasibility Study\">Court Farm Feasibility Study, 1985, \"Background Information\", section 5</ref>\n\nOwen Bonnell died in January, 1976 and Court Farm was inherited by his nephew, John Bonnell Davies, who was born at Court Farm. He is the present owner and lives in Pembrey.<ref name=\"Feasibility Study\" />\n\n==Community interest in Court Farm==\n\nIn 1972, the possibility of saving Court Farm was first put forward to the former [[Carmarthenshire County Council]], but it was believed that the building had deteriorated too far and would cost an estimated \u00a350,000 to put right. Considerable theft and vandalism left the property in a badly damaged condition, and so a planning application was made by the owners for consent to demolish the building. On 23 October 1980, [[Llanelli Borough Council]] refused the application for the following reasons:\n\n<blockquote>~\t[Court Farm] is a Grade II Listed Building of special architectural and historic interest, which is capable of renovation, rehabilitation and use, which would ensure its future conservation; and</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>~\tin line with national policy, the Borough Council is disposed not to grant consent for the demolition of Listed Buildings which are capable of preservation or conservation.</blockquote><ref name=\"Feasibility Study\" />\n\nDespite the decline in the fortunes of Court Farm, local concern for the building remained strong, as evidenced by the publicity in the local press. The late Mr John Evans, of Erw Terrace, Burry Port, who was a member of [[Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society]], commenced a campaign to save Court Farm and. in August 1981, a Court Farm Committee was established. The Committee requested that the Borough Council place a [[compulsory purchase order]] on the building and plans were formulated to restore it and develop it as a [[museum]], in a \u00a3100,000 project phased over 3 years. Unfortunately, the plans suffered a setback when solicitors representing the owners refused to accept a valuation figure of \u00a34,000 for the {{convert|1.8|acre|m2|adj=on}} site.<ref name=\"WesternMail1\">Western Mail, \"Ex-teacher fights to save Historic farmhouse\", 11 August 1980</ref>\n\nOn 19 October 1984, another application was made to demolish Court Farm, but the application was refused. The refusal notice, issued on 18 July 1985, stated that demolition was considered premature, due to the Borough Architect\u2019s museum feasibility study.<ref name=\"Feasibility Study\" />\n\nBy 14 November 1984, the [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] newspaper was reporting on the proposed 48-hour fast of Mr John Evans. The planned fast was the \"ultimate threat\" if demolition were to come about and \"would be a last resort gesture\".<ref name=\"WesternMail2\">Western Mail, \"Fast plan to save old building\", 13 November 1984</ref>\n\nIn his campaign to save the building, Mr Evans wrote to the former [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Elwyn Jones]] (a native of Llanelli), to the [[Archbishop of Wales]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Llanelli Borough Council, [[Dyfed County Council]], the [[Welsh Office]], the [[Welsh Development Agency]], Members of Parliament, [[Government Minister]]s, various trusts and influential academics.<ref name=\"WesternMail7\">Western Mail, \"Walker urged to save manor house\", 29 June 1987</ref> Letters of support were received from the [[Prince of Wales]], who was reported to be pleased that efforts were being made to save Court Farm, and a letter of support was also received from Professor Sir [[Glanmor Williams]].<ref name=\"WesternMail1\" /><ref name=\"Touchand Go\">Touch and Go, \"Campaign, Some Progress!\", 21 May-17 June 1983</ref>\n\nBy 1985, local concern was such that funding was made available for a feasibility study for the property. [[Cadw]] generously offered a grant of 50% towards the cost of preparation of the study and the balance came from Llanelli Borough Council. The feasibility study concluded that Court Farm was worth retaining on the basis of :-\n\n<blockquote>-\tits uniqueness in the district and probably Wales, particularly in a locality predominantly shaped by the [[Industrial Revolution]];</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>-\tits rich variety of architectural features within a single building;</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>-\tvirtually no examples of medieval or Tudor settlement remain in the district; and</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>-\tthe extent of local interest and concern over the future of the property, which has long formed part of the local history and character of the village of Pembrey.</blockquote><ref name=\"Feasibility Study Chapter 7\">Court Farm Feasbility Study, 1985, \"Deirability of Retention\", chapter 7</ref>\n\nOn 30 August 1985, Llanelli Borough Planning Officer, Mr Clive Davies, stated that the ultimate step of demolition would not be justified until the results of the feasibility study were known. Apart from Mr Evans and Cadw, others who objected to demolition included the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments in Wales, [[Dyfed Archaeological Trust]], Llanelli Civic Society and Pembrey Community Council.<ref name=\"WesternMail4\">Western Mail, \"Fasting threat stays over farm\u2019s future\", 30 August 1985</ref>\n\nIn November 1985, the Reverend W. Roberts of Burry Port wrote to the Western Mail Civic Pride Competition <ref name=\"WesternMail5\">Western Mail, \"Why Court Farm must be saved\", 24 November 1985</ref> arguing for the preservation of Court Farm, and concluded with the following call to action:\n\n<blockquote>\"Summing up, the ancient St. Illtud\u2019s Church remains; the notorious wreck-strewn and beautiful Cefn Sidan Sands remain; the third part of the trinity must also remain. In reality, the neglect of the ancient monument is a local and national scandal. Court Farm must be restored.\"</blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, plans by Llanelli Council to restore Court Farm had stalled because the asking price remained too high.<ref name=\"WesternMail6\">Western Mail, \"Farmhouse museum plan hit by land value clash\", 28 August 1981</ref> On 27 June 1987, Mr John Evans urged the [[Secretary of State for Wales]], Mr [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]], to take over the planned restoration, fearing that otherwise the plans would come to nothing. By this stage, the proposed Court Farm museum was in jeopardy because of plans to develop a Heritage and Tinplate Centre at Kidwelly<ref name=\"WesternMail7\"/> which is now [[Kidwelly Industrial Museum]]. \n \nThe importance of Court Farm was still recognised by Cadw, however, and in July 1987 they agreed to offer a grant to fund restoration at a rate of 60%, which was 10% above the then usual rate. Sadly, Cadw\u2019s offer was not taken up and changes in grant regulations meant that the offer lapsed.<ref name=\"WesternMail8\">Western Mail, \"Ancient mansion may find a new role\", 29 January 1988</ref>\n\nHowever, there was renewed hope when, on 29 January 1988, Llanelli Borough Council announced plans to buy the property in order to develop it as a tourist promotion and information office. Mr George Harris, estate officer for Llanelli Borough Council, stated that the situation of Court Farm would not be suitable as a tourist attraction in itself, but could be used as a base to promote tourist interest in the Llanelli area.<ref name=\"WesternMail8\" />\n\nCourt Farm remains posted as a building at risk on the web site of SAVE Britain\u2019s Heritage<ref name=\"SAVE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.savebritainsheritage.org/|title=Save Britain's Heritage|website=www.savebritainsheritage.org|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> and the posting attracted the interest of [[Cadw Sir Gaerfyrddin]]/Carmarthenshire Building Preservation Trust who obtained funding to conduct a fresh feasibility study, which was completed in 2003 by Davies Sutton Architecture. This architectural firm have successfully restored [[Sker House]], a similar type of building.<ref name=\"CSG\">Davies Sutton Architecture et al, Feasibility Study for Cadw Sir Gaerfyrddin Cyf.: \"Court Farm, Pembrey, Carmarthenshire\", June 2003</ref> This Study was funded with by [[Cadw]] and the [[Architectural Heritage Fund]]. The Study established the intrinsic value of Court Farm and looked at all the options for saving the building. The Study established that the building represented an important historical resource and could be saved for a new beneficial use, with repair retaining a flexible layout, allowing fitting-out for an optimum end use. The [[structural engineer]]\u2019s report, prepared by Mann Williams Consulting Civil and Structural Engineers of [[Cardiff]] collateral to the Study provided a structural assessment and report on the basis of an inspection carried out during February 2003. This stated that \"the main walls remain reasonably plumb and stable when considering the extensive period of neglect. Replacement of floors and roof structures will reinstate the necessary support to the walls and provide a significant improvement to stability.\" <ref name=\"CSG\" />\n\n==Relationship with the sea==\n\nCourt Farm has a panoramic view of [[Carmarthen Bay]] and is the only surviving [[Elizabethan]] manor house in Carmarthenshire.  Before the construction of [[Whiteford Lighthouse]], Court Farm and St Illtud's Church, Pembrey formed two of the few prominent local landmarks in the Pembrey area and so became important navigational aides. It is the seven \"towering chimneys\" that made Court Farm such a landmark, and both the Manor and Church are clearly marked on William Jones of Loughor\u2019s \u2018Plan or Directions for Ships to Come Safe into Burry and to Several Places of Safety to be within the Same\u2019, made in 1757.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe Burry Inlet has always been a notoriously difficult place to navigate, due to the quickly changing course of the river and shifting sand banks. Ships crossing the Burry Bar, which is roughly on a line drawn from [[Burry Holms]] on [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]] to [[Tywyn Sands]] or Cornel Mawr, near Pembrey, were crossing a treacherous area. Charts indicate that the contours of the estuary are constantly changing. As an example, in 1764 [[John Wesley]] crossed the Burry Inlet on horseback from Pembrey on his way to [[Oxwich]], in Gower. Today, such a crossing would not be possible.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nIn the 17th century, Sir Walter Vaughan, conceived a life saving sea rescue scheme, and as local Member of Parliament, enthusiastically tried to get the Government to take-up his plans, to no avail.\n\n==Wrecking rights and maritime enterprises==\n\nThe Butlers had been granted rights to all wrecks found on the Cefn Sidan sands, and so for centuries the [[Lord of the Manor]] of Pembrey had rights and privileges over the disposal of wrecks found along the coast.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n[[Cefn Sidan]] was frequently the graveyard of many unsuspecting vessels, whose victims were buried in the grounds of Pembrey Church, including a relative of [[Napoleon]]'s Josephine. Entries in the Pembrey Church registers record numerous burials of passengers and crew. The demand for coal, in the 19th century, led to a big increase in the number of wrecks along the coast.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nDespite this close connection with the sea, when King Charles I asked Sir Walter Vaughan if he could supply the Crown with a ship of 30 tons, Sir Walter avoided the issue by claiming that Carmarthenshire was an inland county with only a few [[stream|creek]]s. However, this did not prevent Sir Walter from acquiring possession of at least two ships at auction, after mishaps led to them running aground at Pembrey. One of these was of 60 tons burthen and known as \"DOROTHY\". She was registered at Burry and leased for a voyage from [[Laugharne]] to [[Chester]], with a cargo of salt. The other ship was the vessel \"HOPE\", she was registered at [[Harborough]], but was driven by a storm into the North Burry Road in June 1631, damaging the cargo of salt and leading to the desertion of the vessel by her crew. Sir Walter acquired possession of both vessels and cargoes and later assigned them to a [[Plymouth]] merchant for \u00a3500.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Manorial dispute==\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, uncertainty had arisen as to the exact area to which the Lord Ashburnham, at that time, the Lord of the Manor of Pembrey, and [[Lord Cawdor]], Lord of Kidwelly held rights. Both agreed that their agents and their legal advisers should be allowed to investigate their claims, and depositions were taken from a number of older local men, who indicated that uncertainties about the rights had set in during the 17th century.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nThe statements of Lord Ashburnham sought to claim that Lord Ashburnham\u2019s tenants had always exercised their right to take any wreck or articles found on the shore to a recognised storage place, or even to Court Farm itself. The [[salvor]]s were then granted a sum of money to cover the \"salvage and expenses\". It may be that such articles were stored in the barn at Court Farm. The following are two examples of the many depositions that were made in favour of the Ashburnham estate:\n\n<blockquote>''\u201c1663, 8th day of June, John William Arnold, yeoman of Pembrey, aged 75, Sworn and Examined before the Court of the Steward\u2026\u201d he had always assumed that he had the right to claim any material from the wrecks on behalf of the \u201cLordship of Ashburnham until now and of late.\u201d''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201c1664, 14th day of July, David William John, village of Pembrey, yeoman, four score years, Sworn and Examined before the Court of the Steward\u2026did lay claim, title unto any of the wreck or materials that happened to be cast up by the sea upon any of the lands within the Lordship of Pembrey by Permission of the Lord of the Manor and his agents.\u201d''</blockquote>\n\nBy 1830 the dispute had been settled amicably, without a court case, and the agreement allowed Lord Ashburnham to maintain his ancient manorial rights over the Pembrey foreshore, and Lord Cawdor to maintain his rights over the Kidwelly foreshore. The agreement document stated:\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cThe right of wreck upon this immediate part of the coast (Caldecott) seems not to have been distinctly exercised within living memory of man, but whenever a ship has been stranded, large parties come down from the Country, some joining the tenantry of Lord Ashburnham, and others the tenantry of Lord Cawdor, and whichever proved the stronger party took the greater share of the Prey.\u201d''</blockquote><ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n==Proceeds and sale of wrecks==\n\nCargo from wrecked vessels was sometimes carried in carts to farms owned by Lord Ashburnham and, when the owner made a claim on the property, Lord Ashburnham\u2019s agent would charge a [[salvage fee]]. The following are examples of wrecks claimed by Lord Ashburnham and listed in the 1830 agreement document:\n\n<blockquote>''1763\tReceived balance left unpaid of Wine (salvaged) sold this year, 8s. 10d. For salvage of the tobacco ship that came ashore at Pembrey, 5gns. For timber that came ashore at Pembrey, \u00a31. 10. 0.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1764\tFor \u2018uldge\u2019 cast with a small supply of rum in it that came on shore \u00a34. 10. 0.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1766\tCaldecott: received for a boat taken up at Towin (in Caldecott) afterwards claimed on oath by Capt. Jones of Carmarthen, 1d.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1768\tCaldecott: received the profit of 4 casks of wine, sold by auction at Towin on 15th March 1768, \u00a317. 4. 0.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1770\tReceived for the salvage of a Dutch vessel, stranded on the fee farm at Caldecott, 5gns. Received for a hogshead of claret, \u00a34. 18. 0, but deducted 5s. for carriage of it from the sand of Towin.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1776\tReceived of Mr. Griffith the Collector of Customs at Llanelly, the produce of the tobacco of the ship \u201cPOMPEY\u201d, thrown on Pembrey Manor in February 1773, \u00a383. 4. 0.''</blockquote>\n\nThere are also occasional accounts in Ashburnham documents of sales of wreck found on the Pembrey sands:\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cAccount of wreck sold by William Davies for the Right Honourable the Earl of Ashburnham \u2013 collected from Pembrey Manor (The Court).</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''September 1804\tTo piece of elm, timber sold, being 8 cwts. and a half at 2s. 0.     17s 0''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''August 1805\t\tTo an old cannon sold to Mr Morgan at 4 @ 2/6\t\t    10s 0''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''Received from Steven Jones for use of the storeroom at Court to put the late wreck\t      \t\t\t            \u00a31.  1s. 0''</blockquote><ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nEventually, all wrecks became the sole responsibility of the Receiver of Wrecks and Droits and it was his prerogative to dispose of a wreck, and its cargo, by auction, or any other suitable means. By this time, all ships from the Pembrey area were registered with the Register of British Ships at the port of Llanelli, and each ship was issued with a [[certificate of registry]] and details of the vessel were entered in the Register.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Looting==\n\nThere were reputed to be many wreckers in the Pembrey area. \"Mat of the Iron Hand\", who had lost a hand and boasted an iron hook, used to tie lanterns to the sheep grazing on the headlands during a winter storm to draw vessels into shore. One day, these false lights lured a ship onto the rocks before Sir Walter Vaughan could get the boats of his sea rescue crew out to save them. It was said that Mat's custom was to kill all survivors, so that there could be no witnesses. One swimmer that he allegedly despatched turned out to be John Walter Vaughan, the eldest son of Sir Walter Vaughan. As Mat had been imprisoned, over the years by, Sir Walter, he took his revenge by cutting off the young man's hand. As he did so, he noticed that he was wearing a gold signet ring with the well-known Vaughan crest of the three boys' snake-entwined heads, given to John Walter on attaining his majority. This was the private seal of the family. Mat was subsequently hanged.\n\n==Manorial hedgerows and woodland==\n\nIn 1979 a group of Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society members carried out some hedge counting on Court Farm land. This involves counting the number of different tree species in alternate 30m lengths of [[hedgerow]]. Each species in the hedge approximates to one hundred years.<ref name=\"Hedges\">\"Hedges and landscape history - Pembrey Court\", The Carmarthenshire Antiquary</ref>\n\nA narrow strip of land near the Court, known as the \"Narrow Yard\" (Llathed Fain, in Welsh) was traditionally granted, or leased, by the Lord of the Manor to a favoured [[yeoman]], who quickly delineated his property with a surrounding hedge. At Court Farm, the field shapes do suggest enclosure of former \"strips\" or \"lands\" in an open field system. The Antiquarian Society found that, on average, there were five tree species per hedge, indicating an early 16th-century enclosure from open fields.<ref name=\"Hedges\" />\n\nMost of the survey effort was concentrated here, and in the Kidwelly area, because of the amount of medieval, and later, documentation available for this area, which can act as a \"control\" check for dates obtained from species counting. The constituent manors of local lordships are described in a 1609 Survey. This covers different soils, field types, settlement patterns and tenurial customs of the Welshries and Englishries. Dr. Max Hooper, of the [[Nature Conservancy]], pioneered this system of calculation from English hedgerows, whose antiquity was attested by similar documents, such as hedged parts of [[Anglo-Saxon]] estate boundaries delineated in the charters, medieval \"assarts\" or clearances in the forest or waste registered in the [[Court Roll]]s, etc. The equation between age and number of species present is due to the relative abundance of [[colonizing]] species in the immediate vicinity, and the rate at which some species can colonize existing hedges, whether planted or made by clearing woodland either side of them.<ref name=\"Hedges\" />\n \nDuring the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a large number of [[oak]] trees were planted on the eastern slope below Garreg Llwyd Quarry. In early times the oak tree was sacred to the [[Druid]]s, and in 1842 a newspaper reported that \"A grand Druidic procession took place in Pembrey\", although it is not clear if there is any link to the wood.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nDuring the early 19th century, women were employed in the area to strip the bark of the oak trees, which was sent to the nearest [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]], where tannin was extracted from the bark and used in [[leather]] production.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Relationship to St Illtud's Church, Pembrey==\n\nFanciful claims have been made that a tunnel connected Court Farm with the nearby St Illtud's Church.\n \nCourt Farm used to have a large and heavy stone bowl, filled by spring water, in its grounds, which was used to water cattle for almost a hundred years by Court Farm\u2019s tenant farmers. This was believed to be the \"lost\" Norman font bowl of the Church, and subsequently, the bowl was moved to the Lady Chapel of the Church in 1933, where it still remains.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Antiquarian interest in Court Farm==\n\nInterest in Court Farm goes back over a number of decades. On the afternoon of Saturday, 12 September 1970 the Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society held its final Field Day of the 1970 season, when a visit was made to the Pembrey area. The seventy members were conducted by Mr W.H. Morris of Kidwelly and Mr Brynmor Voyle of Llanelli. After assembling at [[Trimsaran]], the party proceeded to a point on Pembrey Mountain where they paused to admire a panoramic view of Carmarthen Bay.  At Court Farm Mr. Brynmor Voyle outlined the main architectural and historical features of the mansion, including its single hall-type structure. Members were, unfortunately, unable to inspect the inside of the house. The castellated barn structure in front of the mansion aroused a great deal of interest.<ref name=\"FieldDay\">\"Field Day - Pembrey\", The Carmarthensjire Antiquary</ref>\n\nAt St. Illtud's Church, the Reverend T.A. Jones welcomed the party and made special mention of \"Butler's Window\" and the [[hagioscope]], the opening in the church tower through which lepers viewed the consecration of the bread and wine at the altar. Members then inspected the [[parish register]]s, dating from 1700 and the memorial to families such as Rees of [[Cilymaenllwyd]], Mansel of [[Stradey]], Vaughan of Trimsaran, Thompson of [[Glyn Abbey]] and Wedge of [[Goodig]].<ref name=\"FieldDay\" />\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n{{coord|51.6911|-4.2761|type:landmark_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Houses in Carmarthenshire]]\n[[Category:Manor houses in Wales]]\n[[Category:Ruins in Wales]]\n[[Category:Burry Port]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n[[File:CourtFarm,Pembrey3.JPG|thumb|300px|The barn at Court Farm, Pembrey]]\n'''Court Farm''' in [[Pembrey]], [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Wales]], is an ancient and formerly imposing [[manor house]] which is now an overgrown [[ruin]], but structurally sound, and capable of repair and [[Building restoration|restoration]]. It consists of three buildings: the farmhouse, a complex two-storey house of approximately 99 square metres; an adjacent barn; and a later cowshed.\n\n==Construction==\n\nThe present farmhouse is 16th century, with an earlier [[medieval]] core, and may have been a [[tower]] house, a form more associated with [[Pembrokeshire]]. It is built from local [[sandstone]] quarried from a [[quarry]] located in its own land, known as Garreg Llwyd Quarry.\nCourt Farm has a line of [[corbels]] on the south facing walls which are a particular feature of old [[Carmarthenshire]] buildings and, because of its size and visible location it was, together with the nearby [[St. Illtud's Church, Pembrey]], used a navigational point on local shipping charts to help captains of vessels navigate the treacherous [[Burry Inlet]].\n\nOriginally, there were seven square [[chimney]]s, two of which were unusually set [[diagonally]] in the chimney breast in the east wall. It appears that every room had a fireplace, yet the 1672 [[hearth tax]] lists the Court as only having two fireplaces, probably to avoid paying tax of two [[shillings]]. Similarly, many of the early windows were blocked up to avoid paying the half-yearly [[window tax]] of 3 shillings. One room retained its [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] [[panelling]] until Court Farm was abandoned in around 1948.\n\nCourt Farm has an interesting large [[barn]], with a defensive military appearance, due its [[embattled]] [[parapet]] on the south [[elevation]]. It is not known if the barn had a defensive function of any kind, although it could be part of a more  extensive [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. The Pembrey area was \"frontier land\" in [[Medieval]] times, lying between the [[Norman people|Norman]] occupied areas of the east, and the [[Wales|Welsh]] kingdom, north-west of [[Kidwelly]], which continued to attack the Norman strongholds.\n\n==Ownership by the Le Botelers==\n\nEvidence suggests that the Le Boteler family were the first to occupy a manor on the site of the present Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\">Nicholson, J., A., Pembrey and Burry Port, published by Llanelli Borough Council</ref>\n\n[[Maurice de Londres]] granted the Manor of Pembrey to Sir John Butler of [[Dunraven, Wales|Dunraven]] in 1128.<ref name=\"Roberts, Pertwee\">Roberts, E., & Pertwee, H., A., \"St. Illtyd\u2019s Church, Pembrey\", published 1898</ref> Maurice de Londres was the son of [[William de Londres]], who was a knight to [[Robert Fitzhamon]], a [[Norman people|Norman]] [[baron]] from [[Gloucestershire]].\n\nFitzhamon invaded [[Wales]] between 1091 and 1093, established himself as Lord of [[Glamorgan]] and built [[Cardiff Castle]]. The [[knight]]s protecting his castle included William de Londres. As a reward for his services, Fitzhamon gave William the lordship of Ogmore. William went on to help Roger, [[Bishop of Salisbury]], defend his [[lordship]] at [[Kidwelly]] from attacks by the adjacent Welsh [[monarchy|kingdom]] of [[Deheubarth]]. On one of his expeditions to Kidwelly, the inhabitants of Glamorgan attacked [[Ogmore Castle]]. William\u2019s butler, called Arnold, successfully repulsed the attack and was rewarded with the castle and manor of Dunraven. To mark his loyalty, Arnold called himself  [[Arnold le Boteler]]; the Norman word for butler is Le Boteler, or Boteler. The family [[surname]] was later [[anglicized]] to Butler.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nMaurice de Londres succeeded to the lordship of Ogmore, upon the death of his father, William, in 1126. In 1128, Maurice also became Lord of Kidwelly when Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, returned his lordship to [[The Crown]], having found it too difficult to protect from the attacks of Deheubarth. The Crown then gave the lordship to Maurice. In the same year, Maurice granted the Manor of Pembrey to Arnold Butler\u2019s son, Sir John Butler, whose male line of issue included seven generations, most of them named John Butler.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The line became extinct when Arnold Butler, of Pembrey and Dunraven, died without issue. Arnold\u2019s sister, Ann Butler, then inherited both estates.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe [[Manorialism|manor]] of Pembrey was held under military [[tenure]] under the Lordship of Kidwelly.<ref name=\"Lancaster\">Duchy of Lancaster Records, 43/12</ref> The occupation of the Manor of Pembrey required each Butler occupant, in time of war, to provide five [[archery|archer]]s \"according to ancient custom\" to help the Lord of Kidwelly within the limits of the land under his control.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The Butlers also had to order one [[knight]] to attend the \"Court of Foreignry of Kidwelly\", which was held every month.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Each Butler [[heir]] also had an obligation to pay a sum of money to the Lord of Kidwelly of ten [[shilling]]s,<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> to give a day\u2019s ploughing and to help with the [[hay]] for one day.<ref name=\"NLW\">Ashburnham Document Collection N 297, [[National Library of Wales]]</ref>\n\nOne of the woods that originally lay on the manorial land of Court Farm is known as Coed Marchog (Knight's Wood, in the [[English language]]), it lies on the eastern side of the Pembrey to [[Pinged]] Road, below Garreg Lwyd.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe Butler's [[coat of arms]] appears in Pembrey Church. Its [[heraldic device]] is [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], three cups covered, [[or (heraldry)]].<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The Butler [[coat of arms]] can be found in the south east window of the [[nave]] of St Illtud\u2019s Church, Pembrey.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> A [[monument]] and [[altar]]-[[tomb]] of Sir John le Boteler, of circa 1250, can be found at [[St Brides Major]] church<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n   \nIn addition to the land surrounding Court Farm, the Butlers also controlled the vast area of flatlands known as [[Pembrey Burrows]], or the Warren, and the greater part of Pinged Marsh, which is now part of [[Pembrey Country Park]].<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The Butlers were granted rights to all wrecks found on the [[Cefn Sidan]] sands as far as [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]] Point or [[Tywyn Point]]<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe original [[caput]] of the Manor of Pembrey was probably the mound [[castle]] now called \u2018the Twmpath\u2019, which is located about a mile and a half to the north-east of [[Burry Port]] Station. This [[tumulus]] is {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter, with a [[ditch]] of about {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide and about {{convert|5|ft|m}} deep surrounding it. The Twmpath has extensive views, but at some stage it became inconvenient and the caput of the Manor was relocated to the site of the present location of Court Farm.<ref name=\"RCAHMW\">[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]], National Monuments Record</ref>\n\n==Ownership by the Vaughans==\n\nAnn Butler was the last of the Pembrey Butlers. She married Sir Richard Vaughan of [[Bredwardine]], in [[Herefordshire]],<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> the Court Farm and Dunraven estates then became part of the Vaughan family estates.\n\nThe Vaughans claimed to be direct descendants of the Welsh king Moreiddig Warwyn of [[Breconshire]] and north Carmarthenshire.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> The family has an unusual coat of arms: three boys' heads with snakes coupled around their necks. This is based on a family legend. When the pregnant mother of Moreiddig Warwyn (Warwyn means \"fair neck\" in Welsh) was resting in the garden, she was frightened by an [[Vipera berus|adder]]. Moreiddig was born with a mark, resembling the bite of the adder, on his neck.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nSir Richard Vaughan was born in 1460 and was knighted at [[Tournai]], in 1513. He became [[High sheriff of Herefordshire]] in 1530, and again in 1541.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />  Sir Richard was succeeded by his son, Sir Walter Vaughan (1500\u20131584), who inherited the three estates of Pembrey, Dunraven and Bredwardine. Sir Walter was born at [[Dunraven Castle]], where his parents had decided to live. After his marriage, he moved to Pembrey, and Court Farm was built as a wedding present for him by his father, in about 1530. The Vaughan part of the current building is the main L-shaped section, facing south and east.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Sir Walter was [[High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire]] in 1557 and also a Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />  His son, Sir Thomas Vaughan, inherited the three estates and added to it the Fullerston Estate, in [[Wiltshire]]. Sir Thomas was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1566 and 1570.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Sir Thomas had a son, also called Sir Walter Vaughan,  who inherited the estates but decided to live at Fullerston. He added Caldicot Farm to the estate holdings, in around 1607.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> During this period, Court Farm was occupied by Sir Walter\u2019s nephew, Roland Vaughan, until the next Vaughan heir, Sir Charles Vaughan, was old enough to take possession. Charles was Sir Walter\u2019s son by his first wife. He bought [[Porthaml]] Mansion, near [[Talgarth]] in Breconshire, and Court Farm was then occupied by his son, Sir George Vaughan.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nSir George Vaughan was a fervent [[Royalist]]s and supported [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against [[Oliver Cromwell]], in the [[English Civil War]]. As a consequence, in 1648, Sir George Vaughan was imprisoned by Cromwell for a short time at [[Southwark]] and fined \u00a32,609 for his \"[[Juvenile delinquency|Delinquency]]\". Cromwell is believed to have passed through the [[parish]] of Pembrey in 1648, on his way to [[Ireland]] and his soldiers may have visited Court Farm to charge and apprehend Sir George at that time.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Sir George returned to Court Farm, but the huge fine meant that he had to sell the Dunraven estate, in 1648, and the Fullerston estate, in 1649.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nSir George died without issue and the remaining Pembrey and Porthaml estates passed to his younger brother, the [[Reverend]] Frederick Vaughan, who had been blind from infancy as a result of [[smallpox]]. Frederick Vaughan\u2019s only son, Sir Walter Vaughan, married Alice Bond of Wiltshire, in 1653. They lived, in turn, on both estates and had two children, Bridget and Walter.  The male line of the Vaughans of Pembrey ended when Sir Walter\u2019s son died in his first year.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nAfter the death of Sir Walter Vaughan, Alice Vaughan married William Ball in 1655. He was a lawyer of [[Gray's Inn]] and became High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1682 and died in 1701. They lived, in turn, at the Porthaml and Pembrey estates.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nMany famous people are said to have been entertained at the Court, including the [[Painting|painter]]s [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyke]], [[Peter Lely|Lely]] and [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]], who painted the Vaughan family. Some of these [[portrait]]s can now be seen in [[Carmarthen]] museum.\n\n==Relationship with the Dalton family==\n\nUnder the Vaughans, the Pembrey Estate was administered by agents comprising at least three generations of the \"capable and loyal\" Dalton family.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> It was probably during this period that a number of fireplaces were blocked up. One of Court Farm\u2019s more impressive architectural features comprises seven tall chimneys, made up of five single stacks and two diagonal twin stacks. These reflect a house of substance with many hearths, but the 1672 [[Hearth Tax]] records the house as having only two fireplaces. As an economy measure, many of the original fireplaces were blocked-up in order to avoid paying Hearth Tax at the then substantial rate of two shillings per hearth.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe Dalton family appear to originate from [[Witney]] in [[Oxfordshire]], and some of the family are buried at St. Illtud\u2019s Church, Pembrey, where entries can be found  in the Church\u2019s burial register.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Relationship with the Ashburnhams==\n\nBridget Vaughan married [[John Ashburnham, 1st Earl of Ashburnham]], in 1677 at [[Henry VII's Chapel]], in [[Westminster Abbey]]. She was 17 and he was 21 years old. Thereafter they lived at the family's ancestral mansion, [[Ashburnham Place]], in [[Ashburnham and Penhurst|Ashburnham]], near [[Battle]], [[Sussex]] and made only occasional visits to the other estates.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe Ashburnham family had been settled in Sussex for many generations, taking their name from a village called [[Ashburnham and Penhurst|Ashburnham]] located in the parish of [[Ashburnham and Penhurst]] about {{convert|8|mi|km}} north-west of [[Hastings]]. Like the Vaughan family, the Ashburnham family were fervent [[Royalist]]s. They suffered heavy fines and imprisonment by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s.  After the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the family was given numerous crown leases to compensate for losses under the commonwealth, and the post of [[Groom of the Bedchamber]].<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones, Francis, \"Pembrey Court: An Old Carmarthenshire Manor House, A Tale of Continuity\", The Carmarthenshire Antiquary</ref>\n\nLord John Ashburnham was married 10 years before he saw Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> He noted in his diary, on Sunday, 3 July 1687, that:\n\n<blockquote>\"I saw Pembrey House (Court), which is an old stone house, large enough and kept in pretty good repaire. The land hereabouts is very good.\"</blockquote><ref name=\"Mee\">Mee Arthur, Ed., \"Carmarthenshire Miscellany\", 1892</ref>\n\nIn 1697 the government introduced a [[window tax]] of three shillings per window. In order to reduce the amount of tax payable, the Ashburnham estate arranged for many of Court Farm\u2019s stone and wooden mullion windows to be blocked up. Window tax was [[repeal]]ed in 1851, but the large windows on the west of the house have remained blocked to the present day.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nJohn Ashburnham died at his London residence in Southampton Street, [[Bloomsbury]], on 21 January 1709 aged 44. His eldest son, William, succeeded him as second [[baron]] but died of smallpox on 16 June 1710. The Ashburnham Estates then passed to his brother John, who became third baron. On 14 May 1730, he became Viscount St Asaph of the [[Principality of Wales]] and [[Earl of Ashburnham]]. The family had been elevated in the [[peerage]], because a [[viscount]] is one step above the lowest rank of baron. He died on 10 March 1736-7 at the age of 49 and his only son, John, succeeded to the estate as [[John Ashburnham, 2nd Earl of Ashburnham]]. The second Earl died on 8 April 1812 aged 87 and his only son, George Ashburnham, succeeded as [[George Ashburnham, 3rd Earl of Ashburnham]].<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nIn 1813, George Ashburnham took legal action to bar the [[entail]] of his Pembrey Estate so that he could regain the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]]. After that he could [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] the estate, which he did on 15 June 1824, together with his other Carmarthenshire and Breconshire properties. [[Lord Lovaine]] and Robert Vyner, Esq. of [[Gautby]], [[Lincolnshire]] were the [[mortgagee]]s, and the loan was \u00a319,403,4s, 6d.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nGeorge Ashburnham died on 27 October 1830 and his son Bertram became the fourth earl. When visiting the Pembrey Estate George Ashburnham usually stayed at Pembrey House, which the family had built on the slope to the north east of St Illtud's Church, Pembrey, in 1823 and which has since been demolished. The house was occasionally let, with rooms being reserved for family use. However, in the 1891 [[census]], Lord Ashburnham, 5th Earl, is recorded as staying at the Ashburnham Hotel.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Relationship with the Mansel family==\n\nAfter the death of Bridget Vaughan\u2019s stepfather, William Ball, in 1701, Court Farm was leased to Rawleigh Mansel, of [[Llangunnor]] Parish. He was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1679 and, according to The Red Dragon periodical (1886), he went to live at Court Farm:\n\n<blockquote>\u201cthoroughly repairing that old mansion for the purpose, and lived there for three or four years, and died there on 27 November 1702 in his 73rd year\u201d</blockquote>\n\nHis grandson, Rawleigh Dawkin Mansel, who was High Sheriff in 1730, then lived as [[tenant farmer|tenant]] at Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nDuring the tenancy of Rawleigh Dawkin Mansel the house was divided into two separate living sections and accommodated two separate families. Walls were added or removed, several doors and windows were blocked and new ones opened, additional stairs were fitted and at least two attic rooms were added. During this period David Thomas (1738/39-1788) was born at Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nRawleigh Dawkin Mansel was High Sheriff for Carmarthenshire in 1730 and died \u2018under the agonizing pains of the [[Gout]]\u2019 in his 44th year in 1749. Thereafter, Court Farm was home to several Ashburnham agents, [[steward (office)|steward]]s and other estate officials.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nOn Kitchen\u2019s map of 1701 Court Farm is clearly marked as:  \u2018Court, Mansel, Esq.\u2019\n\n==Edward Lluyd\u2019s visit==\n\nIn 1700, [[Edward Lluyd]], a graduate of [[Jesus College, Oxford]], keeper of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, and a noted [[Celts|Celtic]] scholar and antiquary, visited Pembrey Court and reported as follows:-\n\n<blockquote>\u201cPenbre Court, ye Seat formerly of the Butlers and afterwards of the Vaughans, and now belonging (in right of his Lady) to [William] Ball, Esqr, whence it descends to my Ld Ashburnham\u2019s Lady\u2026\u2026\u2026..Diwlais Brook divides this parish from Llan Elhi, springing at Croslaw Mountain and falls into the sea\u2026\u2026\u2026Here are 2 lakes close together called Swan Pool where there are plenty of Eels, and in the Winter store of Fowls such as Ducks and Teal, sometimes wild Swans or Elks and wild Geese. The adjoining one, stored with Turbot, Bret and Sole. They take here a large sort of fish called Friers or Monk fish (in Hereford, Gloucester, and Worcester, whither they carry them, Soucing Fish) about May, June and July. This Pool (or Pools for both may be called one) is called Swan Pool because the Lord of the Manor (Mr Ball) has thereon about 40 Swans. Before the hard frost there were about 80, which all died to 6.\"</blockquote>\n\nSwan Pool was located near Towyn Mawr, and has since been drained. Appropriately, the location is now known as Swan Pool Drain.\n\nA picturesque pond, located near to the house, and close to the Mountain Road, was also drained in about 1937.\n\n==Relationship with the Thomas family==\n\nDavid Thomas was born at Court Farm during the tenancy of the Mansels, when the house was divided into two. He was a gifted, but unqualified, [[bone setter]] from an illustrious family practising bone setting, and is buried in St Illtud's Church, Pembrey.  The Thomas family proved to have other talents, and many vocations. Three generations are listed in the Church's registers as farmers, butchers, shopkeepers, and [[shipowner]]s of vessels that traded from Pembrey, Old Harbour.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nOn 24 July 1843, John Thomas, a farmer, and David Thomas, a shopkeeper, jointly registered a [[brigantine]] of 185 tons burthen known as the \"ELIZA\" at [[Llanelli]]. Its master was John Thomas junior and it traded to [[Liverpool]], [[Malta]], [[Ancona]], [[Venice]] and as far as San Francisco, where the whole crew deserted the ship to join the Californian [[gold rush]]. Consequently, the ship was anchored, with hundreds of others, in San Francisco harbour for several years. She was later sold, along with many other ships, by the [[United States Marshall]].<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nJohn Thomas also owned a [[sloop]] of 29 tons burthen called the \"SEDULOUS\", which was built in [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] and registered at Llanelli on 15 February 1842. Its registry was cancelled on 19 March 1842.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nHugh Thomas, together with some other investors, owned the \"MARGARET JANE\", a vessel built at [[Pwllheli]] in 1850, and whose registry was cancelled on 13 December 1865.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nIn 1831, Mr. Edward Driver, a [[Surveying|surveyor]], made a \"[[Surveying|Survey]] and Valuation of the Manor of Pembrey and Estate\" on behalf of Bertram Ashburham. At this time, Court Farm comprised 194 [[acre]]s plus {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of marshland. The tenant was recorded as John Thomas (later succeeded by his son Hugh) who paid a yearly rent of \u00a388.10s. John Thomas occupied a part of the Mansion, whilst a Mr. T.E. Biederman occupied the other part. Mr. Driver reported as follows:<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n<blockquote>\"One portion of the Old Court House is occupied by Mr. Biederman. The other portion comprises a very good large kitchen, small cellar, old Entrance Hall, a parlour not inhabitable but now undergoing repairs and filling up, and a new staircase has been lately made to lead to two new formed bedrooms. At the back of the House is a range of offices comprising (besides some held by Mr. Biederman) a dairy and a cheese loft. A newly erected cowhouse and stable with slated roof, and enclosed yard. Adjoining the House is a good barn with cowhouse; coach-house at the end, hereafter described, and held by Mr. Biederman; a stock yard with cowhouse, and another barn, slated, and a lean-to carthouse, thatched, at the back\u2026\"</blockquote>\n\nLater in the survey, Mr. Driver wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\u201cPart of the Court House and buildings, heretofore generally used by the Agent, but for the last 3 or 4 years was occupied by his brother and T. E. Biederman. The buildings comprise the old Court House, and was formerly a good residence; it is stone built with slated roof; part has been kept for the accommodation of the Agent to the Estate, and this is now occupied, and has so been for 3 or 4 years by Mr T. E. Biederman, and consists of the large principal room, now subdivided, leaving a good Parlor, a bedroom without a fireplace, and a passage leading to another bedroom; another bedroom, kitchen, and small scullery, and a small bedroom for a servant; a cellar under a part; coalhouse and room over; and a coach-house at the end of the barn; a stable in two divisions for four horses: all the above occupied by Mr. Biederman.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nDuring its early period, Court Farm had a high, open-trussed roof, visible from the floor of the main hall and of an elaborate design, with double roll and hollow moulding. Bredwardine Court and Porthaml Mansion, two other ancestral homes of the Vaughans, have similar surviving roofs.<ref name=\"Poppy\">Vaughan-Poppy, Ithiel, \"The Homes of the Vaughans of Carmarthenshire\", Volume 2, March 1981</ref> However, part of the original roof of Court Farm was lowered and flattened during alterations made during the 19th century, and the carved ornamental detail of the original trussed roof was lost. In addition, the original stone tiles, which needed a more steeply pitching roof, were replaced with Caernarvon slates (as reported in Mr. Driver\u2019s survey), and the roof valleys were finished off with lead flashing.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe 1878 [[Ordnance Survey]] map gives the first known [[ground plan]] of Court Farm, this shows the original Vaughan L-shaped structure, with two wings enclosing a courtyard in the rear. Nearby, on the south side, is the barn. A large enclosed garden is outlined, together with Court Wood, said to have been planted by the Vaughans.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nA [[Tithe]] Schedule and map dated 7 June 1839 shows Court Farm with {{convert|209|acre|km2}}, a slight increase in landholding since the survey of Mr Driver, with Mr. John Thomas still the tenant. The Thomas family were tenants of Court Farm from 1738 to 1902, and most of their baptisms, marriages and burials are recorded in the registers of St Illtyd Church, Pembrey.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nThe Tithe Schedule also includes the names of all the surrounding fields, including Clos Edwin, Wedlanis, Abel Dawnsi, Hunting Knap, and Mumble Head. Two fields, Garreg Lwyd and Maes Graig Lwyd, may have had a religious origin.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n==Industrial activities==\n\nIt was during the ownership of the Pembrey Estate by the Ashburnhams that trial workings for coal were made. These proved to be successful and a number of levels and pits were opened in Coed y Marchog (Knight\u2019s Wood) and Coed Rhial (Royal Wood) on the western slope of Pembrey Mountain.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nManagement of the [[colliery]] was undertaken from an office at Court Farm and the coal was carried by [[packhorse]] to the [[estuary]] of the [[River Gwendraeth]] and to the Burry Inlet, from here it was shipped to the west of England and [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"Morris\">Morris, W., H., \"The Canals of the Gwendraeth Valley\" (Part I), The Carmarthenshire Antiquary</ref>\n\nThe second Earl Ashburnham, impressed by the success of a canal built by [[Thomas Kymer]] in the [[Gwendraeth valley]], decided upon a similar scheme for his Pembrey colliery. [[Kymer\u2019s Canal]] was built between 1766 and 1768 in order to carry coal from pits and levels at [[Pwll y Llygod]] and Great Forest (near [[Carway]]) to a place of shipment on the Lesser Gwendraeth river near Kidwelly.<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\nThe Ashburnham canal ran from the foot of Pembrey Mountain to the Gwendraeth estuary and its aim was to improve the transport of coal from the Pembrey colliery to the sea. The plan initially encountered opposition from [[colliery|collier]]s, whose ponies used to do the job, but by 1796 work on the canal had begun below Coed Farm, close to the Llandyry-Pinged road. By 1799, the canal had extended across the Kidwelly-Pembrey road, near to Saltrock Farm, and by the end of 1801 it had reached the sea at Pill Towyn, a creek running in from the south bank of the Gwendraeth Fawr river. Two shipping places were built on the canal, one of them at Pill Ddu, and the total length of the canal was about two miles (3&nbsp;km). Flat terrain meant that there were no locks, and in 1805 a short branch was constructed towards [[Ffrwd]] when new levels were opened in Coed Rhial. The entrance to Pill Ddu was deepened in 1816 and a [[dry dock]] was added in 1817. By 1818, however, the colliery had become exhausted and the canal became redundant.<ref name=\"Morris\" />\n\nIn the returns of Owners of Land in 1873, Bertram Ashburnham is shown as having substantial estates in Wales, with {{convert|5685|acre|km2}} producing an estimated annual rental of \u00a33,547 in Carmarthenshire, and {{convert|1881|acre|km2}} producing an estimated annual rental of \u00a31,963 in Breconshire. In Sussex, the family seat, {{convert|14051|acre|km2}} produced \u00a313,069.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n==Sale of the Ashburnham estate==\n\nBertram Ashburnham died on 22 June 1878 aged 80. His eldest of seven sons, also named Bertram, succeeded as fifth Earl and actively participated in the development of industry in Pembrey. He died in 1913 leaving an only child, Lady Mary Cathleen Charlotte Ashburnham. The title thus passed to his younger brother, Thomas, the sixth and last Earl of Ashburnham, who had married Maria Elizabeth Anderson of [[Fredericton]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]] in 1903.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nGeorge Ashburnham had taken out a mortgage on his Welsh estates in 1824 for \u00a319,403,4s, 6d after he had freed the Welsh properties from entail on certain leases. By 1897 the mortgage debt on the Welsh properties had increased to \u00a387,600, as the loan had not been repaid on its due date. In order to repay the loan, the Porthaml estate was sold in 1913 and the Pembrey estate in 1922. Thomas Ashburnham died without issue on 12 May 1924, leading to the extinction of the Ashburnham title.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nCourt Farm was tenanted by the Thomas family until around 1902. After that, William Bonnell (senior), and his family, were tenants. The house once again became a single dwelling. The Bonnell family farmed Court Farm until August 1922, when the whole of the Ashburnham Estate was sold. The sale was a major local event. The Ashburnhams had, for 245 years, controlled much of Pembrey Parish, and been intimately involved in turning it into a centre of industry. At the auction Mr William Bonnell (senior) purchased Penllwyn Uchaf Farm and thereafter vacated Court Farm.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nCourt Farm was advertised for sale by [[auction]] on 14 September 1929, subject to tenancy, and plans could be inspected at the [[auctioneer]]'s office or the local butchers. Mr James Butler of [[Treorchy]] bought Court Farm at the auction. The Manor was then let to the family of Mr Sidney Thomas. They remained as tenants after the death of Mr Butler, in 1937, and the purchase of the Manor by Mr Charles Harding from the Links, Pembrey.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nMr Harding bought Pembrey Court as a business proposition. He developed the Garreg Lwyd quarries, located on Court Farm land, as a [[brickworks]], and used material from the quarry for his [[brick]] mixture. The brickwork project failed when the brick making machinery ran into technical difficulties. Probably as a result of these activities, a large front section of the quarry collapsed.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Ownership by the Bonnell family==\n\nIn 1942, Mr Harding sold Court Farm to William Bonnell (junior), who lived at Penllwyn Uchaf farm. However, the Thomas family remained as tenants until about 1948, after which Court Farm was left empty. Mr William Bonnell (Junior) continued to live at Penllwyn Uchaf Farm until his death in January 1962 and during this time Pembrey Court was used for storage. After William Bonnell's death, Court Farm passed to his younger brother, Mr Owen Bonnell.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nDuring the 1970s, Court Farm remained unoccupied and thieves twice stole the [[lead flashing]]s from the roof. After the first theft, Mr Owen Bonnell replaced the lead, but after the second theft he could see little point in replacing it again. It was at this stage that the structure of the house began to deteriorate. Nevertheless, in 1972, he appointed Messrs, Peter Howell and Donald Jones, Architects, of [[Uplands, Swansea]] to apply for grant aid from the Historic Buildings Council. The [[Marquis of Anglesey]] and representatives of the Historic Buildings Council visited Court Farm in order to assess the property for grant aid, but their report to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] pointed out that the property was beyond repair and so a grant was refused.<ref name=\"Feasibility Study\">Court Farm Feasibility Study, 1985, \"Background Information\", section 5</ref>\n\nOwen Bonnell died in January, 1976 and Court Farm was inherited by his nephew, John Bonnell Davies, who was born at Court Farm. He is the present owner and lives in Pembrey.<ref name=\"Feasibility Study\" />\n\n==Community interest in Court Farm==\n\nIn 1972, the possibility of saving Court Farm was first put forward to the former [[Carmarthenshire County Council]], but it was believed that the building had deteriorated too far and would cost an estimated \u00a350,000 to put right. Considerable theft and vandalism left the property in a badly damaged condition, and so a planning application was made by the owners for consent to demolish the building. On 23 October 1980, [[Llanelli Borough Council]] refused the application for the following reasons:\n\n<blockquote>~\t[Court Farm] is a Grade II Listed Building of special architectural and historic interest, which is capable of renovation, rehabilitation and use, which would ensure its future conservation; and</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>~\tin line with national policy, the Borough Council is disposed not to grant consent for the demolition of Listed Buildings which are capable of preservation or conservation.</blockquote><ref name=\"Feasibility Study\" />\n\nDespite the decline in the fortunes of Court Farm, local concern for the building remained strong, as evidenced by the publicity in the local press. The late Mr John Evans, of Erw Terrace, Burry Port, who was a member of [[Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society]], commenced a campaign to save Court Farm and. in August 1981, a Court Farm Committee was established. The Committee requested that the Borough Council place a [[compulsory purchase order]] on the building and plans were formulated to restore it and develop it as a [[museum]], in a \u00a3100,000 project phased over 3 years. Unfortunately, the plans suffered a setback when solicitors representing the owners refused to accept a valuation figure of \u00a34,000 for the {{convert|1.8|acre|m2|adj=on}} site.<ref name=\"WesternMail1\">Western Mail, \"Ex-teacher fights to save Historic farmhouse\", 11 August 1980</ref>\n\nOn 19 October 1984, another application was made to demolish Court Farm, but the application was refused. The refusal notice, issued on 18 July 1985, stated that demolition was considered premature, due to the Borough Architect\u2019s museum feasibility study.<ref name=\"Feasibility Study\" />\n\nBy 14 November 1984, the [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] newspaper was reporting on the proposed 48-hour fast of Mr John Evans. The planned fast was the \"ultimate threat\" if demolition were to come about and \"would be a last resort gesture\".<ref name=\"WesternMail2\">Western Mail, \"Fast plan to save old building\", 13 November 1984</ref>\n\nIn his campaign to save the building, Mr Evans wrote to the former [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Elwyn Jones]] (a native of Llanelli), to the [[Archbishop of Wales]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Llanelli Borough Council, [[Dyfed County Council]], the [[Welsh Office]], the [[Welsh Development Agency]], Members of Parliament, [[Government Minister]]s, various trusts and influential academics.<ref name=\"WesternMail7\">Western Mail, \"Walker urged to save manor house\", 29 June 1987</ref> Letters of support were received from the [[Prince of Wales]], who was reported to be pleased that efforts were being made to save Court Farm, and a letter of support was also received from Professor Sir [[Glanmor Williams]].<ref name=\"WesternMail1\" /><ref name=\"Touchand Go\">Touch and Go, \"Campaign, Some Progress!\", 21 May-17 June 1983</ref>\n\nBy 1985, local concern was such that funding was made available for a feasibility study for the property. [[Cadw]] generously offered a grant of 50% towards the cost of preparation of the study and the balance came from Llanelli Borough Council. The feasibility study concluded that Court Farm was worth retaining on the basis of :-\n\n<blockquote>-\tits uniqueness in the district and probably Wales, particularly in a locality predominantly shaped by the [[Industrial Revolution]];</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>-\tits rich variety of architectural features within a single building;</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>-\tvirtually no examples of medieval or Tudor settlement remain in the district; and</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>-\tthe extent of local interest and concern over the future of the property, which has long formed part of the local history and character of the village of Pembrey.</blockquote><ref name=\"Feasibility Study Chapter 7\">Court Farm Feasbility Study, 1985, \"Deirability of Retention\", chapter 7</ref>\n\nOn 30 August 1985, Llanelli Borough Planning Officer, Mr Clive Davies, stated that the ultimate step of demolition would not be justified until the results of the feasibility study were known. Apart from Mr Evans and Cadw, others who objected to demolition included the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments in Wales, [[Dyfed Archaeological Trust]], Llanelli Civic Society and Pembrey Community Council.<ref name=\"WesternMail4\">Western Mail, \"Fasting threat stays over farm\u2019s future\", 30 August 1985</ref>\n\nIn November 1985, the Reverend W. Roberts of Burry Port wrote to the Western Mail Civic Pride Competition <ref name=\"WesternMail5\">Western Mail, \"Why Court Farm must be saved\", 24 November 1985</ref> arguing for the preservation of Court Farm, and concluded with the following call to action:\n\n<blockquote>\"Summing up, the ancient St. Illtud\u2019s Church remains; the notorious wreck-strewn and beautiful Cefn Sidan Sands remain; the third part of the trinity must also remain. In reality, the neglect of the ancient monument is a local and national scandal. Court Farm must be restored.\"</blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, plans by Llanelli Council to restore Court Farm had stalled because the asking price remained too high.<ref name=\"WesternMail6\">Western Mail, \"Farmhouse museum plan hit by land value clash\", 28 August 1981</ref> On 27 June 1987, Mr John Evans urged the [[Secretary of State for Wales]], Mr [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]], to take over the planned restoration, fearing that otherwise the plans would come to nothing. By this stage, the proposed Court Farm museum was in jeopardy because of plans to develop a Heritage and Tinplate Centre at Kidwelly<ref name=\"WesternMail7\"/> which is now [[Kidwelly Industrial Museum]]. \n \nThe importance of Court Farm was still recognised by Cadw, however, and in July 1987 they agreed to offer a grant to fund restoration at a rate of 60%, which was 10% above the then usual rate. Sadly, Cadw\u2019s offer was not taken up and changes in grant regulations meant that the offer lapsed.<ref name=\"WesternMail8\">Western Mail, \"Ancient mansion may find a new role\", 29 January 1988</ref>\n\nHowever, there was renewed hope when, on 29 January 1988, Llanelli Borough Council announced plans to buy the property in order to develop it as a tourist promotion and information office. Mr George Harris, estate officer for Llanelli Borough Council, stated that the situation of Court Farm would not be suitable as a tourist attraction in itself, but could be used as a base to promote tourist interest in the Llanelli area.<ref name=\"WesternMail8\" />\n\nCourt Farm remains posted as a building at risk on the web site of SAVE Britain\u2019s Heritage<ref name=\"SAVE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.savebritainsheritage.org/|title=Save Britain's Heritage|website=www.savebritainsheritage.org|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref> and the posting attracted the interest of [[Cadw Sir Gaerfyrddin]]/Carmarthenshire Building Preservation Trust who obtained funding to conduct a fresh feasibility study, which was completed in 2003 by Davies Sutton Architecture. This architectural firm have successfully restored [[Sker House]], a similar type of building.<ref name=\"CSG\">Davies Sutton Architecture et al, Feasibility Study for Cadw Sir Gaerfyrddin Cyf.: \"Court Farm, Pembrey, Carmarthenshire\", June 2003</ref> This Study was funded with by [[Cadw]] and the [[Architectural Heritage Fund]]. The Study established the intrinsic value of Court Farm and looked at all the options for saving the building. The Study established that the building represented an important historical resource and could be saved for a new beneficial use, with repair retaining a flexible layout, allowing fitting-out for an optimum end use. The [[structural engineer]]\u2019s report, prepared by Mann Williams Consulting Civil and Structural Engineers of [[Cardiff]] collateral to the Study provided a structural assessment and report on the basis of an inspection carried out during February 2003. This stated that \"the main walls remain reasonably plumb and stable when considering the extensive period of neglect. Replacement of floors and roof structures will reinstate the necessary support to the walls and provide a significant improvement to stability.\" <ref name=\"CSG\" />\n\n==Relationship with the sea==\n\nCourt Farm has a panoramic view of [[Carmarthen Bay]] and is the only surviving [[Elizabethan]] manor house in Carmarthenshire.  Before the construction of [[Whiteford Lighthouse]], Court Farm and St Illtud's Church, Pembrey formed two of the few prominent local landmarks in the Pembrey area and so became important navigational aides. It is the seven \"towering chimneys\" that made Court Farm such a landmark, and both the Manor and Church are clearly marked on William Jones of Loughor\u2019s \u2018Plan or Directions for Ships to Come Safe into Burry and to Several Places of Safety to be within the Same\u2019, made in 1757.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nThe Burry Inlet has always been a notoriously difficult place to navigate, due to the quickly changing course of the river and shifting sand banks. Ships crossing the Burry Bar, which is roughly on a line drawn from [[Burry Holms]] on [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]] to [[Tywyn Sands]] or Cornel Mawr, near Pembrey, were crossing a treacherous area. Charts indicate that the contours of the estuary are constantly changing. As an example, in 1764 [[John Wesley]] crossed the Burry Inlet on horseback from Pembrey on his way to [[Oxwich]], in Gower. Today, such a crossing would not be possible.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nIn the 17th century, Sir Walter Vaughan, conceived a life saving sea rescue scheme, and as local Member of Parliament, enthusiastically tried to get the Government to take-up his plans, to no avail.\n\n==Wrecking rights and maritime enterprises==\n\nThe Butlers had been granted rights to all wrecks found on the Cefn Sidan sands, and so for centuries the [[Lord of the Manor]] of Pembrey had rights and privileges over the disposal of wrecks found along the coast.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n[[Cefn Sidan]] was frequently the graveyard of many unsuspecting vessels, whose victims were buried in the grounds of Pembrey Church, including a relative of [[Napoleon]]'s Josephine. Entries in the Pembrey Church registers record numerous burials of passengers and crew. The demand for coal, in the 19th century, led to a big increase in the number of wrecks along the coast.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nDespite this close connection with the sea, when King Charles I asked Sir Walter Vaughan if he could supply the Crown with a ship of 30 tons, Sir Walter avoided the issue by claiming that Carmarthenshire was an inland county with only a few [[stream|creek]]s. However, this did not prevent Sir Walter from acquiring possession of at least two ships at auction, after mishaps led to them running aground at Pembrey. One of these was of 60 tons burthen and known as \"DOROTHY\". She was registered at Burry and leased for a voyage from [[Laugharne]] to [[Chester]], with a cargo of salt. The other ship was the vessel \"HOPE\", she was registered at [[Harborough]], but was driven by a storm into the North Burry Road in June 1631, damaging the cargo of salt and leading to the desertion of the vessel by her crew. Sir Walter acquired possession of both vessels and cargoes and later assigned them to a [[Plymouth]] merchant for \u00a3500.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Manorial dispute==\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, uncertainty had arisen as to the exact area to which the Lord Ashburnham, at that time, the Lord of the Manor of Pembrey, and [[Lord Cawdor]], Lord of Kidwelly held rights. Both agreed that their agents and their legal advisers should be allowed to investigate their claims, and depositions were taken from a number of older local men, who indicated that uncertainties about the rights had set in during the 17th century.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nThe statements of Lord Ashburnham sought to claim that Lord Ashburnham\u2019s tenants had always exercised their right to take any wreck or articles found on the shore to a recognised storage place, or even to Court Farm itself. The [[salvor]]s were then granted a sum of money to cover the \"salvage and expenses\". It may be that such articles were stored in the barn at Court Farm. The following are two examples of the many depositions that were made in favour of the Ashburnham estate:\n\n<blockquote>''\u201c1663, 8th day of June, John William Arnold, yeoman of Pembrey, aged 75, Sworn and Examined before the Court of the Steward\u2026\u201d he had always assumed that he had the right to claim any material from the wrecks on behalf of the \u201cLordship of Ashburnham until now and of late.\u201d''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201c1664, 14th day of July, David William John, village of Pembrey, yeoman, four score years, Sworn and Examined before the Court of the Steward\u2026did lay claim, title unto any of the wreck or materials that happened to be cast up by the sea upon any of the lands within the Lordship of Pembrey by Permission of the Lord of the Manor and his agents.\u201d''</blockquote>\n\nBy 1830 the dispute had been settled amicably, without a court case, and the agreement allowed Lord Ashburnham to maintain his ancient manorial rights over the Pembrey foreshore, and Lord Cawdor to maintain his rights over the Kidwelly foreshore. The agreement document stated:\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cThe right of wreck upon this immediate part of the coast (Caldecott) seems not to have been distinctly exercised within living memory of man, but whenever a ship has been stranded, large parties come down from the Country, some joining the tenantry of Lord Ashburnham, and others the tenantry of Lord Cawdor, and whichever proved the stronger party took the greater share of the Prey.\u201d''</blockquote><ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\n==Proceeds and sale of wrecks==\n\nCargo from wrecked vessels was sometimes carried in carts to farms owned by Lord Ashburnham and, when the owner made a claim on the property, Lord Ashburnham\u2019s agent would charge a [[salvage fee]]. The following are examples of wrecks claimed by Lord Ashburnham and listed in the 1830 agreement document:\n\n<blockquote>''1763\tReceived balance left unpaid of Wine (salvaged) sold this year, 8s. 10d. For salvage of the tobacco ship that came ashore at Pembrey, 5gns. For timber that came ashore at Pembrey, \u00a31. 10. 0.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1764\tFor \u2018uldge\u2019 cast with a small supply of rum in it that came on shore \u00a34. 10. 0.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1766\tCaldecott: received for a boat taken up at Towin (in Caldecott) afterwards claimed on oath by Capt. Jones of Carmarthen, 1d.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1768\tCaldecott: received the profit of 4 casks of wine, sold by auction at Towin on 15th March 1768, \u00a317. 4. 0.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1770\tReceived for the salvage of a Dutch vessel, stranded on the fee farm at Caldecott, 5gns. Received for a hogshead of claret, \u00a34. 18. 0, but deducted 5s. for carriage of it from the sand of Towin.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1776\tReceived of Mr. Griffith the Collector of Customs at Llanelly, the produce of the tobacco of the ship \u201cPOMPEY\u201d, thrown on Pembrey Manor in February 1773, \u00a383. 4. 0.''</blockquote>\n\nThere are also occasional accounts in Ashburnham documents of sales of wreck found on the Pembrey sands:\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cAccount of wreck sold by William Davies for the Right Honourable the Earl of Ashburnham \u2013 collected from Pembrey Manor (The Court).</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''September 1804\tTo piece of elm, timber sold, being 8 cwts. and a half at 2s. 0.     17s 0''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''August 1805\t\tTo an old cannon sold to Mr Morgan at 4 @ 2/6\t\t    10s 0''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''Received from Steven Jones for use of the storeroom at Court to put the late wreck\t      \t\t\t            \u00a31.  1s. 0''</blockquote><ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nEventually, all wrecks became the sole responsibility of the Receiver of Wrecks and Droits and it was his prerogative to dispose of a wreck, and its cargo, by auction, or any other suitable means. By this time, all ships from the Pembrey area were registered with the Register of British Ships at the port of Llanelli, and each ship was issued with a [[certificate of registry]] and details of the vessel were entered in the Register.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Looting==\n\nThere were reputed to be many wreckers in the Pembrey area. \"Mat of the Iron Hand\", who had lost a hand and boasted an iron hook, used to tie lanterns to the sheep grazing on the headlands during a winter storm to draw vessels into shore. One day, these false lights lured a ship onto the rocks before Sir Walter Vaughan could get the boats of his sea rescue crew out to save them. It was said that Mat's custom was to kill all survivors, so that there could be no witnesses. One swimmer that he allegedly despatched turned out to be John Walter Vaughan, the eldest son of Sir Walter Vaughan. As Mat had been imprisoned, over the years by, Sir Walter, he took his revenge by cutting off the young man's hand. As he did so, he noticed that he was wearing a gold signet ring with the well-known Vaughan crest of the three boys' snake-entwined heads, given to John Walter on attaining his majority. This was the private seal of the family. Mat was subsequently hanged.\n\n==Manorial hedgerows and woodland==\n\nIn 1979 a group of Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society members carried out some hedge counting on Court Farm land. This involves counting the number of different tree species in alternate 30m lengths of [[hedgerow]]. Each species in the hedge approximates to one hundred years.<ref name=\"Hedges\">\"Hedges and landscape history - Pembrey Court\", The Carmarthenshire Antiquary</ref>\n\nA narrow strip of land near the Court, known as the \"Narrow Yard\" (Llathed Fain, in Welsh) was traditionally granted, or leased, by the Lord of the Manor to a favoured [[yeoman]], who quickly delineated his property with a surrounding hedge. At Court Farm, the field shapes do suggest enclosure of former \"strips\" or \"lands\" in an open field system. The Antiquarian Society found that, on average, there were five tree species per hedge, indicating an early 16th-century enclosure from open fields.<ref name=\"Hedges\" />\n\nMost of the survey effort was concentrated here, and in the Kidwelly area, because of the amount of medieval, and later, documentation available for this area, which can act as a \"control\" check for dates obtained from species counting. The constituent manors of local lordships are described in a 1609 Survey. This covers different soils, field types, settlement patterns and tenurial customs of the Welshries and Englishries. Dr. Max Hooper, of the [[Nature Conservancy]], pioneered this system of calculation from English hedgerows, whose antiquity was attested by similar documents, such as hedged parts of [[Anglo-Saxon]] estate boundaries delineated in the charters, medieval \"assarts\" or clearances in the forest or waste registered in the [[Court Roll]]s, etc. The equation between age and number of species present is due to the relative abundance of [[colonizing]] species in the immediate vicinity, and the rate at which some species can colonize existing hedges, whether planted or made by clearing woodland either side of them.<ref name=\"Hedges\" />\n \nDuring the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a large number of [[oak]] trees were planted on the eastern slope below Garreg Llwyd Quarry. In early times the oak tree was sacred to the [[Druid]]s, and in 1842 a newspaper reported that \"A grand Druidic procession took place in Pembrey\", although it is not clear if there is any link to the wood.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\nDuring the early 19th century, women were employed in the area to strip the bark of the oak trees, which was sent to the nearest [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]], where tannin was extracted from the bark and used in [[leather]] production.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Relationship to St Illtud's Church, Pembrey==\n\nFanciful claims have been made that a tunnel connected Court Farm with the nearby St Illtud's Church.\n \nCourt Farm used to have a large and heavy stone bowl, filled by spring water, in its grounds, which was used to water cattle for almost a hundred years by Court Farm\u2019s tenant farmers. This was believed to be the \"lost\" Norman font bowl of the Church, and subsequently, the bowl was moved to the Lady Chapel of the Church in 1933, where it still remains.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n==Antiquarian interest in Court Farm==\n\nInterest in Court Farm goes back over a number of decades. On the afternoon of Saturday, 12 September 1970 the Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society held its final Field Day of the 1970 season, when a visit was made to the Pembrey area. The seventy members were conducted by Mr W.H. Morris of Kidwelly and Mr Brynmor Voyle of Llanelli. After assembling at [[Trimsaran]], the party proceeded to a point on Pembrey Mountain where they paused to admire a panoramic view of Carmarthen Bay.  At Court Farm Mr. Brynmor Voyle outlined the main architectural and historical features of the mansion, including its single hall-type structure. Members were, unfortunately, unable to inspect the inside of the house. The castellated barn structure in front of the mansion aroused a great deal of interest.<ref name=\"FieldDay\">\"Field Day - Pembrey\", The Carmarthensjire Antiquary</ref>\n\nAt St. Illtud's Church, the Reverend T.A. Jones welcomed the party and made special mention of \"Butler's Window\" and the [[hagioscope]], the opening in the church tower through which lepers viewed the consecration of the bread and wine at the altar. Members then inspected the [[parish register]]s, dating from 1700 and the memorial to families such as Rees of [[Cilymaenllwyd]], Mansel of [[Stradey]], Vaughan of Trimsaran, Thompson of [[Glyn Abbey]] and Wedge of [[Goodig]].<ref name=\"FieldDay\" />\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n{{coord|51.6911|-4.2761|type:landmark_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Houses in Carmarthenshire]]\n[[Category:Manor houses in Wales]]\n[[Category:Ruins in Wales]]\n[[Category:Burry Port]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRelationship with the Ashburnhams:Fix placename links, replaced:Battle\u2192Battle,typo(s) fixed: 1736-7 \u2192 1736\u20137", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Farm,_Pembrey"}

[[Antigua and Barbuda]] and other islands which use the same meteorological service, such as [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]], and [[Belize]] use Fahrenheit and [[Celsius]]. All other countries in the world officially now use the Celsius scale, named after [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[astronomer]] [[Anders Celsius]]. A handful of [[British Overseas Territories]] still use Fahrenheit alongside Celsius including the [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]], and [[Bermuda]].<ref>http://metricviews.org.uk/2012/10/50-years-of-celsius-weather-forecasts-%E2%80%93-time-to-kill-off-fahrenheit-for-good/</ref>\n\n==Definition and conversion==\n{{temperature}}\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, the [[freezing point]] of [[water]] is 30&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) and the [[boiling point]] is 210&nbsp;\u00b0F (at [[standard atmospheric pressure]]). This puts the boiling and freezing points of water 180&nbsp;degrees apart.<ref name=\"rank\"/> Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale is {{frac|1|180}} of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point. On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water are 100&nbsp;degrees apart.

The French chemist [[Nicolas Lemery|Nicolas L\u00e9mery]] (1645\u20131715) discussed it in his book ''Cours de Chymie'' (A Course of Chemistry, 1675), describing where it occurs naturally and how it can be prepared artificially.  It occurs naturally in the deserts of northern Africa, where it forms from puddles of animal urine.  It can be prepared artificially by boiling 5 parts of urine, 1 part of sea salt, and \u00bd part of chimney soot until the mixture has dried.  The mixture is then heated in a sublimation pot until it sublimates ; the sublimated crystals are ''sal Armoniac''.  See:\n*  Nicolas L\u00e9mery, ''Cours de chymie'' \u2026 , 7th ed.

He invented the [[mercury thermometer]] (first practical, accurate [[thermometer]]) and Fahrenheit scale (first widely used, standardized [[temperature scale]]).]]\nFahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724, basing it on two reference points of temperature. In his initial scale (which is not the final Fahrenheit scale), the zero point was determined by placing the [[thermometer]] in  a mixture \"of [[ice]], of water, and of [[ammonium chloride]] (''salis Armoniaci'')<ref>\"Sal Armoniac\" was an impure form of ammonium chloride.  The French chemist [[Nicolas Lemery|Nicolas L\u00e9mery]] (1645\u20131715) discussed it in his book ''Cours de Chymie'' (A Course of Chemistry, 1675), describing where it occurs naturally and how it can be prepared artificially.  It occurs naturally in the deserts of northern Africa, where it forms from puddles of animal urine.  It can be prepared artificially by boiling 5 parts of urine, 1 part of sea salt, and \u00bd part of chimney soot until the mixture has dried.  The mixture is then heated in a sublimation pot until it sublimates ; the sublimated crystals are ''sal Armoniac''.  See:\n*  Nicolas L\u00e9mery, ''Cours de chymie'' \u2026 , 7th ed.

Fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to eliminate fractions and make the scale more [[granularity|fine-grained]]. He then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and 90 degrees); he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees, so that 64 intervals would separate the two, allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times (since 64 is 2 to the sixth power).<ref name=TMU>{{Cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-71590-4 |last=Frautschi |first=Steven C. |author2=Richard P.

More goldseekers soon arrived and a town was built near the site of Dunlevy's strike including several hotels, a store and a post office.\n\nThen in 1887, the area experienced a second boom when Thaddeus Harper built and operated the first of several [[hydraulic]] [[mining|mines]] and the town became known as Harper's Camp.

F.C.|Biggleswade Town]], where he plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].\n\nBall started his career with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2005, and progressed through the ranks at the club to sign his first professional contract in May 2011. During the [[2011\u201312 in English football|2011\u201312]] season, Ball was loaned out to [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]]. He was released by Norwich in June 2012, and signed for Stevenage a month later. Ball spent a month out on loan at [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough]] in March 2013.

Landing pages are used for [[lead generation]]. The actions that a visitor takes on a landing page is what determines an advertiser's conversion rate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leadforest.com/landing-pages/|title=Landing Page|accessdate=October 13, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113073639/http://www.leadforest.com/landing-pages/|archive-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref> A landing page may be part of a [[microsite]] or a single page within an organization's main [[web site]].\n\nLanding pages are often linked to [[social media]], e-mail campaigns or [[search engine marketing]] campaigns in order to enhance the effectiveness of the advertisements. The general goal of a landing page is to convert site visitors into sales or [[Lead generation|leads]]. If the goal is to obtain a lead, the landing page will include some method for the visitor to get into contact with the company, usually a phone number, or an inquiry form. If a sale is required, the landing page will usually have a link for the visitor to click, which will then send them to a shopping cart or a checkout area. By [[web analytics|analyzing activity]] generated by the linked URL, marketers can use [[click-through rate]]s and [[conversion rate]] to determine the success of an advertisement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ash|first=Tim|title=Landing Page Optimization: The Definitive Guide to Testing and Tuning for Conversions|publisher=Wiley Publishing|isbn=0-470-17462-5}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThere are two types of landing pages: ''reference'' and ''transactional''.\n\n===References===\nA ''reference'' landing page presents information that is relevant to the visitor. These can display text, images, dynamic compilations of relevant links, or other elements.<ref>{{cite book |author=John Reddock|page=71|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rhE1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA71 |title=Small Business Domination|year=2011|isbn=9781257784462}}</ref>\n\n=== Transactional ===\nThe purpose of the ''transactional'' landing page is to persuade a visitor to take action by completing a transaction. This is accomplished by providing a form that needs to be filled out. The visitor information is obtained in order to add the visitor's email address to a mailing list as a prospect. An email campaign can then be developed based on responses to transactional landing pages. The goal is to capture as much information about the visitor as possible. The ultimate goal is to convert the visitor into a customer. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n=== Origin ===\n\nLanding pages originated with the IT departments of [[Microsoft]] in late 2003 in response to poor online sales of [[Microsoft Office|Office]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://blog.omniconvert.com/the-history-of-the-landing-pages.html|title=The History Of Landing Pages - Omniconvert Blog|date=2016-08-17|work=Omniconvert Conversion Rate Optimization Blog|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The process was tedious and time-consuming. As a result, in 2009, several startups, including [[Unbounce]], were formed to simplify and streamline the process. The rise of [[cloud computing]] and [[e-commerce]] around 2009 provided ideal conditions for these startups to flourish.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since then the customer requirements changed, requesting integrations with other solutions such as [[email marketing]], lead nurturing and [[customer relationship management]] systems.\n\n===Typical format===\nLanding pages often contain clear, concise action-oriented headlines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/best-selling-headline-david-ogilvys-copywriting-career-7-others/|title=The Best Selling Headline Of David Ogilvy's Copywriting Career (and 7 others!) - Word-of-Mouth and Referral Marketing Blog|website=www.referralcandy.com|publisher=Visakan Veerasamy blog editor at ReferralCandy|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-31|date=2014-06-04}}</ref> A good landing page explains the product offer in a clear manner and places visual emphasis on the value of the product or service presented.\n\nMarketing experts recommend websites remove the navigation menu and limit internal and external links on the page.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thefinancialbrand.com/63081/website-conversions-landing-pages/|title=Increase Conversions By Maximizing Your Website Landing Pages|date=2017-01-05|work=The Financial Brand|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}</ref> Any signup forms on the landing page should reflect the value of the offer. For example, a free offer or newsletter sign up form may only request an email address, whereas high value offers may have longer forms with more details required. They may also include a relevant image, animation or short video. These pages also tend to contain small icons (i.e. of [[Facebook]], or [[Twitter]]) to facilitate [[social media]] sharing.\n\n==Landing page optimization==\n''Landing page optimization'' (LPO) is one part of a broader [[Internet marketing]] process called [[conversion optimization]], or conversion rate optimization (CRO), with the goal of improving the percentage of visitors to the website that become sales leads and customers. A landing page is a webpage that is displayed when a potential customer clicks an [[advertisement]] or a [[search engine]] result link. This webpage typically displays content that is a relevant extension of the advertisement or link. LPO aims to provide page content and appearance that makes the webpage more appealing to target audiences.\n\nThere are three major types of LPO based on [[targeting (advertising)|targeting]]:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1108/07363760910965882|title=Integrating science into web design: Consumer\u2010driven web site optimization|year=2009|last1=Gofman|first1=Alex|last2=Moskowitz|first2=Howard R.|last3=Mets|first3=T\u00f5nis|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=26|issue=4|pages=286\u2013298}}.</ref>\n# '''Associative content targeting''' (also called ''rule-based optimization'' or ''passive targeting''). The page content is modified based on information obtained about the visitor's search criteria, geographic information of source traffic, or other known generic parameters that can be used for explicit non-research-based consumer [[market segmentation|segmentation]].\n# '''Predictive content targeting''' (also called ''active targeting''). The page content is adjusted by correlating any known information about the visitor (e.g., prior purchase behavior, personal demographic information, browsing patterns, etc.) to anticipate (desired) future actions based on [[predictive analytics]].\n# '''Consumer directed targeting''' (also called ''social targeting'').

The general goal of a landing page is to convert site visitors into sales or [[Lead generation|leads]]. If the goal is to obtain a lead, the landing page will include some method for the visitor to get into contact with the company, usually a phone number, or an inquiry form. If a sale is required, the landing page will usually have a link for the visitor to click, which will then send them to a shopping cart or a checkout area. By [[web analytics|analyzing activity]] generated by the linked URL, marketers can use [[click-through rate]]s and [[conversion rate]] to determine the success of an advertisement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ash|first=Tim|title=Landing Page Optimization: The Definitive Guide to Testing and Tuning for Conversions|publisher=Wiley Publishing|isbn=0-470-17462-5}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThere are two types of landing pages: ''reference'' and ''transactional''.\n\n===References===\nA ''reference'' landing page presents information that is relevant to the visitor.

This is accomplished by providing a form that needs to be filled out. The visitor information is obtained in order to add the visitor's email address to a mailing list as a prospect. An email campaign can then be developed based on responses to transactional landing pages. The goal is to capture as much information about the visitor as possible.

For example, a free offer or newsletter sign up form may only request an email address, whereas high value offers may have longer forms with more details required.

These pages also tend to contain small icons (i.e. of [[Facebook]], or [[Twitter]]) to facilitate [[social media]] sharing.\n\n==Landing page optimization==\n''Landing page optimization'' (LPO) is one part of a broader [[Internet marketing]] process called [[conversion optimization]], or conversion rate optimization (CRO), with the goal of improving the percentage of visitors to the website that become sales leads and customers. A landing page is a webpage that is displayed when a potential customer clicks an [[advertisement]] or a [[search engine]] result link. This webpage typically displays content that is a relevant extension of the advertisement or link. LPO aims to provide page content and appearance that makes the webpage more appealing to target audiences.\n\nThere are three major types of LPO based on [[targeting (advertising)|targeting]]:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1108/07363760910965882|title=Integrating science into web design: Consumer\u2010driven web site optimization|year=2009|last1=Gofman|first1=Alex|last2=Moskowitz|first2=Howard R.|last3=Mets|first3=T\u00f5nis|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=26|issue=4|pages=286\u2013298}}.</ref>\n# '''Associative content targeting''' (also called ''rule-based optimization'' or ''passive targeting'').

The page content is adjusted by correlating any known information about the visitor (e.g., prior purchase behavior, personal demographic information, browsing patterns, etc.) to anticipate (desired) future actions based on [[predictive analytics]].\n# '''Consumer directed targeting''' (also called ''social targeting''). The page content is created using the relevance of publicly available information through a mechanism based on reviews, ratings, [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]], referrals, etc.\n\nThere are two major types of LPO based on experimentation:\n# '''Closed-ended experimentation'''.

The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company [[Softdisk]], [[game programmer|programmers]] [[John Carmack]] and [[John Romero]], [[game designer]] [[Tom Hall]], and artist [[Adrian Carmack]] (no relation to John Carmack). Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved. id Software made important technological developments in video game technologies for the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] (running [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]), including work done for the ''[[Wolfenstein (series)|Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', and ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]'' franchises. id's work was particularly important in [[3D computer graphics]] technology and in [[game engine]]s that are used throughout the [[video game industry]]. The company was involved in the creation of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) genre. ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' is often considered to be the first true FPS, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' is a game that popularized the genre and PC gaming in general, and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was id's first true 3D FPS.\n\nOn June 24, 2009, [[ZeniMax Media]] acquired the company. In 2015, they opened a second studio in [[Frankfurt]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-08-05-id-software-opens-german-studio |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 17, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318001938/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-08-05-id-software-opens-german-studio |archive-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe founders of id Software met in the offices of [[Softdisk]] developing multiple games for Softdisk's monthly publishing, including ''[[Dangerous Dave]]''. In September 1990, [[John Carmack]] developed [[adaptive tile refresh|an efficient way to rapidly side-scroll graphics]] on the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]. Upon making this breakthrough, Carmack and [[Tom Hall]] stayed up late into the night making a replica of the first level of the popular 1988 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', inserting stock graphics of [[John Romero]]'s Dangerous Dave character in lieu of Mario. When Romero saw the [[game demo|demo]], entitled \"Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement\", he realized that Carmack's breakthrough could have potential. The team that would later form id Software immediately began moonlighting, going so far as to \"borrow\" company computers that were not being used over the weekends and at nights while they designed their own remake of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n\nDespite their work, Nintendo turned them down, saying they had no interest in expanding to the PC market, and that Mario games were to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles. Around this time, [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]] of [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]] learned of the group and their exceptional talent, having played one of Romero's Softdisk games, ''Dangerous Dave'', and contacted Romero under the guise of multiple fan letters that Romero came to realize all originated from the same address.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with John Romero |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |date=May 15, 2006 |access-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110121949/http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |archive-date=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=20 Years of Evolution: Scott Miller and 3D Realms |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808123226/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |archive-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> When he confronted Miller, Miller explained that the deception was necessary since Softdisk screened letters it received.

Brainstormed by [[John Romero]], id Software held a weekend session titled \"The id Summer Seminar\" in the summer of 1991 with prospective buyers including [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]], [[George Broussard]], Ken Rogoway, Jim Norwood and [[Todd Replogle]]. One of the nights, id Software put together an impromptu game known as \"Wac-Man\" to demonstrate not only the technical prowess of the ''Keen'' engine, but also how it worked internally.\n\nid Software has developed their own game engine for each of their titles when moving to the next technological milestone, including ''Commander Keen'', ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''[[ShadowCaster]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=David |authorlink=David Kushner |title=[[Masters of Doom]] |edition=paperback |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2004 |pages=119\u2013122 |isbn=0-8129-7215-5}}</ref> ''Doom'', ''Quake'', ''Quake II'', and ''Quake III'', as well as the technology used in making ''Doom 3''. After being used first for id Software's in-house game, the engines are licensed out to other developers. According to ''Eurogamer.net'', \"id Software has been synonymous with PC game engines since the concept of a detached game engine was first popularized\". During the mid to late 1990s, \"the launch of each successive round of technology it's been expected to occupy a headlining position\", with the ''Quake III'' engine being most widely adopted of their engines. However [[id Tech 4]] had far fewer licensees than the [[Unreal Engine]] from [[Epic Games]], due to the long development time that went into ''Doom 3'' which id Software had to release before licensing out that engine to others.\n\nDespite his enthusiasm for open source code, Carmack revealed in 2011 that he had no interest in licensing the technology to the mass market. Beginning with Wolfenstein 3D, he felt bothered when third-party companies started \"pestering\" him to licence the id tech engine, adding that he wanted to focus on new technology instead of providing support to existing ones. He felt very strongly that this was not why he signed up to be a game programmer for; to be \"holding the hands\" of other game developers. Carmack commended Epic Games for pursuing the licensing to the market beginning with Unreal Engine 3. Even though the said company has gained more success with its game engine than id Software over the years, Carmack had no regrets by his decision and continued to focus on open source until his departure from the company in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gamespot |title=id Software 20th Anniversary Feature |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoLaA-CVmTE |website=YouTube |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with his self-professed affinity for sharing [[source code]], John Carmack has open-sourced most of the major id Software engines under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Historically, the [[source code]] for each engine has been released once the code base is 5 years old. Consequently, many home grown projects have sprung up porting the code to different platforms, cleaning up the source code, or providing major modifications to the core engine. ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''DOOM'' and ''Quake'' engine ports are ubiquitous to nearly all platforms capable of running games, such as hand-held PCs, iPods, the PSP, the Nintendo DS and more. Impressive core modifications include DarkPlaces which adds stencil shadow volumes into the original ''Quake'' engine along with a more efficient network protocol.

It is the series of id Software that designer [[Tom Hall]] is most affiliated with.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The first ''Commander Keen'' trilogy was released on December 14, 1990.\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein'' ===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein (series)}}\nThe company's breakout product was released on May 5, 1992: ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', a [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) with smooth 3D graphics that were unprecedented in computer games, and with violent gameplay that many gamers found engaging. After essentially founding an entire genre with this game, id Software created ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Quake II]]'', ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', ''[[Quake 4]]'', and ''[[Doom 3]]''. Each of these first-person shooters featured progressively higher levels of graphical technology. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' spawned a prequel and a sequel: the prequel called ''[[Spear of Destiny (computer game)|Spear of Destiny]]'', and the second, ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', using the [[id Tech 3]] [[game engine|engine]]. A third ''Wolfenstein'' sequel, simply titled ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', was released by [[Raven Software]], using the [[id Tech 4]] [[game engine|engine]]. Another sequel, named ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]''; was developed by [[MachineGames]] using the [[id Tech 5]] engine and released in 2014, with it getting a prequel by the name of ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'' a year later; followed by a direct sequel titled ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'' in 2017.\n\n=== ''Doom'' ===\n{{Main|Doom (franchise)}}\nEighteen months after their release of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', on December 10, 1993, id Software released ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' which would again set new standards for graphic quality and graphic violence in computer gaming. ''Doom'' featured a [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[horror fiction|horror]] setting with graphic quality that had never been seen on personal computers or even [[video game console]]s. ''Doom'' became a cultural phenomenon and its violent theme would eventually launch a new wave of [[Video game controversy|criticism]] decrying the dangers of violence in video games. ''Doom'' was ported to numerous platforms, inspired many knock-offs, and was eventually followed by the technically similar ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. id Software made its mark in video game history with the [[shareware]] release of ''Doom'', and eventually revisited the theme of this game in 2004 with their release of ''[[Doom 3]]''. John Carmack said in an interview at QuakeCon 2007 that there would be a ''[[Doom 4]]''. It began development on May 7, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2 |title=QuakeCon 2007: John Carmack Talks Rage, id Tech 5 And More |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=October 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029050912/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2 |archivedate=October 29, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', the fourth installation and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the Doom series, was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 13, 2016, and was later released on Nintendo Switch on November 10, 2017. In June 2018, the sequel to the 2016 reboot, ''[[Doom Eternal]]'' was officially announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018|E3 2018]] with a teaser trailer, followed by a gameplay reveal at [[QuakeCon]] in August 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=DOOM Eternal \u2013 Official Gameplay Reveal |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGq8Ee2gOe4 |website=YouTube |publisher=Bethesda Softworks |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DOOM Eternal \u2013 Official E3 Teaser |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVwrpfo_QA |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Quake'' ===\n{{Main|Quake (series)}}\nOn June 22, 1996, the release of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' marked the third milestone in id Software history. ''Quake'' combined a cutting edge fully 3D engine, the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], with a distinctive art style to create critically acclaimed graphics for its time. Audio was not neglected either, having recruited [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]] to facilitate unique sound effects and ambient music for the game. (A small homage was paid to Nine Inch Nails in the form of the band's logo appearing on the ammunition boxes for the nailgun weapon.) It also included the work of [[Michael Abrash]]. Furthermore, ''Quake'''s main innovation, the capability to play a deathmatch (competitive gameplay between living opponents instead of against computer-controlled characters) over the Internet (especially through the add-on ''[[QuakeWorld]]''), seared the title into the minds of gamers as another smash hit.\n\nIn 2008, id Software was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for the pioneering work ''Quake'' represented in user modifiable games.<ref>[http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners 2008 Tech Emmy Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929094303/http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners |date=September 29, 2012 }} from Kotaku.com</ref> id Software is the only game development company ever honored twice by the [[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]], having been given an Emmy Award in 2007 for creation of the 3D technology that underlies modern [[Shooter game|shooter]] video games.<ref>[http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x \"John Carmack and id Software's pioneering development work in 3d games recognized with two Technology Emmy Awards\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705061409/http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x |date=July 5, 2008 }} from [[Shacknews]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Quake (series)|''Quake'' series]] continued with ''[[Quake II]]'' in 1997. Activision purchased a 49% stake in id Software, making it a second party which took publishing duties until 2009. However, the game is not a storyline sequel, and instead focuses on an assault on an alien planet, Stroggos, in retaliation for [[Strogg]] attacks on [[Earth]]. Most of the subsequent entries in the ''Quake'' franchise follow this storyline. ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' (1999), the next title in the series, has minimal plot, but centers around the \"Arena Eternal\", a gladiatorial setting created by an alien race known as the Vadrigar and populated by combatants plucked from various points in time and space. Among these combatants are some characters either drawn from or based on those in ''Doom'' (\"[[Doomguy]]\"), ''Quake'' (Ranger, Wrack), and ''Quake II'' (Bitterman, Tank Jr., Grunt, Stripe). ''[[Quake IV]]'' (2005) picks up where ''Quake II'' left off \u2013 finishing the war between the humans and Strogg. The spin-off ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' acts as a prequel to ''Quake II'', when the Strogg first invade Earth. ''Quake IV'' and ''Enemy Territory: Quake Wars'' were made by outside developers and not id.\n\nThere have also been other spin-offs such as [[Quake (video game)#Quake Mobile|Quake Mobile]] in 2005 and ''[[Quake Live]]'', an internet browser based modification of ''Quake III''. A game called ''Quake Arena DS'' was planned and canceled for the [[Nintendo DS]]. John Carmack stated, at [[QuakeCon]] 2007, that the ''[[id Tech 5]]'' engine would be used for a new ''Quake'' game.\n\n=== ''Rage'' ===\n{{Main|Rage (video game)}}\nTodd Hollenshead announced in May 2007 that id Software had begun working on an all new series that would be using a new engine.

There was also the ''[[Rescue Rover]]'' series, which had two games \u2013 ''Rescue Rover'' and ''Rescue Rover 2''. Also there was [[John Romero]]'s ''[[Dangerous Dave]]'' series, which included such notables as the tech demo (''In Copyright Infringement'') which led to the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' engine, and the decently popular ''[[Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion]]''. ''In the Haunted Mansion'' was powered by the same engine as the earlier id Software game ''[[Shadow Knights]]'', which was one of the several games written by id Software to fulfill their contractual obligation to produce games for [[Softdisk]], where the id Software founders had been employed. id Software has also overseen several games using its technology that were not made in one of their IPs such as ''[[ShadowCaster]]'', (early-[[Doom engine|id Tech 1]]), ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' (id Tech 1), ''[[Hexen II]]'' ([[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]]), and ''[[Orcs and Elves]]'' (''[[Doom RPG]]'' engine).\n\n== Other media ==\nid Software has also published novels based on the Doom series [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]].

[[Harvard Medical School]] researchers Cheryl Olson and Lawrence Kutner found that violent video games did not correlate to school shootings. The [[United States Secret Service]] and [[United States Department of Education]] analyzed 37 incidents of school violence and sought to develop a profile of school shooters; they discovered that the most common traits among shooters were that they were male and had histories of depression and attempted suicide. While many of the killers\u2014like the vast majority of young teenage boys\u2014did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between gameplay and school shootings. In fact, only one-eighth of the shooters showed any special interest in violent video games, far less than the number of shooters who seemed attracted to books and movies with violent content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative |format=PDF |date= |access-date=November 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804232200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |archive-date=August 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein 3D'' ===\nAs for ''Wolfenstein 3D'', due to its use of Nazi symbols such as the [[swastika]] and the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]'', as theme music, the PC version of the game was withdrawn from circulation in Germany in 1994, following a verdict by the Amtsgericht M\u00fcnchen on January 25, 1994. Despite the fact that Nazis are portrayed as the enemy in ''Wolfenstein'', the use of those symbols is a federal offense in Germany unless certain circumstances apply. Similarly, the [[Atari Jaguar]] version was confiscated following a verdict by the Amtsgericht Berlin Tiergarten on December 7, 1994.\n\nDue to concerns from Nintendo of America, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version was modified to not include any swastikas or Nazi references; furthermore, blood was replaced with sweat to make the game seem less violent, and the attack dogs in the game were replaced by giant mutant rats. Employees of id Software are quoted in ''The Official DOOM Player Guide'' about the reaction to ''Wolfenstein'', claiming it to be ironic that it was morally acceptable to shoot people and rats, but not dogs. Two new weapons were added as well. The Super NES version was not as successful as the PC version.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== People ==\nIn 2003, the book ''[[Masters of Doom]]'' chronicled the development of id Software, concentrating on the personalities and interaction of John Carmack and John Romero. Below are the key people involved with id's success.\n\n=== John Carmack ===\n{{Main|John Carmack}}\nCarmack's skill at [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[computer programming|programming]] is widely recognized in the software industry and from its inception, he was id's [[lead programmer]]. On August 7, 2013, he joined [[Oculus VR]], a company developing [[virtual reality headset]]s, and left id Software on November 22, 2013.<ref name=carmack-leaves-id />\n\n=== John Romero ===\n{{Main|John Romero}}\nJohn Romero, who was forced to resign in 1996 after the release of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', later formed the ill-fated company [[Ion Storm]]. There, he became infamous through the development of ''[[Daikatana]]'', which was received negatively from reviewers and gamers alike upon release.\n\nBoth Tom Hall and John Romero have reputations as designers and idea men who have helped shape some of the key PC gaming titles of the 1990s.\n\n=== Tom Hall ===\n{{Main|Tom Hall}}\nTom Hall was forced to resign by id Software during the early days of ''Doom'' development, but not before he had some impact; for example, he was responsible for the inclusion of teleporters in the game. He was let go before the shareware release of ''Doom'' and then went to work for Apogee, developing ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' with the \"Developers of Incredible Power\". When he finished work on that game, he found he was not compatible with the ''[[Prey (2006 video game)|Prey]]'' development team at Apogee, and therefore left to join his ex-id Software compatriot John Romero at [[Ion Storm]]. Hall has frequently commented that if he could obtain the rights to ''[[Commander Keen]]'', he would immediately develop another Keen title.\n\n=== Sandy Petersen ===\n{{Main|Sandy Petersen}}\nSandy Petersen was a level designer for 19 of the 27 levels in the original ''Doom'' title as well as 17 of the 32 levels of ''Doom II''. As a fan of [[H.P. Lovecraft]], his influence is apparent in the Lovecraftian feel of the monsters for ''Quake'', and he created ''Inferno'', the third \"episode\" of the first DOOM. He was forced to resign from id Software during the production of ''Quake II'' and most of his work was scrapped before the title was released.\n\n=== American McGee ===\n{{Main|American McGee}}\nAmerican McGee was a [[level designer]] for ''Doom II'', ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Quake'', and ''Quake II''. He was asked to resign after the release of ''Quake II'', then moved to [[Electronic Arts]] where he gained industry notoriety with the development of his own game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]''. After leaving Electronic Arts, he became an independent entrepreneur and game developer. McGee now heads [[independent game development]] house [[Spicy Horse]] in Shanghai, where he works on various projects.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* Kushner, David (2003).

The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company [[Softdisk]], [[game programmer|programmers]] [[John Carmack]] and [[John Romero]], [[game designer]] [[Tom Hall]], and artist [[Adrian Carmack]] (no relation to John Carmack). Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved. id Software made important technological developments in video game technologies for the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] (running [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]), including work done for the ''[[Wolfenstein (series)|Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', and ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]'' franchises. id's work was particularly important in [[3D computer graphics]] technology and in [[game engine]]s that are used throughout the [[video game industry]]. The company was involved in the creation of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) genre. ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' is often considered to be the first true FPS, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' is a game that popularized the genre and PC gaming in general, and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was id's first true 3D FPS.\n\nOn June 24, 2009, [[ZeniMax Media]] acquired the company. In 2015, they opened a second studio in [[Frankfurt]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-08-05-id-software-opens-german-studio |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 17, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318001938/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-08-05-id-software-opens-german-studio |archive-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe founders of id Software met in the offices of [[Softdisk]] developing multiple games for Softdisk's monthly publishing, including ''[[Dangerous Dave]]''. In September 1990, [[John Carmack]] developed [[adaptive tile refresh|an efficient way to rapidly side-scroll graphics]] on the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]. Upon making this breakthrough, Carmack and [[Tom Hall]] stayed up late into the night making a replica of the first level of the popular 1988 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', inserting stock graphics of [[John Romero]]'s Dangerous Dave character in lieu of Mario. When Romero saw the [[game demo|demo]], entitled \"Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement\", he realized that Carmack's breakthrough could have potential. The team that would later form id Software immediately began moonlighting, going so far as to \"borrow\" company computers that were not being used over the weekends and at nights while they designed their own remake of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n\nDespite their work, Nintendo turned them down, saying they had no interest in expanding to the PC market, and that Mario games were to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles. Around this time, [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]] of [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]] learned of the group and their exceptional talent, having played one of Romero's Softdisk games, ''Dangerous Dave'', and contacted Romero under the guise of multiple fan letters that Romero came to realize all originated from the same address.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with John Romero |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |date=May 15, 2006 |access-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110121949/http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2006/05/the_apogee_legacy_19.html |archive-date=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=20 Years of Evolution: Scott Miller and 3D Realms |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808123226/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4112/20_years_of_evolution_scott_.php |archive-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> When he confronted Miller, Miller explained that the deception was necessary since Softdisk screened letters it received. Although disappointed by not actually having received mail from multiple fans, Romero and other Softdisk developers began proposing ideas to Miller, including ''[[Commander Keen]]'' in December 1990, which became a very successful [[shareware]] game.

Brainstormed by [[John Romero]], id Software held a weekend session titled \"The id Summer Seminar\" in the summer of 1991 with prospective buyers including [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]], [[George Broussard]], Ken Rogoway, Jim Norwood and [[Todd Replogle]]. One of the nights, id Software put together an impromptu game known as \"Wac-Man\" to demonstrate not only the technical prowess of the ''Keen'' engine, but also how it worked internally.\n\nid Software has developed their own game engine for each of their titles when moving to the next technological milestone, including ''Commander Keen'', ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''[[ShadowCaster]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=David |authorlink=David Kushner |title=[[Masters of Doom]] |edition=paperback |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2004 |pages=119\u2013122 |isbn=0-8129-7215-5}}</ref> ''Doom'', ''Quake'', ''Quake II'', and ''Quake III'', as well as the technology used in making ''Doom 3''. After being used first for id Software's in-house game, the engines are licensed out to other developers. According to ''Eurogamer.net'', \"id Software has been synonymous with PC game engines since the concept of a detached game engine was first popularized\". During the mid to late 1990s, \"the launch of each successive round of technology it's been expected to occupy a headlining position\", with the ''Quake III'' engine being most widely adopted of their engines. However [[id Tech 4]] had far fewer licensees than the [[Unreal Engine]] from [[Epic Games]], due to the long development time that went into ''Doom 3'' which id Software had to release before licensing out that engine to others.\n\nDespite his enthusiasm for open source code, Carmack revealed in 2011 that he had no interest in licensing the technology to the mass market. Beginning with Wolfenstein 3D, he felt bothered when third-party companies started \"pestering\" him to licence the id tech engine, adding that he wanted to focus on new technology instead of providing support to existing ones. He felt very strongly that this was not why he signed up to be a game programmer for; to be \"holding the hands\" of other game developers. Carmack commended Epic Games for pursuing the licensing to the market beginning with Unreal Engine 3. Even though the said company has gained more success with its game engine than id Software over the years, Carmack had no regrets by his decision and continued to focus on open source until his departure from the company in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gamespot |title=id Software 20th Anniversary Feature |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoLaA-CVmTE |website=YouTube |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with his self-professed affinity for sharing [[source code]], John Carmack has open-sourced most of the major id Software engines under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Historically, the [[source code]] for each engine has been released once the code base is 5 years old. Consequently, many home grown projects have sprung up porting the code to different platforms, cleaning up the source code, or providing major modifications to the core engine. ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''DOOM'' and ''Quake'' engine ports are ubiquitous to nearly all platforms capable of running games, such as hand-held PCs, iPods, the PSP, the Nintendo DS and more. Impressive core modifications include DarkPlaces which adds stencil shadow volumes into the original ''Quake'' engine along with a more efficient network protocol. Another such project is [[ioquake3]], which maintains a goal of cleaning up the source code, adding features and fixing bugs. Even earlier id Software code, namely for ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3D]]'', was released in June 2014 by [[Flat Rock Software]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTcxMjM |title=id Software's Softdisk Open-Sources Some Really Old Games |first=Michael |last=Larabel |date=June 6, 2014 |access-date=June 6, 2014 |publisher=[[Phoronix]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609231037/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTcxMjM |archive-date=June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe GPL release of the ''Quake III'' engine's source code was moved from the end of 2004 to August 2005 as the engine was still being licensed to commercial customers who would otherwise be concerned over the sudden loss in value of their recent investment.\n\nOn August 4, 2011, [[John Carmack]] revealed during his [[QuakeCon]] 2011 keynote that they will be releasing the source code of the ''[[Doom 3]]'' engine ([[id Tech 4]]) during the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doom 3 Source-Code To Be Released This Year |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTc1MQ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011045711/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTc1MQ |archive-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nid Software publicly stated they would not support the [[Wii]] console (possibly due to technical limitations),<ref>{{cite web |title=id Software boss unconvinced by Wii |url=http://play.tm/news/24147/id-software-boss-unconvinced-by-wii/ |date=April 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413101828/http://play.tm/news/24147/id-software-boss-unconvinced-by-wii/ |archive-date=April 13, 2009}}</ref> although they have since indicated that they may release titles on that platform (although it would be limited to their games released during the 1990s).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001953/http://www.cubed3.com/news/6961/1/id_Properties_Coming_to_Wii \"id Properties Coming to Wii\"] from Cubed3</ref> They did the same thing with the [[Wii U]] but for [[Nintendo Switch]], they collaborated with [[Panic Button (company)|Panic Button]] to release 2016's [[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]] and [[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]].\n\nSince id Software revealed their engine [[id Tech 5]], they call their engines \"[[id Tech]]\", followed by a version number.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.idsoftware.com/business/technology |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215034944/http://www.idsoftware.com/business/technology |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |title=id Software: Technology licensing |publisher=idsoftware.com |accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref> Older engines have retroactively been renamed to fit this scheme, with the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] as id Tech 1.\n\n=== Linux gaming ===\n[[File:Timothee-Besset.jpg|thumb|right|Timothee Besset has been responsible for many Linux ports of id Software's games]]\nid Software was an early pioneer in the [[Linux gaming]] market,<ref>[http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=1011&page=3 HEXUS.gaming \u2013 Feature \u2013 Linux Gaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719184812/http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=1011&page=3 |date=July 19, 2011 }} Jo Shields, March 25, 2005</ref> and id Software's [[Linux]] games have been some of the most popular of the platform.

After essentially founding an entire genre with this game, id Software created ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Quake II]]'', ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', ''[[Quake 4]]'', and ''[[Doom 3]]''. Each of these first-person shooters featured progressively higher levels of graphical technology. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' spawned a prequel and a sequel: the prequel called ''[[Spear of Destiny (computer game)|Spear of Destiny]]'', and the second, ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', using the [[id Tech 3]] [[game engine|engine]]. A third ''Wolfenstein'' sequel, simply titled ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', was released by [[Raven Software]], using the [[id Tech 4]] [[game engine|engine]]. Another sequel, named ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]''; was developed by [[MachineGames]] using the [[id Tech 5]] engine and released in 2014, with it getting a prequel by the name of ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'' a year later; followed by a direct sequel titled ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'' in 2017.\n\n=== ''Doom'' ===\n{{Main|Doom (franchise)}}\nEighteen months after their release of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', on December 10, 1993, id Software released ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' which would again set new standards for graphic quality and graphic violence in computer gaming. ''Doom'' featured a [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[horror fiction|horror]] setting with graphic quality that had never been seen on personal computers or even [[video game console]]s. ''Doom'' became a cultural phenomenon and its violent theme would eventually launch a new wave of [[Video game controversy|criticism]] decrying the dangers of violence in video games. ''Doom'' was ported to numerous platforms, inspired many knock-offs, and was eventually followed by the technically similar ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. id Software made its mark in video game history with the [[shareware]] release of ''Doom'', and eventually revisited the theme of this game in 2004 with their release of ''[[Doom 3]]''.

Furthermore, ''Quake'''s main innovation, the capability to play a deathmatch (competitive gameplay between living opponents instead of against computer-controlled characters) over the Internet (especially through the add-on ''[[QuakeWorld]]''), seared the title into the minds of gamers as another smash hit.\n\nIn 2008, id Software was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for the pioneering work ''Quake'' represented in user modifiable games.<ref>[http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners 2008 Tech Emmy Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929094303/http://kotaku.com/342028/2008-tech-emmy-winners |date=September 29, 2012 }} from Kotaku.com</ref> id Software is the only game development company ever honored twice by the [[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]], having been given an Emmy Award in 2007 for creation of the 3D technology that underlies modern [[Shooter game|shooter]] video games.<ref>[http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x \"John Carmack and id Software's pioneering development work in 3d games recognized with two Technology Emmy Awards\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705061409/http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/010710_id_carmack_emmys.x |date=July 5, 2008 }} from [[Shacknews]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Quake (series)|''Quake'' series]] continued with ''[[Quake II]]'' in 1997. Activision purchased a 49% stake in id Software, making it a second party which took publishing duties until 2009. However, the game is not a storyline sequel, and instead focuses on an assault on an alien planet, Stroggos, in retaliation for [[Strogg]] attacks on [[Earth]]. Most of the subsequent entries in the ''Quake'' franchise follow this storyline. ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' (1999), the next title in the series, has minimal plot, but centers around the \"Arena Eternal\", a gladiatorial setting created by an alien race known as the Vadrigar and populated by combatants plucked from various points in time and space. Among these combatants are some characters either drawn from or based on those in ''Doom'' (\"[[Doomguy]]\"), ''Quake'' (Ranger, Wrack), and ''Quake II'' (Bitterman, Tank Jr., Grunt, Stripe). ''[[Quake IV]]'' (2005) picks up where ''Quake II'' left off \u2013 finishing the war between the humans and Strogg. The spin-off ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' acts as a prequel to ''Quake II'', when the Strogg first invade Earth. ''Quake IV'' and ''Enemy Territory: Quake Wars'' were made by outside developers and not id.\n\nThere have also been other spin-offs such as [[Quake (video game)#Quake Mobile|Quake Mobile]] in 2005 and ''[[Quake Live]]'', an internet browser based modification of ''Quake III''. A game called ''Quake Arena DS'' was planned and canceled for the [[Nintendo DS]]. John Carmack stated, at [[QuakeCon]] 2007, that the ''[[id Tech 5]]'' engine would be used for a new ''Quake'' game.\n\n=== ''Rage'' ===\n{{Main|Rage (video game)}}\nTodd Hollenshead announced in May 2007 that id Software had begun working on an all new series that would be using a new engine. Hollenshead also mentioned that the title would be completely developed in-house, marking the first game since 2004's ''[[Doom 3]]'' to be done so.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&aid=154029 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025815/http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&aid=154029 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |title=New IP Coming From id Software |publisher=Totalgaming.net |date=May 31, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}</ref> At 2007's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]], John Carmack showed the new engine called [[id Tech 5]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2007/06/11/wwdc-game-on/ |title=WWDC: Game On |publisher=MacRumors |date=June 11, 2007 |access-date=June 11, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170810/http://www.macrumors.com/2007/06/11/wwdc-game-on/ |archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Later that year, at [[QuakeCon]] 2007, the title of the new game was revealed as ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48289 |title=id Reveals Rage, Implies PS3, 360 and PC Versions |publisher=shacknews |date=August 3, 2007 |access-date=August 3, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235543/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48289 |archive-date=September 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn July 14, 2008, id Software announced at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] event that they would be publishing ''Rage'' through [[Electronic Arts]], and not id's longtime publisher [[Activision]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=193022 |title=id Software, EA Partner For RAGE Publishing Deal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730003532/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=193022 |archive-date=July 30, 2008}}</ref> However, since then ZeniMax has also announced that they are publishing ''Rage'' through [[Bethesda Softworks]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bethblog.com/index.php/2009/12/15/bethesda-softworks-to-publish-rage/ |title=ZeniMax/Bethesda to publish RAGE}}</ref>\n\nOn August 12, 2010, during Quakecon 2010, id Software announced ''Rage'' US ship date of September 13, 2011, and a European ship date of September 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gamespot.com/events/quakecon2010/story.html?sid=6273462 |title=id shows more Rage and announces release date |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819145447/http://www.gamespot.com/events/quakecon2010/story.html?sid=6273462 |archive-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref> During the keynote, id Software also demonstrated a ''Rage'' spin-off title running on the [[iPhone]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/12/quakecon-rage-coming-to-iphone-running-at-60fps/ |title=QuakeCon: Rage coming to iPhone, running at 60fps |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218110711/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/12/quakecon-rage-coming-to-iphone-running-at-60fps/ |archive-date=December 18, 2010}} from Joystiq.com</ref> This technology demo later became ''Rage HD''.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, Bethesda Softworks announced ''[[Rage 2]]'', a co-development between id Software and [[Avalanche Studios]].\n\n=== Other games ===\n[[File:Keen3Gameplay.png|thumb|right|180px|Screenshot of a ''Commander Keen'' game, ''Keen Must Die!'']]\n[[File:Doom ingame 1.png|thumb|180px|A screenshot from the first episode of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'']]\nDuring its early days, id Software produced much more varied games; these include the early 3D first-person shooter experiments that led to ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' \u2013 ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3D]]''. There was also the ''[[Rescue Rover]]'' series, which had two games \u2013 ''Rescue Rover'' and ''Rescue Rover 2''. Also there was [[John Romero]]'s ''[[Dangerous Dave]]'' series, which included such notables as the tech demo (''In Copyright Infringement'') which led to the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' engine, and the decently popular ''[[Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion]]''. ''In the Haunted Mansion'' was powered by the same engine as the earlier id Software game ''[[Shadow Knights]]'', which was one of the several games written by id Software to fulfill their contractual obligation to produce games for [[Softdisk]], where the id Software founders had been employed. id Software has also overseen several games using its technology that were not made in one of their IPs such as ''[[ShadowCaster]]'', (early-[[Doom engine|id Tech 1]]), ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' (id Tech 1), ''[[Hexen II]]'' ([[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]]), and ''[[Orcs and Elves]]'' (''[[Doom RPG]]'' engine).\n\n== Other media ==\nid Software has also published novels based on the Doom series [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]]. After a brief hiatus from publishing, id resumed and re-launched the novel series in 2008 with [[Matthew J. Costello]]'s (a story consultant for ''[[Doom 3]]'' and now ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'') new ''Doom 3'' novels: ''[[Doom 3: Worlds on Fire|Worlds on Fire]]'' and ''[[Doom 3: Maelstrom|Maelstrom]]''.\n\nid Software became involved in film development when they oversaw the film adaption of their ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' franchise in 2005. In August 2007, [[Todd Hollenshead]] stated at QuakeCon 2007 that a ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein (film)|Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' movie is in development which re-teams the ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'' writer/producer team, [[Roger Avary]] as writer and director and [[Samuel Hadida]] as producer. A new ''Doom'' film, titled ''[[Doom: Annihilation]]'', was released in 2019, although id itself stressed its lack of involvement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/12/doom-studio-makes-very-clear-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-new-doom-movie|title=Doom Studio Makes Very Clear It Has Nothing to Do With New Doom Movie|first=Adam|last=Bankhurst|work=IGN|date=March 12, 2019|accessdate=March 12, 2019|archivedate=March 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190313010232/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/12/doom-studio-makes-very-clear-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-new-doom-movie|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nid Software was the target of controversy over two of their most popular games, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)#Controversies|Doom]]'' and the earlier ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'':\n\n=== ''Doom'' ===\n''Doom'' was notorious for its high levels of [[Graphic violence#Internet|gore]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Entertainment Software Rating Board |title=Game ratings |url=http://www.esrb.org/search_results.asp?key=doom&x=0&y=0&type=game |access-date=December 4, 2004 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216031317/http://www.esrb.org/search_results.asp?key=doom&x=0&y=0&type=game |archive-date=February 16, 2006}}</ref> and [[occultism]] along with [[Satanism|satanic]] imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups.

While planning for the massacre, Harris said that the killing would be \"like playing ''Doom''\", and \"it'll be like the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|LA riots]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma bombing]], [[World War II]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], ''[[Duke Nukem 3D|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''Doom'' all mixed together\", and that his shotgun was \"straight out of the game\".<ref>{{cite web |author=4\u201320: a Columbine site |title=Basement Tapes: quotes and transcripts from Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's video tapes |url=http://columbine.free2host.net/quotes.html |accessdate=November 15, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223025846/http://columbine.free2host.net/quotes.html |archivedate=February 23, 2006}}</ref> A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a ''Doom'' level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over.

[[Harvard Medical School]] researchers Cheryl Olson and Lawrence Kutner found that violent video games did not correlate to school shootings. The [[U.S. Secret Service]] and [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] analyzed 37 incidents of school violence and sought to develop a profile of school shooters; they discovered that the most common traits among shooters were that they were male and had histories of depression and attempted suicide. While many of the killers\u2014like the vast majority of young teenage boys\u2014did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between game play and school shootings. In fact, only one eighth of the shooters showed any special interest in violent video games, far less than the number of shooters who seemed attracted to books and movies with violent content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative |format=PDF |date= |access-date=November 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804232200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ssi_final_report.pdf |archive-date=August 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein 3D'' ===\nAs for ''Wolfenstein 3D'', due to its use of Nazi symbols such as the [[swastika]] and the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]'', as theme music, the PC version of the game was withdrawn from circulation in Germany in 1994, following a verdict by the Amtsgericht M\u00fcnchen on January 25, 1994. Despite the fact that Nazis are portrayed as the enemy in ''Wolfenstein'', the use of those symbols is a federal offense in Germany unless certain circumstances apply. Similarly, the [[Atari Jaguar]] version was confiscated following a verdict by the Amtsgericht Berlin Tiergarten on December 7, 1994.\n\nDue to concerns from Nintendo of America, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version was modified to not include any swastikas or Nazi references; furthermore, blood was replaced with sweat to make the game seem less violent, and the attack dogs in the game were replaced by giant mutant rats. Employees of id Software are quoted in ''The Official DOOM Player Guide'' about the reaction to ''Wolfenstein'', claiming it to be ironic that it was morally acceptable to shoot people and rats, but not dogs. Two new weapons were added as well. The Super NES version was not as successful as the PC version.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== People ==\nIn 2003, the book ''[[Masters of Doom]]'' chronicled the development of id Software, concentrating on the personalities and interaction of John Carmack and John Romero. Below are the key people involved with id's success.\n\n=== John Carmack ===\n{{Main|John Carmack}}\nCarmack's skill at [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[computer programming|programming]] is widely recognized in the software industry and from its inception, he was id's [[lead programmer]]. On August 7, 2013, he joined [[Oculus VR]], a company developing [[virtual reality headset]]s, and left id Software on November 22, 2013.<ref name=carmack-leaves-id />\n\n=== John Romero ===\n{{Main|John Romero}}\nJohn Romero, who was forced to resign in 1996 after the release of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', later formed the ill-fated company [[Ion Storm]]. There, he became infamous through the development of ''[[Daikatana]]'', which was received negatively from reviewers and gamers alike upon release.\n\nBoth Tom Hall and John Romero have reputations as designers and idea men who have helped shape some of the key PC gaming titles of the 1990s.\n\n=== Tom Hall ===\n{{Main|Tom Hall}}\nTom Hall was forced to resign by id Software during the early days of ''Doom'' development, but not before he had some impact; for example, he was responsible for the inclusion of teleporters in the game. He was let go before the shareware release of ''Doom'' and then went to work for Apogee, developing ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' with the \"Developers of Incredible Power\". When he finished work on that game, he found he was not compatible with the ''[[Prey (2006 video game)|Prey]]'' development team at Apogee, and therefore left to join his ex-id Software compatriot John Romero at [[Ion Storm]]. Hall has frequently commented that if he could obtain the rights to ''[[Commander Keen]]'', he would immediately develop another Keen title.\n\n=== Sandy Petersen ===\n{{Main|Sandy Petersen}}\nSandy Petersen was a level designer for 19 of the 27 levels in the original ''Doom'' title as well as 17 of the 32 levels of ''Doom II''. As a fan of [[H.P. Lovecraft]], his influence is apparent in the Lovecraftian feel of the monsters for ''Quake'', and he created ''Inferno'', the third \"episode\" of the first DOOM. He was forced to resign from id Software during the production of ''Quake II'' and most of his work was scrapped before the title was released.\n\n=== American McGee ===\n{{Main|American McGee}}\nAmerican McGee was a [[level designer]] for ''Doom II'', ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Quake'', and ''Quake II''. He was asked to resign after the release of ''Quake II'', then moved to [[Electronic Arts]] where he gained industry notoriety with the development of his own game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]''. After leaving Electronic Arts, he became an independent entrepreneur and game developer. McGee now heads [[independent game development]] house [[Spicy Horse]] in Shanghai, where he works on various projects.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* Kushner, David (2003).
