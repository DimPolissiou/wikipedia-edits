His performance in 1914, while on furlough from the [[U.S. Navy]], led Petersburg owner Dr. D.H Leigh to reach out to Virginia Senators [[Thomas S. Martin]] and [[Claude A. Swanson]] and inquire about getting Rice discharged from the Navy. In 1912, Rice was in the preseason, playing for the [[Galesburg Pavers]] when his wife, two children, his parents and two sisters were killed in a tornado. Rice eventually quit baseball and enrolled in the Navy. In 1914, with the senators help, Rice was honorably discharged from the Navy.

The police were heavily armed after that, especially when facing unruly or hostile crowds. The Police Act (No. 7) of 1958 broadened the mission of the SAP beyond conventional police functions, such as maintaining law and order and investigating and preventing crime and gave the police extraordinary powers to quell unrest and to conduct counterinsurgency activities. The Police Amendment Act (No. 70) of 1965 empowered the police to search without warrant any person, receptacle, vehicle, aircraft, or premise within one mile of any national border and to seize anything found during such a search. This search-and-seize zone was extended to within eight miles of any border in 1979 and to the entire country in 1983. Among the SAP's spies during the apartheid era was the infamous [[Craig Williamson]] and his best-known female recruit [[Olivia Forsyth]].\n\nThe SAP relinquished its responsibility for South West Africa in 1981.<ref>Dicker, Richard (1992).

They were formed either to carry out a specific task or to deal with a particular area of crime.\n\n=== Koevoet ===\n{{see also|Koevoet}}\nThe Koevoet, translating into English as 'crowbar', but officially known as the Police Counter-Insurgency Unit (COIN) or 'Operation K' were a major [[paramilitary]] police unit in South African-administered [[South West Africa]], now the [[Republic of Namibia]]. Active within the [[Namibian War of Independence]] from 1979 to 1989, they were held responsible for committing multiple [[human rights]] violations, and alongside the [[South West African Police]], they were disbanded following Namibian independence in 1989, and were essentially replaced by the [[Special Field Force]] in modern-day Namibia.\n\n=== Special Task Force ===\n{{see also|Special Task Force (SAPS)}}\nFormed following a need to defend the border between South Africa and [[Rhodesia]] during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], the Special Task Force were unofficially founded in 1967, and began to be trained to use advanced tactics, such as survival and bush skills, to carry out COIN operations, and drastically reduce police casualties - this unit was known as the 'Bliksems'. By 1975, support of creating the Special Task Force reached the Bureau of State Security, following both the Fox Street Siege, in which the police were unable to deal with a hostage crisis at the Israeli embassy in Johannesburg, and the outbreak of the conflict in South West Africa, stretching the demand of COIN operatives. Finally, authorization of creating the Specialist Task Force was given, following multiple recommendations, and the issues described beforehand. This unit is still in action in modern-day South Africa.\n\n=== Division: Internal Stability ===\nFormed in 1992 in the run-up to the [[1994 South African election]] following the end of Apartheid, 'Division: Internal Stability' were tasked with the important role of combating violence in the turbulent years leading up to and after the elections. The unit consisted of 41 divisions, and proved detrimental to preventing potentially thousands of killings during major political violence.<ref>https://abs-isd-police.weebly.com/about.html</ref>\n\n== Upholding apartheid ==\n[[File:Caspir1.jpg|thumb|The [[Casspir]], an [[armoured personnel carrier]] used by the SAP.]]\n\nDuring South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|rule under apartheid]], the SAP operated to quell [[civil unrest]] amongst the country's disenfranchised non-white majority. During emergencies they were assisted by the military. Beyond the conventional police functions of upholding order and solving crime, the SAP employed [[counter-insurgency]] and intimidation tactics against anti-apartheid activists and critics of the [[Minority rule|white minority government]]. From 1961 to 1990, a total of 67 people died in South African Police detention from hanging and torture as well as natural causes as claimed by the Police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/list-deaths-detention|title=List of deaths in detention|last=Anonymous|date=31 March 2011|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref>\n\n=== Sharpeville massacre ===\n{{Main|Sharpeville massacre}}\nOn 21 March 1960, SAP officers in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] [[Township (South Africa)|township]] of [[Sharpeville]] opened fire on a large anti-apartheid protest outside of the local police station, killing 69 demonstrators and injuring 180 others. Police reports from the time of the massacre claimed that panicking officers spontaneously fired into an increasingly violent crowd; however, other sources claim that the demonstration was peaceful in the moment leading up to the shooting. Evidence given to the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] in 1998 suggested \"a degree of deliberation in the decision to open fire\" by the police.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mouton|first=F.A.|date=January 1989|title=\"Die slag van Durban\": Die massiewe polisie-optrede van November 1929 in Durban|journal=Kleio|volume=21|issue=1|pages=47\u201357|doi=10.1080/17532528908537551|issn=0023-2084}}</ref>\n\n===Vlakplaas ===\n{{Main|Vlakplaas}}\n\nIn 1983, the SAP formed C1, a [[counter-insurgency]] unit commanded by police colonel and former [[Koevoet]] operator [[Eugene de Kock]]. C1 was run out of a secluded farmhouse called [[Vlakplaas]] until 1992. It functioned as a paramilitary hit squad,<ref name=pdfreport>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukzn.ac.za/cae/caepubs/CASERole.pdf|title=The Role of Political Violence in South Africa's Democratisation|publisher=}}</ref> capturing political opponents of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government and either \"turning\" or executing them. C1 was also responsible for several fatal bomb attacks against anti-apartheid activists, including members of the [[African National Congress]]. The Vlakplaas farm became the site of multiple executions of political opponents of the apartheid government.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/truth_and_reconciliation/143668.stm Truth and Reconciliation \u2013 The Voice of 'Prime Evil'] \u2013 BBC News</ref>\n\n== Reserve ==\n\nThe Police Reserve, established in 1973, enabled the government to recall former police personnel for active duty for thirty to ninety days each year, and for additional service in times of emergency. Another reserve (volunteer) force was established in 1966, consisting of unpaid, mostly [[White South African|White]] civilians willing to perform limited police duties. A youth wing of this reserve force reported that it had inducted almost 3,000 students and young people to assist the police during the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Career Times |title=Career Times |url=https://careertimes.co.za/jobs-and-learnerships/saps-volunteer-and-reservist-application-forms/ |publisher=Career Times |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe police increased the use of part-time, specialised personnel \u2013 such as the special [[constable]]s (called ''kitskonstabels'' (instant constables) in [[Afrikaans]]) \u2013 to help quell the growing violence in the 1980s. In 1987, for example, the police recruited almost 9,000 ''kitskonstabels'' and gave them an intensive six-week training course. Most of these constables were [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Blacks]] and [[Coloured people|Coloreds]]. These \"instant\" police assistants were then armed with non-lethal weapons and assigned to areas of unrest, which were often the most turbulent townships. Even with training courses extended to three months, their often brutal and inept performance contributed to the growing hostility between the police and the public by the late 1980s.\n\nAlthough the mission of the SAP grew well beyond conventional policing responsibilities during the 1970s, the size of the police force declined relative to population. In 1981 the police force of roughly 48,991 represented a ratio of less than 1.5 police per 1,000 people, down from 1.67 per 1,000 people in the 1960s. Alarmed by the increased political violence and crime in the mid-1980s and by the lack of adequate police support, officials then increased the size of the police force to 93,600\u2014a ratio of 2.7 per 1,000 people\u2014by 1991.\n\nThe police were authorised to act on behalf of other government officials when called upon. For example, in rural areas and small towns, where there may be no public prosecutor available, police personnel could institute criminal proceedings. The police could legally serve as wardens, court clerks, and messengers, as well as immigration, health, and revenue officials. In some circumstances, the police were also authorised to serve as vehicle inspectors, postal agents, and local court personnel.\n\nAfter [[State President|President]] [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]] lifted the ban on black political organisations and released leading dissidents from prison in 1990, he met with the police and ordered them help end apartheid, to demonstrate greater political tolerance, and to improve their standing in black communities.\n\nThrough the early 1980s, police units were integrated, but most police recruits had been trained in single-race classes, sometimes in institutions designated for one racial group. For example, most black police personnel had trained at Hammanskraal, near Pretoria; most whites, in Pretoria; most coloureds, Bishop Lavis, near Cape Town; and Asians at Chatsworth, near Durban.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saps.gov.za/training/history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926212250/http://www.saps.gov.za/training/history.htm |archive-date=26 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the late 1980s, the Hammanskraal college saw a large enrollment of black policemen.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=g6LtCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=south+africa+police+training+1980s#v=onepage&q=south%20africa%20police%20training%201980s&f=false |title = Settler and Creole Reenactment|isbn = 9780230244900|last1 = Agnew|first1 = V.|last2 = Lamb|first2 = J.|date = 28 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nAs the apartheid era ended, these programs were restructured to emphasise racial tolerance and respect for basic human rights.  The first racially integrated intake of recruits began slowly in 1993 and integration was complete by 1995. Today there is only one Police College to train new recruits in Pretoria. The police also increased recruitment among black youth and hired international police training experts to advise them on ways to improve race relations in the service.\n\nThe basic police training regimen includes courses in criminal investigation procedures, self-defense, musketry, tactical weapons training, drills, inspections, public relations and law. Specialized courses include crowd and riot control, detective skills, horsemanship and veterinary training, and advanced-level management skills. Their basic training lasted 6 months. During the time of the S.A. border war all Policemen were required to complete a 6-week intensive counter insurgence (C.O.I.N.) training at Maleoskop (now closed) in specialised weapons and \"bush warfare\" in preparation for their 3 months \"call up\". (Some volunteering and been called up more frequently.) Since 1990, South Africa also has provided training for police from [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], [[Malawi]] and the (then) [[Zaire]].\n\nThe climate of escalating violence in the early 1990s often posed even greater challenges to the police than they had faced in the 1980s, as violence shifted from anti-government activity to a mosaic of political rivalries and factional clashes. At the same time, many South Africans feared that the police were causing some of the criminal and political violence, and they demanded immediate changes in the police force to mark the end of apartheid-era injustices.\n\nTo meet the new challenges, the 91,000 active police personnel in 1991, including administrative and support personnel, were increased to more than 110,000 by 1993 and 140,000 by 1995. Throughout this time, police reserves numbered at least 37,000. In 1996 the combined active and reserve police represented a police-to-population ratio of almost 4.0 per 1,000.\n\nAs part of the overall reorganisation of the police, the government merged the formerly dreaded Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the police security branch to form a Crime Combatting and Investigation (CCI) Division. The new CCI, with responsibility for reversing the rising crime rate, combined the intelligence and operational resources of the security police with the anticrime capabilities of the CID.\n\nMinister of Law and Order [[Hernus Kriel]] in 1991 also appointed an [[ombudsman]] to investigate allegations of police misconduct. He increased the recruitment of black police personnel, formed a civilian riot-control unit that was separate from the SAP but worked with it, developed a code of police conduct agreed upon by a number of political parties and communities, and substantially increased police training facilities. In 1992 Kriel began restructuring the SAP into a three-tiered force consisting of a national police, primarily responsible for internal security and for serious crime; autonomous regional forces, responsible for crime prevention and for matters of general law and order; and municipal police, responsible for local law enforcement and for minor criminal matters. He also established police/community forums in almost every police station.\n\nIn 1995, the force absorbed the police forces of [[Bophuthatswana]], [[Ciskei]], [[Gazankulu]], [[KaNgwane]], [[KwaNdebele]]. [[KwaZulu]], [[Lebowa]], [[QwaQwa]], [[Transkei]], and [[Venda]], and was renamed the [[South African Police Service]].\n\n== Battle honours ==\n{{See also|List of South African Battle Honours}}\n{{BattleHonour|country=ZAR|\nSouth West Africa 1914-1915|\nWestern Desert 1941-43|\nGazala|\nBardia|\nPoint 204|\nSollum|\nGerman East Africa 1916-18|\nHalfaya|\nCommonwealth Keep|\nTobruk|\nRhodesia 1967-75|\n}}\n\n== Medals and decorations ==\n{{see also|South African Police decorations}}\nPolicemen and women were eligible for a number of awards.

From 1923, the SAP also had its own long service medal, which doubled as a medal for gallantry.

1994; it was the ''de facto'' police force in the territory of [[South West Africa]] ([[Namibia]]) from 1939 to 1981. After South Africa's transition to majority rule in 1994, the SAP was reorganised into the [[South African Police Service]] (SAPS).\n\n== History ==\nThe South African Police were the successors to the police forces of the [[Cape Colony]], the [[Colony of Natal|Natal Colony]], the [[Orange River Colony]], and the [[Transvaal Colony]] in [[law enforcement in South Africa]].

The police were heavily armed after that, especially when facing unruly or hostile crowds. The Police Act (No. 7) of 1958 broadened the mission of the SAP beyond conventional police functions, such as maintaining law and order and investigating and preventing crime and gave the police extraordinary powers to quell unrest and to conduct counterinsurgency activities. The Police Amendment Act (No. 70) of 1965 empowered the police to search without warrant any person, receptacle, vehicle, aircraft, or premise within one mile of any national border and to seize anything found during such a search. This search-and-seize zone was extended to within eight miles of any border in 1979 and to the entire country in 1983. Among the SAP's spies during the apartheid era was the infamous [[Craig Williamson]] and his best-known female recruit [[Olivia Forsyth]].\n\nThe SAP relinquished its responsibility for South West Africa in 1981.<ref>Dicker, Richard (1992).

They were formed either to carry out a specific task or to deal with a particular area of crime.\n\n=== Koevoet ===\n{{see also|Koevoet}}\nThe Koevoet, translating into English as 'crowbar', but officially known as the Police Counter-Insurgency Unit (COIN) or 'Operation K' were a major [[paramilitary]] police unit in South African-administered [[South West Africa]], now the [[Republic of Namibia]]. Active within the [[Namibian War of Independence]] from 1979 to 1989, they were held responsible for committing multiple [[human rights]] violations, and alongside the [[South West African Police]], they were disbanded following Namibian independence in 1989, and were essentially replaced by the [[Special Field Force]] in modern-day Namibia.\n\n=== Special Task Force ===\n{{see also|Special Task Force (SAPS)}}\nFormed following a need to defend the border between South Africa and [[Rhodesia]] during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], the Special Task Force were unofficially founded in 1967, and began to be trained to use advanced tactics, such as survival and bush skills, to carry out COIN operations, and drastically reduce police casualties - this unit was known as the 'Bliksems'. By 1975, support of creating the Special Task Force reached the Bureau of State Security, following both the Fox Street Siege, in which the police were unable to deal with a hostage crisis at the Israeli embassy in Johannesburg, and the outbreak of the conflict in South West Africa, stretching the demand of COIN operatives. Finally, authorization of creating the Specialist Task Force was given, following multiple recommendations, and the issues described beforehand. This unit is still in action in modern-day South Africa.\n\n=== Division: Internal Stability ===\nFormed in 1992 in the run-up to the [[1994 South African election]] following the end of Apartheid, 'Division: Internal Stability' were tasked with the important role of combating violence in the turbulent years leading up to and after the elections. The unit consisted of 41 divisions, and proved detrimental to preventing potentially thousands of killings during major political violence.<ref>https://abs-isd-police.weebly.com/about.html</ref>\n\n== Upholding apartheid ==\n[[File:Caspir1.jpg|thumb|The [[Casspir]], an [[armoured personnel carrier]] used by the SAP.]]\n\nDuring South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|rule under apartheid]], the SAP operated to quell [[civil unrest]] amongst the country's disenfranchised non-white majority. During emergencies they were assisted by the military. Beyond the conventional police functions of upholding order and solving crime, the SAP employed [[counter-insurgency]] and intimidation tactics against anti-apartheid activists and critics of the [[Minority rule|white minority government]]. From 1961 to 1990, a total of 67 people died in South African Police detention from hanging and torture as well as natural causes as claimed by the Police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/list-deaths-detention|title=List of deaths in detention|last=Anonymous|date=31 March 2011|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref>\n\n=== Sharpeville massacre ===\n{{Main|Sharpeville massacre}}\nOn 21 March 1960, SAP officers in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] [[Township (South Africa)|township]] of [[Sharpeville]] opened fire on a large anti-apartheid protest outside of the local police station, killing 69 demonstrators and injuring 180 others. Police reports from the time of the massacre claimed that panicking officers spontaneously fired into an increasingly violent crowd; however, other sources claim that the demonstration was peaceful in the moment leading up to the shooting. Evidence given to the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] in 1998 suggested \"a degree of deliberation in the decision to open fire\" by the police.\n\n===<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mouton|first=F.A.|date=January 1989|title=\"Die slag van Durban\": Die massiewe polisie-optrede van November 1929 in Durban|journal=Kleio|volume=21|issue=1|pages=47\u201357|doi=10.1080/17532528908537551|issn=0023-2084}}</ref>Vlakplaas ===\n{{Main|Vlakplaas}}\n\nIn 1983, the SAP formed C1, a [[counter-insurgency]] unit commanded by police colonel and former [[Koevoet]] operator [[Eugene de Kock]]. C1 was run out of a secluded farmhouse called [[Vlakplaas]] until 1992. It functioned as a paramilitary hit squad,<ref name=pdfreport>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukzn.ac.za/cae/caepubs/CASERole.pdf|title=The Role of Political Violence in South Africa's Democratisation|publisher=}}</ref> capturing political opponents of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government and either \"turning\" or executing them. C1 was also responsible for several fatal bomb attacks against anti-apartheid activists, including members of the [[African National Congress]]. The Vlakplaas farm became the site of multiple executions of political opponents of the apartheid government.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/truth_and_reconciliation/143668.stm Truth and Reconciliation \u2013 The Voice of 'Prime Evil'] \u2013 BBC News</ref>\n\n== Reserve ==\n\nThe Police Reserve, established in 1973, enabled the government to recall former police personnel for active duty for thirty to ninety days each year, and for additional service in times of emergency. Another reserve (volunteer) force was established in 1966, consisting of unpaid, mostly [[White South African|White]] civilians willing to perform limited police duties. A youth wing of this reserve force reported that it had inducted almost 3,000 students and young people to assist the police during the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Career Times |title=Career Times |url=https://careertimes.co.za/jobs-and-learnerships/saps-volunteer-and-reservist-application-forms/ |publisher=Career Times |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe police increased the use of part-time, specialised personnel \u2013 such as the special [[constable]]s (called ''kitskonstabels'' (instant constables) in [[Afrikaans]]) \u2013 to help quell the growing violence in the 1980s. In 1987, for example, the police recruited almost 9,000 ''kitskonstabels'' and gave them an intensive six-week training course. Most of these constables were [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Blacks]] and [[Coloured people|Coloreds]]. These \"instant\" police assistants were then armed with non-lethal weapons and assigned to areas of unrest, which were often the most turbulent townships. Even with training courses extended to three months, their often brutal and inept performance contributed to the growing hostility between the police and the public by the late 1980s.\n\nAlthough the mission of the SAP grew well beyond conventional policing responsibilities during the 1970s, the size of the police force declined relative to population. In 1981 the police force of roughly 48,991 represented a ratio of less than 1.5 police per 1,000 people, down from 1.67 per 1,000 people in the 1960s. Alarmed by the increased political violence and crime in the mid-1980s and by the lack of adequate police support, officials then increased the size of the police force to 93,600\u2014a ratio of 2.7 per 1,000 people\u2014by 1991.\n\nThe police were authorised to act on behalf of other government officials when called upon. For example, in rural areas and small towns, where there may be no public prosecutor available, police personnel could institute criminal proceedings. The police could legally serve as wardens, court clerks, and messengers, as well as immigration, health, and revenue officials. In some circumstances, the police were also authorised to serve as vehicle inspectors, postal agents, and local court personnel.\n\nAfter [[State President|President]] [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]] lifted the ban on black political organisations and released leading dissidents from prison in 1990, he met with the police and ordered them help end apartheid, to demonstrate greater political tolerance, and to improve their standing in black communities.\n\nThrough the early 1980s, police units were integrated, but most police recruits had been trained in single-race classes, sometimes in institutions designated for one racial group. For example, most black police personnel had trained at Hammanskraal, near Pretoria; most whites, in Pretoria; most coloureds, Bishop Lavis, near Cape Town; and Asians at Chatsworth, near Durban.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saps.gov.za/training/history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926212250/http://www.saps.gov.za/training/history.htm |archive-date=26 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the late 1980s, the Hammanskraal college saw a large enrollment of black policemen.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=g6LtCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=south+africa+police+training+1980s#v=onepage&q=south%20africa%20police%20training%201980s&f=false |title = Settler and Creole Reenactment|isbn = 9780230244900|last1 = Agnew|first1 = V.|last2 = Lamb|first2 = J.|date = 28 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nAs the apartheid era ended, these programs were restructured to emphasise racial tolerance and respect for basic human rights.  The first racially integrated intake of recruits began slowly in 1993 and integration was complete by 1995. Today there is only one Police College to train new recruits in Pretoria. The police also increased recruitment among black youth and hired international police training experts to advise them on ways to improve race relations in the service.\n\nThe basic police training regimen includes courses in criminal investigation procedures, self-defense, musketry, tactical weapons training, drills, inspections, public relations and law. Specialized courses include crowd and riot control, detective skills, horsemanship and veterinary training, and advanced-level management skills. Their basic training lasted 6 months. During the time of the S.A. border war all Policemen were required to complete a 6-week intensive counter insurgence (C.O.I.N.) training at Maleoskop (now closed) in specialised weapons and \"bush warfare\" in preparation for their 3 months \"call up\". (Some volunteering and been called up more frequently.) Since 1990, South Africa also has provided training for police from [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], [[Malawi]] and the (then) [[Zaire]].\n\nThe climate of escalating violence in the early 1990s often posed even greater challenges to the police than they had faced in the 1980s, as violence shifted from anti-government activity to a mosaic of political rivalries and factional clashes. At the same time, many South Africans feared that the police were causing some of the criminal and political violence, and they demanded immediate changes in the police force to mark the end of apartheid-era injustices.\n\nTo meet the new challenges, the 91,000 active police personnel in 1991, including administrative and support personnel, were increased to more than 110,000 by 1993 and 140,000 by 1995. Throughout this time, police reserves numbered at least 37,000. In 1996 the combined active and reserve police represented a police-to-population ratio of almost 4.0 per 1,000.\n\nAs part of the overall reorganisation of the police, the government merged the formerly dreaded Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the police security branch to form a Crime Combatting and Investigation (CCI) Division. The new CCI, with responsibility for reversing the rising crime rate, combined the intelligence and operational resources of the security police with the anticrime capabilities of the CID.\n\nMinister of Law and Order [[Hernus Kriel]] in 1991 also appointed an [[ombudsman]] to investigate allegations of police misconduct. He increased the recruitment of black police personnel, formed a civilian riot-control unit that was separate from the SAP but worked with it, developed a code of police conduct agreed upon by a number of political parties and communities, and substantially increased police training facilities. In 1992 Kriel began restructuring the SAP into a three-tiered force consisting of a national police, primarily responsible for internal security and for serious crime; autonomous regional forces, responsible for crime prevention and for matters of general law and order; and municipal police, responsible for local law enforcement and for minor criminal matters. He also established police/community forums in almost every police station.\n\nIn 1995, the force absorbed the police forces of [[Bophuthatswana]], [[Ciskei]], [[Gazankulu]], [[KaNgwane]], [[KwaNdebele]]. [[KwaZulu]], [[Lebowa]], [[QwaQwa]], [[Transkei]], and [[Venda]], and was renamed the [[South African Police Service]].\n\n== Battle honours ==\n{{See also|List of South African Battle Honours}}\n{{BattleHonour|country=ZAR|\nSouth West Africa 1914-1915|\nWestern Desert 1941-43|\nGazala|\nBardia|\nPoint 204|\nSollum|\nGerman East Africa 1916-18|\nHalfaya|\nCommonwealth Keep|\nTobruk|\nRhodesia 1967-75|\n}}\n\n== Medals and decorations ==\n{{see also|South African Police decorations}}\nPolicemen and women were eligible for a number of awards.

From 1923, the SAP also had its own long service medal, which doubled as a medal for gallantry.
