He came into the limelight after his dismissal from public service, for participating in the strike of public servants in 1947. Soon after he joined the CMU.\n\nThe CMU was originally built in 1928 as a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] union in the mercantile sector.

It is morphologically similar to some other members of its genus, particularly the [[magnificent tree frog]] (''R.&nbsp;splendida'') and the [[white-lipped tree frog]] (''R.&nbsp;infrafrenata'').\n\nLarger than most Australian [[frog]]s, the Australian green [[tree]] frog reaches 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) or more in length. Its average lifespan in captivity, about 16 years, is long compared with most frogs. Docile and well suited to living near human dwellings, Australian green tree frogs are often found on window sills or inside houses, eating insects drawn by the light. The green tree frog screams when it is in danger to scare off its foe, and squeaks when it is touched.\n\nDue to its appearance and behavioural traits, the green tree frog is a popular [[exotic pet]] throughout the world. The skin secretions of the frog have [[Antiseptic|antibacterial]] and [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] properties that may prove useful in [[pharmacology|pharmaceutical]] preparations and which have rendered it relatively immune to the [[Decline in amphibian populations|population declines being experienced by many species of amphibian]]. It is a common species and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed its conservation status as being \"[[least concern]]\".\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[Image:Blue frog old.jpg|thumb|left|Original print of the green tree frog, published in John White's ''Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales''. Artist: S. Stone]]\nThe Australian green tree frog is a member of the tree frog family [[Pelodryadidae]] and is placed in the subfamily \"Pelodryadinae\" which is [[Endemism|endemic]] to Australia and New Guinea and includes over 100 species in the genera ''[[Ranoidea]]'' and ''[[Nyctimystes]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Ambystoma&where-species=rosaceum |title=Hylidae |work=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> The common name of the species, \"White's tree frog\", is in honour of [[John White (surgeon)|John White]]'s first description in 1790.<ref name=\"e383\"/><ref name=White1790>{{cite book |author=White, John |author-link=John White (surgeon) |title=Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales with sixty-five plates of non descript animals, birds, lizards, serpents, curious cones of trees and other natural productions |year=1790 |publisher=J.

The specimens White sent to England were damaged by the preservative and appeared blue.<ref name=e383>Egerton, p. 383.</ref> The colour of the frog is caused by blue and green [[pigment]]s covered in a yellow layer; the preservative destroyed the yellow layer and left the frog with a blue appearance.

A distinctive fatty ridge is seen over the eye, and the [[parotoid gland]] is moderately large. The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is golden and has a horizontally slit pupil, and the [[Tympanum (anatomy)|tympanum]] (a skin membrane similar to an [[eardrum]]) is visible just behind the eye. The limbs are short and robust, and large adhesive discs are at the end of the digits which provide grip while climbing. The fingers are about one-third webbed, and the toes nearly three-quarters webbed. The dorsal colour depends on the temperature and nature of the environment, ranging from brownish- or greyish-green to bright emerald green. The frog occasionally has small, irregularly shaped white spots on its back. Males have a greyish, wrinkled vocal sac under the throat, while the throat of females is white. The ventral surface in both sexes is creamy-white and rough in texture.<ref name=e383/><ref name=fact/>\n\nThis frog is similar in appearance to the [[magnificent tree frog]] (''R.&nbsp;splendida''), which inhabits only north-western Australia. Older members of that species have very large parotoid glands, which cover the entire top of their heads and droop over their tympana. The parotoid gland of the green tree frog is much smaller, and it also lacks the yellow speckling on the back and the yellow markings on the hand, groin, and thigh.<ref name=Tyler1977>{{cite journal |author1=Tyler, M.

During the day, they find cool, dark, and moist areas, such as tree holes or rock crevices, in which to sleep. They are not a rainforest species, but make use of the rain that falls almost daily and collects on leaves and in crevices, to keep themselves moist. Their skin exudes a waxy coating that helps prevent evaporation. In dry periods, they avoid desiccation by concealing themselves in a cool spot, perhaps by burrowing, and enveloping themselves in a cocoon made of shed skin and [[mucus]].<ref name=fact/>\n\nThe diet of the green tree frog consists mainly of [[insect]]s such as [[moth]]s, [[cockroach]]es, and [[locust]]s.

Its docile nature and long life expectancy make it an attractive choice for [[exotic pet]] owners. It is also one of the easier frogs to maintain; its diet is broad and it has a strong resistance to disease. One problem commonly associated with keeping this species as a pet is overfeeding; green tree frogs tend to become obese if overfed. In the wild, exertion of energy is required for a frog to capture its prey. However, in captivity, they are usually given live feed in a confined space. This lessens the activity needed for feeding, resulting in weight gain. An overweight member of the species deposits fat layers over the top of the head and body, giving it a \"dumpy\" appearance, thus the name \"dumpy tree frog\".<ref name=\"fact\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://whitestreefrog.net/ |title=White's Tree Frog|publisher=Frog World |accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe rover fireflies of the genus ''[[Photinus (beetle)|Photinus]]'' (including the [[Photinus pyralis|common eastern firefly]] of [[North America]]) are poisonous to these frogs, and an incident has been reported in which a firefly was fed to a green tree frog, which subsequently died.<ref name=Knight>{{cite journal |author1=Knight, Michael |author2=Glor, Richard |author3=Smedley, Scott R. |author4=Gonz\u00e1lez, Andr\u00e9s |author5=Adler, Kraig |author6=Eisner, Thomas |year=1999 |title=Firefly Toxicosis in Lizards |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=1981\u20131986 |doi=10.1023/A:1021072303515 }}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Leopardenfrosch-01.jpg|thumb|left|Dark specimen in K\u00f6ln Zoo]] \nAustralian law gives protected status to the green tree frog\u2014along with all [[Fauna of Australia|Australian fauna]]\u2014under the federal [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 |publisher=[[Australian Government]]| url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C03797 | accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref> The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] lists the green tree frog's conservation status as being of \"[[Least-concern species|least concern]]\", given its broad range, its large total population, and its tolerance of a variety of habitat types.

Also, some of the frogs have been found to be infected with the [[Chytridiomycota|chytrid]] fungus which causes the fatal amphibian disease [[chytridiomycosis]]. The frog's status in New Guinea is poorly studied, but in 2002, some 75,000 individuals were exported from Indonesia as part of the pet trade, and this may impact populations in some locations. The frog is present in a number of protected areas in New Guinea, and it has been successfully bred in some Australian zoos. Overall, the main threat to this species is the potential for a widespread disease epidemic.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\n==Use in research==\nAlthough frogs have lungs, they absorb oxygen through their skin; for this to occur efficiently, the skin must be moist. A disadvantage of moist skin is that [[pathogen]]s such as molds and bacteria can thrive on it, increasing the chance of infection. To counteract this, frogs secrete [[peptide]]s that destroy these pathogens. The [[secretion]] from the paratoid gland of the green tree frog contains 25 caerins, a group of [[peptide]]s with [[Antibiotics|antibacterial]] and [[Antiviral protein|antiviral]] properties.

It is morphologically similar to some other members of its genus, particularly the [[magnificent tree frog]] (''R.&nbsp;splendida'') and the [[white-lipped tree frog]] (''R.&nbsp;infrafrenata'').\n\nLarger than most Australian [[frog]]s, the Australian green [[tree]] frog reaches 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) or more in length. Its average lifespan in captivity, about 16 years, is long compared with most frogs. Docile and well suited to living near human dwellings, Australian green tree frogs are often found on window sills or inside houses, eating insects drawn by the light. The green tree frog screams when it is in danger to scare off its foe, and squeaks when it is touched.\n\nDue to its appearance and behavioural traits, the green tree frog is a popular [[exotic pet]] throughout the world. The skin secretions of the frog have [[Antiseptic|antibacterial]] and [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] properties that may prove useful in [[pharmacology|pharmaceutical]] preparations and which have rendered it relatively immune to the [[Decline in amphibian populations|population declines being experienced by many species of amphibian]].

The specific epithet, ''caerulea'', which is [[Latin]] for blue, has remained.<ref name=\"bruin2000\"/> This frog is sometimes referred to as ''Pelodryas caerulea'' in the scientific literature.<ref name=\"bruin2000\"/> In Australia, the frog is also known more simply as the \"green tree frog\", but that name is often given to the most common green arboreal species in a region, such as the [[American green tree frog]] (''Hyla cinerea'').\n\n==Description==\nThe green tree frog is a plump, rather large tree frog, and can grow up to {{convert|11.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} in length, with fully grown females being slightly larger than males. A distinctive fatty ridge is seen over the eye, and the [[parotoid gland]] is moderately large. The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is golden and has a horizontally slit pupil, and the [[Tympanum (anatomy)|tympanum]] (a skin membrane similar to an [[eardrum]]) is visible just behind the eye. The limbs are short and robust, and large adhesive discs are at the end of the digits which provide grip while climbing. The fingers are about one-third webbed, and the toes nearly three-quarters webbed. The dorsal colour depends on the temperature and nature of the environment, ranging from brownish- or greyish-green to bright emerald green. The frog occasionally has small, irregularly shaped white spots on its back. Males have a greyish, wrinkled vocal sac under the throat, while the throat of females is white. The ventral surface in both sexes is creamy-white and rough in texture.<ref name=e383/><ref name=fact/>\n\nThis frog is similar in appearance to the [[magnificent tree frog]] (''R.&nbsp;splendida''), which inhabits only north-western Australia. Older members of that species have very large parotoid glands, which cover the entire top of their heads and droop over their tympana. The parotoid gland of the green tree frog is much smaller, and it also lacks the yellow speckling on the back and the yellow markings on the hand, groin, and thigh.<ref name=Tyler1977>{{cite journal |author1=Tyler, M.

For most of the year, the frogs call from high positions, such as trees and gutters, but during the breeding season, they descend to near the ponds and pools, where they breed. Like many frogs, green tree frogs call not only to attract a mate, but also to advertise their location outside the mating season. They are particularly vocal after rain, but the reasons for this are unclear. They emit a stress call when they are in danger, such as when being attacked by a [[Predation|predator]] or when a person steps on the log in which one is concealed.<ref name=\"fact\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Litoria caerulea2.JPG|thumb|upright|Specimen climbing a tree]] \nThe green tree frog is native to northern and eastern regions of Australia and to the lowlands of New Guinea. Distribution is limited mostly to areas with warm, wet [[tropics|tropic]]al climates. Its range spans from [[Irian Jaya]] to [[Port Moresby]], and is most abundant on [[Daru Island]]. The [[International Conservation Union|IUCN]] suggests \"scattered locations\" in both New Guinea and Indonesia.<ref name=\"iucn\"/> In Australia, its range extends from the Kimberley region of [[Western Australia]] through the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]] to north and central [[New South Wales]] and the extreme northeasterly part of [[South Australia]].

In the United States, it is restricted to two regions within [[Florida]], where it was possibly introduced through the [[pet trade]]. Only small populations have been found there, and whether they have caused any [[ecology|ecological]] damage as an [[invasive species]] is unknown.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=2276 |title=''Litoria caerulea'' (White, 1790) |accessdate=4 April 2015 |year=2002 |work=Nonindigenous Aquatic Species |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218070740/http://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=2276 |archivedate=18 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In New Zealand, a several individuals were liberated in various locations in 1897 and 1899, and a further accidental introduction was made in the 1940s.

They favour old stands of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'', where the trees have hollows in which water collects. They are common along inland waterways and can survive in swamps (among the [[Phragmites|reed]]s) or in grasslands in cooler climates.<ref name=Vanderduys29>{{cite book|author=Vanderduys, Eric|title=Field Guide to the Frogs of Queensland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlTWBiWKY5gC&pg=PA29 |year=2012 |publisher=Csiro Publishing |isbn=978-0-643-10630-7 |page=29}}</ref>\n\nGreen tree frogs are little troubled by the presence of humans and often live in close association with them. They sometimes stray inside houses and are found in such places as sinks and toilets. They can also be found on outside windowsills at night, eating insects attracted to the light, and they may gather under outdoor lighting for the same reason.<ref name=e383/><ref name=Vanderduys29/> They sometimes occupy tanks ([[cistern]]s), downpipes (downspouts), and gutters, as these have high humidity and are usually cooler than the external environment. They may be drawn to the downpipes and tanks during the mating season because the fixtures amplify their calls.<ref name=\"fact\"/> Green tree frogs seem to have homing abilities, being able to return to locations from which they were caught from a considerable distance after being displaced.<ref name=\"Tyler1993\"/>\n\n==Ecology and behaviour==\n[[Image:Caerulea web.jpg|thumb|upright|A green tree frog in a [[spider web|spider's web]] after eating the spider]]\nGreen tree frogs are very docile and unafraid of humans.<ref name=\"fact\"/> They are [[nocturnal]]<ref name=e383/> and come out in early evenings to call (in spring and summer) and hunt for food. During the day, they find cool, dark, and moist areas, such as tree holes or rock crevices, in which to sleep. They are not a rainforest species, but make use of the rain that falls almost daily and collects on leaves and in crevices, to keep themselves moist. Their skin exudes a waxy coating that helps prevent evaporation. In dry periods, they avoid desiccation by concealing themselves in a cool spot, perhaps by burrowing, and enveloping themselves in a cocoon made of shed skin and [[mucus]].<ref name=fact/>\n\nThe diet of the green tree frog consists mainly of [[insect]]s such as [[moth]]s, [[cockroach]]es, and [[locust]]s. They also eat [[spider]]s and can include smaller frogs and even small [[mammal]]s (including [[bat]]s<ref>Mikula, P. 2015: Fish and amphibians as bat predators.

Many frogs flick out their sticky tongues at prey and the victim sticks to the tip and is drawn back into the mouth and consumed. A green tree frog uses this technique for smaller prey; for larger items, however, it pounces, then pushes the prey into its mouth with its hands.<ref name=\"Tyler1993\"/>\n\nThe frog has a few native predators, among them [[snake]]s and [[bird]]s. Since the [[History of Australia (1788\u20131850)|European settlement of Australia]], non-native predators have been introduced, primarily dogs and cats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perthzoo.wa.gov.au/animals-plants/australia/nocturnal-house/green-tree-frog/|title=Green tree frog|publisher=Perth Zoo|date=10 May 2013|accessdate=4 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701212846/http://www.perthzoo.wa.gov.au/animals-plants/australia/nocturnal-house/green-tree-frog/|archivedate=1 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The species has an average life expectancy in captivity of 16 years, but some have been known to live over 20 years.<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web | title=Fact Sheet: White's Tree Frog |work=Smithsonian National Zoological Park |publisher=Smithsonian Institution | url= http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/ReptilesAmphibians/Facts/FactSheets/Whitestreefrog.cfm| accessdate=4 April 2015 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051216192202/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/ReptilesAmphibians/Facts/FactSheets/Whitestreefrog.cfm| archivedate= 16 December 2005 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\nBreeding occurs between November and February.<ref name=AmphibiaWeb/> During the mating season, the males call from slightly elevated positions close to the still-water sources in which they choose to breed.<ref name=\"fact\"/> Clumps of between 200 and 2000 eggs are laid which initially float, but sink within 24 hours.

Its docile nature and long life expectancy make it an attractive choice for [[exotic pet]] owners. It is also one of the easier frogs to maintain; its diet is broad and it has a strong resistance to disease. One problem commonly associated with keeping this species as a pet is overfeeding; green tree frogs tend to become obese if overfed. In the wild, exertion of energy is required for a frog to capture its prey. However, in captivity, they are usually given live feed in a confined space. This lessens the activity needed for feeding, resulting in weight gain. An overweight member of the species deposits fat layers over the top of the head and body, giving it a \"dumpy\" appearance, thus the name \"dumpy tree frog\".<ref name=\"fact\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://whitestreefrog.net/ |title=White's Tree Frog|publisher=Frog World |accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe rover fireflies of the genus ''[[Photinus (beetle)|Photinus]]'' (including the [[Photinus pyralis|common eastern firefly]] of [[North America]]) are poisonous to these frogs, and an incident has been reported in which a firefly was fed to a green tree frog, which subsequently died.<ref name=Knight>{{cite journal |author1=Knight, Michael |author2=Glor, Richard |author3=Smedley, Scott R. |author4=Gonz\u00e1lez, Andr\u00e9s |author5=Adler, Kraig |author6=Eisner, Thomas |year=1999 |title=Firefly Toxicosis in Lizards |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=1981\u20131986 |doi=10.1023/A:1021072303515 }}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Leopardenfrosch-01.jpg|thumb|left|Dark specimen in K\u00f6ln Zoo]] \nAustralian law gives protected status to the green tree frog\u2014along with all [[Fauna of Australia|Australian fauna]]\u2014under the federal [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 |publisher=[[Australian Government]]| url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C03797 | accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref> The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] lists the green tree frog's conservation status as being of \"[[Least-concern species|least concern]]\", given its broad range, its large total population, and its tolerance of a variety of habitat types.

Also, some of the frogs have been found to be infected with the [[Chytridiomycota|chytrid]] fungus which causes the fatal amphibian disease [[chytridiomycosis]]. The frog's status in New Guinea is poorly studied, but in 2002, some 75,000 individuals were exported from Indonesia as part of the pet trade, and this may impact populations in some locations. The frog is present in a number of protected areas in New Guinea, and it has been successfully bred in some Australian zoos. Overall, the main threat to this species is the potential for a widespread disease epidemic.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\n==Use in research==\nAlthough frogs have lungs, they absorb oxygen through their skin; for this to occur efficiently, the skin must be moist. A disadvantage of moist skin is that [[pathogen]]s such as molds and bacteria can thrive on it, increasing the chance of infection. To counteract this, frogs secrete [[peptide]]s that destroy these pathogens. The [[secretion]] from the paratoid gland of the green tree frog contains 25 caerins, a group of [[peptide]]s with [[Antibiotics|antibacterial]] and [[Antiviral protein|antiviral]] properties.

In 1960, she became a member of the governing body of the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. When Matri Bhavan hospital, a 10-bed maternity care centre  where she had worked as a nurse came under the control of Ramakrishna Sarada Mission following its transfer from the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] she was appointed as its secretary.
