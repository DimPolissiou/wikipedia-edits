The standard defines the electrical connection between the chips to be a two wire, shared([[multidrop bus|multidrop]]), [[serial communication|serial data]] [[bus (computing)|bus]], one wire (<code>SCL</code>) being used as a clock to define the sampling times, the other wire (<code>SDA</code>) being used as a data line whose voltage can be sampled. The standard defines a signalling protocol in which multiple chips can control communication and thereby act as the bus [[master (device)|master]].\n\nThe I3C specification takes its name from, uses the same electrical connections as, and allows some backward compatibility with, the [[I\u00b2C]] bus, a de facto [[technical standard|standard]] for inter-chip communication, widely used for low-speed peripherals and sensors in computer systems. The I3C standard is designed to retain some [[backward compatibility]] with the [[I\u00b2C]] system, notably allowing designs where existing I\u00b2C devices can be connected to an I3C bus but still have the bus able to switch to a higher [[Bit rate|data rate]] for communication at higher speeds between compliant I3C devices. The I3C standard thereby combines the advantage of the simple, two wire I\u00b2C architecture with the higher communication speeds common to more complicated buses such as the [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] (SPI).\n\nThe I3C standard was developed as a collaborative effort between electronics and computer related companies under auspices of the Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance ([[MIPI Alliance]]). The I3C standard was first released to the public at the end of 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/business-wire/mipi-alliance-opens-access-to-its-mipi-i3c-sensor-interface-specification/article22310984.ece|title=MIPI Alliance opens access to its MIPI I3C Sensor Interface Specification|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.evaluationengineering.com/home/article/13014940/mipi-alliance-releases-mipi-i3c-sensorinterface-specification|title=MIPI Alliance releases MIPI I3C sensor-interface specification|website=www.evaluationengineering.com}}</ref>, although access requires the disclosure of private information.

None the less the default SDR mode at up to 12.5 Mbit/s is a major speed/capacity improvement over I2C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://resources.mipi.org/blog/mipi-alliance-delivers-new-i3c-basic-specification|title=MIPI Alliance Delivers New I3C Basic Specification|last=Group|first=Ken Foust, Chair of the MIPI I3C Working Group and MIPI I3C Basic Ad Hoc Working|website=resources.mipi.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== I3C V1.1 ===\nPublished in December of 2019, this specification is only available to MIPI member.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n=== Signal Pins ===\nI3C uses two signal pins on referred to as '''SCL''' and '''SDA'''.  In legacy and SDR modes, these signals are used in a way very similarly to I2C:\n\n* SCL is a conventional digital [[clock signal]], driven with a [[Push\u2013pull output|push-pull output]] by the bus current master during data transfers.   In transactions involving legacy slave devices, this clock signal generally has a [[duty cycle]], of approximately 50%, but in transactions with known I3C slaves, the bus master may switch to a higher frequency by altering the duty cycle to one where the SCL high period is limited to no more than 40 ns.   \n* SDA is carries the serial data stream, which may be driven by either master or slave, but is driven at a rate determined by the master's SCL signal.   For compatibility with the I2C protocol, SDA is initially driven with [[Open collector|open-drain outputs]], which limits the transmission speed.  For transactions involving a I3C slave, the SDA driver mode switches to push-pull after receiving some of the first bits in a packet, allowing substantial speed improvements.   This medium-speed feature is called standard data rate (SDR) mode\n\n=== Framing ===\nAll communications in I2C and I3C requires [[Frame (networking)|framing]] for synchronization.   Within a frame, changes on the SDA line should always occur while SCL is in the low state, so that SDA can be considered stable on the low-to-high transition of SCL.   Violations of this general rule are used for framing (at least in legacy and standard data rate modes.\n\nBetween data frames, the bus master holds SCL high, in effect stopping the clock, and SDA drivers are in a high-impedance state, permitting a pull-up resistor to float it to high.   A high-to-low transition of SDA, while SCL his high, is known as a START symbol, and signals the beginning a new data frame.   A low-to-high transition on SDA, while SCL is high, is the STOP symbol, ending a data frame.\n\nIn I2C, the START symbol is usually generated by a bus master, but in I3C, even slave devices can pull SDA low to indicate they want to start a frame.   This is used to implement some advanced I3C features, such as in-band interrupts, and hot-joins.    After the start, the bus master restarts the clock by driving SCL, and begins the bus arbitration process.\n\n=== Bus Arbitration ===\nAt the start of a frame, several devices may contend for use of the bus, and the bus arbitration process serves to select what device to service next.   In both I2C and I3C, bus arbitration is done based on the device's address, where devices with the lowest address have higher priority.    It is done with the SDA line in open-drain mode, which allows devices transmitting a binary 0 (low) to override devices signaling a binary 1.  Contending devices monitor the SDA line while driving it in open-drain mode.  If they detect a situation where SDA is low at a time their address required it to be high, they know they have lost the bus arbitration, and must cease their contention until the next frame begins.\n\n== Device classes ==\nOn an I3C bus in its default (SDR) mode, four different classes of devices can be supported:\n* I3C Main Master\n* I3C Secondary Master\n* I3C Slave\n* I2C Slave (legacy devices)\n\n== High Data Rate (HDR) options ==\nI3C Buses always initialize in SDR mode. To enter HDR mode, the I3C master issues an \"Enter HDR\" CCC Broadcast command which tells all I3C slaves that \nthe bus is in HDR mode. I3C slaves which do not support HDR have told that to the master and can ignore that command.\nI3C slaves which do not support HDR need to have an \"HDR exit\" detector which informs when it is time to listen to the bus again.\n\nHDR modes operate in either Double Data Rate (DDR) or Ternary Symbol modes.  These modes can only be on buses under one of two limited configurations:\n* A Pure I3C Bus \u2013 no I2C devices on the bus\n* A Mixed Fast Bus \u2013 Where I2C devices on the bus are equipped with a 50&nbsp;ns Spike Filter\n\nThere are three possible HDR modes:\n* HDR-DDR Double Data Rate \u2013 Data transfers on both clock edges, permitting throughput up to 20 Mbit/s (25 Mbit/s raw bit rate) \n* HDR-TSP Ternary Symbol for Pure Bus \u2013 Increases throughput by using both SDA and SCL wires for data.  Not allowed on mixed I2C\u2013I3C bus.\n* HDR-TSL Ternary Symbol for Legacy Bus \u2013 Permits buses including I2C devices (with a spike filter) to operate at higher speeds.\n\n== I2C features not supported in I3C ==\n* Pull-up resistors are provided by the I3C master.

The standard defines the electrical connection between the chips to be a two wire, shared([[multidrop bus|multidrop]]), [[serial communication|serial data]] [[bus (computing)|bus]], one wire (<code>SCL</code>) being used as a clock to define the sampling times, the other wire (<code>SDA</code>) being used as a data line whose voltage can be sampled. The standard defines a signalling protocol in which multiple chips can control communication and thereby act as the bus [[master (device)|master]].\n\nThe I3C specification takes its name from, uses the same electrical connections as, and allows some backward compatibility with, the [[I\u00b2C]] bus, a de facto [[technical standard|standard]] for inter-chip communication, widely used for low-speed peripherals and sensors in computer systems. The I3C standard is designed to retain some [[backward compatibility]] with the [[I\u00b2C]] system, notably allowing designs where existing I\u00b2C devices can be connected to an I3C bus but still have the bus able to switch to a higher [[Bit rate|data rate]] for communication at higher speeds between compliant I3C devices. The I3C standard thereby combines the advantage of the simple, two wire I\u00b2C architecture with the higher communication speeds common to more complicated buses such as the [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] (SPI).\n\nThe I3C standard was developed as a collaborative effort between electronics and computer related companies under auspices of the Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance ([[MIPI Alliance]]). The I3C standard was first released to the public at the end of 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/business-wire/mipi-alliance-opens-access-to-its-mipi-i3c-sensor-interface-specification/article22310984.ece|title=MIPI Alliance opens access to its MIPI I3C Sensor Interface Specification|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.evaluationengineering.com/home/article/13014940/mipi-alliance-releases-mipi-i3c-sensorinterface-specification|title=MIPI Alliance releases MIPI I3C sensor-interface specification|website=www.evaluationengineering.com}}</ref>, although access requires the disclosure of private information.

None the less the default SDR mode at up to 12.5 Mbit/s is a major speed/capacity improvement over I2C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://resources.mipi.org/blog/mipi-alliance-delivers-new-i3c-basic-specification|title=MIPI Alliance Delivers New I3C Basic Specification|last=Group|first=Ken Foust, Chair of the MIPI I3C Working Group and MIPI I3C Basic Ad Hoc Working|website=resources.mipi.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== I3C V1.1 ===\nPublished in December of 2019, this specification is only available to MIPI member.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n=== Signal Pins ===\nI3C uses two signal pins on referred to as '''SCL''' and '''SDA'''.  In legacy and SDR modes, these signals are used in a way very similarly to I2C:\n\n* SCL is a conventional digital [[clock signal]], driven with a [[Push\u2013pull output|push-pull output]] by the bus current master during data transfers.   In transactions involving legacy slave devices, this clock signal generally has a [[duty cycle]], of approximately 50%, but in transactions with known I3C slaves, the bus master may switch to a higher frequency by altering the duty cycle to one where the SCL high period is limited to no more than 40 ns.   \n* SDA is carries the serial data stream, which may be driven by either master or slave, but is driven at a rate determined by the master's SCL signal.   For compatibility with the I2C protocol, SDA is initially driven with [[Open collector|open-drain outputs]], which limits the transmission speed.  For transactions involving a I3C slave, the SDA driver mode switches to push-pull after receiving some of the first bits in a packet, allowing substantial speed improvements.   This medium-speed feature is called standard data rate (SDR) mode\n\n=== Framing ===\nAll communications in I2C and I3C requires [[Frame (networking)|framing]] for synchronization.   Within a frame, changes on the SDA line should always occur while SCL is in the low state, so that SDA can be considered stable on the low-to-high transition of SCL.   Violations of this general rule are used for framing (at least in legacy and standard data rate modes.\n\nBetween data frames, the bus master holds SCL high, in effect stopping the clock, and SDA drivers are in a high-impedance state, permitting a pull-up resister to float it to high.   A high-to-low transition of SDA, while SCL his high, is known as a START symbol, and signals the beginning a new data frame.   A low-to-high transition on SDA, while SCL is high, is the STOP symbol, ending a data frame.\n\nIn I2C, the START symbol is usually generated by a bus master, but in I3C, even slave devices can pull SDA low to indicate they want to start a frame.   This is used to implement some advanced I3C features, such as in-band interrupts, and hot-joins.    After the start, the bus master restarts the clock by driving SCL, and begins the bus arbitration process.\n\n=== Bus Arbitration ===\nAt the start of a frame, several devices may contend for use of the bus, and the bus arbitration process serves to select what device to service next.   In both I2C and I3C, bus arbitration is done based on the device's address, where devices with the lowest address have higher priority.    It is done with the SDA line in open-drain mode, which allows devices transmitting a binary 0 (low) to override devices signaling a binary 1.  Contending devices monitor the SDA line while driving it in open-drain mode.  If they detect a situation where SDA is low at a time their address required it to be high, they know they have lost the bus arbitration, and must cease their contention until the next frame begins.\n\n== Device classes ==\nOn an I3C bus in its default (SDR) mode, four different classes of devices can be supported:\n* I3C Main Master\n* I3C Secondary Master\n* I3C Slave\n* I2C Slave (legacy devices)\n\n== High Data Rate (HDR) options ==\nI3C Buses always initialize in SDR mode. To enter HDR mode, the I3C master issues an \"Enter HDR\" CCC Broadcast command which tells all I3C slaves that \nthe bus is in HDR mode. I3C slaves which do not support HDR have told that to the master and can ignore that command.\nI3C slaves which do not support HDR need to have an \"HDR exit\" detector which informs when it is time to listen to the bus again.\n\nHDR modes operate in either Double Data Rate (DDR) or Ternary Symbol modes.  These modes can only be on buses under one of two limited configurations:\n* A Pure I3C Bus \u2013 no I2C devices on the bus\n* A Mixed Fast Bus \u2013 Where I2C devices on the bus are equipped with a 50&nbsp;ns Spike Filter\n\nThere are three possible HDR modes:\n* HDR-DDR Double Data Rate \u2013 Data transfers on both clock edges, permitting throughput up to 20 Mbit/s (25 Mbit/s raw bit rate) \n* HDR-TSP Ternary Symbol for Pure Bus \u2013 Increases throughput by using both SDA and SCL wires for data.  Not allowed on mixed I2C\u2013I3C bus.\n* HDR-TSL Ternary Symbol for Legacy Bus \u2013 Permits buses including I2C devices (with a spike filter) to operate at higher speeds.\n\n== I2C features not supported in I3C ==\n* Pull-up resistors are provided by the I3C master. External pull-up resistor are no longer needed.\n* Clock Stretching \u2013 devices are expected to be fast enough to operate at bus speed. The I3C master is the sole clock source.\n* I2C Extended (10-bit) Addresses.  All devices on an I3C bus are addressed by a 7-bit address.  Native I3C devices have a unique 48-bit address which is used only during dynamic address assignments.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mipi.org/specifications/i3c%E2%84%A0-sensor-specification MIPI I3C]\n\n{{Computer-bus|collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I2c}}\n[[Category:Serial buses]]\n", "name_user": "Heron", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFraming:sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I3C_(bus)"}

After searching the mountains, [[Kublai Khan]] was overjoyed to find four fat sheep, and asked his subordinates to kill and cook them. At this moment, a soldier rushed in and reported that the enemies were approaching. The chef, knowing he had no time to cook the sheep, cut out ten pieces of thin meat with a knife, and stirred them into boiling water. When the color of the meat changed, the chef immediately put them in a bowl and sprinkled them with coarse salt. Kublai Khan ate a few pieces and turned around to lead the army. Later, [[Kublai Khan]] named this dish \"instant-boiled mutton\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.littlesheep.com/Brand/PrairieFire|title=\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a|website=www.littlesheep.com|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding ===\nZhang Gang is the founder of Little Sheep. There are two versions of how Little Sheep is created in Baotou. One theory is that Zhang Gang developed a method of eating hotpot without cooking, so he opened a hotpot restaurant with a few friends that grew wildly popular. Another theory is that Zhang Gang and a friend had a meal together and found out that the hot pot was delicious and easy to promote, so he spent a lot of money to buy the hot pot base receipt and began to develop the little sheep hot pot.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/48859.html|title=\u5f20\u94a2\uff0c\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u7684\u9910\u996e\u5e1d\u56fd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Zhang Gang and others worked out a recipe for Little Sheep.

Xilinguole grassland has become one of the world's four most famous grasslands due to its wide range of types of flora and fauna. Its rich aquatic plants provide sufficient natural food for sheep without supplementary feeding. Xilinguole grassland has high-quality natural grassland area of more than 180,000 square kilometers and a unique geographical position of 45 \u00b0 north latitude, which has created the natural quality of pastures and bred fertile Mongolian sheep, such as well-known \"Wuzhumuqin Sheep(\u4e4c\u73e0\u7a46\u6c81\u7f8a)\", \"Sunite Sheep(\u82cf\u5c3c\u7279\u7f8a)\", and \"Wulatetan Sheep(\u4e4c\u62c9\u7279\u6ee9\u7f8a)\". only six-month-old lamb will be selected, because the meat is fresh and tender, not smelly or stale.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Menu ==\nThe Little Sheep has been serving high-quality lamb, beef, and other specials.

Drill bits come in many sizes and shapes and can create different kinds of holes in many different materials. In order to create holes drill bits are usually attached to a [[drill]], which powers them to cut through the workpiece, typically by rotation. The drill will grasp the upper end of a bit called the ''shank'' in the [[chuck (engineering)|chuck]].\n\nDrill bits come in standard sizes, described in the [[drill bit sizes]] article. A comprehensive [[drill and tap size chart|drill bit and tap size chart]] lists [[Metric system|metric]] and [[Imperial system|imperial]] sized drill bits alongside the required screw tap sizes.  There are also certain specialized drill bits that can create holes with a non-circular cross-section.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI-15fovYEY |title=Practical demonstration of square-hole bit, YouTube video |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}</ref>\n\nWhile the term ''drill'' may refer to either a drilling machine or a drill bit while in use in a drilling machine, in this article, for clarity, ''drill bit'' or ''bit'' is used throughout to refer to a bit for use in a drilling machine, and ''drill'' refers always to a drilling machine.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Main|Drill bit sizes}}\n\nDrill bit geometry has several characteristics:\n\n*The '''spiral''' (or rate of twist) in the drill bit controls the rate of [[swarf|chip]] removal. A fast spiral (high twist rate or \"compact flute\") drill bit is used in high feed rate applications under low spindle speeds, where removal of a large volume of chips is required.  Low spiral (low twist rate or \"elongated flute\") drill bits are used in cutting applications where high cutting speeds are traditionally used, and where the material has a tendency to [[galling|gall]] on the bit or otherwise clog the hole, such as aluminum or copper.\n*The '''point angle''', or the angle formed at the tip of the bit, is determined by the material the bit will be operating in. Harder materials require a larger point angle, and softer materials require a sharper angle. The correct point angle for the hardness of the material influences wandering, chatter, hole shape, and wear rate.\n*The '''lip angle''' determines the amount of support provided to the cutting edge. A greater lip angle will cause the bit to cut more aggressively under the same amount of point pressure as a bit with a smaller lip angle. Both conditions can cause binding, wear, and eventual catastrophic failure of the tool. The proper amount of lip clearance is determined by the point angle. A very acute point angle has more web surface area presented to the work at any one time, requiring an aggressive lip angle, where a flat bit is extremely sensitive to small changes in lip angle due to the small surface area supporting the cutting edges.\n*The '''functional length''' of a bit determines how deep a hole can be drilled, and also determines the stiffness of the bit and accuracy of the resultant hole.  While longer bits can drill deeper holes, they are more flexible meaning that the holes they drill may have an inaccurate location or wander from the intended axis. Twist drill bits are available in standard lengths, referred to as Stub-length or Screw-Machine-length (short), the extremely common [[Drill bit sizes#Jobber-length drill|Jobber-length]] (medium), and Taper-length or Long-Series (long).\n\nMost drill bits for consumer use have straight shanks. For heavy duty drilling in industry, bits with [[Morse taper|tapered]] shanks are sometimes used. Other types of shank used include hex-shaped, and various proprietary quick release systems.\n\nThe diameter-to-length ratio of the drill bit is usually between 1:1 and 1:10. Much higher ratios are possible (e.g., \"aircraft-length\" twist bits, pressured-oil [[gun drill|gun drill bits]], etc.), but the higher the ratio, the greater the technical challenge of producing good work.\n\nThe best geometry to use depends upon the properties of the material being drilled. The following table lists geometries recommended for some commonly drilled materials.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Tool geometry<ref>{{Citation|first1 = Robert H.|last1 = Todd|first2 = Dell K.|last2 = Allen|first3 = Leo|last3 = Alting|year = 1994|title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide|publisher = Industrial Press Inc.|pages = 43\u201348|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6x1smAf_PAcC|isbn = 0-8311-3049-0|postscript =.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Many hard materials, such as carbides, are much more brittle than steel, and are far more subject to breaking, particularly if the drill is not held at a very constant angle to the workpiece; e.g., when hand-held.\n\n====Steels====\n*Soft '''low-carbon [[steel]]''' bits are inexpensive, but do not hold an edge well and require frequent sharpening. They are used only for drilling wood; even working with [[hardwood]]s rather than [[softwood]]s can noticeably shorten their lifespan.\n*Bits made from '''high-carbon steel''' are more durable than low-carbon steel bits due to the properties conferred by [[Heat treatment|hardening and tempering]] the material. If they are overheated (e.g., by frictional heating while drilling) they lose their [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]], resulting in a soft cutting edge. These bits can be used on wood or metal.\n*'''[[High-speed steel]]''' (HSS) is a form of [[tool steel]]; HSS bits are hard and much more resistant to heat than high-carbon steel. They can be used to drill metal, hardwood, and most other materials at greater cutting speeds than carbon-steel bits, and have largely replaced carbon steels.\n*'''[[Cobalt]] steel''' [[alloy]]s are variations on high-speed steel that contain more cobalt.  They hold their hardness at much higher temperatures and are used to drill [[stainless steel]] and other hard materials.  The main disadvantage of cobalt steels is that they are more brittle than standard HSS.\n\n====Others====\n*'''[[Tungsten carbide]]''' and other [[carbide]]s are extremely hard and can drill virtually all materials, while holding an edge longer than other bits. The material is expensive and much more brittle than steels; consequently they are mainly used for drill-bit tips, small pieces of hard material fixed or [[brazing|brazed]] onto the tip of a bit made of less hard metal. However, it is becoming common in job shops to use solid carbide bits. In very small sizes it is difficult to fit carbide tips; in some industries, most notably [[printed circuit board|PCB]] manufacturing, requiring many holes with diameters less than 1&nbsp;mm, solid carbide bits are used.\n*'''Polycrystalline diamond''' (PCD) is among the hardest of all tool materials and is therefore extremely resistant to wear.  It consists of a layer of diamond particles, typically about {{convert|0.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, bonded as a sintered mass to a tungsten-carbide support. Bits are fabricated using this material by either brazing small segments to the tip of the tool to form the cutting edges or by [[sintering]] PCD into a vein in the tungsten-carbide \"nib\".  The nib can later be brazed to a carbide shaft; it can then be ground to complex geometries that would otherwise cause braze failure in the smaller \"segments\". PCD bits are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and other industries to drill abrasive aluminum alloys, carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, and other abrasive materials, and in applications where machine downtime to replace or sharpen worn bits is exceptionally costly. PCD is not used on ferrous metals due to excess wear resulting from a reaction between the carbon in the PCD and the iron in the metal.\n\n===Coatings===\n[[Image:2mm diamond drill bits macro.jpg|thumb|Diamond-coated 2&nbsp;mm bits, used for drilling materials such as glass]]\n*[[Black oxide]] is an inexpensive black coating. A black oxide coating provides heat resistance and lubricity, as well as corrosion resistance. The coating increases the life of high-speed steel bits.\n*[[Titanium nitride]] (TiN) is a very hard ceramic material that can be used to coat a high-speed steel bit (usually a twist bit), extending the cutting life by three or more times. Even after sharpening, the leading edge of coating still provides improved cutting and lifetime.\n*[[Titanium aluminum nitride]] (TiAlN) is a similar coating that can extend tool life five or more times.\n*Titanium carbon nitride (TiCN) is another coating also superior to TiN.\n*Diamond powder is used as an abrasive, most often for cutting tile, stone, and other very hard materials. Large amounts of heat are generated by friction, and diamond-coated bits often have to be water-cooled to prevent damage to the bit or the workpiece.\n*[[Zirconium nitride]] has been used as a drill-bit coating for some tools under the [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]] brand name.\n*Al-Chrome Silicon Nitride (AlCrSi/Ti)N is a multilayer coating made of alternating nanolayer, developed using [[Chemical vapor deposition]] technique, is used in drilling [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer]] (CFRP) and CFRP-Ti stack. (AlCrSi/Ti)N is a superhard ceramic coating, which performs better than other coated and uncoated drill.<ref name=\"doi.org\">.

It comprises a cutting point at the tip of a cylindrical shaft with helical flutes; the flutes act as an [[Archimedean screw]] and lift [[swarf]] out of the hole.\n\nThe twist drill bit was invented by Steven A. Morse of [[East Bridgewater, Massachusetts]] in 1861.<ref>{{Citation|title = Modern machinery|page = 68|publisher = Modern Machining Publishing Company|year = 1899|volume = 5|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hZzmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA68|postscript =.}}</ref><ref>Stephen Ambrose Morse [http://www.datamp.org/patents/displayPatent.php?pn=38119&id=18675 US patent 38,119 Improvement in Drill-Bits. Twist Drill Bit], Granted: April 7, 1863</ref> The original method of manufacture was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a round bar, then to twist the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the drill bit is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] wheel to cut the [[Flute (cutting tool)|flutes]] in the same manner as [[gear cutting|cutting helical gears]].\n\nTwist drill bits range in diameter from {{convert|0.002|to|3.5|in|abbr=on}}<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|pp=829,846}}</ref> and can be as long as {{convert|25.5|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=846}}</ref>\n\nThe geometry and sharpening of the cutting edges is crucial to the performance of the bit. Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because sharpening them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace. For larger bits, special grinding jigs are available. A special [[tool grinder]] is available for sharpening or reshaping cutting surfaces on twist drill bits in order to optimize the bit for a particular material.\n\nManufacturers can produce special versions of the twist drill bit, varying the geometry and the materials used, to suit particular machinery and particular materials to be cut. Twist drill bits are available in the widest choice of tooling materials. However, even for industrial users, most holes are drilled with standard [[high speed steel]] bits.\n\n[[Image:5mm carbide bit displaying shallow point angle.jpg|thumb|A 5&nbsp;mm carbide bit displaying shallow point angle.]]\n\nThe most common twist drill bit (sold in general hardware stores) has a point angle of 118 degrees, acceptable for use in wood, metal, plastic, and most other materials, although it does not perform as well as using the optimum angle for each material. In most materials it does not tend to wander or dig in.\n\nA more aggressive angle, such as 90 degrees, is suited for very soft plastics and other materials; it would wear rapidly in hard materials. Such a bit is generally self-starting and can cut very quickly. A shallower angle, such as 150 degrees, is suited for drilling steels and other tougher materials. This style of bit requires a starter hole, but does not bind or suffer premature wear so long as a suitable feed rate is used.\n\nDrill bits with no point angle are used in situations where a blind, flat-bottomed hole is required. These bits are very sensitive to changes in lip angle, and even a slight change can result in an inappropriately fast cutting drill bit that will suffer premature wear.\n\n''Long series'' drill bits are unusually long twist drill bits. However, they are not the best tool for routinely drilling deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal to clear the flutes of swarf and to prevent breakage of the bit. Instead, [[gun drill]] bits are preferred for deep hole drilling.\n\n<gallery widths=\"240px\" heights=\"190px\">\nImage:drill twist 1.jpg|Twist drill bit cutting edges\nImage:drill twist morse.jpg|Twist drill bit with [[Machine taper#Morse|Morse taper]] shank\nImage:LongSeriesDrill-11 32.jpg|{{convert|11/32|in|mm|4|abbr=on}} drill bits - long-series morse, plain morse, jobber\n</gallery>\n\n===Step drill bits=== <!-- courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Step-bit]] links here. -->\nA '''step drill bit''' is a drill bit that has the tip ground down to a different diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar does not have the same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.<ref name=\"gillespie\">{{Citation|last = Gillespie|first = Laroux|title = Countersinking Handbook|pages = 78\u201379|publisher =Industrial Press Inc.|year = 2008|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=esWtCQuLWtIC&pg=PA78|isbn = 978-0-8311-3318-4|postscript =.}}</ref>\n\n===Unibit===\n[[Image:Pair of unibits aka step bits.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A pair of unibits.]]\n\nA '''unibit''' (often called a [[#Step drill bits|step drill bit]]) is a roughly [[cone (geometry)|conical]] bit with a [[stairs]]tep profile.<ref name=\"gillespie\"/> Due to its design, a single bit can be used for drilling a wide range of hole sizes. Some bits come to a point and are thus self-starting. The larger-size bits have blunt tips and are used for hole enlarging.\n\nUnibits are commonly used on sheet metal<ref name=\"gillespie\"/> and in general construction.  One drill bit can drill the entire range of holes necessary on a countertop, speeding up installation of fixtures. They are often used on softer materials, such as plywood, particle board, drywall, acrylic, and laminate.  They can be used on very thin sheet metal, but metals tend to cause premature bit wear and dulling.\n\nUnibits are ideal for use in electrical work where thin steel, aluminum or plastic boxes and chassis are encountered.  The short length of the unibit and ability to vary the diameter of the finished hole is an advantage in chassis or front panel work.  The finished hole can often be made quite smooth and burr-free, especially in plastic.\n\nAn additional use of unibits is deburring holes left by other bits, as the sharp increase to the next step size allows the cutting edge to scrape burrs off the entry surface of the workpiece. However, the straight flute is poor at chip ejection, and can cause a burr to be formed on the exit side of the hole, more so than a spiral twist drill bit turning at high speed.\n\nThe unibit was invented by Harry C. Oakes and [[patent]]ed in 1973.<ref>{{US patent|3758222}}</ref> It was sold only by the Unibit Corporation in the 1980s until the patent expired, and was later sold by other companies. Unibit is a trademark of [[Irwin Industrial Tools]].\n\nAlthough it is claimed that the stepped drill was invented by Harry C Noakes it was in fact first produced by Bradley Engineering, Wandsworth, London in the 1960s and named the Bradrad. It was marketed under this name until the patent was sold to Halls Ltd.uk by whom it is still produced.\n\n===Hole saw===\n{{Main|Hole saw}}\n[[Image:One and one quarter inch hole saw bit.jpg|right|thumb|200px|{{convert|1.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} hole saw bit.]]\nHole saws take the form of a short open cylinder with saw-teeth on the open edge, used for making relatively large holes in thin material. They remove material only from the edge of the hole, cutting out an intact disc of material, unlike many drills which remove all material in the interior of the hole.  They can be used to make large holes in wood, sheet metal and other materials.\n\n==Metal drill bits==\n\n===Center and spotting drill bits=== <!-- courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[Spot drill]] and [[center drill bit]] link here. -->\n[[Image:CenterDrills123456.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Center drill bits, numbers 1 to 6]]\n\n''Center drill bits'', occasionally known as Slocombe drill bits, are used in [[metalworking]] to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation in the end of a workpiece in which to mount a [[lathe center]]. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the ''center'' of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe ''center''. However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a ''spotting drill bit'' (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits ''combined-drill-and-countersinks'' in order to make it unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).\n\n====Use in making holes for lathe centers====\nCenter drill bits are meant to create a conical hole for \"between centers\" manufacturing processes (typically lathe or cylindrical-grinder work). That is, they provide a location for a (live, dead, or driven) center to locate the part about an axis. A workpiece machined ''between centers'' can be safely removed from one process (perhaps turning in a lathe) and set up in a later process (perhaps a [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] operation) with a negligible loss in the co-axiality of features (usually [[total indicator reading|TIR]] < {{convert|0.002|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}; and TIR < {{convert|0.0001|in|mm|3|abbr=on}} is held in cylindrical grinding operations, as long as conditions are correct).\n\n====Use in spotting hole centers====\nTraditional twist drill bits may tend to wander when started on an unprepared surface. Once a bit wanders off course it is difficult to bring it back on center. A center drill bit frequently provides a reasonable starting point as it is short and therefore has a reduced tendency to wander when drilling is started.\n\nWhile the above is a common use of center drill bits, it is a technically incorrect practice and should not be considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a ''spotting drill bit'' (or a ''spot drill bit'', as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.\n\nMost modern solid-carbide bits should not be used in conjunction with a spot drill bit or a center drill bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to [[chamfer]] a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nWhen drilling with a hand-held drill the flexibility of the bit is not the primary source of inaccuracy\u2014it is the user's hands.  Therefore, for such operations, a [[Center punch#Center|center punch]] is often used to spot the hole center prior to drilling a [[pilot hole]].\n\n===Core drill bit===\n[[File:HSS Core drills.jpg|thumb|150px|right|HSS core drills in various sizes]]\n[[File:Magnetic Drilling Machine from BDS.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A magnetic core drilling machine making hole with annular cutter (core drill)]]\n\nThe term '''core drill bit''' is used for two quite different tools.\n\n====Enlarging holes====\nA bit used to enlarge an existing hole is called a core drill bit. The existing hole may be the result of a [[core (manufacturing)|core]] from a [[casting]] or a stamped (punched) hole.  The name comes from its first use, for drilling out the hole left by a ''foundry core'', a cylinder placed in a mould for a casting that leaves an irregular hole in the product. This core drill bit is solid.\n\nThese core drill bits are similar in appearance to [[reamer]]s as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. Core drill bits differ from reamers in the amount of material they are intended to remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.\n\nUsing an ordinary two-flute twist drill bit to enlarge the hole resulting from a casting core will not produce a clean result, the result will possibly be out of round, off center and generally of poor finish. The two fluted drill bit also has a tendency to grab on any protuberance (such as [[flash (manufacturing)|flash]]) which may occur in the product.\n\n====Extracting core====\n{{Main|Annular cutter}}\nA hollow cylindrical bit which will cut a hole with an [[annulus (mathematics)|annular]] cross-section and leave the inner cylinder of material (the \"core\") intact, often removing it, is also called a core drill bit or [[annular cutter]]. Unlike other drills, the purpose is often to retrieve the core rather than simply to make a hole. A diamond core drill bit is intended to cut an annular hole in the workpiece. Large bits of similar shape are used for geological work, where a deep hole is drilled in sediment or ice and the drill bit, which now contains an intact core of the material drilled with a diameter of several centimeters, is retrieved to allow study of the [[stratum|strata]].\n\n===Countersink bit===\n{{Main|Countersink}}\nA countersink is a conical hole cut into a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use is to allow the head of a bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or below the surface of the surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.\n\n===Ejector drill bit===\nUsed almost exclusively for deep hole drilling of medium to large diameter holes (approximately {{convert|3/4|-|4|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}} diameter). An ejector drill bit uses a specially designed carbide cutter at the point. The bit body is essentially a tube within a tube. Flushing water travels down between the two tubes. Chip removal is back through the center of the bit.\n\n===Gun drill bit===\n{{Main|Gun drill}}\nGun drills are straight fluted drills which allow [[cutting fluid]] (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill's hollow body to the cutting face.\n\n===Indexable drill bit===\nIndexable drill bits are primarily used in [[CNC]] and other high precision or production equipment, and are the most expensive type of drill bit, costing the most per diameter and length.  Like [[Tool bit|indexable lathe tools]] and [[milling cutter]]s, they use replaceable carbide or ceramic inserts as a cutting face to alleviate the need for a tool grinder.  One insert is responsible for the outer radius of the cut, and another insert is responsible for the inner radius.  The tool itself handles the point deformity, as it is a low-wear task.  The bit is hardened and coated against wear far more than the average drill bit, as the shank is non-consumable.  Almost all indexable drill bits have multiple coolant channels for prolonged tool life under heavy usage.  They are also readily available in odd configurations, such as straight flute, fast spiral, multiflute, and a variety of cutting face geometries.\n\nTypically indexable drill bits are used in holes that are no deeper than about 5 times the bit diameter. They are capable of quite high axial loads and cut very fast.\n\n===Left-hand bit===\n[[Image:Left hand drill bit.jpg|thumb|An 1/8 inch left-hand drill bit]]\n\nLeft-hand bits are almost always twist bits and are predominantly used in the [[mass production|repetition]] engineering industry on screw machines or drilling heads. Left-handed drill bits allow a machining operation to continue where either the spindle cannot be reversed or the design of the machine makes it more efficient to run left-handed. With the increased use of the more versatile CNC machines, their use is less common than when specialized machines were required for machining tasks.\n\n[[Screw extractor]]s are essentially left-hand bits of specialized shape, used to remove common right-hand [[screw]]s whose heads are broken or too damaged to allow a screwdriver tip to engage, making use of a screwdriver impossible. The extractor is pressed against the damaged head and rotated counter-clockwise and will tend to jam in the damaged head and then turn the screw counter-clockwise, unscrewing it.  For screws that break off deeper in the hole, an extractor set will often include left handed drill bits of the appropriate diameters so that grab holes can be drilled into the screws in a left handed direction, preventing further tightening of the broken piece.\n\n===Metal spade bit===\nA spade drill bit for metal is a two part bit with a tool holder and an insertable tip, called an insert. The inserts come in various sizes that range from {{convert|7/16|to|2.5|in}}. The tool holder usually has a coolant passage running through it.<ref>McMaster-Carr, p. 2438, 116th edition.</ref> They are capable of cutting to a depth of about 10 times the bit diameter. This type of drill bit can also be used to make stepped holes.\n\n===Straight fluted bit===\nStraight fluted drill bits do not have a helical twist like twist drill bits do. They are used when drilling [[copper]] or [[brass]] because they have less of a tendency to \"dig in\" or grab the material.\n\n===Trepan===<!-- [[Trepan (drill bit)]] redirects here -->\n{{See also|Trepanning (drilling)|Cranial Drill}}\n\nA trepan, sometimes called a BTA drill bit (after the Boring and Trepanning Association), is a drill bit that cuts an annulus and leaves a center core. Trepans usually have multiple carbide inserts and rely on water to cool the cutting tips and to flush chips out of the hole. Trepans are often used to cut large diameters and deep holes. Typical bit diameters are {{convert|6|-|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} and hole depth from {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|71|ft|m}}.\n\n==Wood drill bits==\n\n===Lip and spur drill bits===\n[[Image:drill tip spur.jpg|right|thumb|200px|10.5 mm lip and spur bit]]\n\nThe '''lip and spur drill bit''' is a variation of the twist drill bit which is optimized for drilling in wood. It is also called the '''brad point''' bit or '''dowelling bit'''.\n\nConventional twist drill bits tend to wander when presented to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The centre of the drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.\n\nMetals are typically [[isotropic]], and an ordinary twist drill bit shears the edges of the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend to pull out of the wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.\n\nLip and spur drill bits are also effective in soft plastic. Conventional twist drill bits in a hand drill, where the hole axis is not maintained throughout the operation, have a tendency to smear the edges of the hole through side friction as the drill bit vibrates.\n\nIn metal, the lip and spur drill bit is confined to drilling only the thinnest and softest [[sheet metal]]s in a [[drill press]]. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges to take a very aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.\n\nLip and spur drill bits are ordinarily available in diameters from {{convert|3|-|16|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Wood spade bits===\nSpade bits are used for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause splintering when they emerge from the workpiece.  Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from the opposite side of the work.  Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a [[Drill bit#Installer bits|bell-hanger bit]]. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as \"paddle bits\".\n\nSpade drill bits are ordinarily available in diameters from 6 to 36&nbsp;mm, or \u00bc to 1\u00bd inches.\n\n<gallery widths=\"320px\" heights=\"180px\">\nImage:Spade bits.JPG|Spade bits\nImage:drill spade tiny.jpg|Tiny spade bit\n</gallery>\n\n===Spoon bits=== <!-- courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[Spoon bit drill]] links here -->\nSpoon bits consist of a grooved shank with a point shaped somewhat like the bowl of a spoon, with the cutting edge on the end. The more common type is like a gouge bit that ends in a slight point. This is helpful for starting the hole, as it has a center that will not wander or walk.  These bits are used by chair-makers for boring or reaming holes in the seats and arms of chairs. Their design is ancient, going back to Roman times. Spoon bits have even been found in Viking excavations. Modern spoon bits are made of hand-forged carbon steel, carefully heat-treated and then hand ground to a fine edge.\n\nSpoon bits are the traditional boring tools used with a brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that the angle of the hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is that they do not have a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.\n\nWhen reaming a pre-bored straight-sided hole, the spoon bit is inserted into the hole and rotated in a clockwise direction with a carpenters' brace until the desired taper is achieved. When boring into solid wood, the bit should be started in the vertical position; after a \"dish\" has been created and the bit has begun to \"bite\" into the wood, the angle of boring can be changed by tilting the brace a bit out of the vertical. Holes can be drilled precisely, cleanly and quickly in any wood, at any angle of incidence, with total control of direction and the ability to change that direction at will.\n\nParallel spoon bits are used primarily for boring holes in the seat of a [[Windsor chair]] to take the back spindles, or similar round-tenon work when assembling furniture frames in [[green woodworking]] work.\n\nThe spoon bit may be honed by using a slipstone on the inside of the cutting edge; the outside edge should never be touched.\n\n===Forstner bits===<!-- [[Forstner bit]], [[Webfoot auger]] & [[Forstner flange bit]] redirect here. -->\n[[Image:drill tip forstner.jpg|right|thumb|{{convert|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} Forstner bit]]\n[[Image:Forstner Bohrer 01.jpg|thumb|Another Forstner bit]]\n\nForstner bits, named after their inventor, [[Benjamin Forstner]], bore precise, flat-bottomed holes in wood, in any orientation with respect to the wood grain. They can cut on the edge of a block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes; for such applications they are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in hand-held electric drills. Because of the flat bottom of the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay.\n\nThe bit includes a center point which guides it throughout the cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers at the edge of the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bits shown in the images have two radial edges; other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.\n\nSawtooth bits are also available, which include many more cutting edges to the cylinder. These cut faster, but produce a more ragged hole. They have advantages over Forstner bits when boring into [[end grain]].\n\nBits are commonly available in sizes from {{convert|8|-|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} diameter. Sawtooth bits are available up to {{convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} diameter.\n\nOriginally the Forstner bit was very successful with gunsmiths because of its ability to drill an exceedingly smooth-sided hole.\n\n===Center bits===\nThe center bit is optimized for drilling in wood with a [[Brace (tool)|hand brace]]. Many different designs have been produced.\n\nThe center of the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There is no need for any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of thickness equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.\n\nThe edge of the bit has a sharpened spur to cut the fibers of the wood, as in the lip and spur drill bit. A radial cutting edge planes the wood from the base of the hole. In this version, there is minimal or no spiral to remove chips from the hole. The bit must be periodically withdrawn to clear the chips.\n\nSome versions have two spurs. Some have two radial cutting edges.\n\nCenter bits do not cut well in the end grain of wood. The central screw tends to pull out, or to split the wood along the grain, and the radial edges have trouble cutting through the long wood fibers.\n\nCenter bits are made of relatively soft steel, and can be sharpened with a file.\n\n<gallery widths=\"330px\" heights=\"250px\">\nImage:drill brace.jpg|A 19&nbsp;mm (3/4 inch) center bit, made sometime before 1950\nImage:drill tip brace.jpg|Center bit tip detail\n</gallery>\n\n===Auger bits===\nThe cutting principles of the auger bit are the same as those of the center bit above. The auger adds a long deep spiral flute for effective chip removal.\n\nTwo styles of auger bit are commonly used in hand braces: the '''Jennings''' or Jennings-pattern bit has a self-feeding screw tip, two spurs and two radial cutting edges. This bit has a double flute starting from the cutting edges, and extending several inches up the shank of the bit, for waste removal. This pattern of bit was developed by Russell Jennings in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe '''Irwin''' or solid-center auger bit is similar, the only difference being that one of the cutting edges has only a \"vestigal flute\" supporting it, which extends only about {{convert|1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}} up the shank before ending. The other flute continues full-length up the shank for waste removal. The Irwin bit may afford greater space for waste removal, greater strength (because the design allows for a center shank of increased size within the flutes, as compared to the Jenning bits), or smaller manufacturing costs. This style of bit was invented in 1884, and the rights sold to Charles Irwin who patented and marketed this pattern the following year.\n\nBoth styles of auger bits were manufactured by several companies throughout the early- and mid-20th century, and are still available new from select sources today.\n\nThe diameter of auger bits for hand braces is commonly expressed by a single number, indicating the size in 16ths of an inch. For example, #4 is 4/16 or 1/4&nbsp;in (6&nbsp;mm), #6 is 6/16 or 3/8&nbsp;in (9&nbsp;mm), #9 is 9/16&nbsp;in (14&nbsp;mm), and #16 is 16/16 or 1&nbsp;in (25&nbsp;mm). Sets commonly consist of #4-16 or #4-10 bits.\n\nThe bit shown in the picture is a modern design for use in portable power tools, made in the UK in about 1995. It has a single spur, a single radial cutting edge and a single flute. Similar auger bits are made with diameters from 6&nbsp;mm (3/16&nbsp;in) to 30&nbsp;mm (1 3/16&nbsp;in). Augers up to {{convert|600|mm|ft|abbr=on}} long are available, where the chip-clearing capability is especially valuable for drilling deep holes.\n\n<gallery widths=\"320px\" heights=\"170px\">\nImage:drill auger.jpg|{{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} auger bit for wood\nImage:drill tip auger.jpg|Auger bit tip detail\n</gallery>\n\n===Gimlet bits===\nThe gimlet bit is a very old design. The bit is the same style as that used in the [[Gimlet (tool)|gimlet]], a self-contained tool for boring small holes in wood by hand. Since about 1850, gimlets have had a variety of cutter designs, but some are still produced with the original version. The gimlet bit is intended to be used in a hand brace for drilling into wood. It is the usual style of bit for use in a brace for holes below about {{convert|7|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter.\n\nThe tip of the gimlet bit acts as a tapered screw, to draw the bit into the wood and to begin forcing aside the wood fibers, without necessarily cutting them. The cutting action occurs at the side of the broadest part of the cutter. Most drill bits cut the base of the hole. The gimlet bit cuts the side of the hole.\n\n<gallery widths=\"330px\" heights=\"180px\">\nImage:drill gimlet.jpg|Gimlet bit for wood, made sometime before 1950.\nImage:drill tip gimlet.jpg|Gimlet bit tip detail\n</gallery>\n\n===Hinge sinker bits===\n[[Image:drill tip 30mm hinge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|30&nbsp;mm hinge sinker bit]]\n\nThe hinge sinker bit is an example of a custom drill bit design for a specific application. Many European kitchen cabinets are made from [[particle board]] or [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF) with a laminated [[melamine resin]] veneer. Those types of [[pressed wood]] boards are not very strong, and the screws of butt [[hinge]]s tend to pull out. A specialist hinge has been developed which uses the walls of a {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter hole, bored in the particle board, for support. This is a very common and relatively successful construction method.\n\nA Forstner bit could bore the mounting hole for the hinge, but particle board and MDF are very abrasive materials, and steel cutting edges soon wear. A [[tungsten carbide]] cutter is needed, but the complex shape of a forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special drill bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has cutting edges of tungsten carbide brazed to a steel body; a center spur keeps the bit from wandering.\n\n=== Adjustable wood bits === <!-- courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[expansive drill bit]] links here. -->\n[[Image:Adjustable drill bit closeup.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An adjustable wood bit meant for use in a [[Brace (tool)|brace]]]]\n\nAn adjustable wood bit, also known as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a [[set screw]] to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill a wide variety of holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A [[ruler]] or [[vernier scale]] is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.\n\nThese bits are available both in a version similar to an auger bit or brace bit, designed for low speed, high torque use with a brace or other hand drill (pictured to the right), or as a high speed, low torque bit meant for a power drill. While the shape of the cutting edges is different, and one uses screw threads and the other a twist bit for the pilot, the method of adjusting them remains the same.\n\n==Other materials==\n\n===Diamond core bits===\n{{Main|Diamond core drill bit}}\n\nThe diamond masonry mortar bit is a hybrid drill bit, designed to work as a combination router and drill bit. It consists of a steel shell, with the diamonds embedded in metal segments attached to the cutting edge. These drill bits are used at relatively low speeds.\n\n===Masonry drill bits=== <!-- courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[star drill]] links here. -->\nThe masonry bit shown here is a variation of the twist drill bit. The bulk of the tool is a relatively soft steel, and is machined with a [[milling machine|mill]] rather than ground. An insert of [[tungsten carbide]] is [[brazing|brazed]] into the steel to provide the cutting edges.\n\nMasonry bits typically are used with a [[hammer drill]], which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow.  Hammer drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the [[Drill bit shank#SDS shank|SDS]] type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.\n\nMasonry bits of the style shown are commonly available in diameters from 3&nbsp;mm to 40&nbsp;mm. For larger diameters, core bits are used. Masonry bits up to {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} long can be used with hand-portable power tools, and are very effective for installing wiring and plumbing in existing buildings.\n\nA '''{{visible anchor|star drill bit}}''', similar in appearance and function to a hole punch or chisel, is used as a hand powered drill in conjunction with a [[hammer]] to drill into [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[masonry]]. A star drill bit's cutting edge consists of several blades joined at the center to form a star pattern.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Drill masonry.jpg|25\u00d7500&nbsp;mm [[Chuck (engineering)#Special Direct System (SDS)|SDS-plus]] masonry bit\nFile:Drill tip masonry.jpg|Masonry bit tip\nFile:Quadro40max.JPG|Rebar resistant bit with four carbide cutters\nFile:Star_drill2.jpg|Star drill\n</gallery>\n\n===Glass drill bits===\nGlass bits have a spade-shaped carbide point. They generate high temperatures and have a very short life. Holes are generally drilled at low speed with a succession of increasing bit sizes. Diamond drill bits can also be used to cut holes in glass, and last much longer.\n\n===PCB through-hole drill bits===\nA great number of holes with small diameters of about 1&nbsp;mm or less must be drilled in [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) used by [[electronic equipment]] with [[through-hole]] components. Most PCBs are made of highly abrasive [[fiberglass]], which quickly wears steel bits, especially given the hundreds or thousands of holes on most circuit boards. To solve this problem, solid [[tungsten carbide]] twist bits, which drill quickly through the board while providing a moderately long life,  are almost always used. Carbide PCB bits are estimated to outlast high speed steel bits by a factor of ten or more.  Other options sometimes used are diamond or diamond-coated bits.\n\nIn industry, virtually all drilling is done by [[computer numerical control|automated machines]], and the bits are often automatically replaced by the equipment as they wear, as even solid carbide bits do not last long in constant use. PCB bits, of narrow diameter, typically mount in a [[collet]] rather than a [[Chuck (engineering)|chuck]], and come with standard-size shanks, often with pre-installed stops to set them at an exact depth every time when being automatically chucked by the equipment.\n\nVery high rotational speeds\u201430,000 to 100,000 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] or even higher\u2014are used; this translates to a reasonably fast linear speed of the cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very vulnerable to breaking, particularly if the angle of the bit to the workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practical, and many general-purpose drilling machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.\n\nResharpened and easily available PCB drills have historically been used in many prototyping and home PCB labs, using a high-speed rotary tool for small-diameter bits (such as a Moto-Tool by Dremel) in a stiff drill-press jig.  If used for other materials these tiny bits must be evaluated for equivalent cutting speed vs material resistance to the cut (hardness), as the bit's [[rake angle]] and expected feed per revolution are optimised for high-speed automated use on fiberglass PCB substrate.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Two pcb bits.jpg|Two [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] drill bits.\nImage:Box of 02in pcb bits.jpg|A box of [[drill bit sizes|#76]] ({{convert|0.02|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) [[printed circuit board|PCB]] drill bits.\n</gallery>\n\n===Installer bits===\n\n====Fishing bit====\nInstaller bits, also known as '''bell-hanger''' bits or '''fishing''' bits, are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. The key distinguishing feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a [[fish tape]] could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the shank end as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be threaded through the shank end, the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the drilled hole. These bits are made for cement, block and brick; they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of [[Brooklyn, New York]] was issued {{US patent|597750}} for this invention on January 25, 1898.\n\nInstaller bits are available in various materials and styles for drilling wood, masonry and metal.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Installer bit overview.jpg|A {{convert|3/8|x|18|in|abbr=on|mm}} installer bit\nFile:Installer bit closeup 2.jpg|Closeup of installer bit. The fishing hole is visible in the flute in the center of the picture.\n</gallery>\n\n====Flexible shaft bit====\nAnother, different, bit also called an installer bit has a very long flexible shaft, typically up to {{convert|72|in|m}} long, with a small twist bit at the end. The shaft is made of [[Martensite|spring steel]] instead of hardened [[steel]], so it can be flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to drill through [[Wall stud|studs]] from a [[light switch]] box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.\n\nThis flexible installer bit is used in the US, but does not appear to be routinely available in Europe.\n\n==Drill bit shank==\n{{main|Drill bit shank}}\nDifferent shapes of shank are used. Some are simply the most appropriate for the chuck used; in other cases particular combinations of shank and chuck give performance advantages, such as allowing higher torque, greater centering accuracy, or efficient hammering action.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Drill and tap size chart]]\n*[[Drill bit shank]]\n*[[Drill bit sizes]]\n*[[Drill rod]]\n*[[Endmill]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Citation|last = Oberg|first = Erik|last2 = Jones|first2 = Franklin D.|last3 = Horton|first3 = Holbrook L.|last4 = Ryffel|first4 = Henry H.|title = [[Machinery's Handbook]]|place = New York|publisher = Industrial Press Inc.|year = 2000|edition = 26th|isbn = 0-8311-2635-3|postscript =.}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Drill bits}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051230001027/http://www.mfg.mtu.edu/marc/primers/drilling/nomen.html Nomenclature]\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|machopen}}\n{{Cutting and abrasive tools}}\n\n[[Category:Hole making]]\n[[Category:Woodworking tools]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the types used in drilling holes in the ground|Well drilling}}\n{{other uses}}\n[[File:Drillbits.jpg|thumb|From top to bottom: Spade, lip and spur (brad point), masonry bit and twist drill bits]]\n[[File:Pistol-grip drill.svg|thumb|Drill bit (upper left), mounted on a pistol-grip corded [[drill]].]]\n[[File:Drill bits 2017 G1.jpg|thumb|A set of masonry drill bits]]\n\n'''Drill bits''' are cutting tools used to remove material to create holes, almost always of circular cross-section. Drill bits come in many sizes and shapes and can create different kinds of holes in many different materials. In order to create holes drill bits are usually attached to a [[drill]], which powers them to cut through the workpiece, typically by rotation. The drill will grasp the upper end of a bit called the ''shank'' in the [[chuck (engineering)|chuck]].\n\nDrill bits come in standard sizes, described in the [[drill bit sizes]] article. A comprehensive [[drill and tap size chart|drill bit and tap size chart]] lists [[Metric system|metric]] and [[Imperial system|imperial]] sized drill bits alongside the required screw tap sizes.  There are also certain specialized drill bits that can create holes with a non-circular cross-section.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI-15fovYEY |title=Practical demonstration of square-hole bit, YouTube video |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}</ref>\n\nWhile the term ''drill'' may refer to either a drilling machine or a drill bit while in use in a drilling machine, in this article, for clarity, ''drill bit'' or ''bit'' is used throughout to refer to a bit for use in a drilling machine, and ''drill'' refers always to a drilling machine.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Main|Drill bit sizes}}\n\nDrill bit geometry has several characteristics:\n\n*The '''spiral''' (or rate of twist) in the drill bit controls the rate of [[swarf|chip]] removal. A fast spiral (high twist rate or \"compact flute\") drill bit is used in high feed rate applications under low spindle speeds, where removal of a large volume of chips is required.  Low spiral (low twist rate or \"elongated flute\") drill bits are used in cutting applications where high cutting speeds are traditionally used, and where the material has a tendency to [[galling|gall]] on the bit or otherwise clog the hole, such as aluminum or copper.\n*The '''point angle''', or the angle formed at the tip of the bit, is determined by the material the bit will be operating in. Harder materials require a larger point angle, and softer materials require a sharper angle. The correct point angle for the hardness of the material influences wandering, chatter, hole shape, and wear rate.\n*The '''lip angle''' determines the amount of support provided to the cutting edge. A greater lip angle will cause the bit to cut more aggressively under the same amount of point pressure as a bit with a smaller lip angle. Both conditions can cause binding, wear, and eventual catastrophic failure of the tool. The proper amount of lip clearance is determined by the point angle. A very acute point angle has more web surface area presented to the work at any one time, requiring an aggressive lip angle, where a flat bit is extremely sensitive to small changes in lip angle due to the small surface area supporting the cutting edges.\n*The '''functional length''' of a bit determines how deep a hole can be drilled, and also determines the stiffness of the bit and accuracy of the resultant hole.  While longer bits can drill deeper holes, they are more flexible meaning that the holes they drill may have an inaccurate location or wander from the intended axis. Twist drill bits are available in standard lengths, referred to as Stub-length or Screw-Machine-length (short), the extremely common [[Drill bit sizes#Jobber-length drill|Jobber-length]] (medium), and Taper-length or Long-Series (long).\n\nMost drill bits for consumer use have straight shanks. For heavy duty drilling in industry, bits with [[Morse taper|tapered]] shanks are sometimes used. Other types of shank used include hex-shaped, and various proprietary quick release systems.\n\nThe diameter-to-length ratio of the drill bit is usually between 1:1 and 1:10. Much higher ratios are possible (e.g., \"aircraft-length\" twist bits, pressured-oil [[gun drill|gun drill bits]], etc.), but the higher the ratio, the greater the technical challenge of producing good work.\n\nThe best geometry to use depends upon the properties of the material being drilled. The following table lists geometries recommended for some commonly drilled materials.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Tool geometry<ref>{{Citation|first1 = Robert H.|last1 = Todd|first2 = Dell K.|last2 = Allen|first3 = Leo|last3 = Alting|year = 1994|title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide|publisher = Industrial Press Inc.|pages = 43\u201348|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6x1smAf_PAcC|isbn = 0-8311-3049-0|postscript =.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Many hard materials, such as carbides, are much more brittle than steel, and are far more subject to breaking, particularly if the drill is not held at a very constant angle to the workpiece; e.g., when hand-held.\n\n====Steels====\n*Soft '''low-carbon [[steel]]''' bits are inexpensive, but do not hold an edge well and require frequent sharpening. They are used only for drilling wood; even working with [[hardwood]]s rather than [[softwood]]s can noticeably shorten their lifespan.\n*Bits made from '''high-carbon steel''' are more durable than low-carbon steel bits due to the properties conferred by [[Heat treatment|hardening and tempering]] the material. If they are overheated (e.g., by frictional heating while drilling) they lose their [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]], resulting in a soft cutting edge. These bits can be used on wood or metal.\n*'''[[High-speed steel]]''' (HSS) is a form of [[tool steel]]; HSS bits are hard and much more resistant to heat than high-carbon steel. They can be used to drill metal, hardwood, and most other materials at greater cutting speeds than carbon-steel bits, and have largely replaced carbon steels.\n*'''[[Cobalt]] steel''' [[alloy]]s are variations on high-speed steel that contain more cobalt.  They hold their hardness at much higher temperatures and are used to drill [[stainless steel]] and other hard materials.  The main disadvantage of cobalt steels is that they are more brittle than standard HSS.\n\n====Others====\n*'''[[Tungsten carbide]]''' and other [[carbide]]s are extremely hard and can drill virtually all materials, while holding an edge longer than other bits. The material is expensive and much more brittle than steels; consequently they are mainly used for drill-bit tips, small pieces of hard material fixed or [[brazing|brazed]] onto the tip of a bit made of less hard metal. However, it is becoming common in job shops to use solid carbide bits. In very small sizes it is difficult to fit carbide tips; in some industries, most notably [[printed circuit board|PCB]] manufacturing, requiring many holes with diameters less than 1&nbsp;mm, solid carbide bits are used.\n*'''Polycrystalline diamond''' (PCD) is among the hardest of all tool materials and is therefore extremely resistant to wear.  It consists of a layer of diamond particles, typically about {{convert|0.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, bonded as a sintered mass to a tungsten-carbide support. Bits are fabricated using this material by either brazing small segments to the tip of the tool to form the cutting edges or by [[sintering]] PCD into a vein in the tungsten-carbide \"nib\".  The nib can later be brazed to a carbide shaft; it can then be ground to complex geometries that would otherwise cause braze failure in the smaller \"segments\". PCD bits are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and other industries to drill abrasive aluminum alloys, carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, and other abrasive materials, and in applications where machine downtime to replace or sharpen worn bits is exceptionally costly. PCD is not used on ferrous metals due to excess wear resulting from a reaction between the carbon in the PCD and the iron in the metal.\n\n===Coatings===\n[[Image:2mm diamond drill bits macro.jpg|thumb|Diamond-coated 2&nbsp;mm bits, used for drilling materials such as glass]]\n*[[Black oxide]] is an inexpensive black coating. A black oxide coating provides heat resistance and lubricity, as well as corrosion resistance. The coating increases the life of high-speed steel bits.\n*[[Titanium nitride]] (TiN) is a very hard ceramic material that can be used to coat a high-speed steel bit (usually a twist bit), extending the cutting life by three or more times. Even after sharpening, the leading edge of coating still provides improved cutting and lifetime.\n*[[Titanium aluminum nitride]] (TiAlN) is a similar coating that can extend tool life five or more times.\n*Titanium carbon nitride (TiCN) is another coating also superior to TiN.\n*Diamond powder is used as an abrasive, most often for cutting tile, stone, and other very hard materials. Large amounts of heat are generated by friction, and diamond-coated bits often have to be water-cooled to prevent damage to the bit or the workpiece.\n*[[Zirconium nitride]] has been used as a drill-bit coating for some tools under the [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]] brand name.\n*Al-Chrome Silicon Nitride (AlCrSi/Ti)N is a multilayer coating made of alternating nanolayer, developed using [[Chemical vapor deposition]] technique, is used in drilling [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer]] (CFRP) and CFRP-Ti stack. (AlCrSi/Ti)N is a superhard ceramic coating, which performs better than other coated and uncoated drill.<ref name=\"doi.org\">.

It comprises a cutting point at the tip of a cylindrical shaft with helical flutes; the flutes act as an [[Archimedean screw]] and lift [[swarf]] out of the hole.\n\nThe twist drill bit was invented by Steven A. Morse of [[East Bridgewater, Massachusetts]] in 1861.<ref>{{Citation|title = Modern machinery|page = 68|publisher = Modern Machining Publishing Company|year = 1899|volume = 5|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hZzmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA68|postscript =.}}</ref><ref>Stephen Ambrose Morse [http://www.datamp.org/patents/displayPatent.php?pn=38119&id=18675 US patent 38,119 Improvement in Drill-Bits. Twist Drill Bit], Granted: April 7, 1863</ref> The original method of manufacture was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a round bar, then to twist the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the drill bit is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] wheel to cut the [[Flute (cutting tool)|flutes]] in the same manner as [[gear cutting|cutting helical gears]].\n\nTwist drill bits range in diameter from {{convert|0.002|to|3.5|in|abbr=on}}<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|pp=829,846}}</ref> and can be as long as {{convert|25.5|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=846}}</ref>\n\nThe geometry and sharpening of the cutting edges is crucial to the performance of the bit. Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because sharpening them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace. For larger bits, special grinding jigs are available. A special [[tool grinder]] is available for sharpening or reshaping cutting surfaces on twist drill bits in order to optimize the bit for a particular material.\n\nManufacturers can produce special versions of the twist drill bit, varying the geometry and the materials used, to suit particular machinery and particular materials to be cut. Twist drill bits are available in the widest choice of tooling materials. However, even for industrial users, most holes are drilled with standard [[high speed steel]] bits.\n\n[[Image:5mm carbide bit displaying shallow point angle.jpg|thumb|A 5&nbsp;mm carbide bit displaying shallow point angle.]]\n\nThe most common twist drill bit (sold in general hardware stores) has a point angle of 118 degrees, acceptable for use in wood, metal, plastic, and most other materials, although it does not perform as well as using the optimum angle for each material. In most materials it does not tend to wander or dig in.\n\nA more aggressive angle, such as 90 degrees, is suited for very soft plastics and other materials; it would wear rapidly in hard materials. Such a bit is generally self-starting and can cut very quickly. A shallower angle, such as 150 degrees, is suited for drilling steels and other tougher materials. This style of bit requires a starter hole, but does not bind or suffer premature wear so long as a suitable feed rate is used.\n\nDrill bits with no point angle are used in situations where a blind, flat-bottomed hole is required. These bits are very sensitive to changes in lip angle, and even a slight change can result in an inappropriately fast cutting drill bit that will suffer premature wear.\n\n''Long series'' drill bits are unusually long twist drill bits. However, they are not the best tool for routinely drilling deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal to clear the flutes of swarf and to prevent breakage of the bit. Instead, [[gun drill]] bits are preferred for deep hole drilling.\n\n<gallery widths=\"240px\" heights=\"190px\">\nImage:drill twist 1.jpg|Twist drill bit cutting edges\nImage:drill twist morse.jpg|Twist drill bit with [[Machine taper#Morse|Morse taper]] shank\nImage:LongSeriesDrill-11 32.jpg|{{convert|11/32|in|mm|4|abbr=on}} drill bits - long-series morse, plain morse, jobber\n</gallery>\n\n===Step drill bits=== <!-- courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Step-bit]] links here. -->\nA '''step drill bit''' is a drill bit that has the tip ground down to a different diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar does not have the same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.<ref name=\"gillespie\">{{Citation|last = Gillespie|first = Laroux|title = Countersinking Handbook|pages = 78\u201379|publisher =Industrial Press Inc.|year = 2008|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=esWtCQuLWtIC&pg=PA78|isbn = 978-0-8311-3318-4|postscript =.}}</ref>\n\n===Unibit===\n[[Image:Pair of unibits aka step bits.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A pair of unibits.]]\n\nA '''unibit''' (often called a [[#Step drill bits|step drill bit]]) is a roughly [[cone (geometry)|conical]] bit with a [[stairs]]tep profile.<ref name=\"gillespie\"/> Due to its design, a single bit can be used for drilling a wide range of hole sizes. Some bits come to a point and are thus self-starting. The larger-size bits have blunt tips and are used for hole enlarging.\n\nUnibits are commonly used on sheet metal<ref name=\"gillespie\"/> and in general construction.  One drill bit can drill the entire range of holes necessary on a countertop, speeding up installation of fixtures. They are often used on softer materials, such as plywood, particle board, drywall, acrylic, and laminate.  They can be used on very thin sheet metal, but metals tend to cause premature bit wear and dulling.\n\nUnibits are ideal for use in electrical work where thin steel, aluminum or plastic boxes and chassis are encountered.  The short length of the unibit and ability to vary the diameter of the finished hole is an advantage in chassis or front panel work.  The finished hole can often be made quite smooth and burr-free, especially in plastic.\n\nAn additional use of unibits is deburring holes left by other bits, as the sharp increase to the next step size allows the cutting edge to scrape burrs off the entry surface of the workpiece. However, the straight flute is poor at chip ejection, and can cause a burr to be formed on the exit side of the hole, more so than a spiral twist drill bit turning at high speed.\n\nThe unibit was invented by Harry C. Oakes and [[patent]]ed in 1973.<ref>{{US patent|3758222}}</ref> It was sold only by the Unibit Corporation in the 1980s until the patent expired, and was later sold by other companies. Unibit is a trademark of [[Irwin Industrial Tools]].\n\nAlthough it is claimed that the stepped drill was invented by Harry C Noakes it was in fact first produced by Bradley Engineering, Wandsworth, London in the 1960s and named the Bradrad. It was marketed under this name until the patent was sold to Halls Ltd.uk by whom it is still produced.\n\n===Hole saw===\n{{Main|Hole saw}}\n[[Image:One and one quarter inch hole saw bit.jpg|right|thumb|200px|{{convert|1.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} hole saw bit.]]\nHole saws take the form of a short open cylinder with saw-teeth on the open edge, used for making relatively large holes in thin material. They remove material only from the edge of the hole, cutting out an intact disc of material, unlike many drills which remove all material in the interior of the hole.  They can be used to make large holes in wood, sheet metal and other materials.\n\n==Metal drill bits==\n\n===Center and spotting drill bits=== <!-- courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[Spot drill]] and [[center drill bit]] link here. -->\n[[Image:CenterDrills123456.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Center drill bits, numbers 1 to 6]]\n\n''Center drill bits'', occasionally known as Slocombe drill bits, are used in [[metalworking]] to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation in the end of a workpiece in which to mount a [[lathe center]]. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the ''center'' of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe ''center''. However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a ''spotting drill bit'' (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits ''combined-drill-and-countersinks'' in order to make it unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).\n\n====Use in making holes for lathe centers====\nCenter drill bits are meant to create a conical hole for \"between centers\" manufacturing processes (typically lathe or cylindrical-grinder work). That is, they provide a location for a (live, dead, or driven) center to locate the part about an axis. A workpiece machined ''between centers'' can be safely removed from one process (perhaps turning in a lathe) and set up in a later process (perhaps a [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] operation) with a negligible loss in the co-axiality of features (usually [[total indicator reading|TIR]] < {{convert|0.002|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}; and TIR < {{convert|0.0001|in|mm|3|abbr=on}} is held in cylindrical grinding operations, as long as conditions are correct).\n\n====Use in spotting hole centers====\nTraditional twist drill bits may tend to wander when started on an unprepared surface. Once a bit wanders off course it is difficult to bring it back on center. A center drill bit frequently provides a reasonable starting point as it is short and therefore has a reduced tendency to wander when drilling is started.\n\nWhile the above is a common use of center drill bits, it is a technically incorrect practice and should not be considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a ''spotting drill bit'' (or a ''spot drill bit'', as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.\n\nMost modern solid-carbide bits should not be used in conjunction with a spot drill bit or a center drill bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to [[chamfer]] a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nWhen drilling with a hand-held drill the flexibility of the bit is not the primary source of inaccuracy\u2014it is the user's hands.  Therefore, for such operations, a [[Center punch#Center|center punch]] is often used to spot the hole center prior to drilling a [[pilot hole]].\n\n===Core drill bit===\n[[File:HSS Core drills.jpg|thumb|150px|right|HSS core drills in various sizes]]\n[[File:Magnetic Drilling Machine from BDS.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A magnetic core drilling machine making hole with annular cutter (core drill)]]\n\nThe term '''core drill bit''' is used for two quite different tools.\n\n====Enlarging holes====\nA bit used to enlarge an existing hole is called a core drill bit. The existing hole may be the result of a [[core (manufacturing)|core]] from a [[casting]] or a stamped (punched) hole.  The name comes from its first use, for drilling out the hole left by a ''foundry core'', a cylinder placed in a mould for a casting that leaves an irregular hole in the product. This core drill bit is solid.\n\nThese core drill bits are similar in appearance to [[reamer]]s as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. Core drill bits differ from reamers in the amount of material they are intended to remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.\n\nUsing an ordinary two-flute twist drill bit to enlarge the hole resulting from a casting core will not produce a clean result, the result will possibly be out of round, off center and generally of poor finish. The two fluted drill bit also has a tendency to grab on any protuberance (such as [[flash (manufacturing)|flash]]) which may occur in the product.\n\n====Extracting core====\n{{Main|Annular cutter}}\nA hollow cylindrical bit which will cut a hole with an [[annulus (mathematics)|annular]] cross-section and leave the inner cylinder of material (the \"core\") intact, often removing it, is also called a core drill bit or [[annular cutter]]. Unlike other drills, the purpose is often to retrieve the core rather than simply to make a hole. A diamond core drill bit is intended to cut an annular hole in the workpiece. Large bits of similar shape are used for geological work, where a deep hole is drilled in sediment or ice and the drill bit, which now contains an intact core of the material drilled with a diameter of several centimeters, is retrieved to allow study of the [[stratum|strata]].\n\n===Countersink bit===\n{{Main|Countersink}}\nA countersink is a conical hole cut into a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use is to allow the head of a bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or below the surface of the surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.\n\n===Ejector drill bit===\nUsed almost exclusively for deep hole drilling of medium to large diameter holes (approximately {{convert|3/4|-|4|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}} diameter). An ejector drill bit uses a specially designed carbide cutter at the point. The bit body is essentially a tube within a tube. Flushing water travels down between the two tubes. Chip removal is back through the center of the bit.\n\n===Gun drill bit===\n{{Main|Gun drill}}\nGun drills are straight fluted drills which allow [[cutting fluid]] (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill's hollow body to the cutting face.\n\n===Indexable drill bit===\nIndexable drill bits are primarily used in [[CNC]] and other high precision or production equipment, and are the most expensive type of drill bit, costing the most per diameter and length.  Like [[Tool bit|indexable lathe tools]] and [[milling cutter]]s, they use replaceable carbide or ceramic inserts as a cutting face to alleviate the need for a tool grinder.  One insert is responsible for the outer radius of the cut, and another insert is responsible for the inner radius.  The tool itself handles the point deformity, as it is a low-wear task.  The bit is hardened and coated against wear far more than the average drill bit, as the shank is non-consumable.  Almost all indexable drill bits have multiple coolant channels for prolonged tool life under heavy usage.  They are also readily available in odd configurations, such as straight flute, fast spiral, multiflute, and a variety of cutting face geometries.\n\nTypically indexable drill bits are used in holes that are no deeper than about 5 times the bit diameter. They are capable of quite high axial loads and cut very fast.\n\n===Left-hand bit===\n[[Image:Left hand drill bit.jpg|thumb|An 1/8 inch left-hand drill bit]]\n\nLeft-hand bits are almost always twist bits and are predominantly used in the [[mass production|repetition]] engineering industry on screw machines or drilling heads. Left-handed drill bits allow a machining operation to continue where either the spindle cannot be reversed or the design of the machine makes it more efficient to run left-handed. With the increased use of the more versatile CNC machines, their use is less common than when specialized machines were required for machining tasks.\n\n[[Screw extractor]]s are essentially left-hand bits of specialized shape, used to remove common right-hand [[screw]]s whose heads are broken or too damaged to allow a screwdriver tip to engage, making use of a screwdriver impossible. The extractor is pressed against the damaged head and rotated counter-clockwise and will tend to jam in the damaged head and then turn the screw counter-clockwise, unscrewing it.  For screws that break off deeper in the hole, an extractor set will often include left handed drill bits of the appropriate diameters so that grab holes can be drilled into the screws in a left handed direction, preventing further tightening of the broken piece.\n\n===Metal spade bit===\nA spade drill bit for metal is a two part bit with a tool holder and an insertable tip, called an insert. The inserts come in various sizes that range from {{convert|7/16|to|2.5|in}}. The tool holder usually has a coolant passage running through it.<ref>McMaster-Carr, p. 2438, 116th edition.</ref> They are capable of cutting to a depth of about 10 times the bit diameter. This type of drill bit can also be used to make stepped holes.\n\n===Straight fluted bit===\nStraight fluted drill bits do not have a helical twist like twist drill bits do. They are used when drilling [[copper]] or [[brass]] because they have less of a tendency to \"dig in\" or grab the material.\n\n===Trepan===<!-- [[Trepan (drill bit)]] redirects here -->\n{{See also|Trepanning (drilling)|Cranial Drill}}\n\nA trepan, sometimes called a BTA drill bit (after the Boring and Trepanning Association), is a drill bit that cuts an annulus and leaves a center core. Trepans usually have multiple carbide inserts and rely on water to cool the cutting tips and to flush chips out of the hole. Trepans are often used to cut large diameters and deep holes. Typical bit diameters are {{convert|6|-|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} and hole depth from {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|71|ft|m}}.\n\n==Wood drill bits==\n\n===Lip and spur drill bits===\n[[Image:drill tip spur.jpg|right|thumb|200px|10.5 mm lip and spur bit]]\n\nThe '''lip and spur drill bit''' is a variation of the twist drill bit which is optimized for drilling in wood. It is also called the '''brad point''' bit or '''dowelling bit'''.\n\nConventional twist drill bits tend to wander when presented to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The centre of the drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.\n\nMetals are typically [[isotropic]], and an ordinary twist drill bit shears the edges of the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend to pull out of the wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.\n\nLip and spur drill bits are also effective in soft plastic. Conventional twist drill bits in a hand drill, where the hole axis is not maintained throughout the operation, have a tendency to smear the edges of the hole through side friction as the drill bit vibrates.\n\nIn metal, the lip and spur drill bit is confined to drilling only the thinnest and softest [[sheet metal]]s in a [[drill press]]. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges to take a very aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.\n\nLip and spur drill bits are ordinarily available in diameters from {{convert|3|-|16|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Wood spade bits===\nSpade bits are used for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause splintering when they emerge from the workpiece.  Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from the opposite side of the work.  Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a [[Drill bit#Installer bits|bell-hanger bit]]. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as \"paddle bits\".\n\nSpade drill bits are ordinarily available in diameters from 6 to 36&nbsp;mm, or \u00bc to 1\u00bd inches.\n\n<gallery widths=\"320px\" heights=\"180px\">\nImage:Spade bits.JPG|Spade bits\nImage:drill spade tiny.jpg|Tiny spade bit\n</gallery>\n\n===Spoon bits=== <!-- courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[Spoon bit drill]] links here -->\nSpoon bits consist of a grooved shank with a point shaped somewhat like the bowl of a spoon, with the cutting edge on the end. The more common type is like a gouge bit that ends in a slight point. This is helpful for starting the hole, as it has a center that will not wander or walk.  These bits are used by chair-makers for boring or reaming holes in the seats and arms of chairs. Their design is ancient, going back to Roman times. Spoon bits have even been found in Viking excavations. Modern spoon bits are made of hand-forged carbon steel, carefully heat-treated and then hand ground to a fine edge.\n\nSpoon bits are the traditional boring tools used with a brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that the angle of the hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is that they do not have a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.\n\nWhen reaming a pre-bored straight-sided hole, the spoon bit is inserted into the hole and rotated in a clockwise direction with a carpenters' brace until the desired taper is achieved. When boring into solid wood, the bit should be started in the vertical position; after a \"dish\" has been created and the bit has begun to \"bite\" into the wood, the angle of boring can be changed by tilting the brace a bit out of the vertical. Holes can be drilled precisely, cleanly and quickly in any wood, at any angle of incidence, with total control of direction and the ability to change that direction at will.\n\nParallel spoon bits are used primarily for boring holes in the seat of a [[Windsor chair]] to take the back spindles, or similar round-tenon work when assembling furniture frames in [[green woodworking]] work.\n\nThe spoon bit may be honed by using a slipstone on the inside of the cutting edge; the outside edge should never be touched.\n\n===Forstner bits===<!-- [[Forstner bit]], [[Webfoot auger]] & [[Forstner flange bit]] redirect here. -->\n[[Image:drill tip forstner.jpg|right|thumb|{{convert|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} Forstner bit]]\n[[Image:Forstner Bohrer 01.jpg|thumb|Another Forstner bit]]\n\nForstner bits, named after their inventor, [[Benjamin Forstner]], bore precise, flat-bottomed holes in wood, in any orientation with respect to the wood grain. They can cut on the edge of a block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes; for such applications they are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in hand-held electric drills. Because of the flat bottom of the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay.\n\nThe bit includes a center point which guides it throughout the cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers at the edge of the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bits shown in the images have two radial edges; other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.\n\nSawtooth bits are also available, which include many more cutting edges to the cylinder. These cut faster, but produce a more ragged hole. They have advantages over Forstner bits when boring into [[end grain]].\n\nBits are commonly available in sizes from {{convert|8|-|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} diameter. Sawtooth bits are available up to {{convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} diameter.\n\nOriginally the Forstner bit was very successful with gunsmiths because of its ability to drill an exceedingly smooth-sided hole.\n\n===Center bits===\nThe center bit is optimized for drilling in wood with a [[Brace (tool)|hand brace]]. Many different designs have been produced.\n\nThe center of the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There is no need for any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of thickness equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.\n\nThe edge of the bit has a sharpened spur to cut the fibers of the wood, as in the lip and spur drill bit. A radial cutting edge planes the wood from the base of the hole. In this version, there is minimal or no spiral to remove chips from the hole. The bit must be periodically withdrawn to clear the chips.\n\nSome versions have two spurs. Some have two radial cutting edges.\n\nCenter bits do not cut well in the end grain of wood. The central screw tends to pull out, or to split the wood along the grain, and the radial edges have trouble cutting through the long wood fibers.\n\nCenter bits are made of relatively soft steel, and can be sharpened with a file.\n\n<gallery widths=\"330px\" heights=\"250px\">\nImage:drill brace.jpg|A 19&nbsp;mm (3/4 inch) center bit, made sometime before 1950\nImage:drill tip brace.jpg|Center bit tip detail\n</gallery>\n\n===Auger bits===\nThe cutting principles of the auger bit are the same as those of the center bit above. The auger adds a long deep spiral flute for effective chip removal.\n\nTwo styles of auger bit are commonly used in hand braces: the '''Jennings''' or Jennings-pattern bit has a self-feeding screw tip, two spurs and two radial cutting edges. This bit has a double flute starting from the cutting edges, and extending several inches up the shank of the bit, for waste removal. This pattern of bit was developed by Russell Jennings in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe '''Irwin''' or solid-center auger bit is similar, the only difference being that one of the cutting edges has only a \"vestigal flute\" supporting it, which extends only about {{convert|1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}} up the shank before ending. The other flute continues full-length up the shank for waste removal. The Irwin bit may afford greater space for waste removal, greater strength (because the design allows for a center shank of increased size within the flutes, as compared to the Jenning bits), or smaller manufacturing costs. This style of bit was invented in 1884, and the rights sold to Charles Irwin who patented and marketed this pattern the following year.\n\nBoth styles of auger bits were manufactured by several companies throughout the early- and mid-20th century, and are still available new from select sources today.\n\nThe diameter of auger bits for hand braces is commonly expressed by a single number, indicating the size in 16ths of an inch. For example, #4 is 4/16 or 1/4&nbsp;in (6&nbsp;mm), #6 is 6/16 or 3/8&nbsp;in (9&nbsp;mm), #9 is 9/16&nbsp;in (14&nbsp;mm), and #16 is 16/16 or 1&nbsp;in (25&nbsp;mm). Sets commonly consist of #4-16 or #4-10 bits.\n\nThe bit shown in the picture is a modern design for use in portable power tools, made in the UK in about 1995. It has a single spur, a single radial cutting edge and a single flute. Similar auger bits are made with diameters from 6&nbsp;mm (3/16&nbsp;in) to 30&nbsp;mm (1 3/16&nbsp;in). Augers up to {{convert|600|mm|ft|abbr=on}} long are available, where the chip-clearing capability is especially valuable for drilling deep holes.\n\n<gallery widths=\"320px\" heights=\"170px\">\nImage:drill auger.jpg|{{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} auger bit for wood\nImage:drill tip auger.jpg|Auger bit tip detail\n</gallery>\n\n===Gimlet bits===\nThe gimlet bit is a very old design. The bit is the same style as that used in the [[Gimlet (tool)|gimlet]], a self-contained tool for boring small holes in wood by hand. Since about 1850, gimlets have had a variety of cutter designs, but some are still produced with the original version. The gimlet bit is intended to be used in a hand brace for drilling into wood. It is the usual style of bit for use in a brace for holes below about {{convert|7|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter.\n\nThe tip of the gimlet bit acts as a tapered screw, to draw the bit into the wood and to begin forcing aside the wood fibers, without necessarily cutting them. The cutting action occurs at the side of the broadest part of the cutter. Most drill bits cut the base of the hole. The gimlet bit cuts the side of the hole.\n\n<gallery widths=\"330px\" heights=\"180px\">\nImage:drill gimlet.jpg|Gimlet bit for wood, made sometime before 1950.\nImage:drill tip gimlet.jpg|Gimlet bit tip detail\n</gallery>\n\n===Hinge sinker bits===\n[[Image:drill tip 30mm hinge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|30&nbsp;mm hinge sinker bit]]\n\nThe hinge sinker bit is an example of a custom drill bit design for a specific application. Many European kitchen cabinets are made from [[particle board]] or [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF) with a laminated [[melamine resin]] veneer. Those types of [[pressed wood]] boards are not very strong, and the screws of butt [[hinge]]s tend to pull out. A specialist hinge has been developed which uses the walls of a {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter hole, bored in the particle board, for support. This is a very common and relatively successful construction method.\n\nA Forstner bit could bore the mounting hole for the hinge, but particle board and MDF are very abrasive materials, and steel cutting edges soon wear. A [[tungsten carbide]] cutter is needed, but the complex shape of a forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special drill bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has cutting edges of tungsten carbide brazed to a steel body; a center spur keeps the bit from wandering.\n\n=== Adjustable wood bits === <!-- courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[expansive drill bit]] links here. -->\n[[Image:Adjustable drill bit closeup.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An adjustable wood bit meant for use in a [[Brace (tool)|brace]]]]\n\nAn adjustable wood bit, also known as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a [[set screw]] to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill a wide variety of holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A [[ruler]] or [[vernier scale]] is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.\n\nThese bits are available both in a version similar to an auger bit or brace bit, designed for low speed, high torque use with a brace or other hand drill (pictured to the right), or as a high speed, low torque bit meant for a power drill. While the shape of the cutting edges is different, and one uses screw threads and the other a twist bit for the pilot, the method of adjusting them remains the same.\n\n==Other materials==\n\n===Diamond core bits===\n{{Main|Diamond core drill bit}}\n\nThe diamond masonry mortar bit is a hybrid drill bit, designed to work as a combination router and drill bit. It consists of a steel shell, with the diamonds embedded in metal segments attached to the cutting edge. These drill bits are used at relatively low speeds.\n\n===Masonry drill bits=== <!-- courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[star drill]] links here. -->\nThe masonry bit shown here is a variation of the twist drill bit. The bulk of the tool is a relatively soft steel, and is machined with a [[milling machine|mill]] rather than ground. An insert of [[tungsten carbide]] is [[brazing|brazed]] into the steel to provide the cutting edges.\n\nMasonry bits typically are used with a [[hammer drill]], which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow.  Hammer drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the [[Drill bit shank#SDS shank|SDS]] type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.\n\nMasonry bits of the style shown are commonly available in diameters from 3&nbsp;mm to 40&nbsp;mm. For larger diameters, core bits are used. Masonry bits up to {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} long can be used with hand-portable power tools, and are very effective for installing wiring and plumbing in existing buildings.\n\nA '''{{visible anchor|star drill bit}}''', similar in appearance and function to a hole punch or chisel, is used as a hand powered drill in conjunction with a [[hammer]] to drill into [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[masonry]]. A star drill bit's cutting edge consists of several blades joined at the center to form a star pattern.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Drill masonry.jpg|25\u00d7500&nbsp;mm [[Chuck (engineering)#Special Direct System (SDS)|SDS-plus]] masonry bit\nFile:Drill tip masonry.jpg|Masonry bit tip\nFile:Quadro40max.JPG|Rebar resistant bit with four carbide cutters\nFile:Star_drill2.jpg|Star drill\n</gallery>\n\n===Glass drill bits===\nGlass bits have a spade-shaped carbide point. They generate high temperatures and have a very short life. Holes are generally drilled at low speed with a succession of increasing bit sizes. Diamond drill bits can also be used to cut holes in glass, and last much longer.\n\n===PCB through-hole drill bits===\nA great number of holes with small diameters of about 1&nbsp;mm or less must be drilled in [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) used by [[electronic equipment]] with [[through-hole]] components. Most PCBs are made of highly abrasive [[fiberglass]], which quickly wears steel bits, especially given the hundreds or thousands of holes on most circuit boards. To solve this problem, solid [[tungsten carbide]] twist bits, which drill quickly through the board while providing a moderately long life,  are almost always used. Carbide PCB bits are estimated to outlast high speed steel bits by a factor of ten or more.  Other options sometimes used are diamond or diamond-coated bits.\n\nIn industry, virtually all drilling is done by [[computer numerical control|automated machines]], and the bits are often automatically replaced by the equipment as they wear, as even solid carbide bits do not last long in constant use. PCB bits, of narrow diameter, typically mount in a [[collet]] rather than a [[Chuck (engineering)|chuck]], and come with standard-size shanks, often with pre-installed stops to set them at an exact depth every time when being automatically chucked by the equipment.\n\nVery high rotational speeds\u201430,000 to 100,000 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] or even higher\u2014are used; this translates to a reasonably fast linear speed of the cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very vulnerable to breaking, particularly if the angle of the bit to the workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practical, and many general-purpose drilling machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.\n\nResharpened and easily available PCB drills have historically been used in many prototyping and home PCB labs, using a high-speed rotary tool for small-diameter bits (such as a Moto-Tool by Dremel) in a stiff drill-press jig.  If used for other materials these tiny bits must be evaluated for equivalent cutting speed vs material resistance to the cut (hardness), as the bit's [[rake angle]] and expected feed per revolution are optimised for high-speed automated use on fiberglass PCB substrate.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Two pcb bits.jpg|Two [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] drill bits.\nImage:Box of 02in pcb bits.jpg|A box of [[drill bit sizes|#76]] ({{convert|0.02|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) [[printed circuit board|PCB]] drill bits.\n</gallery>\n\n===Installer bits===\n\n====Fishing bit====\nInstaller bits, also known as '''bell-hanger''' bits or '''fishing''' bits, are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. The key distinguishing feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a [[fish tape]] could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the shank end as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be threaded through the shank end, the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the drilled hole. These bits are made for cement, block and brick they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of [[Brooklyn, New York]] was issued {{US patent|597750}} for this invention on January 25, 1898.\n\nInstaller bits are available in various materials and styles for drilling wood, masonry and metal.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Installer bit overview.jpg|A {{convert|3/8|x|18|in|abbr=on|mm}} installer bit\nFile:Installer bit closeup 2.jpg|Closeup of installer bit. The fishing hole is visible in the flute in the center of the picture.\n</gallery>\n\n====Flexible shaft bit====\nAnother, different, bit also called an installer bit has a very long flexible shaft, typically up to {{convert|72|in|m}} long, with a small twist bit at the end. The shaft is made of [[Martensite|spring steel]] instead of hardened [[steel]], so it can be flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to drill through [[Wall stud|studs]] from a [[light switch]] box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.\n\nThis flexible installer bit is used in the US, but does not appear to be routinely available in Europe.\n\n==Drill bit shank==\n{{main|Drill bit shank}}\nDifferent shapes of shank are used. Some are simply the most appropriate for the chuck used; in other cases particular combinations of shank and chuck give performance advantages, such as allowing higher torque, greater centering accuracy, or efficient hammering action.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Drill and tap size chart]]\n*[[Drill bit shank]]\n*[[Drill bit sizes]]\n*[[Drill rod]]\n*[[Endmill]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Citation|last = Oberg|first = Erik|last2 = Jones|first2 = Franklin D.|last3 = Horton|first3 = Holbrook L.|last4 = Ryffel|first4 = Henry H.|title = [[Machinery's Handbook]]|place = New York|publisher = Industrial Press Inc.|year = 2000|edition = 26th|isbn = 0-8311-2635-3|postscript =.}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Drill bits}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051230001027/http://www.mfg.mtu.edu/marc/primers/drilling/nomen.html Nomenclature]\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|machopen}}\n{{Cutting and abrasive tools}}\n\n[[Category:Hole making]]\n[[Category:Woodworking tools]]\n", "name_user": "Moletrouser", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo - missing semicolon", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_bit"}
{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}}\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n*Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies.

[[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king.

However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

The female captives are used sexually. Their Muslim captors state that Islamic law allows them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}}  The evidence strongly demonstrates that the government of Sudan had revived slavery and made it as important as it was in the previous century.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=29}} The Sudanese army has had a central role in the revival of slavery.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=32}} Sudan's Arab government started recruiting Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the Popular Defense Forces, consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black villages, executed all its males and would then take away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement to their low salaries. The first slave raid on the [[Dinka]] took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families. Slave raids continued every year after 1985.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=26}} Dinka girls kept in Arab households were used as sex-slaves.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=35}} Some of them were sold to Arab men in [[Libya]], It has been alleged that there slave markets were set up in Sudan. Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]] the [[Taliban]] has committed atrocities against the Shia population. One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The Taliban either takes beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly marries them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}}\n\nAsifa Quraishi-Landes also observes that most Muslims believe that sex is only permissible within marriage and they ignore the permission for keeping concubines in Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} Furthermore, the majority of modern Muslims are not aware that Islamic jurists had made an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} and many modern Muslims would be offended by the idea that a [[husband]] owns his wife's private parts under Islamic law.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}}\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Y.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}}\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n*Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

The female captives are used sexually. Their Muslim captors state that Islamic law allows them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}}  The evidence strongly demonstrates that the government of Sudan had revived slavery and made it as important as it was in the previous century.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=29}} The Sudanese army has had a central role in the revival of slavery.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=32}} Sudan's Arab government started recruting Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the Popular Defense Forces, consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the SPLA which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black villages, executed all its males and would then take away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement to their low salaries. The first slave raid on the Dinka took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families. Slave raids continued every year after 1985.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=26}} Dinka girls kept in Arab households were used as sex-slaves.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=35}} Some of them were sold to Arab men in Libya, It has been alleged that there slave markets were set up in Sudan. Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15.Many Western organisations travelled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]] the [[Taliban]] has committed atrocities against the Shia population. One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The Taliban either takes beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly marries them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}}\n\nAsifa Quraishi-Landes also observes that most Muslims believe that sex is only permissible within marriage and they ignore the permission for keeping concubines in Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} Furthermore, the majority of modern Muslims are not aware that Islamic jurists had made an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} and many modern Muslims would be offended by the idea that a [[husband]] owns his wife's private parts under Islamic law.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}}\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Y.
