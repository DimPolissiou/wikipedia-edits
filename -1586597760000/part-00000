It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J. (1830). ''Voyage de d\u00e9couvertes de l'Astrolabe ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par ordre du Roi, pendant les anne\u00e9s 1826\u20131827\u20131828\u20131829, sous le commandement de M.J. Dumont-d'Urville''. Zoologie. Paris: J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\".\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]\nIn addition, in 1991 Masvidal helped Chicago band [[Master (American band)|Master]] to record their album ''[[On the Seventh Day God Created... Master]]''. Masvidal handled all guitar duties on this album. After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. Roadrunner released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert.Cynic took a hiatus in 1995 after record ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]]. \n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]\n[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''Traced In Air'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\".\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]\nIn addition, in 1991 Masvidal helped Chicago band [[Master (American band)|Master]] to record their album ''[[On the Seventh Day God Created... Master]]''. Masvidal handled all guitar duties on this album. After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. Roadrunner released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert.Cynic took a hiatus in 1995 after record ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]]. \n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]\n[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''Traced In Air'', their comeback opus.

''Rolling Stone'' music critic Hank Shteamer raved in his review<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|title=Cynic: Carbon-Based Anatomy EP|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> of ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'': \"The title track is a perfectly paced stunner...Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.\"\n\nIn 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death ''Human'' line up and toured worldwide in honor of Chuck Schuldiner's legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). \n[[File:KindlyBentToFreeUs.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Kindly Bent to Free Us]]\n\n\nCynic's third full-length album, ''Kindly Bent to Free Us'', released in 2014, was hailed by [[Malcolm Dome|Malcome Dome]] of ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' magazine as \"an album that transcends all the limitations of genre and era... There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\" The album rose to No. 4 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Heatseekers chart in February 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.\n\n\n\n\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]\n\n\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk][[File:Onward with Love.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Onward with Love, 2015]]\n\n\nIn 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full-length record by 2021.\n\nIn 2016, Masvidal, along with collaborator [[Amy Correia]], composed the musical score for the award-winning feature film ''[[The Tiger Hunter]]'', featuring lead actor [[Danny Pudi]] \n\nMasvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures. His credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. Masvidal has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television. Music writer Jeff Wagner, in ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]'', stated that \"any viewer of ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', ''That '70s Show'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and any number of random television programs has probably stumbled across Cynic's core members without even knowing it.\" In 2015, Masvidal produced a children's album for actor [[Jim Carrey]] titled ''How Roland Rolls''.\n[[File:Cynic Humanoid.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Humanoid (Single)]]\nIn January 2018, Cynic released a digital single, titled \"Humanoid\". The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album ''Kindly Bent to Free Us''. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums titled ''Mythical Human Vessel.''

It is hosted by [[Alexander stupid Armstrong]] with assistance from [[Richard Osman]]. In each episode four teams of two contestants attempt to find correct but obscure answers to four rounds of general knowledge questions, with the winning team eligible to compete for the show's cash jackpot. All questions used on the show are factual in nature, and are asked of a panel of 100 individuals in a pre-conducted public survey. Contestants seek to find correct answers that were given by as few of the survey subjects as possible (\"points\"); each round is won by the team with the fewest points. \"Pointless\" answers, given by nobody, score zero points, the best score. Every pointless answer given during the main game increases the jackpot by \u00a3250, and one such answer must be given in the final round in order to win it.\n\nIt debuted on [[BBC Two]] on 5555524 August 2009. The success of its first three series led the BBC to move it to [[BBC One]] from 2011. On occasions when BBC1 carries live broadcasts of major news or sport events, the programme is transferred to BBC2, for example during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus outbreak]] in 2020. {{As of |2019|12}} the programme had been shown for 22 series<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rhg2r/episodes/guide |title=BBC One \u2013 Pointless \u2013 Episode guide |publisher=BBC}}</ref> and has had peak audience figures of over 7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/pointless-celebrities-attracts-more-viewers-than-englands-euro-qualifier-match-against-slovenia-9864757.html |title=Pointless Celebrities attracts more viewers than England's Euro qualifier against Slovenia |author=Daisy Wyatt |date=17 November 2014 |work=The Independent}}</ref> A celebrity version entitled ''Pointless Celebrities'' was first shown in 2011, and {{as of |2019|12|lc=y}} had reached series 12. The format has been exported internationally.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe object of the game is for contestants to provide answers that are not only correct but also as obscure as possible, with each game consisting of teams of two contestants. In its early days the programme featured five teams at the start of each edition, but this was later reduced to four. Prior to each show, 100 people are given 100 seconds to provide as many answers as they can to a series of general knowledge questions as part of a pre-conducted online survey,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c0bvxd |work=[[BBC iPlayer]] |title=Pointless, Series 20: Episode 49 |date=17 January 2019}}</ref> and in each round, contestants are asked these same questions. These questions are set into categories, with the contestants given rules regarding what they are searching for in terms of answers, more importantly what answers will be accepted for the question given. If the answer is correct, the team scores one point for each participant that gave it during the survey; if none of the surveyed participants gave an answer listed for the question and a contestant gives it, the team scores zero points for providing a \"pointless\" answer. If the answer is incorrect, the team scores the maximum of 100 points. After a question is done, a list of answers that are pointless are given, along with the high-scoring answers given in the survey, usually the top three.<ref name=\"recomm\"><!-- cite press release -->[https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/10_october/06/pointless.shtml BBC Daytime re-commissions Pointless] BBC Press Office.</ref>\n\nThe format of the show starts with two elimination rounds, in which teams must achieve as low a score as possible. The team with the highest score in each round is eliminated from the game. If two teams are tied for the highest score in either of these rounds, a sudden-death \"lockdown\" round is played between the two, with the higher-scoring team losing. In the next round, the two surviving teams compete against each other (\"the head-to-head\") to find the lowest-scoring answer in a series of questions. The winning team moves on to the final round.\n\nTeams eliminated while making their first appearance who have reached no further than the head-to-head are eligible to appear again in the next consecutive game; teams that have appeared twice or reached the final round cannot return (with the exception of the teams that appeared in the 1000th episode). The team that reaches the final round is awarded a trophy to keep. They must then supply three responses to a question with many correct answers (e.g., name films directed by a specified director or name a song by a specified singer). If any of the answers is pointless, they win the jackpot as it stands for that game; otherwise, the money rolls over to the next show.\n\nThe cash jackpot begins at \u00a31,000 at the start of its run. Except in the final round, every pointless answer given adds \u00a3250 to the cash jackpot. If the jackpot is not won at the end of a game, the amount (including any increases from pointless answers) is rolled over to the next game and increased by \u00a31,000, offering returning and new contestants a chance of winning a bigger cash prize. {{As of|2019|8}} the highest recorded jackpot won on the show was \u00a324,750 on 8 March 2013. Once the jackpot is won, the amount is reset to \u00a31,000. For the celebrity version, the jackpot is set at \u00a32,500, and increases by \u00a3250 for each pointless answer found, while special editions have the jackpot set at \u00a35,000, and increased by \u00a3500 for each pointless answer found; in neither version does the jackpot roll over to another show.\n\n===Elimination rounds===\nDuring an elimination round, teams aim to score as few points as possible, with the team having the highest score at the end of the round being eliminated from the game. Each round consists of a question derived from a subject, with each member of a team required to give an answer during a pass; each round consists of two passes, and teams are required, prior to the question being given, to decide who answers during the first pass, with the other answering during the second pass, without conferring. The order of play differs; in the first elimination round, it is determined by drawing lots in advance of recording, while in the second, it is determined by the scores in the previous round, though in both, the team nearest to the host answers first, moving on towards the team farthest from them, before going back in reverse order during the second pass. In the event of a tie, the tied teams are allowed to confer and give an extra answer to the question, until one team manages to score more points than the others; if no team can give a correct answer on this pass, the question is thrown out and a new one is asked in its place.\n\nFive different formats for the questions are or have been used during the programme's run for the elimination rounds in each game:\n\n* ''Open-Ended'' \u2013 Contestants are given the question, and have free choice of what answer to give. In the first series, this format was used three times in this round, before subsequent episodes used it no more than once. A variant of this format was introduced in the seventh series, in which a list of categories is shown and contestants can give an answer as long as it fitted into any of the categories shown (for example, they could name any member that was in any band on the list); contestants are not required to identify which category their answer belongs to, and will be still credited for a correct answer even if they attribute it to the wrong category. This variant of the format was mainly designed to combine several smaller categories into a round (e.g. the films of several different actors) or to narrow down a wider category (for example, by limiting answers to those starting with certain letters).\n* '' Possible Answers'' \u2013 Introduced in the second series, contestants are given a board of potential answers to a question and must pick up, attempting to find the obscure ones on the board and avoid picking out a wrong answer. Each pass consists of two boards, each possessing at least one pointless answer and one incorrect answer, the latter usually having some indirect link (often humorous) with the question, with Osman going through the board after a pass, revealing the points scores of the correct answers and which were incorrect. This format allowed categories to be used in which no commonly agreed definitive list of correct answers exists. It was discontinued following the end of the fifth series.\n* ''Clues and Answers'' \u2013 Introduced in the third series, contestants are given a list of clues related to the topic of the question, whereupon they must select a clue and provide the correct answer connected to it. An example of this format is that a list could contain the names of different battles, and the questions requires a contestant to name the country that it took place in (e.g., \"the [[Battle of Hastings]]\" \u2013 \"England\"). Although the round follows a similar style to that of the \"Possible Answers\" format, there is no guarantee that contestants may find a pointless answer from within the list.\n* ''Linked Categories'' \u2013 Introduced in the fifth series, each pass consists of two closely related categories; one team member provides an answer related to the first category, while the other provides an answer to the second category. The format follows the same principles as that of the \"Open-ended\" format, but was rarely used, and was later discontinued after the series.\n* ''Picture Board'' \u2013 Introduced in the seventh series, contestants are shown a picture or pictures, which contain many people or objects that they have to identify, attempting to seek out those that are more obscure than others. The format is occasionally used, and often replaces the \"Open-ended\" format when it does.\n\n===Head-to-head===\nThe two teams that survive elimination in the initial rounds, now compete against each other, answering questions with the intention of finding the lowest answers possible. Both teams can now confer, and the winning team of this round moves on to the Final. The format of this round has differed, as listed below:\n* Series 1 \u2013 Both teams provide as many correct answers as they can to a single question, with the aim of providing answers that score as few points as possible, with the round ending if a team goes above 100 points. The team who scored the lowest in the elimination rounds gets pick choosing which of two categories to answer, with both teams required to give an answer on each turn, regardless of their opponents going over 100. If both teams go above 100, then the team that is nearer to 100 goes through to the final.\n* Series 2\u20135 \u2013 Both teams compete in a multi-question best-of contest; best-of-five for the second series, best-of-three from the third series. Each team must give an answer to a question, and once both have done so, the lower score of the two wins the question and earns that team a point. Each question will usually have a minimum of four answers to choose from, and the order of play is that the team who acquired the fewest points in the elimination rounds gets to answer first on the first question.\n* Since Series 6 \u2013 Both teams compete in a multi-question best-of-three contest; while the format is the same since the third series, questions are now designed around the \"Clues and Answers\" format. Each question now has five answers to choose from, and there are three kinds of questions in this round: a picture/sound question, in which contestants are shown five pictures or are played five sounds or pieces of music, labelled A to E, and must identify them, often with some letters given as an additional clue; a facts question, in which contestants are given a list of clues to notable facts, and must identify the answer based upon the clue given; a word puzzle question, in which the answers, connected to the subject of the question, are given in the form of an anagram, an initialism, have alternate letters missing, or complete a quote or title.\n\n===Final===\nThe winning team that survives both the elimination rounds and the head-to-head receives a trophy to keep, regardless of what happens in the final round, and now attempt to win the game's jackpot; the host reminds viewers of the amount, including any rollover from previous games. In order to win it, the team first chose a category from several offered to them, whereupon they are given questions connected to it with multiple correct answers (e.g., name films directed by a specified director or name a song by a specified singer), and have up to 60 seconds to jointly provide three answers. If any individual response is pointless, the team wins the jackpot; otherwise, it is rolled over to the next show.\n\nOriginally, contestants could choose from one of three categories, with those not chosen remaining in the list for five days or until they were picked. This format was used between the first and fifth series. The number of categories to choose from was then increased to five at the start of the sixth series. By the start of the second half of the ninth series, the format of the round was modified in that the winning team must supply answers within three subcategories connected to their chosen category, though they may elect to go for any or all three subcategories with their answers. In addition, they must state which subcategory each of their answer belongs to; if it is for the wrong one, their answer is considered incorrect.\n\n== ''Pointless Celebrities'' ==\nFollowing the success of ''Pointless'' and its transfer to BBC One, the BBC commissioned a celebrity edition of the programme, entitled ''Pointless Celebrities''. Like the main show, the celebrity edition featured teams of two celebrities competing against each other to win the jackpot for their chosen charities. While the show used the same format for rounds, the celebrity edition featured notable differences. Unlike the regular show, the celebrity version was reserved for the weekend and placed in a prime-time evening slot for its broadcast. In addition, celebrities can return in more than one episode, with the same partner or a different partner, most episodes usually featured a theme in regards to the celebrity contestants that took part - for example, a celebrity edition aired in December 2015 consisted of celebrities who were made famous on reality television shows like ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and ''[[Made in Chelsea]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06tgyd1 |title=Pointless Celebrities, Series 8, Reality TV |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nTeams compete for a jackpot of \u00a32,500 for their charity, plus \u00a3250 for every pointless answer given before the final round. The jackpot does not roll over if not won, but the programme rewards all teams with \u00a3500 for taking part, regardless of how well they performed.\n\n==Development==\nThe show's format (originally to be called \"Obviously\") was conceived by Tom Blakeson, Simon Craig, David Flynn, Nick Mather, Richard Osman and Shaun Parry, producers at [[Endemol UK]], in 2009. They envisaged it as a \"reverse ''[[Family Fortunes]]''....rewarding obscure knowledge, while allowing people to also give obvious answers....a quiz which could be sort of highbrow and populist simultaneously\".<ref name=\"guardian500\">{{cite web |author=Tom Meltzer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/04/pointless-alexander-armstrong-richard-osman |title=Pointless: Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman on TV's favourite quiz |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> Osman was not intended to be co-presenter; originally, he filled the role only as part of a demonstration laid on for the BBC.

The Pointless app features animated versions of Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman, and allows the player to tackle questions in a similar format to the TV show.

All five were released by [[Coronet]]. In the books, Armstrong and Osman give their insight to pointless matters. Three editions of the official board game have also been released, plus two mini-sized versions, each of which contains updated questions.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n''Pointless'' appeared in the BBC sitcom ''[[Not Going Out]]'' (series 7, episode 5); Armstrong and Osman both played themselves.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/not-going-out-guest-richard-osman-if-my-kids-dont-laugh-its-lee-macks-fault-64944/ |title=Not Going Out guest Richard Osman: 'If my kids don't laugh, it's Lee Mack's fault' |last=Briant |first=Michelle |date=14 November 2014 |work=[[What's on TV]] |accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref> ''Pointless'' was also parodied in several sketches of the satirical show ''[[Newzoids]]'', in which a caricature of Osman interrupts people in regular situations with phrases used in the game show.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|BBC|Television}}\n* {{BBC programme|b00rhg2r}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01d09p5 ''Pointless Celebrities'']\n* {{UKGameshow|Pointless}}\n\n[[Category:2009 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s British game shows]]\n[[Category:2010s British game shows]]\n[[Category:2020s British game shows]]\n[[Category:BBC television game shows]]\n[[Category:British game shows]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Endemol]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the British quiz show}}\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Pointless\n| image                    = Pointless titles.png\n| show_name_2              = Pointless Celebrities\n| genre                    = [[Quiz show]]\n| director                 = Nick Harris<br />Julian Smith<br />Jonathan Glazier<br />Richard Valentine\t<br />Richard van't Riet<br />Stuart McDonald (celebrity)\n| presenter                = [[Alexander Armstrong]]\n| starring                 = [[Richard Osman]]\n| opentheme                =\n| theme_music_composer     = [[Marc Sylvan]]\n| country                  = [[United Kingdom]]\n| language                 = [[British English|English]]\n| num_series               = 22 (regular) <br /> 11 (celebrity)\n| num_episodes             = 1193 (regular {{asof|2019|October|15|lc=y}}) <br /> 211 (celebrity {{asof|2019|December|14|lc=y}})\n| executive_producer       = Pam Cavannagh (BBC)<br />Tom Blakeson and David Flynn (both Brighter Pictures then Remarkable Television)\n| producer                 = Michelle Woods<br/>Ed de Burgh<br/>John Ryan\n| editor                   = Hannah Barnes<br/>Peter Elphick<br/>David Horwell<br/>Neil Hunter<br/>Nick Parker\n| location                 = [[Television Centre, London|Television Centre]] <br />(2009\u201312, 2017)<br />[[Elstree Studios]] (2013\u2013)\n| camera                   = [[Multiple-camera setup]]\n| runtime                  = 45 minutes (regular)<br />50 minutes (celebrity)\n| company                  = Brighter Pictures (2009)<br />Remarkable Television (2010\u2013)\n| distributor              = [[Endemol Shine UK]]\n| channel                  = [[BBC Two]] (2009\u201311)<br />[[BBC One]] (2011\u2013)\n| picture_format           = [[576i]] ([[16:9]] [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])<br/>[[1080i]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]])\n| audio_format             = Stereo\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2009|8|24|df=yes}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| related                  = \n| website                  = https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rhg2r\n}}\n\n'''''Pointless''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British television]] [[quiz show]] produced by [[Endemol Shine UK]] for the [[BBC]]. It is hosted by [[Alexander Armstrong]] with assistance from [[Richard Osman]]. In each episode four teams of two contestants attempt to find correct but obscure answers to four rounds of general knowledge questions, with the winning team eligible to compete for the show's cash jackpot. All questions used on the show are factual in nature, and are asked of a panel of 100 individuals in a pre-conducted public survey. Contestants seek to find correct answers that were given by as few of the survey subjects as possible (\"points\"); each round is won by the team with the fewest points. \"Pointless\" answers, given by nobody, score zero points, the best score. Every pointless answer given during the main game increases the jackpot by \u00a3250, and one such answer must be given in the final round in order to win it.\n\nIt debuted on [[BBC Two]] on 24 August 2009. The success of its first three series led the BBC to move it to [[BBC One]] from 2011. On occasions when BBC1 carries live broadcasts of major news or sport events, the programme is transferred to BBC2, for example during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus outbreak]] in 2020. {{As of |2019|12}} the programme had been shown for 22 series<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rhg2r/episodes/guide |title=BBC One \u2013 Pointless \u2013 Episode guide |publisher=BBC}}</ref> and has had peak audience figures of over 7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/pointless-celebrities-attracts-more-viewers-than-englands-euro-qualifier-match-against-slovenia-9864757.html |title=Pointless Celebrities attracts more viewers than England's Euro qualifier against Slovenia |author=Daisy Wyatt |date=17 November 2014 |work=The Independent}}</ref> A celebrity version entitled ''Pointless Celebrities'' was first shown in 2011, and {{as of |2019|12|lc=y}} had reached series 12. The format has been exported internationally.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe object of the game is for contestants to provide answers that are not only correct but also as obscure as possible, with each game consisting of teams of two contestants. In its early days the programme featured five teams at the start of each edition, but this was later reduced to four. Prior to each show, 100 people are given 100 seconds to provide as many answers as they can to a series of general knowledge questions as part of a pre-conducted online survey,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c0bvxd |work=[[BBC iPlayer]] |title=Pointless, Series 20: Episode 49 |date=17 January 2019}}</ref> and in each round, contestants are asked these same questions. These questions are set into categories, with the contestants given rules regarding what they are searching for in terms of answers, more importantly what answers will be accepted for the question given. If the answer is correct, the team scores one point for each participant that gave it during the survey; if none of the surveyed participants gave an answer listed for the question and a contestant gives it, the team scores zero points for providing a \"pointless\" answer. If the answer is incorrect, the team scores the maximum of 100 points. After a question is done, a list of answers that are pointless are given, along with the high-scoring answers given in the survey, usually the top three.<ref name=\"recomm\"><!-- cite press release -->[https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/10_october/06/pointless.shtml BBC Daytime re-commissions Pointless] BBC Press Office.</ref>\n\nThe format of the show starts with two elimination rounds, in which teams must achieve as low a score as possible. The team with the highest score in each round is eliminated from the game. If two teams are tied for the highest score in either of these rounds, a sudden-death \"lockdown\" round is played between the two, with the higher-scoring team losing. In the next round, the two surviving teams compete against each other (\"the head-to-head\") to find the lowest-scoring answer in a series of questions. The winning team moves on to the final round.\n\nTeams eliminated while making their first appearance who have reached no further than the head-to-head are eligible to appear again in the next consecutive game; teams that have appeared twice or reached the final round cannot return (with the exception of the teams that appeared in the 1000th episode). The team that reaches the final round is awarded a trophy to keep. They must then supply three responses to a question with many correct answers (e.g., name films directed by a specified director or name a song by a specified singer). If any of the answers is pointless, they win the jackpot as it stands for that game; otherwise, the money rolls over to the next show.\n\nThe cash jackpot begins at \u00a31,000 at the start of its run. Except in the final round, every pointless answer given adds \u00a3250 to the cash jackpot. If the jackpot is not won at the end of a game, the amount (including any increases from pointless answers) is rolled over to the next game and increased by \u00a31,000, offering returning and new contestants a chance of winning a bigger cash prize. {{As of|2019|8}} the highest recorded jackpot won on the show was \u00a324,750 on 8 March 2013. Once the jackpot is won, the amount is reset to \u00a31,000. For the celebrity version, the jackpot is set at \u00a32,500, and increases by \u00a3250 for each pointless answer found, while special editions have the jackpot set at \u00a35,000, and increased by \u00a3500 for each pointless answer found; in neither version does the jackpot roll over to another show.\n\n===Elimination rounds===\nDuring an elimination round, teams aim to score as few points as possible, with the team having the highest score at the end of the round being eliminated from the game. Each round consists of a question derived from a subject, with each member of a team required to give an answer during a pass; each round consists of two passes, and teams are required, prior to the question being given, to decide who answers during the first pass, with the other answering during the second pass, without conferring. The order of play differs; in the first elimination round, it is determined by drawing lots in advance of recording, while in the second, it is determined by the scores in the previous round, though in both, the team nearest to the host answers first, moving on towards the team farthest from them, before going back in reverse order during the second pass. In the event of a tie, the tied teams are allowed to confer and give an extra answer to the question, until one team manages to score more points than the others; if no team can give a correct answer on this pass, the question is thrown out and a new one is asked in its place.\n\nFive different formats for the questions are or have been used during the programme's run for the elimination rounds in each game:\n\n* ''Open-Ended'' \u2013 Contestants are given the question, and have free choice of what answer to give. In the first series, this format was used three times in this round, before subsequent episodes used it no more than once. A variant of this format was introduced in the seventh series, in which a list of categories is shown and contestants can give an answer as long as it fitted into any of the categories shown (for example, they could name any member that was in any band on the list); contestants are not required to identify which category their answer belongs to, and will be still credited for a correct answer even if they attribute it to the wrong category. This variant of the format was mainly designed to combine several smaller categories into a round (e.g. the films of several different actors) or to narrow down a wider category (for example, by limiting answers to those starting with certain letters).\n* '' Possible Answers'' \u2013 Introduced in the second series, contestants are given a board of potential answers to a question and must pick up, attempting to find the obscure ones on the board and avoid picking out a wrong answer. Each pass consists of two boards, each possessing at least one pointless answer and one incorrect answer, the latter usually having some indirect link (often humorous) with the question, with Osman going through the board after a pass, revealing the points scores of the correct answers and which were incorrect. This format allowed categories to be used in which no commonly agreed definitive list of correct answers exists. It was discontinued following the end of the fifth series.\n* ''Clues and Answers'' \u2013 Introduced in the third series, contestants are given a list of clues related to the topic of the question, whereupon they must select a clue and provide the correct answer connected to it. An example of this format is that a list could contain the names of different battles, and the questions requires a contestant to name the country that it took place in (e.g., \"the [[Battle of Hastings]]\" \u2013 \"England\"). Although the round follows a similar style to that of the \"Possible Answers\" format, there is no guarantee that contestants may find a pointless answer from within the list.\n* ''Linked Categories'' \u2013 Introduced in the fifth series, each pass consists of two closely related categories; one team member provides an answer related to the first category, while the other provides an answer to the second category. The format follows the same principles as that of the \"Open-ended\" format, but was rarely used, and was later discontinued after the series.\n* ''Picture Board'' \u2013 Introduced in the seventh series, contestants are shown a picture or pictures, which contain many people or objects that they have to identify, attempting to seek out those that are more obscure than others. The format is occasionally used, and often replaces the \"Open-ended\" format when it does.\n\n===Head-to-head===\nThe two teams that survive elimination in the initial rounds, now compete against each other, answering questions with the intention of finding the lowest answers possible. Both teams can now confer, and the winning team of this round moves on to the Final. The format of this round has differed, as listed below:\n* Series 1 \u2013 Both teams provide as many correct answers as they can to a single question, with the aim of providing answers that score as few points as possible, with the round ending if a team goes above 100 points. The team who scored the lowest in the elimination rounds gets pick choosing which of two categories to answer, with both teams required to give an answer on each turn, regardless of their opponents going over 100. If both teams go above 100, then the team that is nearer to 100 goes through to the final.\n* Series 2\u20135 \u2013 Both teams compete in a multi-question best-of contest; best-of-five for the second series, best-of-three from the third series. Each team must give an answer to a question, and once both have done so, the lower score of the two wins the question and earns that team a point. Each question will usually have a minimum of four answers to choose from, and the order of play is that the team who acquired the fewest points in the elimination rounds gets to answer first on the first question.\n* Since Series 6 \u2013 Both teams compete in a multi-question best-of-three contest; while the format is the same since the third series, questions are now designed around the \"Clues and Answers\" format. Each question now has five answers to choose from, and there are three kinds of questions in this round: a picture/sound question, in which contestants are shown five pictures or are played five sounds or pieces of music, labelled A to E, and must identify them, often with some letters given as an additional clue; a facts question, in which contestants are given a list of clues to notable facts, and must identify the answer based upon the clue given; a word puzzle question, in which the answers, connected to the subject of the question, are given in the form of an anagram, an initialism, have alternate letters missing, or complete a quote or title.\n\n===Final===\nThe winning team that survives both the elimination rounds and the head-to-head receives a trophy to keep, regardless of what happens in the final round, and now attempt to win the game's jackpot; the host reminds viewers of the amount, including any rollover from previous games. In order to win it, the team first chose a category from several offered to them, whereupon they are given questions connected to it with multiple correct answers (e.g., name films directed by a specified director or name a song by a specified singer), and have up to 60 seconds to jointly provide three answers. If any individual response is pointless, the team wins the jackpot; otherwise, it is rolled over to the next show.\n\nOriginally, contestants could choose from one of three categories, with those not chosen remaining in the list for five days or until they were picked. This format was used between the first and fifth series. The number of categories to choose from was then increased to five at the start of the sixth series. By the start of the second half of the ninth series, the format of the round was modified in that the winning team must supply answers within three subcategories connected to their chosen category, though they may elect to go for any or all three subcategories with their answers. In addition, they must state which subcategory each of their answer belongs to; if it is for the wrong one, their answer is considered incorrect.\n\n== ''Pointless Celebrities'' ==\nFollowing the success of ''Pointless'' and its transfer to BBC One, the BBC commissioned a celebrity edition of the programme, entitled ''Pointless Celebrities''. Like the main show, the celebrity edition featured teams of two celebrities competing against each other to win the jackpot for their chosen charities. While the show used the same format for rounds, the celebrity edition featured notable differences. Unlike the regular show, the celebrity version was reserved for the weekend and placed in a prime-time evening slot for its broadcast. In addition, celebrities can return in more than one episode, with the same partner or a different partner, most episodes usually featured a theme in regards to the celebrity contestants that took part - for example, a celebrity edition aired in December 2015 consisted of celebrities who were made famous on reality television shows like ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and ''[[Made in Chelsea]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06tgyd1 |title=Pointless Celebrities, Series 8, Reality TV |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nTeams compete for a jackpot of \u00a32,500 for their charity, plus \u00a3250 for every pointless answer given before the final round. The jackpot does not roll over if not won, but the programme rewards all teams with \u00a3500 for taking part, regardless of how well they performed.\n\n==Development==\nThe show's format (originally to be called \"Obviously\") was conceived by Tom Blakeson, Simon Craig, David Flynn, Nick Mather, Richard Osman and Shaun Parry, producers at [[Endemol UK]], in 2009. They envisaged it as a \"reverse ''[[Family Fortunes]]''....rewarding obscure knowledge, while allowing people to also give obvious answers....a quiz which could be sort of highbrow and populist simultaneously\".<ref name=\"guardian500\">{{cite web |author=Tom Meltzer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/04/pointless-alexander-armstrong-richard-osman |title=Pointless: Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman on TV's favourite quiz |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> Osman was not intended to be co-presenter; originally, he filled the role only as part of a demonstration laid on for the BBC.

It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]].\n\nThe Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply meant that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range.<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. In September 2008, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] conferred on the Lightning its \"Engineering Heritage Award\" at a ceremony at [[BAE Systems]]' site at [[Warton Aerodrome]].<ref>Robinson, Ben.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response Specification ER.103 was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{cvt|50000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> In 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts.

An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}. The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200541.html \"Progress with the P.1\"] ''Flight'', 26 April 1957, p.&nbsp;543.</ref> While ''WG760'' had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to {{convert|1.51|Mach|km/h|0}} due to [[directional stability]] limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the \"Lightning\" name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.<ref name =\"buttler 66\">Buttler 2000, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight.{{sfnp|Flight|26 April 1957}}{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=56-57}} On 25 November he reached Mach 2, {{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=67}} the first time in a British aircraft.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of 1,000&nbsp;mph were achieved daily. During this period the [[Fairey FD2]] delta held the world speed record (1,132&nbsp;mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=59}}\n\nIn 1958 two test pilots from the USAF [[Air Force Flight Test Center]], Andy Anderson and [[Deke Slayton]], were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts, commented:\n\n{{quote|The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104.

The F.3 had higher thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened inlet cone allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''.

The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating {{convert|11250|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of {{convert|14430|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}. Later models of the Avon featured, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 32, 66.</ref> A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the hot engine casing which could reach temperatures of 600&nbsp;\u00b0C. Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility took four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground test rigs were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full ground run of the engine after some maintenance tasks.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 32\u201333.</ref> The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring [[fire hazard]].<ref name=\"Scott 2000_98\">Scott 2000, pp. 98\u201399.</ref> The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> For removal, the lower No.1 engine was removed from below the aircraft, after removal of the ventral tank and lower fuselage access panels, by lowering the engine down, while the upper No.2 engine was lifted out from above via removable sections in the fuselage top.\n\nThe fuselage was tightly packed, leaving no room for fuel tankage or main landing gear. While the notched delta wing lacked the volume of a standard delta wing, each wing contained a fairly conventional three-section main fuel tank and leading-edge tank, holding {{convert|312|impgal|L|abbr=on}};<ref group=\"nb\">All fuel tank volumes are listed in Imperial gallons</ref> the wing flaps also each contained a {{convert|33|impgal|L|abbr=on}} fuel tank and an additional {{convert|5|impgal|L|abbr=on}} was contained in a [[Recuperator|fuel recuperator]], bringing the aircraft's total internal fuel capacity to {{convert|700|impgal|L|abbr=on}}.

The [[Napier Scorpion|Napier Double Scorpion]] engine also contained a reserve of {{convert|200|impgal|L|abbr=on}} of [[high-test peroxide]] (HTP) to drive the rocket's turbopump and act as an oxidiser; fuel was drawn from the aircraft internal tankage. The rocket engine was intended at an early stage in the Lightning's development to boost performance should non-afterburning (reheated) engines be fitted. The basic performance with reheated Avons was deemed sufficient, and the rocket engine option was cancelled in 1958.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_139\">Scott 2000, pp. 139\u2013142.</ref> The ventral store was routinely used as an extra fuel tank, holding {{convert|247|impgal|L|abbr=on}} of usable fuel.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" /> On later variants of the Lightning, a ventral weapons pack could be installed to equip the aircraft alternatively with different armaments, including missiles, rockets, and cannons.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 45, 78.</ref>\n\n===Avionics and systems===\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN2056574.jpg|thumb|Underside of a Lightning F.3 with undercarriage deployed, 23 June 1979]]\nEarly versions of the Lightning were equipped with the Ferranti-developed AI.23 [[monopulse radar]], which was contained right at the front of the fuselage within an inlet cone at the centre of the engine intake.

This approach was unusual, since most aircraft used [[driveshaft]]-driven generators/alternators for electrical energy. A 28V DC battery provided emergency backup power.

The radar had a limited range and no [[track while scan]]ning capability, and it could detect targets only in a narrow (40\u00b0) arc.

It was famous for its ability to rapidly rotate from takeoff to climb almost vertically from the runway, though this did not yield the best time-to-altitude. The Lightning's trademark tail-stand manoeuvre exchanged airspeed for altitude; it could slow to near-stall speeds before commencing level flight. The Lightning's optimum climb profile required the use of afterburners during takeoff. Immediately after takeoff, the nose would be lowered for rapid acceleration to {{convert|430|kn|km/h}} [[Indicated airspeed|IAS]] before initiating a climb, stabilising at {{convert|450|kn|km/h}}. This would yield a constant climb rate of approximately {{convert|20000|ft/min|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name= \"F.6 ODM\" /><ref group=\"nb\">The Lightning would increase forward velocity during the climb, the angle of the climb lessening from about 27 deg to 19 deg at {{convert|13000|ft|abbr=on}}.</ref> Around {{convert|13000|ft|abbr=on}} the Lightning would reach {{convert|0.87|Mach|13000|km/h|0}} and maintain this speed until reaching the [[tropopause]], {{convert|36000|ft|abbr=on}} on a standard day.{{refn|The true airspeed associated with a given indicated airspeed increases with altitude.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surges]] or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 28 November 1958, the weather availed a high tropopause and a substandard \u221267&nbsp;\u00b0C at {{convert|40000|ft}}.

It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]].\n\nThe Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply meant that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range.<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. In September 2008, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] conferred on the Lightning its \"Engineering Heritage Award\" at a ceremony at [[BAE Systems]]' site at [[Warton Aerodrome]].<ref>Robinson, Ben.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response Specification ER.103 was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{cvt|50000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> In 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}. The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200541.html \"Progress with the P.1\"] ''Flight'', 26 April 1957, p.&nbsp;543.</ref> While ''WG760'' had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to {{convert|1.51|Mach|km/h|0}} due to [[directional stability]] limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the \"Lightning\" name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.<ref name =\"buttler 66\">Buttler 2000, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight.{{sfnp|Flight|26 April 1957}}{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=56-57}} On 25 November he reached Mach 2, {{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=67}} the first time in a British aircraft.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of 1,000&nbsp;mph were achieved daily. During this period the [[Fairey FD2]] delta held the world speed record (1,132&nbsp;mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=59}}\n\nIn 1958 two test pilots from the USAF [[Air Force Flight Test Center]], Andy Anderson and [[Deke Slayton]], were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts, commented:\n\n{{quote|The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104.

The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened inlet cone allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating {{convert|11250|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of {{convert|14430|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}.

It was famous for its ability to rapidly rotate from takeoff to climb almost vertically from the runway, though this did not yield the best time-to-altitude. The Lightning's trademark tail-stand manoeuvre exchanged airspeed for altitude; it could slow to near-stall speeds before commencing level flight. The Lightning's optimum climb profile required the use of afterburners during takeoff. Immediately after takeoff, the nose would be lowered for rapid acceleration to {{convert|430|kn|km/h}} [[Indicated airspeed|IAS]] before initiating a climb, stabilising at {{convert|450|kn|km/h}}.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surges]] or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operations at up to Mach 2.0.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009_50\">McLelland 2009, p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe small-fin variants could exceed Mach 1.7,{{refn|Roland Beamont took the Lightning P.1B XA847, a prototype of the F.1, to Mach 2.0. Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 28 November 1958, the weather availed a high tropopause and a substandard \u221267&nbsp;\u00b0C at {{convert|40000|ft}}.
