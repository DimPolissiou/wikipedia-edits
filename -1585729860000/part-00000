India is the last country with both lions and tigers in the wild. Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of [[Eurasia]],<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/> from India in the east, through northern [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], to the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the west.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/>]]\n\nHistorically, a comparison of the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') versus the [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'')<ref name=Geptner /><ref name=CAP /> has been a popular topic of discussion by [[hunter]]s,<ref name=Ortega2007 /><ref name=\"Porter1894\" /> naturalists,<ref name=\"TOTW2010\" /> artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination.<ref name=\"Thespokesmanreview1959\" /><ref name=lat /><ref name=Thomas2006 /><ref name=\"PapersPast1900\" /> In the past, lions and tigers reportedly [[#Competition or coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness|competed in the wilderness]],<ref name=minn /><ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\" /> where their ranges overlapped in [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Humphreys1999 /> The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in [[Captive animal|captivity]],<ref name=\"Beatty1941\" /> either deliberately<ref name=lat/><ref name=\"Auguet1994\" /> or accidentally.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"newspaperarchive.com\" />\n\n== Physical and behavioral comparison ==\n\n=== Behavioral comparison ===\nBoth the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, [[sympatric]] predators, and people. Both may [[Man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[Tiger attack|tiger]].<ref name=\"Porter1894\"/><ref name=\"BCKM1993\"/> \n\nGeneral differences in behavior:\n\n* The lion is usually a [[social animal]], while the tiger is [[Solitary animal|solitary]]. For this reason, even if tigers had individual advantages over lions, such as in intelligence, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs.<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\" />\n* Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\"/> though they do socialize.<ref name=CAP/> During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]].<ref name=Schaller1972/> However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,<ref name=S&S02/> with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,<ref name=\"Joslin1973\" /><ref name=\"Meena2008\" /> similar to tigers,<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Pocock1939/> and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their [[Cub (organism)|cub]]s, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.<ref name=\"HT2016\" />\n\n== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically [[Asiatic lion]]s and [[Bengal tiger]]s.<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Partington1835 /><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /> Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,<ref name=minn/><ref name=ToT1838/><ref name=Pocock1939 /><ref name=Karanth03 /> and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.<ref name=\"cambridge\" /><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\" />\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions<ref name=Haas2005 /><ref name=Catsg /> and [[Caspian tiger]]s<ref name=Mazak1981 /><ref name=Luo04 /> had occurred in other [[Asia]]n<ref name=\"Tudge2011\" /> or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/><ref name=Pocock1939/> As such, there is a word for 'Lion',<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Catsg/> which can also mean 'Tiger',<ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Kipling /> and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}}}),<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" /> and its significance is discussed below.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/>\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.<ref name=messybeast2012 /><ref name=\"ligerfacts.org\" /><ref name=\"krypto\" /><ref name=\"lair\" /><ref name=shi /> From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Luo04/><ref name=\"KitchenerDugmore2000\" /> it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Haas2005/><ref name=Mazak1981/> Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.<ref name=\"Jhaletal2011\" />\n\n[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]\n[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]\nThe possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Asiatic lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> before December 2017.<ref name=\"HT 2017\" /><ref name=\"TOI 12-2017\" /> Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\"/> Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\"<ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2006\" /> The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.<ref name=minn/> Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,<ref name=Kailash1978/> these lions are social like their African relatives,<ref name=S&S02 /> and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. The american biologist [[Craig Packer]] considers that a group of lions (two to three males) or lionesses (two to four females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress. Craig Packer is of the opinion that, in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.<ref name=minn/>\n\n[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,<ref name=Pocock1939/> as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Mazak1981/><ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Karanth03/> As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\n== Observed fights ==\n[[File:Indischer Maler um 1650 (II) 001.jpg|thumb|A [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] painting of a [[Dervish]] with a lion and tiger]]\n\nIn the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,<ref name=\"Auguet1994\"/> including [[Barbary lion]]s<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /><ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /> and tigers.<ref name=Hoage8-18 /> A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.<ref name=\"King2002\" /> There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s gained the victory.

The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals. Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach.

The tiger was more than {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, over {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=off}} feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile. The lion looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs and paws.

The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 [[rupee]]s, accepted that the tiger was the \"King of the [[Cat Family]],\" decreed that Atlas' body be given a Royal burial, and that the tiger should have a \"cage of honour\" in the [[menagerie]] of [[Baroda]], and decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran [[grizzly bear]] weighing more than {{convert|1500|lb|kg|abbr=in}}.

Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \"tyrants of the [[forest]],\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \"King of Beasts.\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.<ref name=\"CUL1855\" />\n* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \"medium-sized.\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,<ref name=Schaller1967 /> but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, [[limp]]ing into the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests|forest]].{{efn|As reported by ''St. Landry Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"StLandryDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Eaton Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"EatonDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Iola Register'' (1887),<ref name=\"IolaRegister1887\"/> ''The Milan Exchange'' (1887),<ref name=\"MilanExchange1887\"/> and ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' (1889),<ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\"/> in [[chronological order]].}}\n* Rivalry between the Asiatic lion and \"[[Siberia]]n tiger\"{{efn|Though this term was used,<ref name=\"SanFranciscoCall1911\" /> genetic tests showed that the [[Siberian tiger]] was closely related to the [[Caspian tiger]],<ref name=\"CSG2017\" /><ref name=\"Driscolletal2009\" /> which also inhabited the former [[Soviet Union]] (where Siberia is located), and whose range would have overlapped with that of the lion in places like the Caucasus.<ref name=\"Geptner\" />}} is mentioned in Hamilton M.

Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of [[Eurasia]],<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/> from India in the east, through northern [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], to the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the west.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/>]]\n\nHistorically, a comparison of the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') versus the [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'')<ref name=Geptner /><ref name=CAP /> has been a popular topic of discussion by [[hunter]]s,<ref name=Ortega2007 /><ref name=\"Porter1894\" /> naturalists,<ref name=\"TOTW2010\" /> artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination.<ref name=\"Thespokesmanreview1959\" /><ref name=lat /><ref name=Thomas2006 /><ref name=\"PapersPast1900\" /> In the past, lions and tigers reportedly [[#Competition or coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness|competed in the wilderness]],<ref name=minn /><ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\" /> where their ranges overlapped in [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Humphreys1999 /> The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in [[Captive animal|captivity]],<ref name=\"Beatty1941\" /> either deliberately<ref name=lat/><ref name=\"Auguet1994\" /> or accidentally.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"newspaperarchive.com\" />\n\n== Physical and behavioral comparison ==\n\n=== Behavioral comparison ===\nBoth the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, [[sympatric]] predators, and people. Both may [[Man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[Tiger attack|tiger]].<ref name=\"Porter1894\"/><ref name=\"BCKM1993\"/> \n\nGeneral differences in behavior:\n\n* The lion is usually a [[social animal]], while the tiger is [[Solitary animal|solitary]]. For this reason, even if tigers had individual advantages over lions, such as in intelligence, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs.<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\" />\n* Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\"/> though they do socialize.<ref name=CAP/> During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]].<ref name=Schaller1972/> However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,<ref name=S&S02/> with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,<ref name=\"Joslin1973\" /><ref name=\"Meena2008\" /> similar to tigers,<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Pocock1939/> and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their [[Cub (organism)|cub]]s, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.<ref name=\"HT2016\" />\n\n== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically [[Asiatic lion]]s and [[Bengal tiger]]s.<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Partington1835 /><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /> Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,<ref name=minn/><ref name=ToT1838/><ref name=Pocock1939 /><ref name=Karanth03 /> and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.<ref name=\"cambridge\" /><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\" />\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions<ref name=Haas2005 /><ref name=Catsg /> and [[Caspian tiger]]s<ref name=Mazak1981 /><ref name=Luo04 /> had occurred in other [[Asia]]n<ref name=\"Tudge2011\" /> or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/><ref name=Pocock1939/> As such, there is a word for 'Lion',<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Catsg/> which can also mean 'Tiger',<ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Kipling /> and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}}}),<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" /> and its significance is discussed below.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/>\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.<ref name=messybeast2012 /><ref name=\"ligerfacts.org\" /><ref name=\"krypto\" /><ref name=\"lair\" /><ref name=shi /> From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Luo04/><ref name=\"KitchenerDugmore2000\" /> it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Haas2005/><ref name=Mazak1981/> Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.<ref name=\"Jhaletal2011\" />\n\n[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]\n[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]\nThe possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Asiatic lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> before December 2017.<ref name=\"HT 2017\" /><ref name=\"TOI 12-2017\" /> Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\"/> Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\"<ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2006\" /> The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.<ref name=minn/> Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,<ref name=Kailash1978/> these lions are social like their African relatives,<ref name=S&S02 /> and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. The american biologist [[Craig Packer]] considers that a group of lions (two to three males) or lionesses (two to four females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress. Craig Packer is of the opinion that, in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.<ref name=minn/>\n\n[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,<ref name=Pocock1939/> as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Mazak1981/><ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Karanth03/> As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\n== Observed fights ==\n[[File:Indischer Maler um 1650 (II) 001.jpg|thumb|A [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] painting of a [[Dervish]] with a lion and tiger]]\n\nIn the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,<ref name=\"Auguet1994\"/> including [[Barbary lion]]s<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /><ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /> and tigers.<ref name=Hoage8-18 /> A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.<ref name=\"King2002\" /> There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s gained the victory.

The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals. Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach.

The tiger was more than {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, over {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=off}} feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile.

The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 [[rupee]]s, accepted that the tiger was the \"King of the [[Cat Family]],\" decreed that Atlas' body be given a Royal burial, and that the tiger should have a \"cage of honour\" in the [[menagerie]] of [[Baroda]], and decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran [[grizzly bear]] weighing more than {{convert|1500|lb|kg|abbr=in}}.

Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \"tyrants of the [[forest]],\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \"King of Beasts.\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.<ref name=\"CUL1855\" />\n* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \"medium-sized.\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,<ref name=Schaller1967 /> but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, [[limp]]ing into the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests|forest]].{{efn|As reported by ''St. Landry Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"StLandryDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Eaton Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"EatonDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Iola Register'' (1887),<ref name=\"IolaRegister1887\"/> ''The Milan Exchange'' (1887),<ref name=\"MilanExchange1887\"/> and ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' (1889),<ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\"/> in [[chronological order]].}}\n* Rivalry between the Asiatic lion and \"[[Siberia]]n tiger\"{{efn|Though this term was used,<ref name=\"SanFranciscoCall1911\" /> genetic tests showed that the [[Siberian tiger]] was closely related to the [[Caspian tiger]],<ref name=\"CSG2017\" /><ref name=\"Driscolletal2009\" /> which also inhabited the former [[Soviet Union]] (where Siberia is located), and whose range would have overlapped with that of the lion in places like the Caucasus.<ref name=\"Geptner\" />}} is mentioned in Hamilton M.

The 1947 Act defines the numbers of senators to be elected from each of the panels, and also provides for the division of each panel into two sub-panels: the nominating bodies sub-panel and the Oireachtas sub-panel, with a minimum number from each sub-panel.\t \n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+Senate vocational panels\n!rowspan=2|Panel\n!colspan=2|Senators\n!colspan=2|Nominating bodies (as of 2020)\n!rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"|\"Interests and services\" represented<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1947/act/42/section/3/enacted/en/html#sec3 Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 s.3]</ref>\n|-\n!Total  !!Min. per<br/>sub-panel\n!Number<ref>{{cite web |title=Register of Nominating Bodies as revised at the annual revision and signed by the Seanad Returning Officer in pursuance of section 19 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947, as amended. |url=https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/electoralProcess/nominatingBodies/seanad/2019/2019-07-24_register-of-nominating-bodies-2019_en.pdf |publisher=Oireachtas |accessdate=1 April 2020 |date=24 July 2019}}</ref> \n!Max nominees<br/>per body<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1954/act/1/section/7/enacted/en/html s.26(2) of the 1947 act as amended by s.7 of the 1954 act]</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Administrative Panel|Administrative]]\n| 7  || 3\n| 20 || 1\n|align=\"left\"| \"Public administration and social services, including voluntary social activities\"\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Agricultural Panel|Agricultural]]\n| 11 || 4\n| 10 || 2\n|align=\"left\"| \"Agriculture and allied interests, and fisheries\"\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Cultural and Educational Panel|Cultural and Educational]]\n| 5  || 2\n| 34 || 1 \n|align=\"left\"| \"The national language {{bracket|i.e. [[Irish language|Irish]]}} and culture, literature, art, education\" and \"such [[profession]]al interests as may be defined by law\", namely \"law\" and \"medicine, including surgery, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and pharmaceutical chemistry\"\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Industrial and Commercial Panel|Industrial and Commercial]]\n| 9  || 3\n| 47 || 1\n|align=\"left\"| \"Industry and commerce, including banking, finance, accountancy, engineering, and architecture\"\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Labour Panel|Labour]]\n| 11 || 4\n| 2  || 7\n|align=\"left\"| \"Labour, whether [[trade union|organised]] or unorganised\"\n|-class=\"sortbottom\"\n!

Candidates can be nominated by two methods: by Oireachtas members or by nominating bodies. Nominating bodies are organisations that are connected to the particular vocation, for example, the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] can nominate in the Labour panel, and the [[Royal Irish Academy]] can nominate in the Cultural and Education panel.\n\nAs the electorate is restricted to elected councillors, [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s and senators, the political parties have a great influence in the nomination procedures. The main political parties are aware of how many seats they will win after the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] election and will endorse candidates that they deem to have a chance of election to the D\u00e1il in the next general election. The nominating bodies tend to nominate party members. Even where non-party candidates get on the ballot paper, it is very rare that these candidates are successful.\n\n===<!-- [[Completion of panels]] redirects here-->Completion of panels===\nThe minimum number of nominees for each subpanel is two plus the maximum number to be elected from the subpanel. If there are too few candidates on a subpanel, the [[Taoiseach]] must nominate extra candidates to \"complete\" the panel.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 s.37 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1947/act/42/section/37/enacted/en/html |website=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB) |accessdate=31 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> In the [[21st Seanad|1997 Seanad election]], [[Bertie Ahern]] was obliged to nominate four candidates across three Oireachtas sub-panels, none of whom polled well in the ensuing election.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Coakley |first1=John |last2=Manning |first2=Maurice |editor-last1=Marsh |editor-first1=Michael |title=How Ireland Voted 1997 |chapter=The Senate Elections ||date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-429-96854-9 |page=203 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwDFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA203 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Whereas [[Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann|nomination directly to the Seanad]] must be by a Taoiseach elected after a [[D\u00e1il election results|D\u00e1il general election]], nomination of candidates to complete a panel may be by an ''acting'' Taoiseach. For example, in 2020 [[Leo Varadkar]] was acting Taoiseach after [[2020 Irish general election|the D\u00e1il election]]; in [[2020 Irish Seanad election|the ensuing Seanad election]], Oireachtas members only nominated eight candidates to their subpanel of the Labour panel, so Varadkar nominated one more to bring the total up to the minimum of nine.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Panels of candidates prepared by the Seanad Returning Officer pursuant to Section 43 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947, as amended by the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1954. |journal=Iris Oifigi\u00fail |date=10 March 2020 |issue=20A [Supplement] |page=6 |url=https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/electoralProcess/electoralRoll/seanad/2020/2020-03-10_seanad-general-election-2020-panels-of-candidates_en.pdf#page=6}}; {{cite news |last1=O'Halloran |first1=Marie |title=FG\u2019s Mary Seery Kearney added to ticket to contest Seanad election |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/fg-s-mary-seery-kearney-added-to-ticket-to-contest-seanad-election-1.4198771 |date=10 March 2020 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |work=The Irish Times |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Voting==\nThe electoral college for the vocational panels are [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|city and county councillors]], members of the new D\u00e1il and members of the outgoing Seanad. The electorate consists of approximately 1,000 voters.\n\nVoting is conducted by proportional representation by the [[single transferable vote]]. However, each ballot is given the value of 1,000 to aid the transfer of fractions of votes. \n\nThere is a guaranteed minimum number of members that can be elected from each sub-panel. This was designed to allow nominating bodies a greater influence in the election of Senators. However, in practice, the political parties also dominate the nominating bodies sub-panel nominations and the electorate.\n\nIn a by-election to the vocational panels, the nomination procedure is the same.

Candidates can be nominated by two methods: by Oireachtas members or by nominating bodies. Nominating bodies are organisations that are connected to the particular vocation, for example, the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] can nominate in the Labour panel, and the [[Royal Irish Academy]] can nominate in the Cultural and Education panel.\n\nAs the electorate is restricted to elected councillors, [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s and senators, the political parties have a great influence in the nomination procedures. The main political parties are aware of how many seats they will win after the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] election and will endorse candidates that they deem to have a chance of election to the D\u00e1il in the next general election. The nominating bodies tend to nominate party members. Even where non-party candidates get on the ballot paper, it is very rare that these candidates are successful.\n\n===<!-- [[Completion of panels]] redirects here-->Completion of panels===\nThe minimum number of nominees for each subpanel is two plus the maximum number to be elected from the subpanel. If there are too few candidates on a subpanel, the [[Taoiseach]] must nominate extra candidates to \"complete\" the panel.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 s.37 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1947/act/42/section/37/enacted/en/html |website=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB) |accessdate=31 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> In the [[21st Seanad|1997 Seanad election]], [[Bertie Ahern]] was obliged to nominate four candidates across three Oireachtas sub-panels, none of whom polled well in the ensuing election.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Coakley |first1=John |last2=Manning |first2=Maurice |editor-last1=Marsh |editor-first1=Michael |title=How Ireland Voted 1997 |chapter=The Senate Elections ||date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-429-96854-9 |page=203 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwDFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA203 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Whereas [[Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann|nomination directly to the Seanad]] must be by a Taoiseach elected after a [[D\u00e1il election results|D\u00e1il general election]], nomination of candidates to complete a panel may be by an ''acting'' Taoiseach.

The electorate consists of approximately 1,000 voters.\n\nVoting is conducted by proportional representation by the [[single transferable vote]]. However, each ballot is given the value of 1,000 to aid the transfer of fractions of votes. \n\nThere is a guaranteed minimum number of members that can be elected from each sub-panel. This was designed to allow nominating bodies a greater influence in the election of Senators. However, in practice, the political parties also dominate the nominating bodies sub-panel nominations and the electorate.\n\nIn a by-election to the vocational panels, the nomination procedure is the same. However, as there is only one seat available, there can be no minimum number elected from sub-panels.

It reportedly could not be \"without her popularity, fame, honour and respect among the people.\"<ref>Inb Al-'Imad, ''Shadharat al-Dhahab'', ii. 21 </ref>\n\n===Ascetic way of life and miracles===\nIt is reported that Nafisa has been living an ascetic way of life. Zainab, her niece, had witnessed that her aunt ate once per three days and kept an empty basket with her, each time she wanted to eat something small, she put her hand inside and found something sent from Allah. Once being moved by the way of life led by Sayyida Nafisa, Zainab asked her aunt: \"You must take care of yourself.\" On that she replied \"How shall I take care of myself before I reach my Lord? Ahead of me are so many barriers which no one can cross except the successful ones (''al-[[Faiz|f\u0101\u02beiz\u016bn]]'', {{lang|ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0632\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0646}}).\"<ref name=\"sunnah\" />\n\nMore than 150 miracles are attributed to Nafisa throughout her life and after death. After settling down in Cairo, there was a miracle of her curing the paralysed daughter of a neighbouring non-Muslim family. One day, the daughter was left in Nafisa's house when her mother went shopping to the marketplace. When Nafisa did her [[Wudu|ablution]] before [[Salah|prayer]], some drops of water touched the girl and she started to move. When Nafisa was praying, daughter stood up and ran to the coming mother, who was shaken and overjoyed at the same moment. After that miracle, the whole family and other neighbours accepted Islam.<ref name=\"Fa\">[https://fa.livejournal.com/399585.html Fa]</ref>\n\nAfter her death the one accident had happened. Some thieves entered her mosque and took sixteen silver lamps. They wanted to escape immediately, but failed to find the doors. They were trapped as if they were in a cage. The next morning, they were found and put into prison.<ref name=\"Fa\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nHer piety was renown to the extent that people came from far and near to seek her blessings; hagiographers recount her decision to leave Egypt due to the throngs that came to seek the blessings of ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'' (\"People of the Household (of Muhammad)\"), leaving little time for prayer. However, the pleas of the governor of Egypt, As-Sirri ibn al-Hakam, and the people for her not to leave Egypt convinced her to stay. Numerous accounts are given of the miracles she performed for those who sought her aid directly or through prayer, such as curing a blind child, intervening when the [[Nile]] did not rise one year as expected, preventing a ship from sinking, helping a poor woman who spent her life spinning wool to support her family, freeing a prisoner through her [[Shafa'ah|intercession]], and seeing people through their difficulties.<ref name=KassamBlomfield/>\n\n[[Sayyid]]ah Nafisah, [[Mashhad of Sayyida Ruqayya|Sayyidah Ruqayyah]] and Sayyidah [[Zaynab bint Ali]] are traditionally considered the patron saints of the ''mad\u012bnah'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629}}, city) of Cairo.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nafisa}}\n[[Category:762 births]]\n[[Category:824 deaths]]\n[[Category:Salaf]]\n[[Category:9th-century Muslim scholars of Islam]]\n[[Category:Family of Muhammad]]\n[[Category:People from Mecca]]\n[[Category:Women scholars of Islam]]\n\n\n{{Islam-bio-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2013}}\n{{Cleanup|date=June 2013|reason=Needs additional information and tags}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox religious biography\n|religion    = [[Islam]]\n|name        = Naf\u012bsah bint Al-\u1e24asan \n|native_name = \u0646\u064e\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0629 \u0628\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062a \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\n|native_name_lang = ar\n|image       = File:Masjid having Nafisa Mausoleum side by,Cairo .jpg\n|caption     = [[Al-Sayeda Nafeesah Mosque]] having Nafisah's Mausoleum by its side in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]\n|title       = ''As-[[Sayyid]]ah'' ({{lang|ar|\u0671\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0650\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0629}}) <br> ''A\u1e6d-\u1e6c\u0101hirah'' ({{lang|ar|\u0671\u0644\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0647\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629}})\n|birth_name  = Nafisah\n|birth_date  = 762 [[Gregorian calendar|ACE]], 145 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]\n|birth_place = [[Mecca]], [[Hejaz]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Asia]]\n|death_date  = 824 [[Common Era|CE]], 208 [[Hijri year|AH]]\n|death_place = Cairo, Egypt\n|death_cause = \n|resting_place = Cairo\n|spouse      = Is-\u1e25\u0101q al-Mu\u02betamin\n|children    = Q\u0101sim (son) <br> Umm Kulth\u016bm (daughter)\n|father      = Al-\u1e24asan al-Anwar ibn Zayd al-Ablaj ibn [[Hasan ibn Ali|Al-Hasan]] ibn [[Ali|\u02bfAl\u012b]] ibn [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib]]\n|mother      = Zaynab bint [[Hasan ibn Hasan|Al-Hasan ibn Al-Hasan]] ibn \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib\n|nationality = \n|ethnicity   = [[Arabs|Arab]]\n|era         = [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]]\n|region      = Egypt, [[Northeast Africa]]\n|occupation  = [[Islamic scholar]]\n|influences  = [[Imamah (Shia)|Imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]\n|influenced  = [[Imam]] [[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Idris al-Shafi'i]]\n|module      = \n|website     = \n}}\n\n'''Sayyida Nafisa''' (d. 208 [[Hijri year|AH]] / 830 [[Common Era|CE]]), full name ''As-Sayyidah Naf\u012bsah [[Patronymic#Arabic|bint]] Am\u012br al-Mu\u02bemin\u012bn Al-\u1e24asan al-Anwar ibn Zayd al-Ablaj ibn [[Hasan ibn Ali|Al-Hasan]] ibn [[Ali|\u02bfAl\u012b]] ibn [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib]] al-\u02bfAlawiyyah al-\u1e24asaniyyah'' ({{lang-ar|\u0671\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0650\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0629 \u0646\u064e\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0629 \u0628\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062a \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0631 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0624\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0632\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064e\u062c \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0628 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629}}), was a [[Family tree of Muhammad|female descendant]] of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic ''Nabi'']] ([[Prophet]]) [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], and a scholar and teacher of [[Islam]].

Zainab, her niece, had witnessed that her aunt ate once per three days and kept an empty basket with her, each time she wanted to eat something small, she put her hand inside and found something sent from Allah. Once being moved by the way of life led by Sayyida Nafisa, Zainab asked her aunt: \"You must take care of yourself.\" On that she replied \"How shall I take care of myself before I reach my Lord? Ahead of me are so many barriers which no one can cross except the successful ones (''al-[[Faiz|f\u0101\u02beiz\u016bn]]'', {{lang|ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0632\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0646}}).\"<ref name=\"sunnah\" />\n\nMore than 150 miracles are attributed to Nafisa throughout her life and after death. After settling down in Cairo, there was a miracle of her curing the paralysed daughter of a neighbouring non-Muslim family. One day, the daughter was left in Nafisa's house when her mother went shopping to the marketplace. When Nafisa did her [[Wudu|ablution]] before [[Salah|prayer]], some drops of water touched the girl and she started to move. When Nafisa was praying, daughter stood up and ran to the coming mother, who was shaken and overjoyed at the same moment. After that miracle, the whole family and other neighbours accepted Islam.<ref name=\"Fa\">[https://fa.livejournal.com/399585.html Fa]</ref>\n\nAfter her death the one accident had happened. Some thieves entered her mosque and took sixteen silver lamps. They wanted to escape immediately, but failed to find the doors. They were trapped as if they were in a cage. The next morning, they were found and put into prison.<ref name=\"Fa\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nHer piety was renown to the extent that people came from far and near to seek her blessings; hagiographers recount her decision to leave Egypt due to the throngs that came to seek the blessings of ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'' (\"People of the Household (of Muhammad)\"), leaving little time for prayer. However, the pleas of the governor of Egypt, As-Sirri ibn al-Hakam, and the people for her not to leave Egypt convinced her to stay. Numerous accounts are given of the miracles she performed for those who sought her aid directly or through prayer, such as curing a blind child, intervening when the [[Nile]] did not rise one year as expected, preventing a ship from sinking, helping a poor woman who spent her life spinning wool to support her family, freeing a prisoner through her [[Shafa'ah|intercession]], and seeing people through their difficulties.<ref name=KassamBlomfield/>\n\n[[Sayyid]]ah Nafisah, [[Mashhad of Sayyida Ruqayya|Sayyidah Ruqayyah]] and Sayyidah [[Zaynab bint Ali]] are traditionally considered the patron saints of the ''mad\u012bnah'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629}}, city) of Cairo.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nafisa}}\n[[Category:762 births]]\n[[Category:824 deaths]]\n[[Category:Salaf]]\n[[Category:9th-century Muslim scholars of Islam]]\n[[Category:Family of Muhammad]]\n[[Category:People from Mecca]]\n[[Category:Women scholars of Islam]]\n\n\n{{Islam-bio-stub}}\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Typo fixing, replaced: from From \u2192 From", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyida_Nafisa"}
