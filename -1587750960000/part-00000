They have driven historical movements such as the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] (which targeted the [[Mongol]] leadership of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]) and the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which overthrew the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. Ethnic tensions have led to [[List of ethnic riots#China|incidents]] in the country such as the [[July 2009 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi riots]].\n\n*'''The {{flagdeco|PRC}} [[People's Republic of China]] (China or PRC)''' is a state that is [[Foreign relations of China|recognised]] by 177 (out of 192 other) [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations member states]] (as well as [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], an [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer]]) as the [[China and the United Nations|sole legitimate government of China]]; the PRC represents China in the [[United Nations]] and is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member of the United Nations Security Council]]. These states (that recognise the PRC's legitimacy) all recognise the [[Mainland|continental]] and island (e.g. [[Hainan]]) territory of \"[[mainland China]]\", which includes certain contentious regions such as [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]], as being part of China (disregarding [[List of territorial disputes|border disputes]]). Mainland China does not include [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]].\n**'''The''' {{flagdeco|PRC}} '''PRC's irredentist territorial claim to [[Taiwan]] as \"[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China]]\"''' \u2014 Many of the states that recognise the PRC's legitimacy have not clarified whether they specifically recognise China's [[Irredentism|irredentist]] [[Territorial dispute|territorial claim]] to the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] and its [[List of islands of Taiwan|satellite islands]] (including [[Penghu]], [[Orchid Island]], [[Green Island, Taiwan|Green Island]], etc.), which it has [[History of Taiwan since 1945|never historically administered]]. China claims Taiwan as \"Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China\", but such a [[polity]] has never historically existed. Taiwan was designated a \"[[Provinces of China|province of China]]\" between 1887 and 1895 and a \"[[prefecture]] of [[Fujian|Fujian Province]]\" between 1684 and 1887, in both cases under the [[Qing dynasty]], an [[History of China|historical regime of China]] and the last Chinese [[Empire|imperial]] [[dynasty]]; the Qing dynasty [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|never exercised absolute control]] over the entire island of Taiwan and its satellite islands.\n*'''The {{flagdeco|HKG}} [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]] (Hong Kong or Hong Kong SAR)''' is a highly autonomous territory whose sovereignty ultimately lies within China (PRC).

Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]]. A \"[[Human rights|rights]] organization which has worked to denounce Saudi Arabia\u2019s abuses in northern Yemen\",<ref name=PressTV>{{cite news|title=Yemen's Houthis standing ground against Saudi Arabia |url= http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/02/07/349604/houthis-stand-ground-against-s-arabia |work=Press TV| date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> the Asir Movement described itself as a \u201ccivil popular\u201d movement that seeks to raise \"internal Yemeni awareness\" about the situation and to explore legal remedies against Saudi Arabia \"for their involvement and assistance in abdicating Yemen\u2019s historical right to its territories\", all while emphasizing Yemeni unity.

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]]. Many supporters of Taiwan independence believe that Taiwan, under the formal name of the \"Republic of China\", is already an independent country from China, under the formal name of the \"People's Republic of China\".\n***Political parties: [[Pan-Green Coalition]] ([[Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], [[Taiwan Independence Party]]), [[New Power Party]], [[Taiwan Statebuilding Party]]\n***Advocacy groups: Keep Taiwan Free (Taiwanese organisation), [[World United Formosans for Independence]]\n***Claimed territories: Taiwan (Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, Taiwan-Penghu, Taoyuan)\n***Area of claimed territories: Roughly 36,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of claimed territories: Roughly 24,000,000 people\n{{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} '''[[Kinmen|Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (Kinmen)''' \u2014 Independence movement{{See also|Kinmen|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\n\n* Ethnic group: Kinmenese people, [[Taiwanese people]]\n**Proposed unification with a proposed state: {{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}}[[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] Kinmen County, Republic of Taiwan\n***Movement: Kinmen-Taiwan unification movement, [[Taiwan independence movement]], [[Taiwanese nationalism]]\n****Note: [[Kinmen]] is currently ruled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]], so it and Taiwan are ''de facto'' already united. However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

Kinmen is viewed by the Chinese (PRC) government as a place where Chinese (re)unification experiments can be conducted, in preparation for the ultimate goal of annexing the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]]. The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

Eastern Province highlighted.]]\n\nIn 2013 Robin Wright\u2019s colorful map of a politically re-divided Middle East in the New York Times, which illustrated her article \u201cImagining a Remapped Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]].

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]].

However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Devilina Productions, with [[Scott Buck]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Finn Jones]] stars as Rand, alongside [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Sacha Dhawan]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[David Wenham]]. Development for the series began in late 2013, with Buck hired as the series' showrunner in December 2015 and Jones cast as Rand in February 2016. Filming took place in New York City from April to October 2016, with a focus placed on exploring the \"[[American upper class|One Percent of the One Percent]]\" through story, location, and costume design. The character's martial arts background is also explored, and each episode is named after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences. As the last of several Marvel Netflix seasons to release before the crossover miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', it features set-up for that event and references to those prior seasons.\n\nThe season premiered on March 15, 2017, in New York City, with the full season of 13 episodes released on Netflix on March 17. It received generally negative reviews from critics, particularly for its pace and storytelling, and Jones's performance. The appropriateness of his casting and storyline in terms of race was also widely discussed, while the season's fight sequences were criticized as an important element that were poorly acted, choreographed, and edited. Conversely, Henwick's performance and the use of established characters [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] and [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]] did receive some praise. Third-party data analytics determined the series had strong initial viewership, but this dropped within a week. The series was renewed for a [[Iron Fist (season 2)|second season]] in July 2017.<ref name=\"IFS2\" />\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Episodes ==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#6A543F |overall=5 |season=5 |title=24 |titleR={{efn|name=Titles|Each episode is named after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"NYCC2016IGNLoebBuck\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2016/10/09/iron-fist-will-bring-a-lighter-tone-to-the-marvel-netflix-series-nycc-2016|title=Iron Fist Will Bring a Lighter Tone to the Marvel / Netflix Series \u2013 NYCC 2016|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 8, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ShaolinKungFuEpTitles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/01/23/iron-fist-episode-titles-inspired-by-shaolin-kung-fu-moves/|title=Iron Fist Episode Titles Inspired By Shaolin Kung Fu Moves|last=Golder|first=Dave|publisher=Mym Buzz|date=January 23, 2017|accessdate=July 29, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928042127/http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/01/23/iron-fist-episode-titles-inspired-by-shaolin-kung-fu-moves/|archivedate=September 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>}} |director=15 |writer=36 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-iron-fist/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's iron fist on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Snow Gives Way\n |DirectedBy = [[John Dahl]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Scott Buck]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|3|17}}\n |ShortSummary = After being presumed dead for 15 years, when his family were the victims of a plane crash in the Himalayas, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]] returns to New York City and goes to Rand Enterprises to meet with [[Harold Meachum]], the partner of Danny's now dead father Wendell.

Harold decides to kill Bakuto and formulates a plan to flush him and his operatives out of the compound by having Joy freeze their accounts.

Buck said that much of the season was \"about a journey of finding self ... in terms of what he wants to be as far as 'Who is Danny Rand? What is the Iron Fist?\u2019 and then, 'How do these things get together?'\"<ref name=\"NYCC2016Collider\" /> Loeb described the structure of the season as building \"through a series of sort of metaphorical fights, which is very important in a martial arts film, to sort of show how the character needs to grow from the innocent, wide-eyed person to someone who has to come to terms with \u2018this is the way the outside world works\u2014how am I going to make it work for me?\u2019\".<ref name=\"HogarthInvolved\" />\n\nContinuing on the idea from the previous Marvel Netflix series that New York City is a \"fifth Defender\", Loeb said the season would examine the high-end financial world of New York City, examining \"[[American upper class|the One Percent of the One Percent]] and how that affects our world on a day-to-day basis... high-level corporation, [[Pharmaceutical industry|Big Pharma]], things like that\".<ref name=\"LoebBuckCBR\" /> Actor [[Finn Jones]] added the season examined \"corporate corruption and corporate responsibility in the modern world, and... how much do corporations have impact on society? And what we actually look at in the show is the heroin epidemic of the city, and how corporations maybe actually fund the heroin epidemic, and what that means to society\".<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\" /> In terms of Rand donning a comic-based costume in the season, Buck stated, \"There was no good reason we could imagine to put Danny Rand in a costume. Because Danny Rand is still discovering who he is as a hero and where he is going to be, so he's not yet ready to put on a mask or a costume. [A]t the same time he is someone who is rather well known as a billionaire, so he can't necessarily go out in public and do the things he does without being recognized. It does become an issue for the character.\"<ref name=\"CostumeMar2017\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe main cast for the season includes Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist,<ref name=\"FinnJones\" /><ref name=\"FinnJonesConfirmed\" /> [[Jessica Henwick]] as [[Colleen Wing]],<ref name=\"Henwick\" /> [[Tom Pelphrey]] as [[Ward Meachum]],<ref name=\"StroupPelphrey\" /> [[Jessica Stroup]] as [[Joy Meachum]],<ref name=\"StroupPelphrey\" /> [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]] as [[Bakuto (comics)|Bakuto]],<ref name=\"Bakuto\" /> [[Sacha Dhawan]] as [[Steel Serpent|Davos]],<ref name=\"Dhawan\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> and [[David Wenham]] as [[Harold Meachum]].<ref name=\"Wenham\" /> Dawson reprises her role from previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nRecurring throughout the season are David Furr as Wendell Rand, Danny's father;<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> Barrett Doss as Megan, a Rand Enterprises secretary;<ref name=\"Doss\" /> [[Alex Wyse]] as Kyle, Harold Meachum's personal assistant;<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> and Ramon Fernandez as Kevin Singleton, Harold Meachum's bodyguard.<ref name=\"Fernandez\" /> Wai Ching Ho recurs as Gao, reprising her role from ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'',<ref name=\"OfficialTrailer\" /> and Marquis Rodriguez recurs as Darryl, reprising his role from ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"IGNReview102\" /> [[Clifton Davis]],<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> John Sanders,<ref name=\"Sanders\" /> and Elise Santora<ref name=\"Santora\" /> portray Lawrence Wilkins, Donald Hooper, and Maria Rodriguez, respectively, members of the Rand Enterprise board. Also returning from previous Marvel Netflix series are [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]],<ref name=\"Moss\" /> [[Tijuana Ricks]] as Thembi Wallace,<ref name=\"Ricks\" /> and Suzanne H. Smart as Shirley Benson.<ref name=\"Smart\" />\n\n=== Design ===\nStephanie Maslansky is the costume designer for ''Iron Fist'', after serving the same role for the previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> Maslansky noted one of the differences with the season compared to the other Marvel Netflix series, was the neighborhoods it spent time in (\"the wealthier neighborhoods; [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Upper East Side]], that sort of thing\") compared to [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] for ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'' and [[Harlem]] for ''Luke Cage''. As such, Rand wears more suits than the other heroes, and given the amount of fighting he does in the season, a lot of spandex was added to increase the suits' flexibility.<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg1\" /> Rand's look evolves throughout the season, with Maslansky noting, \"When we first meet him he's clearly traveled a long way. I wanted people to look at Danny and not be sure exactly what he was. A backpacker, or a homeless man. His look needed to reflect a variety of culture [and almost feel] otherworldly.\" Once Rand enters the corporate world, he settles on an \"Urban Cali\" style, which is \"a little looser, little more relaxed. But it's still a suit. His tie is never tied tightly and he always wears sneakers.\" This relaxed style for Rand also provided \"a strong contrast\" to Ward Meachum who is a \"far more corporate looking person.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg2\" /> The monk costumes and Rand's warrior costume was based on \"real [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] warrior monk costumes... I took that distinctive silhouette from the Shaolin warrior monk clothing, and we combined it with the traditional colors of the Iron Fist, green and gold.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg3\" /> Regarding Gao, Maslansky stated \"Her particular look is influenced by ancient China,\" particularly the [[Terracotta Army]] and further progresses the \"villainy\" look of the Marvel Netflix series of \"surround[ing] themselves with [money], with beautiful things.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg2\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Bayonne Bridge from Nicholas Av overpass jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Bayonne Bridge]] doubled as Anzhou, China during production]]\nMarvel announced in February 2014 that the series would be filmed in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> with Quesada stating in April that the show would be filming on location in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Photography began in April 2016 in New York City,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"FilmingStart2\" /> with the [[working title]] ''Kick''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /><ref name=\"JonesEWJan2017\" /> Manuel Billeter served as director of photography after doing the same for the first seasons of ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\nFilming locations included [[Mariners Harbor, Staten Island|Mariners Harbor]] and [[Sailors' Snug Harbor]] on [[Staten Island]],<ref name=\"SIFilming\" /><ref name=\"SIFilming2\" /> which served as Bakuto's compound; [[28 Liberty Street]] for the exterior of Rand Enterprises, while some interiors were filmed in the [[MetLife Building]]; [[19 Gramercy Park South]] for Joy Meachum's home; [[City Hall Park]]; [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], including [[Mott Street]]; the lobby of the [[General Electric Building]] for Harold Meachum's penthouse; the [[Manhattan Bridge]]; [[Green-Wood Cemetery]]; [[Bank of America Tower (Manhattan)|Bank of America Tower]]; [[Bryant Park]]; the Presidential Suite in the [[InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel]], serving as Rand's temporary apartment; the STK Midtown restaurant; [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Pelham Bay Park]]; the [[Bayonne Bridge]], which doubled as Anzhou, China; and [[York Avenue / Sutton Place|Sutton Place]] Park.<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Filming [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 8, 2016.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\n''Iron Fist'' was filmed in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (HDR), which Billeter stated added \"a learning curve\" to his work, forcing him to rethink how he would shoot certain scenes, such as a car lights or street lights, which become much brighter in HDR than previously. To compensate, lights would be painted on set to help \"bring down the highlights\". Post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]] worked on the season to adjust colors the filming team did not have the chance to tweak on set.<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n==== Fight training and choreography ====\nBrett Chan was the stunt-coordinator, fight choreographer, and second unit director for the season, having \"full involvement in all the episodes\". Buck wanted the fighting in the series to be mostly [[Wing Chun]] but with the [[Five Animals|animal styles]] of kung fu as well, and Chan worked alongside Buck and other Marvel executives during development of the fights. As a second unit director, the amount of creative input that Chan had depended on the episodic director he was working with. Chan was influenced by the works of the [[Shaw Brothers]], [[Jackie Chan]], [[Stephen Chow]], [[Bruce Lee]], and [[Yuen Woo Ping]], but avoided being \"floaty or wire-like\" per a request from Marvel; wire work and CGI were used minimally for fights.<ref name=\"ChanCV\" />\n\nChan worked closely with Jones during early preparation for the season, but during filming spent most of his time either choreographing sequences or working on-set.<ref name=\"ChanCV\" /> Chan noted that Jones had a very busy schedule, and it was difficult to find the time to train him in martial arts which Chan felt was \"a lifestyle\" and \"isn't something you can just pick up, or train for every once in a while. It's something you need to be really involved in\". He did note that Henwick trained for six hours every day regardless if she was scheduled to train that day or if she was filming.<ref name=\"ChanScroll\" /> Jones elaborated that he had three weeks before filming began to train for the season,<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" /> during which time he would spend two and a half hours a day training in martial arts before doing weight training in the afternoons.<ref name=\"JonesTrainingEW\" /> Once filming began, Jones had a day and a half during weekends in which he could continue his training, and otherwise would have to learn fight choreography 15 minutes before filming an action sequence. He described this process as \"a baptism of fire and I just learned on the job\".<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nThe executive producers wanted the score to feel modern, and composer [[Trevor Morris (musician)|Trevor Morris]] agreed not to use an orchestra. He did try some instruments to represent the Asian influence on the series, but these were deemed \"too traditional\" by the producers. Only some \"heavily affected\" Japanese flutes were ultimately used.<ref name=\"MorrisAD\" /> Morris also looked to avoid using themes for different characters in a traditional way. He did write a theme for Rand, which is heard in the series' title sequence, as well as a theme for [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]], but in general focused on environmental music.<ref name=\"MorrisMR\" /> Additional music heard in the season includes \"[[So Fresh, So Clean]]\" by [[Outkast]], \"[[Uptown Saturday Night (album)|Krystal Karrington]]\" by [[Camp Lo]], \"[[Priesthood (album)|Heat of the Moment]]\" by [[Killah Priest]], \"[[Black Mags]]\" by [[The Cool Kids]], \"[[Summertime '06|Hang N' Bang]]\" by [[Vince Staples]], \"[[Run the Jewels 2|Blockbuster Night, Pt. 1]]\" by [[Run the Jewels]],<ref name=\"AdditionalMusic\" /> and music from [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref name=\"NYCC2016Footage\" />\n\nA soundtrack album featuring Morris's score was released by Marvel digitally on March 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of the season.

There does have to be a lot of cooperation between all the different [series' showrunners].

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Despite some promising moments, ''Iron Fist'' is weighed down by an absence of momentum and originality.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv//marvel_s_iron_fist/s01 |title=Marvel's Iron Fist: Season 1 (2017)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 37 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-iron-fist |title=''Marvel's Iron Fist'': Season 1 |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the first six episodes of the season, Daniel Fienberg of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' found ''Iron Fist'' to be the \"first big misstep\" for Marvel and Netflix, lacking the \"street-level authenticity\" that their previous series had. Fienberg felt Jones was unable to elevate the material, instead coming across as \"a spoiled frat boy\". He said the season lacked basic character archetypes such as \"a worthy adversary to our hero\", comic relief, or a \"voice of wise authority\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan gave a negative review for the first two episodes, calling them \"ferociously boring\" and \"inessential\". After criticizing the pacing, action, general characterization, production design, cinematography, and dialogue, Ryan suggested that Henwick should have been the star of the season instead of Jones.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n\nRob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized Jones' performance, calling him \"totally devoid of charisma, more cub than lone wolf.\" He also felt the character was missing humor and inner turmoil, and said Rand's \"mystic Zen quotes go over like a ''[[Wayne's World]]'' set-up minus the punch line.\"<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\" /> Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] awarded the season 3 stars out of 5 after seeing the first six episodes. She said the season had a good cast and great origin story, but had a \"glacial pace\" and choppy editing. She did find Jones charming, but agreed with Fienberg that the season was lacking a villain, and felt that Temple was \"shoe-horned\" into the season.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> In his review for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, \"''Iron Fist'' needed to be so much weirder than it actually is, akin to how ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016) essentially re-told the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. ''Iron Fist'' starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when the vast majority of the principal characters [are so] underdeveloped.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" /> Fitzpatrick felt that Colleen Wing was the better of the supporting characters, and praised Henwick's performance.<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" />\n\n[[Uproxx]]'s [[Alan Sepinwall]] felt of the first six episodes, \"It's easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows\", criticizing the pacing and \"miscasting\" of Jones. He was more positive about Moss and Dawson's roles. Sepinwall concluded, \"the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They\u2019re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny had to be [in ''The Defenders'', and as a result,] we got a show that's so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season\".<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> Dan Jolin also gave 3 stars out of 5 in his review for ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''. He felt it was beneficial that ''Iron Fist'' released after ''Doctor Strange'' introduced the MCU to \"all his Eastern-mystical baggage\", and called Iron Fist \"a fresh presence\" compared to \"moody, conflicted heroism\" of the other Defenders. Jolin did criticize that Buck had \"no sense of connection to his subject\" as previous Marvel Netflix showrunners had, and felt it was not until the sixth episode \"that you really feel the pulp martial-arts-movie-riffing origins\" thanks to episodic director RZA who \"finally gives the show a proper sense of flair ... It's enough to make you wish they made him the showrunner.\" Jolin concluded, \"''Iron Fist'' works some fantastical flavor into the MCU's down-to-earth Defenders nook, but it needs more proper kung-fu flair than showrunner Buck allows.\"<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" />\n\nResponding to these reviews, Jones said that \"these shows are not made for critics, they are first and foremost made for the fans ... when the fans of the Marvel Netflix world and fans of the comic books view the show through the lens of just wanting to enjoy a superhero show, then they will really enjoy what they see.\"<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" /> Jones later attributed the negative reviews to the fact that his character, \"a white American billionaire\", was similar to [[Donald Trump]] who had become \"public enemy number one, especially in the US\" between the making of the season and its release.<ref name=\"JonesTrump\" /> In an article for [[Vox (website)|Vox]], Alex Abad-Santos said Jones was just attempting to \"pass the blame\" away from himself when the real problem with the season was \"no one thought about what makes the character human\". Abad-Santos suggested that the season be a warning to others telling stories about superheroes, who he thought needed to ensure they were \"using established characters to touch on other topics\u2014mental illness, parenthood, race, trauma\u2014instead of simply rehashing old plots.\"<ref name=\"VoxReply\" />\n\n==== Fight scene criticisms ====\nFeinberg, in his review, criticized the fight sequences in the season, calling them \"weakly staged and all-too-brief, without any effort to even pretend that the show's leading man is doing any of his own stunts\" and felt \"Danny's strength and his enhanced abilities are barely explained and inconsistently depicted.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> Sepinwall described the fighting in the season as \"both brief and unconvincing\", criticizing Jones' ability to perform the fights as well as the way they were filmed and edited.<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> One fight sequence, featuring 56 cuts for just 35 seconds of footage, was highlighted by some fans and critics as emblematic of the season's fight problems, with ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Christopher Hooton saying the editing created this \"disorientating, messy and ultimately not particularly impactful sequence\". He compared it to what he believed to be the superior work of Jackie Chan, citing a single take fight scene featuring that performer, as well as the fight scenes from ''Daredevil'' which \"had great success with a more considered shot selection and more minimal cutting than ''Iron Fist''\".<ref name=\"56Cuts\" />\n\nAloysius Low at [[CNET]] also compared Jones's fighting in the season to that of Chan as well as Jet Li, saying, \"There's none of that elegance I expect from a kung fu master, and he gets hit way too easily for a trained expert.\" Low also criticized the fact that Jones was unable to fight with both of his fists in the season, while noting that what he believed to be the best fight of the season was when Jones was faced with the drunken fist technique and was losing because of it with Rand only winning that fight due to \"the inevitable invincibility of [his] plot armor\".<ref name=\"cnetFights\" /> Brook H. at Pop Culture Uncovered felt that many of the season's fight scene issues stemmed from a decision to model ''Iron Fist'' on the American action films of the 1980s and 1990s, rather than updating the style of 1970s Hong Kong films: the season has \"no fluidity, variety, interesting styles, or back-and-forth between combatants. These fights were an American interpretation of martial arts, using the visage of kung fu to mask nothing more than straightforward brawling.\" Brook H.'s piece noted that Chan had extensive experience working as a stunt coordinator, but limited time working as a fight choreographer before joining the series, while a professional fight choreographer discussing the season felt the choreography was not the problem as \"I can see where the choreographers were going\" but the actors, particularly Jones, were just not skilled enough to deliver on them. The quick cut editing was also criticized, again, as well as attempts to \"slow-down [[The Wachowskis|Wachowski]]-style, only to speed right back up\" which \"failed miserably\".<ref name=\"PCUFights\" />\n\n=== Casting controversy ===\n{{See also|White savior#Appearance in television}}\n\nFollowing the announcement of the series, Russ Burlingame noted for ComicBook.com that Marvel may have been tempted to change Danny Rand from white to a person of Asian descent, especially given that the other Marvel Netflix series ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' already set a precedent of increasing diversity by exploring a female and African-America lead, respectively. However, Burlingame was against this happening, wanting to see \"the classic\" version of the character, and feeling that making the character Asian simply because he is a martial artist was itself \"quietly, subtlely racist\".<ref name=\"CastingCB\" /> This situation, of casting either a white or Asian-American actor in the role, was described as \"lose/lose\" by Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death,<ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" /> while Albert Ching at [[Comic Book Resources]] was strictly against casting an Asian-American. He said that any extra Asian-American representation onscreen would be positive, but that he was not comfortable with the idea of the first major Asian superhero in film or television being a martial artist. Ching questioned why this discussion had not been raised with any other character, and suggested that a non-white, non-Asian actor be cast instead to avoid either issues. He highlighted the casting of [[Chloe Bennet]] and [[Ming-Na Wen]] in the MCU series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', both in \"non-stereotypical roles\", as examples of what roles he would rather have Asian-Americans be cast in.<ref name=\"CastingCBR\" />\n\nIn response to this, Keith Chow at The Nerds of Color specifically asked Marvel to cast an Asian-American in the role. Chow focused on the lack of Asian-American representation in mainstream television and films, the fact that the character's story would not have to change to accommodate this difference, and how it would stop elements of the \"white savior\" trope being depicted where a \"white-guy-is-better-at-being-Asian-than-the-Asians\".<ref name=\"CastingNoC\" /> Chow did not feel it was equivalent to simply add a different Asian hero to the series such as [[Shang-Chi]] as there is a difference between the experience of an Asian character and an Asian-American, with the latter still being able to have a \"fish out of water\" storyline as Rand does in the comics. Chow disagreed that it was racist to have an Asian-American martial artist, as martial arts are a natural part of an Asian-American's heritage and would not be the only thing the character does;<ref name=\"CastingCA\" /> he gave the example of [[Daniel Wu]] in ''[[Into the Badlands (TV series)|Into the Badlands]]'', the only other Asian American lead of a mainstream martial arts series, who agreed to star in that series despite the perceived stereotypes because of the characterization beyond fighting, and because his \"culture did create kung fu, so is that a stereotype? No it's part of [my] history\". Chow started the hashtag #AAIronFist on [[Twitter]], beginning a movement that received support from \"high profile people\" such as [[Lexi Alexander]] and [[Gail Simone]].<ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" />\n\nMarvel and Netflix became aware of the movement to cast an Asian-American as Danny Rand,<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /><ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" /> particularly after Chow began writing on the subject in March 2014,<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /><ref name=\"CastingNoC\" /> and considered several Asian-American actors for the role.<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /> This included [[Lewis Tan]], who went on to guest star as the villain [[Zhou Cheng]] in the season.<ref name=\"Tan\" /> However, by the time Buck was announced as showrunner in December 2015, the studios were \"leaning toward keeping Iron Fist white.\"<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /> Jones, who is white, was cast in February 2016.<ref name=\"FinnJones\" />\n\nFollowing the casting, [[io9]]'s Rob Bricken spoke out against commentators who accepted Jones's casting because Marvel had been in a \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\" situation, feeling this was not true because the benefits that could have come from casting an Asian-American actor\u2014including having the character \"{{em|reclaim}} his Asian heritage, instead of taking it from others\"\u2014outweighed just copying the stereotypes from the comics.<ref name=\"Castingio9\" /> His colleague Katharine Trendecosta later added, after watching the completed season, that an Asian-American Danny Rand would have been more interesting than the final version, especially in being able to explore how he felt about returning to America having become more of a stereotype, and feeling out of place in K'un Lun due to being American while feeling out of place among the high-society circles of America due to being Asian.<ref name=\"Castingio92\" /> In response to these criticisms, Jones agreed that \"there needs to be more diversity in film and television\" but was confused why ''Iron Fist'' in particular had been targeted by internet commentators and said that they should get angry at \"real problems in the world\" instead.<ref name=\"JonesVulture\" /> After the irony of him championing diversity through his Twitter account was raised with Jones in March 2017, he added that the producers chose to lean in to the problematic aspects of the character and surround him with \"one of the most diverse\" casts of the Marvel Netflix series to create a \"socially progressive story\" without alienating the comic fan base. Jones subsequently took down his Twitter account.<ref name=\"JonesTwitter\" />\n\nIn response to specific criticisms that Rand is a \"white savior\", Buck said that he had approached the character without knowing of the racial issues surrounding him and his comic history, and that \"I can say most definitively Danny Rand is no white saviour. He's trying to save himself, if anything.\"<ref name=\"BuckGoss360\" /> Jones agreed, saying, \"Danny Rand is not a white savior. Danny Rand can hardly save himself, let alone an entire race of people. He is a very complicated, vulnerable individual.\" Jones felt that changing K'un Lun to be a multi-cultural place for the series aided in lessening the white savior narrative, while stating, \"It's up to the writers to address thematic and narrative choices. And it's up to us as actors to try and breathe life into these characters as truthfully and as honestly and with [as much] genuine passion as possible.\"<ref name=\"JonesBuzzFeed\" /> [[Roy Thomas]], co-creator of the character, also defended the season following accusations of cultural appropriation, saying that the character was created for a less \"PC\" time and that K'un Lun was always meant to be a mythical place rather than a prepresentation of Asia. Thomas added that he would not be bothered if the character had been changed to Asian-American, but was not \"ashamed\" that Rand remained white.<ref name=\"RoyThomas\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\nThe season was nominated for Best New Media Superhero Series at the [[44th Saturn Awards]],<ref name=\"SaturnsNom\" /> but lost to Marvel's own ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]''.<ref

Filming took place in New York City from April to October 2016, with a focus placed on exploring the \"[[American upper class|One Percent of the One Percent]]\" through story, location, and costume design. The character's martial arts background is also explored, and each episode is named after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences. As the last of several Marvel Netflix seasons to release before the crossover miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', it features set-up for that event and references to those prior seasons.\n\nThe season premiered on March 15, 2017, in New York City, with the full season of 13 episodes released on Netflix on March 17. It received generally negative reviews from critics, particularly for its pace and storytelling, and Jones's performance. The appropriateness of his casting and storyline in terms of race was also widely discussed, while the season's fight sequences were criticized as an important element that were poorly acted, choreographed, and edited. Conversely, Henwick's performance and the use of established characters [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] and [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]] did receive some praise. Third-party data analytics determined the series had strong initial viewership, but this dropped within a week. The series was renewed for a [[Iron Fist (season 2)|second season]] in July 2017.<ref name=\"IFS2\" />\n\n== Episodes ==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#6A543F |overall=5 |season=5 |title=24 |titleR={{efn|name=Titles|Each episode is named after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"NYCC2016IGNLoebBuck\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2016/10/09/iron-fist-will-bring-a-lighter-tone-to-the-marvel-netflix-series-nycc-2016|title=Iron Fist Will Bring a Lighter Tone to the Marvel / Netflix Series \u2013 NYCC 2016|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 8, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ShaolinKungFuEpTitles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/01/23/iron-fist-episode-titles-inspired-by-shaolin-kung-fu-moves/|title=Iron Fist Episode Titles Inspired By Shaolin Kung Fu Moves|last=Golder|first=Dave|publisher=Mym Buzz|date=January 23, 2017|accessdate=July 29, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928042127/http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/01/23/iron-fist-episode-titles-inspired-by-shaolin-kung-fu-moves/|archivedate=September 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>}} |director=15 |writer=36 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-iron-fist/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's iron fist on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Snow Gives Way\n |DirectedBy = [[John Dahl]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Scott Buck]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|3|17}}\n |ShortSummary = After being presumed dead for 15 years, when his family were the victims of a plane crash in the Himalayas, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]] returns to New York City and goes to Rand Enterprises to meet with [[Harold Meachum]], the partner of Danny's now dead father Wendell. Danny is turned away by security, but uses martial arts to fight his way to Harold's children [[Ward Meachum|Ward]] and [[Joy Meachum|Joy]]. The Meachums reveal that Harold has been dead for years, and do not believe that Danny is who he says he is. Danny is also turned down by [[Colleen Wing]], who he wishes to work for at her newly opened dojo. The Meachums believe that \"Danny's\" appearance is a ploy by their rivals to create a leadership struggle ahead of their planned expansion to China, and Ward hires mercenaries to attack Danny. Wing witnesses him overpower them. Ward meets with Harold, who had faked his death and considers the possibility that Danny survived the plane crash.

Harold secretly visits Danny and learns that Danny has become the Iron Fist and sworn enemy of [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]]. Danny is able to convince Joy of his identity, but Ward is not convinced. Danny explains to Edmonds that following the plane crash, he was saved by two monks and taken to [[K'un-Lun]], another dimension that is connected to the [[Earth]] periodically. It was there that he trained in martial arts and gained the power of the Iron Fist. Edmonds is not convinced, and diagnoses Danny as suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Harold asks Ward to move Danny to a safe place where he can be useful, but Ward instead orders his men, disguised as patients at the hospital, to kill Danny.

He also visits Joy again and she offers him money to change his identity and leave. Danny refuses, and meets with his family's lawyer [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]] who promises to reclaim his identity in exchange for a permanent contract between her firm and Rand Enterprises. After attacking an impolite student at Wing's dojo, Danny is forced to stay elsewhere and is gifted the use of an apartment by Hogarth. The lawyer uses fingerprint evidence to prove Danny's identity to Joy and Ward, and promises to present it in court if they stop Danny from retaking his family's company.

Harold asks Danny to destroy the Hand in order to free him, and orders Ward to accept Danny's return to the company where his return is announced in a press conference. In a board meeting, Danny uses his position as the majority shareholder to enforce his decision to cheaply sell a newly developed drug in order to save more lives. At his apartment, Joy is attacked and wounded by [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] operatives, whom Danny overpowers. He takes her to Wing's dojo before confronting the Triad leader, Yang Hai-Qing, who holds a grudge against Joy for taking the pier. However, he stands down when Danny reveals the involvement of the Hand. As a reward for securing the pier, the Hand allows Harold to remotely observe Joy.

After a chemical factory owned by Rand Enterprises is linked to cancer, Danny personally apologizes to an aggrieved citizen and is recorded by a lawyer who distributes it to the media. In a board meeting that Danny is absent from, Ward convinces the shareholders to stand against the accusations instead of accepting responsibility. However, the anxiety of always being watched by Harold causes Ward to try the new heroin. Danny convinces Wing to help him infiltrate the pier, where they find containers apparently loaded with normal supplies. Inside one he discovers Radovan, the chemist who was forced to create the heroin as the Hand held his daughter hostage. Danny fights off a guard to free Radovan, but the latter is stabbed by the guard.

Buck said that much of the season was \"about a journey of finding self ... in terms of what he wants to be as far as 'Who is Danny Rand? What is the Iron Fist?\u2019 and then, 'How do these things get together?'\"<ref name=\"NYCC2016Collider\" /> Loeb described the structure of the season as building \"through a series of sort of metaphorical fights, which is very important in a martial arts film, to sort of show how the character needs to grow from the innocent, wide-eyed person to someone who has to come to terms with \u2018this is the way the outside world works\u2014how am I going to make it work for me?\u2019\".<ref name=\"HogarthInvolved\" />\n\nContinuing on the idea from the previous Marvel Netflix series that New York City is a \"fifth Defender\", Loeb said the season would examine the high-end financial world of New York City, examining \"[[American upper class|the One Percent of the One Percent]] and how that affects our world on a day-to-day basis... high-level corporation, [[Pharmaceutical industry|Big Pharma]], things like that\".<ref name=\"LoebBuckCBR\" /> Actor [[Finn Jones]] added the season examined \"corporate corruption and corporate responsibility in the modern world, and... how much do corporations have impact on society? And what we actually look at in the show is the heroin epidemic of the city, and how corporations maybe actually fund the heroin epidemic, and what that means to society\".<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\" /> In terms of Rand donning a comic-based costume in the season, Buck stated, \"There was no good reason we could imagine to put Danny Rand in a costume. Because Danny Rand is still discovering who he is as a hero and where he is going to be, so he's not yet ready to put on a mask or a costume. [A]t the same time he is someone who is rather well known as a billionaire, so he can't necessarily go out in public and do the things he does without being recognized.

Smart as Shirley Benson.<ref name=\"Smart\" />\n\n=== Design ===\nStephanie Maslansky is the costume designer for ''Iron Fist'', after serving the same role for the previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> Maslansky noted one of the differences with the season compared to the other Marvel Netflix series, was the neighborhoods it spent time in (\"the wealthier neighborhoods; [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Upper East Side]], that sort of thing\") compared to [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] for ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'' and [[Harlem]] for ''Luke Cage''. As such, Rand wears more suits than the other heroes, and given the amount of fighting he does in the season, a lot of spandex was added to increase the suits' flexibility.<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg1\" /> Rand's look evolves throughout the season, with Maslansky noting, \"When we first meet him he's clearly traveled a long way. I wanted people to look at Danny and not be sure exactly what he was. A backpacker, or a homeless man. His look needed to reflect a variety of culture [and almost feel] otherworldly.\" Once Rand enters the corporate world, he settles on an \"Urban Cali\" style, which is \"a little looser, little more relaxed. But it's still a suit. His tie is never tied tightly and he always wears sneakers.\" This relaxed style for Rand also provided \"a strong contrast\" to Ward Meachum who is a \"far more corporate looking person.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg2\" /> The monk costumes and Rand's warrior costume was based on \"real [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] warrior monk costumes... I took that distinctive silhouette from the Shaolin warrior monk clothing, and we combined it with the traditional colors of the Iron Fist, green and gold.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg3\" /> Regarding Gao, Maslansky stated \"Her particular look is influenced by ancient China,\" particularly the [[Terracotta Army]] and further progresses the \"villainy\" look of the Marvel Netflix series of \"surround[ing] themselves with [money], with beautiful things.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg2\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Bayonne Bridge from Nicholas Av overpass jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Bayonne Bridge]] doubled as Anzhou, China during production]]\nMarvel announced in February 2014 that the series would be filmed in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> with Quesada stating in April that the show would be filming on location in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Photography began in April 2016 in New York City,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"FilmingStart2\" /> with the [[working title]] ''Kick''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /><ref name=\"JonesEWJan2017\" /> Manuel Billeter served as director of photography after doing the same for the first seasons of ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\nFilming locations included [[Mariners Harbor, Staten Island|Mariners Harbor]] and [[Sailors' Snug Harbor]] on [[Staten Island]],<ref name=\"SIFilming\" /><ref name=\"SIFilming2\" /> which served as Bakuto's compound; [[28 Liberty Street]] for the exterior of Rand Enterprises, while some interiors were filmed in the [[MetLife Building]]; [[19 Gramercy Park South]] for Joy Meachum's home; [[City Hall Park]]; [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], including [[Mott Street]]; the lobby of the [[General Electric Building]] for Harold Meachum's penthouse; the [[Manhattan Bridge]]; [[Green-Wood Cemetery]]; [[Bank of America Tower (Manhattan)|Bank of America Tower]]; [[Bryant Park]]; the Presidential Suite in the [[InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel]], serving as Rand's temporary apartment; the STK Midtown restaurant; [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Pelham Bay Park]]; the [[Bayonne Bridge]], which doubled as Anzhou, China; and [[York Avenue / Sutton Place|Sutton Place]] Park.<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Filming [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 8, 2016.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\n''Iron Fist'' was filmed in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (HDR), which Billeter stated added \"a learning curve\" to his work, forcing him to rethink how he would shoot certain scenes, such as a car lights or street lights, which become much brighter in HDR than previously. To compensate, lights would be painted on set to help \"bring down the highlights\". Post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]] worked on the season to adjust colors the filming team did not have the chance to tweak on set.<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n==== Fight training and choreography ====\nBrett Chan was the stunt-coordinator, fight choreographer, and second unit director for the season, having \"full involvement in all the episodes\". Buck wanted the fighting in the series to be mostly [[Wing Chun]] but with the [[Five Animals|animal styles]] of kung fu as well, and Chan worked alongside Buck and other Marvel executives during development of the fights. As a second unit director, the amount of creative input that Chan had depended on the episodic director he was working with. Chan was influenced by the works of the [[Shaw Brothers]], [[Jackie Chan]], [[Stephen Chow]], [[Bruce Lee]], and [[Yuen Woo Ping]], but avoided being \"floaty or wire-like\" per a request from Marvel; wire work and CGI were used minimally for fights.<ref name=\"ChanCV\" />\n\nChan worked closely with Jones during early preparation for the season, but during filming spent most of his time either choreographing sequences or working on-set.<ref name=\"ChanCV\" /> Chan noted that Jones had a very busy schedule, and it was difficult to find the time to train him in martial arts which Chan felt was \"a lifestyle\" and \"isn't something you can just pick up, or train for every once in a while. It's something you need to be really involved in\". He did note that Henwick trained for six hours every day regardless if she was scheduled to train that day or if she was filming.<ref name=\"ChanScroll\" /> Jones elaborated that he had three weeks before filming began to train for the season,<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" /> during which time he would spend two and a half hours a day training in martial arts before doing weight training in the afternoons.<ref name=\"JonesTrainingEW\" /> Once filming began, Jones had a day and a half during weekends in which he could continue his training, and otherwise would have to learn fight choreography 15 minutes before filming an action sequence. He described this process as \"a baptism of fire and I just learned on the job\".<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nThe executive producers wanted the score to feel modern, and composer [[Trevor Morris (musician)|Trevor Morris]] agreed not to use an orchestra. He did try some instruments to represent the Asian influence on the series, but these were deemed \"too traditional\" by the producers. Only some \"heavily affected\" Japanese flutes were ultimately used.<ref name=\"MorrisAD\" /> Morris also looked to avoid using themes for different characters in a traditional way. He did write a theme for Rand, which is heard in the series' title sequence, as well as a theme for [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]], but in general focused on environmental music.<ref name=\"MorrisMR\" /> Additional music heard in the season includes \"[[So Fresh, So Clean]]\" by [[Outkast]], \"[[Uptown Saturday Night (album)|Krystal Karrington]]\" by [[Camp Lo]], \"[[Priesthood (album)|Heat of the Moment]]\" by [[Killah Priest]], \"[[Black Mags]]\" by [[The Cool Kids]], \"[[Summertime '06|Hang N' Bang]]\" by [[Vince Staples]], \"[[Run the Jewels 2|Blockbuster Night, Pt. 1]]\" by [[Run the Jewels]],<ref name=\"AdditionalMusic\" /> and music from [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref name=\"NYCC2016Footage\" />\n\nA soundtrack album featuring Morris's score was released by Marvel digitally on March 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of the season.

There does have to be a lot of cooperation between all the different [series' showrunners]. But other than that, we work distinctly by ourselves.\"<ref name=\"BuckGoss360\" /> The season makes references to the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', the [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]], [[Stark Industries]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], and Seagate Prison,<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /> and mentions the Dogs of Hell biker gang, ''New York Bulletin'' editor-in-chief Mitchell Ellison and reporter [[Karen Page]],<ref name=\"ScreenRantEasterEggs\" /> [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] and Midland Circle.<ref name=\"GamesRadarEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"MTVEasterEggs\" /> The events of the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''Daredevil'', such as the Hand's attack on Metro General Hospital, are noted throughout the season,<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /> and the Hand's blood draining facility from that season is also seen.<ref name=\"MTVEasterEggs\" />\n\n== Release ==\nThe first season of ''Iron Fist'' was released on March 17, 2017, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix worldwide,<ref name=\"Release\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and HDR.<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /><ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n=== Marketing ===\nIn October 2016, Buck and the season's main cast promoted the season at [[New York Comic-Con]], debuting exclusive footage from the season and the first look at the first trailer.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> In early February 2017, the official trailer for the season was released.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailer\" /> David Betancourt, reacting to the trailer for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', compared the story it presents to that of ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), and questioned the fact that Iron Fist's comic costume was not shown.<ref name=\"WashPoTrailer\" /> Eric Francisco at [[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] noted that the trailer was widely criticized on [[Twitter]] for the season's depiction of Rand as an \"insufferable college hippie\".<ref name=\"InverseTrailer\" /> On March 15, 2017, the season held its premiere at the [[Tribeca Performing Arts Center]] in New York City.<ref name=\"Premiere\" /><ref name=\"PremiereLocation\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Audience viewership ===\nNetflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for their series, but Parrot Analytics determined that the season generated over 63 million \"Demand Expressions\" at its peak, behind only ''Luke Cage''{{'}}s 69&nbsp;million in terms of all the Marvel Netflix series, with Parrot calculating expressions \"by evaluating streaming video, P2P-sharing, social chatter, and more.\"<ref name=\"ParrotDemand\" /> 7Park Data, which measures the number of streams on subscription video services, determined ''Iron Fist'' to be the most binge-watched premiere for Netflix in 2017 with 54.7% of ''Iron Fist'' streams on March 17, 2017 being of three episodes or more. The average score was 46.9%. 7Park Data also determined that ''Iron Fist'' accounted for 14.6% of all Netflix streams on its premiere date, the highest percentage of any series premiere measured by the company including previous Marvel Netflix premieres.<ref name=\"7ParkData\" />\n\nParrot later revealed that demand for ''Iron Fist'' a week after it launched was halved. This was the largest drop in retention for a Marvel Netflix series, indicating \"that people started binge-watching the show in its first few days and then didn't come back to finish the season the next weekend.\"<ref name=\"ParrotDemandDropOff\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the third-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 28% of the viewers that the second season of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the firm believed was the most viewed season. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100&nbsp;million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{multiple image|align=right|footer=Series' lead Finn Jones (L) was criticized for his performance, but Jessica Henwick (R) was widely praised for hers.|image1=Finn Jones by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width1=171|image2=Jessica Henwick by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width2=179}}\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 20% approval rating with an average rating of 4.24/10 based on 83 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Despite some promising moments, ''Iron Fist'' is weighed down by an absence of momentum and originality.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv//marvel_s_iron_fist/s01 |title=Marvel's Iron Fist: Season 1 (2017)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 37 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-iron-fist |title=''Marvel's Iron Fist'': Season 1 |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the first six episodes of the season, Daniel Fienberg of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' found ''Iron Fist'' to be the \"first big misstep\" for Marvel and Netflix, lacking the \"street-level authenticity\" that their previous series had. Fienberg felt Jones was unable to elevate the material, instead coming across as \"a spoiled frat boy\". He said the season lacked basic character archetypes such as \"a worthy adversary to our hero\", comic relief, or a \"voice of wise authority\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan gave a negative review for the first two episodes, calling them \"ferociously boring\" and \"inessential\". After criticizing the pacing, action, general characterization, production design, cinematography, and dialogue, Ryan suggested that Henwick should have been the star of the season instead of Jones.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n\nRob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized Jones' performance, calling him \"totally devoid of charisma, more cub than lone wolf.\" He also felt the character was missing humor and inner turmoil, and said Rand's \"mystic Zen quotes go over like a ''[[Wayne's World]]'' set-up minus the punch line.\"<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\" /> Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] awarded the season 3 stars out of 5 after seeing the first six episodes. She said the season had a good cast and great origin story, but had a \"glacial pace\" and choppy editing. She did find Jones charming, but agreed with Fienberg that the season was lacking a villain, and felt that Temple was \"shoe-horned\" into the season.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> In his review for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, \"''Iron Fist'' needed to be so much weirder than it actually is, akin to how ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016) essentially re-told the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. ''Iron Fist'' starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when the vast majority of the principal characters [are so] underdeveloped.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" /> Fitzpatrick felt that Colleen Wing was the better of the supporting characters, and praised Henwick's performance.<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" />\n\n[[Uproxx]]'s [[Alan Sepinwall]] felt of the first six episodes, \"It's easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows\", criticizing the pacing and \"miscasting\" of Jones. He was more positive about Moss and Dawson's roles. Sepinwall concluded, \"the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They\u2019re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny had to be [in ''The Defenders'', and as a result,] we got a show that's so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season\".<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> Dan Jolin also gave 3 stars out of 5 in his review for ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''. He felt it was beneficial that ''Iron Fist'' released after ''Doctor Strange'' introduced the MCU to \"all his Eastern-mystical baggage\", and called Iron Fist \"a fresh presence\" compared to \"moody, conflicted heroism\" of the other Defenders. Jolin did criticize that Buck had \"no sense of connection to his subject\" as previous Marvel Netflix showrunners had, and felt it was not until the sixth episode \"that you really feel the pulp martial-arts-movie-riffing origins\" thanks to episodic director RZA who \"finally gives the show a proper sense of flair ... It's enough to make you wish they made him the showrunner.\" Jolin concluded, \"''Iron Fist'' works some fantastical flavor into the MCU's down-to-earth Defenders nook, but it needs more proper kung-fu flair than showrunner Buck allows.\"<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" />\n\nResponding to these reviews, Jones said that \"these shows are not made for critics, they are first and foremost made for the fans ... when the fans of the Marvel Netflix world and fans of the comic books view the show through the lens of just wanting to enjoy a superhero show, then they will really enjoy what they see.\"<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" /> Jones later attributed the negative reviews to the fact that his character, \"a white American billionaire\", was similar to [[Donald Trump]] who had become \"public enemy number one, especially in the US\" between the making of the season and its release.<ref name=\"JonesTrump\" /> In an article for [[Vox (website)|Vox]], Alex Abad-Santos said Jones was just attempting to \"pass the blame\" away from himself when the real problem with the season was \"no one thought about what makes the character human\". Abad-Santos suggested that the season be a warning to others telling stories about superheroes, who he thought needed to ensure they were \"using established characters to touch on other topics\u2014mental illness, parenthood, race, trauma\u2014instead of simply rehashing old plots.\"<ref name=\"VoxReply\" />\n\n==== Fight scene criticisms ====\nFeinberg, in his review, criticized the fight sequences in the season, calling them \"weakly staged and all-too-brief, without any effort to even pretend that the show's leading man is doing any of his own stunts\" and felt \"Danny's strength and his enhanced abilities are barely explained and inconsistently depicted.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> Sepinwall described the fighting in the season as \"both brief and unconvincing\", criticizing Jones' ability to perform the fights as well as the way they were filmed and edited.<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> One fight sequence, featuring 56 cuts for just 35 seconds of footage, was highlighted by some fans and critics as emblematic of the season's fight problems, with ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Christopher Hooton saying the editing created this \"disorientating, messy and ultimately not particularly impactful sequence\". He compared it to what he believed to be the superior work of Jackie Chan, citing a single take fight scene featuring that performer, as well as the fight scenes from ''Daredevil'' which \"had great success with a more considered shot selection and more minimal cutting than ''Iron Fist''\".<ref name=\"56Cuts\" />\n\nAloysius Low at [[CNET]] also compared Jones's fighting in the season to that of Chan as well as Jet Li, saying, \"There's none of that elegance I expect from a kung fu master, and he gets hit way too easily for a trained expert.\" Low also criticized the fact that Jones was unable to fight with both of his fists in the season, while noting that what he believed to be the best fight of the season was when Jones was faced with the drunken fist technique and was losing because of it with Rand only winning that fight due to \"the inevitable invincibility of [his] plot armor\".<ref name=\"cnetFights\" /> Brook H. at Pop Culture Uncovered felt that many of the season's fight scene issues stemmed from a decision to model ''Iron Fist'' on the American action films of the 1980s and 1990s, rather than updating the style of 1970s Hong Kong films: the season has \"no fluidity, variety, interesting styles, or back-and-forth between combatants. These fights were an American interpretation of martial arts, using the visage of kung fu to mask nothing more than straightforward brawling.\" Brook H.'s piece noted that Chan had extensive experience working as a stunt coordinator, but limited time working as a fight choreographer before joining the series, while a professional fight choreographer discussing the season felt the choreography was not the problem as \"I can see where the choreographers were going\" but the actors, particularly Jones, were just not skilled enough to deliver on them. The quick cut editing was also criticized, again, as well as attempts to \"slow-down [[The Wachowskis|Wachowski]]-style, only to speed right back up\" which \"failed miserably\".<ref name=\"PCUFights\" />\n\n=== Casting controversy ===\n{{See also|White savior#Appearance in television}}\n\nFollowing the announcement of the series, Russ Burlingame noted for ComicBook.com that Marvel may have been tempted to change Danny Rand from white to a person of Asian descent, especially given that the other Marvel Netflix series ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' already set a precedent of increasing diversity by exploring a female and African-America lead, respectively. However, Burlingame was against this happening, wanting to see \"the classic\" version of the character, and feeling that making the character Asian simply because he is a martial artist was itself \"quietly, subtlely racist\".<ref name=\"CastingCB\" /> This situation, of casting either a white or Asian-American actor in the role, was described as \"lose/lose\" by Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death,<ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" /> while Albert Ching at [[Comic Book Resources]] was strictly against casting an Asian-American. He said that any extra Asian-American representation onscreen would be positive, but that he was not comfortable with the idea of the first major Asian superhero in film or television being a martial artist. Ching questioned why this discussion had not been raised with any other character, and suggested that a non-white, non-Asian actor be cast instead to avoid either issues. He highlighted the casting of [[Chloe Bennet]] and [[Ming-Na Wen]] in the MCU series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', both in \"non-stereotypical roles\", as examples of what roles he would rather have Asian-Americans be cast in.<ref name=\"CastingCBR\" />\n\nIn response to this, Keith Chow at The Nerds of Color specifically asked Marvel to cast an Asian-American in the role. Chow focused on the lack of Asian-American representation in mainstream television and films, the fact that the character's story would not have to change to accommodate this difference, and how it would stop elements of the \"white savior\" trope being depicted where a \"white-guy-is-better-at-being-Asian-than-the-Asians\".<ref name=\"CastingNoC\" /> Chow did not feel it was equivalent to simply add a different Asian hero to the series such as [[Shang-Chi]] as there is a difference between the experience of an Asian character and an Asian-American, with the latter still being able to have a \"fish out of water\" storyline as Rand does in the comics. Chow disagreed that it was racist to have an Asian-American martial artist, as martial arts are a natural part of an Asian-American's heritage and would not be the only thing the character does;<ref name=\"CastingCA\" /> he gave the example of [[Daniel Wu]] in ''[[Into the Badlands (TV series)|Into the Badlands]]'', the only other Asian American lead of a mainstream martial arts series, who agreed to star in that series despite the perceived stereotypes because of the characterization beyond fighting, and because his \"culture did create kung fu, so is that a stereotype? No it's part of [my] history\". Chow started the hashtag #AAIronFist on [[Twitter]], beginning a movement that received support from \"high profile people\" such as [[Lexi Alexander]] and [[Gail Simone]].<ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" />\n\nMarvel and Netflix became aware of the movement to cast an Asian-American as Danny Rand,<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /><ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" /> particularly after Chow began writing on the subject in March 2014,<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /><ref name=\"CastingNoC\" /> and considered several Asian-American actors for the role.<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /> This included [[Lewis Tan]], who went on to guest star as the villain [[Zhou Cheng]] in the season.<ref name=\"Tan\" /> However, by the time Buck was announced as showrunner in December 2015, the studios were \"leaning toward keeping Iron Fist white.\"<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /> Jones, who is white, was cast in February 2016.<ref name=\"FinnJones\" />\n\nFollowing the casting, [[io9]]'s Rob Bricken spoke out against commentators who accepted Jones's casting because Marvel had been in a \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\" situation, feeling this was not true because the benefits that could have come from casting an Asian-American actor\u2014including having the character \"{{em|reclaim}} his Asian heritage, instead of taking it from others\"\u2014outweighed just copying the stereotypes from the comics.<ref name=\"Castingio9\" /> His colleague Katharine Trendecosta later added, after watching the completed season, that an Asian-American Danny Rand would have been more interesting than the final version, especially in being able to explore how he felt about returning to America having become more of a stereotype, and feeling out of place in K'un Lun due to being American while feeling out of place among the high-society circles of America due to being Asian.<ref name=\"Castingio92\" /> In response to these criticisms, Jones agreed that \"there needs to be more diversity in film and television\" but was confused why ''Iron Fist'' in particular had been targeted by internet commentators and said that they should get angry at \"real problems in the world\" instead.<ref name=\"JonesVulture\" /> After the irony of him championing diversity through his Twitter account was raised with Jones in March 2017, he added that the producers chose to lean in to the problematic aspects of the character and surround him with \"one of the most diverse\" casts of the Marvel Netflix series to create a \"socially progressive story\" without alienating the comic fan base. Jones subsequently took down his Twitter account.<ref name=\"JonesTwitter\" />\n\nIn response to specific criticisms that Rand is a \"white savior\", Buck said that he had approached the character without knowing of the racial issues surrounding him and his comic history, and that \"I can say most definitively Danny Rand is no white saviour. He's trying to save himself, if anything.\"<ref name=\"BuckGoss360\" /> Jones agreed, saying, \"Danny Rand is not a white savior. Danny Rand can hardly save himself, let alone an entire race of people. He is a very complicated, vulnerable individual.\" Jones felt that changing K'un Lun to be a multi-cultural place for the series aided in lessening the white savior narrative, while stating, \"It's up to the writers to address thematic and narrative choices. And it's up to us as actors to try and breathe life into these characters as truthfully and as honestly and with [as much] genuine passion as possible.\"<ref name=\"JonesBuzzFeed\" /> [[Roy Thomas]], co-creator of the character, also defended the season following accusations of cultural appropriation, saying that the character was created for a less \"PC\" time and that K'un Lun was always meant to be a mythical place rather than a prepresentation of Asia. Thomas added that he would not be bothered if the character had been changed to Asian-American, but was not \"ashamed\" that Rand remained white.<ref name=\"RoyThomas\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\nThe

Supported games use [[computer vision]] and [[gesture recognition]] to process images taken by the EyeToy. This allows players to interact with the games using [[Game controller#Motion sensing|motion]], color detection, and also sound, through its built-in [[microphone]]. It was released in October 2003.\n\nThe camera is manufactured by [[Logitech]] (known as \"Logicool\" in Japan), although newer EyeToys are manufactured by Namtai. The camera is mainly used for playing EyeToy games developed by Sony and other companies. It is not intended for use as a normal [[Personal computer|PC]] camera, although some programmers have written unofficial [[Device driver|drivers]] for it.<ref name=\"drivers\">{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/eocp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615084321/http://sourceforge.net/projects/eocp |title=Eyetoy On Computer Project |archivedate=15 June 2009 |website=[[SourceForge]]}}</ref> The EyeToy is compatible with the [[PlayStation 3]] and can be used for [[Videotelephony|video chatting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/ps3/network/friends |title=PlayStation.com - PLAYSTATION\u00ae3 - Network - friends |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2013-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109073458/http://www.us.playstation.com/ps3/network/friends |archivedate=November 9, 2008 }}</ref> As of November 6, 2008, the EyeToy has sold 10.5 million units worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20975|title=In-Depth: Eye To Eye - The History Of EyeToy|last=Kim|first=Tom|date=2008-11-06|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823204426/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20975|archive-date=2017-08-23|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe EyeToy was conceived by Richard Marks in 1999, after witnessing a demonstration of the PlayStation 2 at the 1999 [[Game Developers Conference]] in [[San Jose, California]].<ref name=\"NYT\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/technology/smile-gamers-you-re-in-the-picture.html|title=Smile, Gamers: You\u2019re in the Picture|last=Robischon|first=Noah|periodical=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417105324/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/technology/smile-gamers-you-re-in-the-picture.html|archive-date=2018-04-17|url-status=live|publication-date=2003-11-13|pages=G1|issn=0362-4331|oclc=1645522}}</ref> Marks's idea was to enable [[natural user interface]] and [[mixed reality]] video game applications using an inexpensive webcam, using the computational power of the PlayStation 2 to implement [[computer vision]] and [[gesture recognition]] technologies.

Soon after being promoted to Senior Vice President of Product Development at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) in 2000, Harrison brought Marks to the division's headquarters in London to demonstrate the technology to a number of developers. At the demonstration, Marks was joined with Ron Festejo of [[SCE Studio Liverpool#Psygnosis|SCE Camden Studio]]<ref name=\"Stanford\" /> (which would later merge to become [[SCE London Studio]]) to begin developing a software title using the technology, which would later become ''[[EyeToy: Play]]''. Originally called the iToy (short for \"interactive toy\") by the London branch, the webcam was later renamed to the EyeToy by Harrison. It was first demonstrated to the public at the PlayStation Experience event in August 2002 with four [[minigame]]s.<ref name=\"LAT\" />\n\nAlready planned for release in Europe, the EyeToy was picked by SCE's Japanese and American branches after the successful showing at the PlayStation Experience. In 2003, EyeToy was released in a bundle with ''EyeToy: Play'': in Europe on July 4, and North America on November 4. By the end of the year, the EyeToy sold over 2 million units in Europe and 400,000 units in the United States.<ref name=\"LAT\" /> On February 11, 2004, the EyeToy was released in Japan.\n\n==Design==\nThe camera is mounted on a pivot, allowing for positioning. Focusing the camera is performed by rotating a ring around the [[Camera lens|lens]]. It comes with two [[LED]] lights on the front. A blue light turns on when the PS2 is on, indicating that it is ready to be used, while the red light flashes when there is insufficient light in the room. There is also a microphone built in. A second, newer model of the EyeToy provides similar features, but sports a smaller size and silver casing.<ref name=\"oncomputer\">Drivers for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]] free and with support from: http://eyetoy8057.sourceforge.net/cms/  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327192750/http://eyetoy8057.sourceforge.net/cms/|date=March 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Use with personal computers==\nSince the EyeToy is essentially a [[webcam]] inside a casing designed to match the PlayStation 2 and it uses a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 1.1 protocol and USB plug, it is possible to make it work on other systems relatively easily. Drivers have been created to make it work with many computer [[operating systems]], however, [[Linux]]<ref>https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/media/usb/gspca/ov519.c</ref> is the only OS which has drivers installed yet no official drivers have been offered by Namtai, Logitech, or Sony for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]], or [[Linux]]. The type of driver required depends on the model of EyeToy camera. There are three different models:\n\n*SLEH-00030\n*SLEH-00031\n*SCEH-0004\n\nThe model information is included in a label on the bottom of the camera.\n\nIn these custom drivers, the red LED that normally signals inadequate lighting is used as the active recording indicator. The blue LED is lit when the EyeToy is plugged into the computer.\n\n==Games==\n\n===Designed for EyeToy===\n25 Games require the EyeToy for them to be played. All but the 2 Korean-exclusive ones were released in PAL Regions, while only 8 (with 2 third party) titles were released in North America.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Game title !!

Supported games use [[computer vision]] and [[gesture recognition]] to process images taken by the EyeToy. This allows players to interact with the games using [[Game controller#Motion sensing|motion]], color detection, and also sound, through its built-in [[microphone]]. It was released in October 2003.\n\nThe camera is manufactured by [[Logitech]] (known as \"Logicool\" in Japan), although newer EyeToys are manufactured by Namtai. The camera is mainly used for playing EyeToy games developed by Sony and other companies. It is not intended for use as a normal [[Personal computer|PC]] camera, although some programmers have written unofficial [[Device driver|drivers]] for it.<ref name=\"drivers\">{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/eocp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615084321/http://sourceforge.net/projects/eocp |title=Eyetoy On Computer Project |archivedate=15 June 2009 |website=[[SourceForge]]}}</ref> The EyeToy is compatible with the [[PlayStation 3]] and can be used for [[Videotelephony|video chatting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/ps3/network/friends |title=PlayStation.com - PLAYSTATION\u00ae3 - Network - friends |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2013-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109073458/http://www.us.playstation.com/ps3/network/friends |archivedate=November 9, 2008 }}</ref> As of November 6, 2008, the EyeToy has sold 10.5 million units worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20975|title=In-Depth: Eye To Eye - The History Of EyeToy|last=Kim|first=Tom|date=2008-11-06|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823204426/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20975|archive-date=2017-08-23|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe EyeToy was conceived by Richard Marks in 1999, after witnessing a demonstration of the PlayStation 2 at the 1999 [[Game Developers Conference]] in [[San Jose, California]].<ref name=\"NYT\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/technology/smile-gamers-you-re-in-the-picture.html|title=Smile, Gamers: You\u2019re in the Picture|last=Robischon|first=Noah|periodical=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417105324/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/technology/smile-gamers-you-re-in-the-picture.html|archive-date=2018-04-17|url-status=live|publication-date=2003-11-13|pages=G1|issn=0362-4331|oclc=1645522}}</ref> Marks's idea was to enable [[natural user interface]] and [[mixed reality]] video game applications using an inexpensive webcam, using the computational power of the PlayStation 2 to implement [[computer vision]] and [[gesture recognition]] technologies. He joined Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) that year, and worked on the technology as Special Projects Manager for Research and Development.<ref name=\"LAT\">{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/18/business/fi-eyetoy18|title=EyeToy Springs From One Man's Vision|last=Pham|first=Alex|periodical=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002811/http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/18/business/fi-eyetoy18|archive-date=2016-03-05|url-status=live|publication-date=2004-01-18|pages=C1|issn=0458-3035|oclc=3638237}}</ref><ref name=\"Stanford\">{{cite video|people=Richard Marks|date=2004-01-21|title=EyeToy: A New Interface for Interactive Entertainment|url=http://lang.stanford.edu/courses/ee380/2003-2004/040121-ee380-100.wmv|format=Windows Media v7|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=2009-06-20|time=08:22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415163216/http://lang.stanford.edu/courses/ee380/2003-2004/040121-ee380-100.wmv|archivedate=2011-04-15}}</ref>\n\nMarks's work drew the attention of [[Phil Harrison]], then Vice President of Third Party Relations and Research and Development at SCEA. Soon after being promoted to Senior Vice President of Product Development at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) in 2000, Harrison brought Marks to the division's headquarters in London to demonstrate the technology to a number of developers. At the demonstration, Marks was joined with Ron Festejo of [[SCE Studio Liverpool#Psygnosis|SCE Camden Studio]]<ref name=\"Stanford\" /> (which would later merge to become [[SCE London Studio]]) to begin developing a software title using the technology, which would later become ''[[EyeToy: Play]]''. Originally called the iToy (short for \"interactive toy\") by the London branch, the webcam was later renamed to the EyeToy by Harrison. It was first demonstrated to the public at the PlayStation Experience event in August 2002 with four [[minigame]]s.<ref name=\"LAT\" />\n\nAlready planned for release in Europe, the EyeToy was picked by SCE's Japanese and American branches after the successful showing at the PlayStation Experience. In 2003, EyeToy was released in a bundle with ''EyeToy: Play'': in Europe on July 4, and North America on November 4. By the end of the year, the EyeToy sold over 2 million units in Europe and 400,000 units in the United States.<ref name=\"LAT\" /> On February 11, 2004, the EyeToy was released in Japan.\n\n==Design==\nThe camera is mounted on a pivot, allowing for positioning. Focusing the camera is performed by rotating a ring around the [[Camera lens|lens]]. It comes with two [[LED]] lights on the front. A blue light turns on when the PS2 is on, indicating that it is ready to be used, while the red light flashes when there is insufficient light in the room. There is also a microphone built in. A second, newer model of the EyeToy provides similar features, but sports a smaller size and silver casing.<ref name=\"oncomputer\">Drivers for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]] free and with support from: http://eyetoy8057.sourceforge.net/cms/  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327192750/http://eyetoy8057.sourceforge.net/cms/|date=March 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Use with personal computers==\nSince the EyeToy is essentially a [[webcam]] inside a casing designed to match the PlayStation 2 and it uses a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 1.1 protocol and USB plug, it is possible to make it work on other systems relatively easily. Drivers have been created to make it work with many computer [[operating systems]], however, [[Linux]]<ref>https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/media/usb/gspca/ov519.c</ref> is the only OS which has drivers installed yet no official drivers have been offered by Namtai, Logitech, or Sony for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]], or [[Linux]]. The type of driver required depends on the model of EyeToy camera. There are three different models:\n\n*SLEH-00030\n*SLEH-00031\n*SCEH-0004\n\nThe model information is included in a label on the bottom of the camera.\n\nIn these custom drivers, the red LED that normally signals inadequate lighting is used as the active recording indicator. The blue LED is lit when the EyeToy is plugged into the computer.\n\n==Games==\n\n===Designed for EyeToy===\n25 Games require the EyeToy for them to be played. All but the 2 Korean-exclusive ones were released in PAL Regions, while only 8 (with 2 third party) titles were released in North America.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Game title !!

It was the last film to feature all six Python members before [[Graham Chapman]]'s death in 1989.\n\nUnlike ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'', the film's two predecessors, which each told a single, more-or-less coherent story,<ref name=\"guard2013\"/> ''The Meaning of Life'' returned to the sketch format of the troupe's [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|original television series]] and their first film from twelve years earlier, ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', loosely structured as a series of comic sketches about the various stages of life. It was accompanied by the [[short film]] ''[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]''.\n\nReleased on 23 June 1983 in the United Kingdom,<ref>McCall, Douglas (2013-11-12).

It also screened at the [[1983 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]]. The film appears in a 2010 list of the top 20 [[cult film]]s published by ''The Boston Globe''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/top_cult_films?pg=2 |title=Top 20 cult films, according to our readers |author=Boston.com Staff |publisher=The Boston Globe |work=boston.com |accessdate=1 February 2016 |date=27 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA group of fish in a posh restaurant's [[fish tank|tank]] swim together casually, until they look at the customers outside of the tank and see their friend Howard being eaten. This leads them to question the [[meaning of life]]. The question is explored in the first sketch, \"The Miracle of Birth\", which features a woman in labour being ignored by the doctors in favour of impressing the hospital's medically-clueless administrator. Meanwhile, in [[Yorkshire]], described as \"the third world\", a [[Catholic Church in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic]] man loses his job and returns home to tell his numerous children that he will have to sell them off for scientific experiments due to the Catholic church's [[Christian views on contraception|opposition to contraception]]; this leads to the musical number \"[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]\". A [[Protestantism in the United Kingdom|Protestant]] man with his wife looks on disapprovingly, and proudly remarks that Protestants can use contraception and have sex for pleasure (though his wife points out that they never do).  \n\nIn \"Growth and Learning\", a class of boys are taught school etiquette before partaking in a [[sex education]] lesson, which involves watching their teacher have sex with his wife. One boy laughs, and is forced into a violent [[rugby football|rugby]] match pitting pupils against the adult school masters as punishment. \"Fighting Each Other\" focuses on three scenes concerning the British military: first a [[World War I]] officer tries to rally his men during an attack, but they insist on presenting him with various going-away presents, including a card, a cake, and a clock; second, a modern army [[Regimental sergeant major|RSM]] attempts to drill his platoon, but his sarcastic remarks asking what they'd \"rather be doing\" ends with him actually dismissing them all to pursue leisure activities. Lastly, in 1879, during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], a soldier finds his leg has been bitten off. Suspecting a [[tiger]] (despite being non-native to Africa) the soldiers hunt for it and find two men suspiciously wearing two halves of a tiger costume.\n\nThe prior sequences ends abruptly with a host introducing \"The Middle of the Film\", beginning with a surreal segment called \"Find the Fish\", wherein bizarre characters ask the audience to find a hidden fish over a strange musical number. \"Middle Age\" involves a middle-aged American couple visiting a [[Cuisine of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] restaurant themed around [[Medieval]] [[torture]], where, to the interest of the fish, the waiter offers a conversation about philosophy and the meaning of life. The customers are unable to make sense of it and move on to a discussion of \"live organ transplants\". \"Live Organ Transplants\" involves two [[paramedic]]s visiting Mr. Brown, a card-carrying [[organ donor]], forcefully removing his [[liver]] while he is still alive. Mrs. Brown is initially reluctant to donate her own liver while alive, but she relents after a man steps out of a fridge and sings the \"[[Galaxy Song]]\", discussing man's insignificance in comparison to the enormousness of the universe. [[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]] pirates from the short pre-film feature appear to invade a corporate boardroom where executives are discussing the meaning of life, but a tumbling skyscraper ends their assault.\n\n\"The Autumn Years\" starts off with a musician in a French restaurant singing about the joys of having a [[penis]]. When the song is finished, the horrible and grotesquely obese [[Mr. Creosote]] visits the restaurant, much to the horror of the other guests and the fish tank. He vomits continuously and devours an enormous meal. When the [[ma\u00eetre d']] persuades him to eat one last wafer-thin mint, Creosote's stomach begins to rapidly expand until it explodes, the ma\u00eetre d' then giving him the bill. Two staff members clean up Creosote's remains while discussing the meaning of life. A third waiter leads the audience to his house, spouts some weak philosophy, and then angrily dismisses them after his point trails off.\n\n\"Death\" features a condemned man choosing the manner of his own execution: being chased off the [[Cliffs of Dover]] by topless women in sports gear and falling into his own grave below. The [[Grim Reaper]] thereupon enters an isolated country house, where the hosts and dinner guests are all clueless as to who he is until the Reaper reveals his identity and tells them they all died from food poisoning (although one guest points out she didn't even eat it). They accompany the Grim Reaper to [[Heaven]], revealed to be the Hawaiian restaurant from earlier. They enter into a [[Las Vegas]]-style hotel where it's always [[Christmas]], with all the characters from the previous sketches as guests, and where a [[Tony Bennett]]-style singer performs \"Christmas in Heaven\" to the cast.\n\nThe song is cut off abruptly for \"The End of the Film.\" An epilogue features the host of \"The Middle of the Film\" being handed an envelope containing the meaning of life. Pronouncing it \"nothing very special,\" she blandly reads it out: \"Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Main cast (the top 5) and featured cast (the 7 shown in same size font as the Pythons) is in credits order, with names as credited.

An awful lot of material didn't get used. ''Holy Grail'' had a structure, a loose one: the search for the grail. Same with ''Life of Brian''. With this, it wasn't so clear. In the end, we just said: 'Well, what the heck. We have got lots of good material, let's give it the loosest structure, which will be the meaning of life'\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nAfter the film's title was chosen, [[Douglas Adams]] called Jones to tell him he had just finished a new book, to be called ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]''; Jones was initially concerned about the similarity in titles, which led to the scene in the [[title sequence]] of a tombstone which, when hit by a flash of lightning, changes from \"The Meaning of Liff\" to \"The Meaning of Life\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\n[[File:Cartwright Hall and fountain, Bradford (22nd October 2010).jpg|thumb|right|The grounds of Cartwright Hall in [[Bradford]] ''(pictured)'' was used as a location for the dancing nurses singing \"[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]\"]]\nPrincipal photography began on 12 July 1982 and was completed about two months later, on 11 September. A wide variety of locations were used, such as [[Porchester Hall]] in [[Queensway, London|Queensway]] for the Mr Creosote sketch, where hundreds of pounds of fake vomit had to be cleaned up on the last day due to a wedding being scheduled hours later. The Malham Moors were chosen for the Grim Reaper segment; the countryside near [[Strathblane]] was used for the Zulu War; and \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" was shot in [[Colne]], [[Lancashire]] with interiors done at [[Elstree Studios]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Douglas |first1=McCall |title=Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969-2012, 2d ed. |date=2013 |publisher=McFarland |page=958}}</ref>\n\nThe film was produced on a budget of less than US$10 million, which was still bigger than that of the earlier films. This allowed for large-scale choreography and crowd sequences, a more lavishly produced soundtrack that included new original songs, and much more time able to be spent on each sketch, especially ''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''. Palin later said that the larger budget, and not making the film for the [[BBC]] (i.e., television), allowed the film to be more daring and dark.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nThe idea for the hospital sketch came from Chapman, himself a doctor,<ref name=split>{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/09/dick-cavetts-semi-serious-talk-with-graham-chapman/|title=Dick Cavett\u2019s Semi-Serious Talk with Graham Chapman|last=Ess|first=Ramsey|date=September 20, 2013|work=Splitsider|publisher=[[The Awl]]|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref> who had noticed that hospitals were changing, with \"lots and lots of machinery\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" /> According to Palin, the organ transplant scene harked back to Python's love of bureaucracy, and sketches with lots of people coming round from the council with different bits of paper.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nDuring the filming of the scene where Palin's character explains Catholicism to his children, his line was \"that rubber thing at the end of my ''sock''\", which was later overdubbed with ''cock''.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\n===''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''===\n{{main|The Crimson Permanent Assurance}}\nThe [[short film]] ''[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]'' introduces the feature. It is about a group of elderly office clerks working in a small [[accounting]] firm. They rebel against [[yuppie]] corporate masters, transform their office building into a [[pirate ship]], and raid a large financial district. One of the boardrooms raided reappears later in the film, from shortly before the attack begins until the narrator apologises and a skyscraper falls and crushes the marauders.\n\nThe short was intended as an [[animation|animated]] sequence in the feature,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=I.

This leads them to question the [[meaning of life]]. The question is explored in the first sketch, \"The Miracle of Birth\", which features a woman in labour being ignored by the doctors in favour of impressing the hospital's medically-clueless administrator. Meanwhile, in [[Yorkshire]], described as \"the third world\", a [[Catholic Church in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic]] man loses his job and returns home to tell his numerous children that he will have to sell them off for scientific experiments due to the Catholic church's [[Christian views on contraception|opposition to contraception]]; this leads to the musical number \"[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]\". A [[Protestantism in the United Kingdom|Protestant]] man with his wife looks on disapprovingly, and proudly remarks that Protestants can use contraception and have sex for pleasure (though his wife points out that they never do).  \n\nIn \"Growth and Learning\", a class of boys are taught school etiquette before partaking in a [[sex education]] lesson, which involves watching their teacher have sex with his wife. One boy laughs, and is forced into a violent [[rugby football|rugby]] match pitting pupils against the adult school masters as punishment. \"Fighting Each Other\" focuses on three scenes concerning the British military: first a [[World War I]] officer tries to rally his men during an attack, but they insist on presenting him with various going-away presents, including a card, a cake, and a clock; second, a modern army [[Regimental sergeant major|RSM]] attempts to drill his platoon, but his sarcastic remarks asking what they'd \"rather be doing\" ends with him actually dismissing them all to pursue leisure activities. Lastly, in 1879, during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], a soldier finds his leg has been bitten off. Suspecting a [[tiger]] (despite being non-native to Africa) the soldiers hunt for it and find two men suspiciously wearing two halves of a tiger costume.\n\nThe prior sequences ends abruptly with a host introducing \"The Middle of the Film\", beginning with a surreal segment called \"Find the Fish\", wherein bizarre characters ask the audience to find a hidden fish over a strange musical number. \"Middle Age\" involves a middle-aged American couple visiting a [[Cuisine of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] restaurant themed around [[Medieval]] [[torture]], where, to the interest of the fish, the waiter offers a conversation about philosophy and the meaning of life. The customers are unable to make sense of it and move on to a discussion of \"live organ transplants\". \"Live Organ Transplants\" involves two [[paramedic]]s visiting Mr. Brown, a card-carrying [[organ donor]], forcefully removing his [[liver]] while he is still alive. Mrs. Brown is initially reluctant to donate her own liver while alive, but she relents after a man steps out of a fridge and sings the \"[[Galaxy Song]]\", discussing man's insignificance in comparison to the enormousness of the universe. [[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]] pirates from the short pre-film feature appear to invade a corporate boardroom where executives are discussing the meaning of life, but a tumbling skyscraper ends their assault.\n\n\"The Autumn Years\" starts off with a musician in a French restaurant singing about the joys of having a [[penis]]. When the song is finished, the horrible and grotesquely obese [[Mr. Creosote]] visits the restaurant, much to the horror of the other guests and the fish tank. He vomits continuously and devours an enormous meal. When the [[ma\u00eetre d']] persuades him to eat one last wafer-thin mint, Creosote's stomach begins to rapidly expand until it explodes, the ma\u00eetre d' then giving him the bill. Two staff members clean up Creosote's remains while discussing the meaning of life. A third waiter leads the audience to his house, spouts some weak philosophy, and then angrily dismisses them after his point trails off.\n\n\"Death\" features a condemned man choosing the manner of his own execution: being chased off the [[Cliffs of Dover]] by topless women in sports gear and falling into his own grave below. The [[Grim Reaper]] thereupon enters an isolated country house, where the hosts and dinner guests are all clueless as to who he is until the Reaper reveals his identity and tells them they all died from food poisoning (although one guest points out she didn't even eat it). They accompany the Grim Reaper to [[Heaven]], revealed to be the Hawaiian restaurant from earlier. They enter into a [[Las Vegas]]-style hotel where it's always [[Christmas]], with all the characters from the previous sketches as guests, and where a [[Tony Bennett]]-style singer performs \"Christmas in Heaven\" to the cast.\n\nThe song is cut off abruptly for \"The End of the Film.\" An epilogue features the host of \"The Middle of the Film\" being handed an envelope containing the meaning of life. Pronouncing it \"nothing very special,\" she blandly reads it out: \"Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Main cast (the top 5) and featured cast (the 7 shown in same size font as the Pythons) is in credits order, with names as credited.

An awful lot of material didn't get used. ''Holy Grail'' had a structure, a loose one: the search for the grail. Same with ''Life of Brian''. With this, it wasn't so clear. In the end, we just said: 'Well, what the heck. We have got lots of good material, let's give it the loosest structure, which will be the meaning of life'\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nAfter the film's title was chosen, [[Douglas Adams]] called Jones to tell him he had just finished a new book, to be called ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]''; Jones was initially concerned about the similarity in titles, which led to the scene in the [[title sequence]] of a tombstone which, when hit by a flash of lightning, changes from \"The Meaning of Liff\" to \"The Meaning of Life\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\n[[File:Cartwright Hall and fountain, Bradford (22nd October 2010).jpg|thumb|right|The grounds of Cartwright Hall in [[Bradford]] ''(pictured)'' was used as a location for the dancing nurses singing \"[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]\"]]\nPrincipal photography began on 12 July 1982 and was completed about two months later, on 11 September. A wide variety of locations were used, such as [[Porchester Hall]] in [[Queensway, London|Queensway]] for the Mr Creosote sketch, where hundreds of pounds of fake vomit had to be cleaned up on the last day due to a wedding being scheduled hours later. The Malham Moors were chosen for the Grim Reaper segment; the countryside near [[Strathblane]] was used for the Zulu War; and \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" was shot in [[Colne]], [[Lancashire]] with interiors done at [[Elstree Studios]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Douglas |first1=McCall |title=Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969-2012, 2d ed. |date=2013 |publisher=McFarland |page=958}}</ref>\n\nThe film was produced on a budget of less than US$10 million, which was still bigger than that of the earlier films. This allowed for large-scale choreography and crowd sequences, a more lavishly produced soundtrack that included new original songs, and much more time able to be spent on each sketch, especially ''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''. Palin later said that the larger budget, and not making the film for the [[BBC]] (i.e., television), allowed the film to be more daring and dark.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nThe idea for the hospital sketch came from Chapman, himself a doctor,<ref name=split>{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/09/dick-cavetts-semi-serious-talk-with-graham-chapman/|title=Dick Cavett\u2019s Semi-Serious Talk with Graham Chapman|last=Ess|first=Ramsey|date=September 20, 2013|work=Splitsider|publisher=[[The Awl]]|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref> who had noticed that hospitals were changing, with \"lots and lots of machinery\".<ref name=\"guard2013\" /> According to Palin, the organ transplant scene harked back to Python's love of bureaucracy, and sketches with lots of people coming round from the council with different bits of paper.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\nDuring the filming of the scene where Palin's character explains Catholicism to his children, his line was \"that rubber thing at the end of my ''sock''\", which was later overdubbed with ''cock''.<ref name=\"guard2013\" />\n\n===''The Crimson Permanent Assurance''===\n{{main|The Crimson Permanent Assurance}}\nThe [[short film]] ''[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]'' introduces the feature.
