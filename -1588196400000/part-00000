This version was created by writer [[J.

Unlike the previous teams, which had appeared in alternate realities, this team was based in Marvel's main \"Earth-616\" reality, although the team members were from a variety of alternate universes that had been destroyed in the aftermath of the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=April 2020}}\n===Earth-712 version===\nThe Squadron Supreme are first encountered by four members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] \u2014 the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Goliath]] \u2014 who have arrived in the Earth-712 universe by mistake.<ref>''Avengers'' #84 (January 1971)</ref> The Avengers are initially confused, since several members of the Squadron Supreme have identical names and powers to the [[Squadron Sinister]], a group of previously encountered villains.<ref>''Avengers'' #69\u201370 (October\u2013November 1969)</ref> After a brief battle, the Avengers assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant [[Brain-Child]], before returning to their own universe.<ref>''Avengers'' #85\u201386 (Feb\u2013Mar 1971)</ref> The Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the '''Serpent Cartel''', but eventually they join forces and prevent the use of the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141\u2013144 (November 1975 \u2013 February 1976) & #147\u2013149 (May\u2013July 1976)</ref>\n\nThe team features briefly in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', when the evil version of [[Hyperion (Zhib-Ran)|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then the Earth-616 Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #280 (February 1979)</ref> The Squadron appear in the title ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' as mind-controlled pawns of the entities the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] and [[Null (comics)|Null the Living Darkness]], but are freed and aid the Defenders in defeating the villains.<ref>''Defenders'' #112\u2013114 (October\u2013December 1982)</ref> Earth-712, however, is left in a [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] state.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe Squadron Supreme were next featured in a self-titled 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sep 1985 \u2013 Aug 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]],<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1\u201312 (Sep 1985 \u2013 Aug 1986)</ref> which picks up from where Earth-712 was last seen in ''Defenders'' #114. The Squadron, led by Hyperion, believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a [[utopia]]. Nighthawk protests, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule. The issue is put to a vote, with the so-called \"Utopia Program\" favored by the majority of the Squadron; Nighthawk, unable to agree with the decision in clear conscience, resigns from the team. The Squadron assume overall control of the government of the [[United States]] and remake the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implement a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of [[behavior modification]] in prisons where inmates are forced to submit to a process that mentally inhibits their criminal instincts; enforcing a strict gun control policy; and developing medical technology to cryogenically preserve the dead.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nDespite the economic and technological advances, there are setbacks: [[Golden Archer]] abuses the behavior modification technology by forcing fellow member [[Lady Lark]] to love him, resulting in his eventual removal from the team; [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] becomes increasingly disgusted with the Squadron's methods and abandons the surface world altogether; [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] inadvertently kills his parents via unnoticed and uncontrollable release of radiation and dies while battling Doctor Spectrum during a rampage; and [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]] discovers he has [[cancer]] but chooses not to inform his teammates,  eventually succumbing to the disease.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nNighthawk is eventually forced to confront his old teammates with a new team he calls the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]], which also includes former Squadron member Golden Archer (now known as Black Archer). A brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes that Nighthawk was right: the Squadron, despite having good intentions, had inadvertently created a totalitarian state, with themselves as its dictators.

Army [[corporal]] Joseph Ledger is given a strange crystal removed from Hyperion's spaceship by the government that bonds to him causing him to fall into a [[coma]] for years.\n\nDiscovering Hyperion has superhuman abilities, the government uses him as a secret weapon, and is eventually outed by the [[News media|media]]. The government then announces and introduces Hyperion as a state-sponsored hero, which encourages other beings to appear, such as [[The Atlanta Blur|Blur]], who can move at superspeed. Ledger awakens, and, harnessing the energy powers of the crystal, becomes [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)|Doctor Spectrum]]. Hyperion and Spectrum are initially hostile to one another, and they battle, with Hyperion accessing lost memories when coming in contact with Spectrum's crystal. [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] is seen on dry land for the first time, and [[Power Princess|Princess Zarda]] heals Hyperion after his battle. [[Nighthawk (Supreme Power)|Nighthawk]] solicits the aid of Hyperion and the Blur to deal with a superpowered [[serial killer]], who Hyperion now knows is actually the product of experimentation with his [[DNA]].\n\nAlthough successful, Hyperion is outraged by the government exploitation and leaves, warning that he has no wish to be contacted by humankind again. The government gathers the remaining superhumans into a team to capture Hyperion.\n\nThe story continues in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Supreme Power: Hyperion''<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #1\u20135 (Nov. 2005 \u2013 Mar. 2006)</ref> with new Squadron members [[Master Menace|Emil Burbank]], [[Arcanna]], [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] and [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] tracking Hyperion to what they believe is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]. In this world, Hyperion and a version of the Squadron rule the world, with only Nighthawk and a small group of superhumans opposing their rule. Although the heroes locate the true Hyperion and convince him to return to their world, Burbank discovers that it was in fact not an alternate reality but their world two years from the present time.\n\n===Second ''Squadron Supreme'' title===\nThe second volume of the series ''Squadron Supreme''<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 2) #1\u20137 (May \u2013 Nov. 2006)</ref> brings together all the superhumans (except a reluctant Nighthawk), who are split into two teams\u2014one for international/public missions and another for covert operations. The [[President of the United States]] calls the group the Squadron Supreme. The Squadron meets with mixed success: an attempt to kill an [[Africa]]n [[dictator]] is botched, and the target is murdered by local superhumans who state the group is not welcome in Africa, and a mission to [[Iran]] has member [[Inertia (comics)|Inertia]] encouraging a victim to fight back and kill.\n\n[[China]] recruits [[Redstone (comics)|Redstone]], the superpowered serial killer created from Hyperion's DNA, in a bid to protect itself.

Courtesy of a deception engineered by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and the Ultimate villain [[Doctor Doom]], the Squadron travel to the Ultimate universe, thinking that the Ultimate [[Reed Richards]] is responsible for releasing an organism that has destroyed much of the United States.\n\nA series of misunderstandings ensues, and after a series of battles between the Squadron, [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]], [[Ultimates]] and the [[Earth-712]] Squadron Supreme (whose world was also affected by the organism), the third culprit is revealed as Burbank, who was asked by the government to develop a weapon to kill Hyperion. Nick Fury is detained in custody in the Earth-31916 universe, while Squadron member Power Princess remains in the Ultimate universe to ensure that Doom (who escaped custody by using a [[Doombot]]) is captured.\n\n===''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk''===\nAn unrelated four-issue limited series, ''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'', written by [[Marc Guggenheim]] and with art by [[Paul Gulacy]], relates how Hyperion and Nighthawk, after an initial skirmish, join forces to try and alleviate the [[Darfur conflict]] in war-torn [[Sudan]]. Hyperion discovers Nighthawk has a [[prototype]] weapon built from stolen plans of Emil Burbank's journal that cannot actually injure him, but can convince him that he is being injured.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'' #1\u20134 (March\u2013June 2007)</ref>\n\n===Third ''Squadron Supreme'' title===\nA third volume of the title ''Squadron Supreme'', written by [[Howard Chaykin]] and with art by [[Greg Land]] (and other artists), is published,<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 3) #1\u201312 (Sep. 2008 \u2013 July 2009)</ref> with the 12-issue series being set five years after the battle with Redstone. Most of the Squadron have disappeared, with Ultimate Nick Fury, Burbank and Arcanna now a team of intelligence officers working for the government and investigate a group of returning astronauts that exhibit strange abilities. The astronauts [[infect]] many people they come into contact with, also giving them superhuman abilities.\n\nFury eventually leads a new version of the Squadron that features characters who are [[pastiche]]s of long-time Marvel characters. The group eventually come into conflict with many of the original members of the Squadron who have been gathered by Hyperion. The heroes unite to stop a group of superhuman [[terrorist]]s from the [[Middle East]], but then, via a government device, apparently all lose their abilities. Arcanna secretly reveals to Fury that she, and likely many others, still possesses superhuman abilities. Fury later returns to the Ultimate universe.\n\n===Later appearances===\nLater, the members of Squadron Supreme are apparently killed by [[Namor]] and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] after the villains raid the Squadron's universe.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #24</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}} Versions resembling these characters later appear on the [[Battleworld]] created by Doctor Doom during the [[Secret Wars]] event, only to be killed again at the hands of [[Squadron Sinister]].

They decide to change the past by dragging this past Namor back to the present, thereby resurrecting him. Although this action is easy for Hyperion, who has had second thoughts about the cutthroat methods the Squadron Supreme has been using, it is more difficult for Doctor Spectrum, as Namor destroyed her Earth.

The Institute of Evil first appeared in ''[[Squadron Supreme]]'' #5 and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Bob Hall (comics)|Bob Hall]].  The known members of the Institute of Evil included [[Ape-X]] (the leader), [[Doctor Decibel]], [[Foxfire (comics)|Foxfire]], [[Lamprey (comics)|Lamprey]], [[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]], and the [[Shape (comics)|Shape]].\n\nThe Behavior Modification process invented by Squadron member [[Tom Thumb (comics)#Squadron Supreme|Tom Thumb]] would prove to be the Institute of Evil's undoing. The [[Golden Archer]] used the machine to make fellow Squadron member [[Lady Lark]] obsessed with him. However, he couldn't stand her irrational behavior, so went for a walk and was captured by the Institute. They tortured the Archer until he revealed the Squadron's new base of operations. They then kidnapped the Squadron's family members and attacked their headquarters. They began ambushing Squadron members and using the behavior modification machines on them as they returned from their missions. The Institute then brought the Squadron back to their lair where the Golden Archer and their captive family members were held. The Squadron attacked, revealing that Tom Thumb had designed the process not to work on Squadron members, and defeated the Institute completely.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5 (mini-series) (Jan. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe Institute of Evil's members were subjected to the Behavior Modification process, altering their personalities. The former super-criminals all became elected to full membership in the Squadron Supreme and aided them in their efforts to conquer the world in order to forcibly turn it into a [[utopia]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #6 (mini-series) (Feb. 1986)</ref>\n\nSome Institute members did not fare so well as members of the Squadron. Ape-X suffered from a psychotic withdrawal from reality and fell into a coma, due to her behavior modification process. After saving twenty factory workers from a gas leakage, Quagmire went into a coma. In the hospital, he was sucked into the hole in his brain that is a portal into the dimension from which his dark matter originates, and Doctor Decibel suffocated in Quagmire's extra-dimensional slime.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #10 (mini-series) (June 1986)</ref>\n\nIn time, Squadron Supreme member [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|Nighthawk]] objected to the extreme methods the Squadron was using to achieve its goals, and left the group. Nighthawk formed a rebel group, known as the America Redeemers, to oppose the Squadron's \"benevolent\" tyranny. The Redeemers included other enemies of the Squadron, expelled Squadron member the [[Golden Archer|Black Archer]], as well as unknown superheroes that infiltrated the Squadron to help take it down. With the help of [[Master Menace#Squadron Supreme|Master Menace]], the Redeemers were able to reverse the Behavior Modification of Foxfire, Lamprey, and the Shape and recruited them into his group. These three agents also remained in the Squadron as double agents.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #11 (mini-series) (July 1986)</ref>\n\nWhen the Redeemers finally confronted the Squadron Supreme, an all-out battle broke out. Lamprey tried to absorb [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]]\u2019s power, but Doctor Spectrum was able to overload Lamprey's power which killed Lamprey. Foxfire, who had long been in love with Doctor Spectrum, tried to gain his approval by betraying Nighthawk, to allow the Squadron to win the fight. She used her powers to kill Nighthawk by blasting his heart and causing a massive coronary. Foxfire was then killed by fellow Redeemer [[Mink (comics)|Mink]], who had been in love with Nighthawk. The death of Nighthawk caused the Squadron members to realize that they had become the very thing that they had intended to oppose, and thus ended the fight.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #12 (mini-series) (Aug. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] was the only former member of the Institute of Evil that eventually chose to side with the Squadron Supreme, finding happiness in his new calling.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (graphic novel) (1989)</ref>\n\n===Members===\n* '''[[Ape-X]]''' \u2013 An intelligent ape who is a loose pastiche of [[Gorilla Grodd]].\n* '''Doctor Decibel''' \u2013 A criminal surgeon.\n* '''Foxfire''' \u2013 \n* '''Lamprey''' \u2013 A power-absorbing supervillain who is a pastiche of [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]].\n* '''[[Mink (comics)|Mink]]''' \u2013 A criminal who is a pastiche for [[Catwoman]].\n* '''[[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]]''' \u2013 \n* '''[[Shape (comics)|Shape]]''' \u2013 A supervillain who is loosely based on [[Plastic Man]].

This version of the Squadron are aliens who attempted to rule their planet and destroyed it when the populace failed to blindly obey them. Nighthawk considers himself the \"architect\" and Hyperion his \"hammer.\" In the first-season episode \"Hyperion\", Hyperion arrives on Earth and plans to do the same to this new world that he had done to his. He is imprisoned by the Avengers, but later escapes and joins the [[Red Skull]]'s [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]]. In the second season, the Squadron Supreme reunite and plan to become the \"protectors\" of Earth, which leads to them clashing with the Avengers in the second season's subplot.

This version was created by writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and artist [[Gary Frank]].\n\nYet another Squadron Supreme was introduced in 2015, written by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] and drawn by [[Leonard Kirk]]. Unlike the previous teams, which had appeared in alternate realities, this team was based in Marvel's main \"Earth-616\" reality, although the team members were from a variety of alternate universes that had been destroyed in the aftermath of the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=April 2020}}\n===Earth-712 version===\nThe Squadron Supreme are first encountered by four members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] \u2014 the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Goliath]] \u2014 who have arrived in the Earth-712 universe by mistake.<ref>''Avengers'' #84 (January 1971)</ref> The Avengers are initially confused, since several members of the Squadron Supreme have identical names and powers to the [[Squadron Sinister]], a group of previously encountered villains.<ref>''Avengers'' #69\u201370 (October\u2013November 1969)</ref> After a brief battle, the Avengers assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant [[Brain-Child]], before returning to their own universe.<ref>''Avengers'' #85\u201386 (Feb\u2013Mar 1971)</ref> The Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the '''Serpent Cartel''', but eventually they join forces and prevent the use of the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141\u2013144 (November 1975 \u2013 February 1976) & #147\u2013149 (May\u2013July 1976)</ref>\n\nThe team features briefly in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', when the evil version of [[Hyperion (Zhib-Ran)|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then the Earth-616 Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #280 (February 1979)</ref> The Squadron appear in the title ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' as mind-controlled pawns of the entities the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] and [[Null (comics)|Null the Living Darkness]], but are freed and aid the Defenders in defeating the villains.<ref>''Defenders'' #112\u2013114 (October\u2013December 1982)</ref> Earth-712, however, is left in a [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] state.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe Squadron Supreme were next featured in a self-titled 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sep 1985 \u2013 Aug 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]],<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1\u201312 (Sep 1985 \u2013 Aug 1986)</ref> which picks up from where Earth-712 was last seen in ''Defenders'' #114. The Squadron, led by Hyperion, believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a [[utopia]]. Nighthawk protests, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule. The issue is put to a vote, with the so-called \"Utopia Program\" favored by the majority of the Squadron; Nighthawk, unable to agree with the decision in clear conscience, resigns from the team. The Squadron assume overall control of the government of the [[United States]] and remake the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implement a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of [[behavior modification]] in prisons where inmates are forced to submit to a process that mentally inhibits their criminal instincts; enforcing a strict gun control policy; and developing medical technology to cryogenically preserve the dead.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nDespite the economic and technological advances, there are setbacks: [[Golden Archer]] abuses the behavior modification technology by forcing fellow member [[Lady Lark]] to love him, resulting in his eventual removal from the team; [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] becomes increasingly disgusted with the Squadron's methods and abandons the surface world altogether; [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] inadvertently kills his parents via unnoticed and uncontrollable release of radiation and dies while battling Doctor Spectrum during a rampage; and [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]] discovers he has [[cancer]] but chooses not to inform his teammates,  eventually succumbing to the disease.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nNighthawk is eventually forced to confront his old teammates with a new team he calls the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]], which also includes former Squadron member Golden Archer (now known as Black Archer). A brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes that Nighthawk was right: the Squadron, despite having good intentions, had inadvertently created a totalitarian state, with themselves as its dictators.

Ledger awakens, and, harnessing the energy powers of the crystal, becomes [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)|Doctor Spectrum]]. Hyperion and Spectrum are initially hostile to one another, and they battle, with Hyperion accessing lost memories when coming in contact with Spectrum's crystal. [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] is seen on dry land for the first time, and [[Power Princess|Princess Zarda]] heals Hyperion after his battle. [[Nighthawk (Supreme Power)|Nighthawk]] solicits the aid of Hyperion and the Blur to deal with a superpowered [[serial killer]], who Hyperion now knows is actually the product of experimentation with his [[DNA]].\n\nAlthough successful, Hyperion is outraged by the government exploitation and leaves, warning that he has no wish to be contacted by humankind again.

The [[President of the United States]] calls the group the Squadron Supreme. The Squadron meets with mixed success: an attempt to kill an [[Africa]]n [[dictator]] is botched, and the target is murdered by local superhumans who state the group is not welcome in Africa, and a mission to [[Iran]] has member [[Inertia (comics)|Inertia]] encouraging a victim to fight back and kill.\n\n[[China]] recruits [[Redstone (comics)|Redstone]], the superpowered serial killer created from Hyperion's DNA, in a bid to protect itself.

Courtesy of a deception engineered by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and the Ultimate villain [[Doctor Doom]], the Squadron travel to the Ultimate universe, thinking that the Ultimate [[Reed Richards]] is responsible for releasing an organism that has destroyed much of the United States.\n\nA series of misunderstandings ensues, and after a series of battles between the Squadron, [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]], [[Ultimates]] and the [[Earth-712]] Squadron Supreme (whose world was also affected by the organism), the third culprit is revealed as Burbank, who was asked by the government to develop a weapon to kill Hyperion. Nick Fury is detained in custody in the Earth-31916 universe, while Squadron member Power Princess remains in the Ultimate universe to ensure that Doom (who escaped custody by using a [[Doombot]]) is captured.\n\n===''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk''===\nAn unrelated four-issue limited series, ''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'', written by [[Marc Guggenheim]] and with art by [[Paul Gulacy]], relates how Hyperion and Nighthawk, after an initial skirmish, join forces to try and alleviate the [[Darfur conflict]] in war-torn [[Sudan]].

The group eventually come into conflict with many of the original members of the Squadron who have been gathered by Hyperion. The heroes unite to stop a group of superhuman [[terrorist]]s from the [[Middle East]], but then, via a government device, apparently all lose their abilities. Arcanna secretly reveals to Fury that she, and likely many others, still possesses superhuman abilities.

They decide to change the past by dragging this past Namor back to the present, thereby resurrecting him. Although this action is easy for Hyperion, who has had second thoughts about the cutthroat methods the Squadron Supreme has been using, it is more difficult for Doctor Spectrum, as Namor destroyed her Earth.

Their origin is fully shown, where its members are revealed to be [[simulacrum]]s created by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and programmed by the Power Elite so that Phil Coulson can have them be a United States-sponsored superhero team.

The Institute of Evil first appeared in ''[[Squadron Supreme]]'' #5 and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Bob Hall (comics)|Bob Hall]].  The known members of the Institute of Evil included [[Ape-X]] (the leader), [[Doctor Decibel]], [[Foxfire (comics)|Foxfire]], [[Lamprey (comics)|Lamprey]], [[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]], and the [[Shape (comics)|Shape]].\n\nThe Behavior Modification process invented by Squadron member [[Tom Thumb (comics)#Squadron Supreme|Tom Thumb]] would prove to be the Institute of Evil's undoing. The [[Golden Archer]] used the machine to make fellow Squadron member [[Lady Lark]] obsessed with him. However, he couldn't stand her irrational behavior, so went for a walk and was captured by the Institute. They tortured the Archer until he revealed the Squadron's new base of operations. They then kidnapped the Squadron's family members and attacked their headquarters. They began ambushing Squadron members and using the behavior modification machines on them as they returned from their missions. The Institute then brought the Squadron back to their lair where the Golden Archer and their captive family members were held. The Squadron attacked, revealing that Tom Thumb had designed the process not to work on Squadron members, and defeated the Institute completely.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5 (mini-series) (Jan. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe Institute of Evil's members were subjected to the Behavior Modification process, altering their personalities. The former super-criminals all became elected to full membership in the Squadron Supreme and aided them in their efforts to conquer the world in order to forcibly turn it into a [[utopia]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #6 (mini-series) (Feb. 1986)</ref>\n\nSome Institute members did not fare so well as members of the Squadron. Ape-X suffered from a psychotic withdrawal from reality and fell into a coma, due to her behavior modification process. After saving twenty factory workers from a gas leakage, Quagmire went into a coma. In the hospital, he was sucked into the hole in his brain that is a portal into the dimension from which his dark matter originates, and Doctor Decibel suffocated in Quagmire's extra-dimensional slime.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #10 (mini-series) (June 1986)</ref>\n\nIn time, Squadron Supreme member [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|Nighthawk]] objected to the extreme methods the Squadron was using to achieve its goals, and left the group. Nighthawk formed a rebel group, known as the America Redeemers, to oppose the Squadron's \"benevolent\" tyranny. The Redeemers included other enemies of the Squadron, expelled Squadron member the [[Golden Archer|Black Archer]], as well as unknown superheroes that infiltrated the Squadron to help take it down. With the help of [[Master Menace#Squadron Supreme|Master Menace]], the Redeemers were able to reverse the Behavior Modification of Foxfire, Lamprey, and the Shape and recruited them into his group. These three agents also remained in the Squadron as double agents.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #11 (mini-series) (July 1986)</ref>\n\nWhen the Redeemers finally confronted the Squadron Supreme, an all-out battle broke out. Lamprey tried to absorb [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]]\u2019s power, but Doctor Spectrum was able to overload Lamprey's power which killed Lamprey. Foxfire, who had long been in love with Doctor Spectrum, tried to gain his approval by betraying Nighthawk, to allow the Squadron to win the fight. She used her powers to kill Nighthawk by blasting his heart and causing a massive coronary. Foxfire was then killed by fellow Redeemer [[Mink (comics)|Mink]], who had been in love with Nighthawk. The death of Nighthawk caused the Squadron members to realize that they had become the very thing that they had intended to oppose, and thus ended the fight.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #12 (mini-series) (Aug. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] was the only former member of the Institute of Evil that eventually chose to side with the Squadron Supreme, finding happiness in his new calling.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (graphic novel) (1989)</ref>\n\n===Members===\n* '''[[Ape-X]]''' - An intelligent ape who is a loose pastiche of [[Gorilla Grodd]].\n* '''Doctor Decibel''' - A criminal surgeon.\n* '''Foxfire''' - \n* '''Lamprey''' - A power-absorbing supervillain who is a pastiche of [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]].\n* '''[[Mink (comics)|Mink]]''' - A criminal who is a pastiche for [[Catwoman]].\n* '''[[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]]''' - \n* '''[[Shape (comics)|Shape]]''' - A supervillain who is loosely based on [[Plastic Man]].

The members present are Nighthawk, Power Princess, and Hyperion. Thanos and Grandmaster pit [[Iron Man]], [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Hulk]] against the Squadron members.\n* The Squadron Supreme also appears in the TV series ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]''. The group consists of [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], [[Power Princess|Zarda]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]], [[Doctor Spectrum]], and [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]]. This version of the Squadron are aliens who attempted to rule their planet and destroyed it when the populace failed to blindly obey them. Nighthawk considers himself the \"architect\" and Hyperion his \"hammer.\" In the first-season episode \"Hyperion\", Hyperion arrives on Earth and plans to do the same to this new world that he had done to his. He is imprisoned by the Avengers, but later escapes and joins the [[Red Skull]]'s [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]]. In the second season, the Squadron Supreme reunite and plan to become the \"protectors\" of Earth, which leads to them clashing with the Avengers in the second season's subplot. Eventually, the Squadron Supreme are defeated and remanded to a special section of the Vault.\n\n==Collected editions==\n* ''Squadron Supreme'' ([[Trade paperback (comics)|TPB]], 352 pages, 2005, {{ISBN|078510576X}}) collects ''Squadron Supreme'' #1\u201312 (Sep 1985 \u2013 Aug 1986)\n* ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (Graphic novel, hardcover, 1989, {{ISBN|0871355981}})\n* ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (TPB, 240 pages, 2006, {{ISBN|0785120912}}) collects ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'', ''Thor'' #280, ''Avengers (1998)'' #5\u20136, ''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98'' and ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order''\n* ''Squadron Supreme Omnibus'' (HC, 2010, {{ISBN|9780785149712}}), collects ''Squadron Supreme'' #1\u201312, ''Captain America'' #314, ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe''\n* ''Squadron Supreme Classic Omnibus'' (HC, 2016, {{ISBN|9781302900656}}), collects ''Avengers'' #69\u201370, #85\u201386, #141\u2013144 and #147\u2013149, ''Thor'' #280, ''Defenders'' #112\u2013114, ''Squadron Supreme'' #1\u201312, ''Captain America'' #314, ''Squadron Supreme: Death Of A Universe'', ''Quasar'' #13\u201316 and #51\u201352, ''Avengers (1998)'' #5\u20136, ''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98'', ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'', ''Exiles'' #77\u201378 and ''Ultimate Power'' #7\u20139\n*''Supreme Power'' (Vol. 1) (MAX imprint) #1\u201318 (August 2003 \u2013 August 2005) collected as:\n**''Contact'' (TPB collects #1\u20136, 144 pages, 2004, {{ISBN|0785112243}})\n**''Powers and Principalities'' (TPB, collects #7\u201312, 144 pages, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1456-4}})\n**''High Command'' (TPB, collects #13\u201318, 144 pages, 2005, {{ISBN|0785114742}})\n**''Supreme Power'' Vol. 1 (hardcover, collects #1\u201312 and ''Avengers'' #85\u201386, 352 pages, 2005, {{ISBN|078511369X}})\n**''Supreme Power'' Vol. 2 (hardcover, collects #13\u201318 and ''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #1\u20135, 264 pages, 2006, {{ISBN|0785121331}})\n*''Doctor Spectrum'' (MAX imprint) #1\u20136 (August 2004 \u2013 March 2005).

Marius's march west provoked the Mauretanian king, Jugurtha's father-in-law Bocchus, into joining forces with Jugurtha. At the end of the campaign, near a river called the Muluccha, Marius captured another of Jugurtha's treasury fortresses. After taking the fortress at the Muluccha Marius decided to return to Cirta to put his soldiers into winter quarters.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp. 27\u201333; Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', p. 84.</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nWhile marching back east the Romans were ambushed, just to the west of [[Setif]], by the combined forces of Jugurtha and Bocchus.
