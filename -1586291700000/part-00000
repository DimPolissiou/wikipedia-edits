Throughout its existence it was edited by newspaper publisher [[James Watson Webb]].  It was closely connected with the rise and fall of the United States [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and was noted for its careful coverage of New York Harbor shipping news and its close attention to speeches and events in the [[United States Congress]].<ref name=\"Burrows\">{{cite book |title=Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 (The History of New York City, vol. 1) |last=Burrows |first=Edwin G., and Wallace, Mike |year=1999 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press USA]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-19-514049-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195140491/page/440 440\u2013441, 556] |nopp=true |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195140491/page/440 }}</ref><ref name=\"Lehrman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mrlincolnandnewyork.org/inside.asp?ID=41&subjectID=3 |title=James Watson Webb (1802-1884) |work=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]] |accessdate=2011-02-09 |format=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Growth===\n[[File:James Watson Webb - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Watson Webb]], publisher]]  The ''Courier and Enquirer'' was based upon the merger of two pre-existing newspapers, Webb's ''New York Morning Courier'' (1827) and [[Mordecai Noah]]'s ''[[New York Enquirer|New-York Enquirer]]''.  After Webb purchased the ''Enquirer'' in 1829, he merged the two Manhattan-based news sheets to form the ''Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer'', usually called simply the ''Courier and Enquirer''.  At that time a partisan supporter of newly elected President [[Andrew Jackson]], Webb ran his newspaper in the interest of what was becoming the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].  He hired young journalist [[James Gordon Bennett, Sr.]] to be his associate editor.<ref name=\"Burrows\"/><ref name=\"Lehrman\"/>\n\nBy the 1830s, Bennett's and Webb's ''Courier and Enquirer'' had developed a crack reportorial system for gathering news from New York-based ships and from Washington, D.C.  The paper was able to compile the resources necessary to set up a pioneering [[Pony express (newspapers)|pony express]] system to carry dispatches from the U.S. Capitol.  In one 1830 coup, the ''Courier and Enquirer'' obtained the text of Jackson's [[State of the Union address|annual message to Congress]] in only 27.5 hours.<ref name=\"Burrows\"/>\n\nHowever, New York's growing [[History of New York City (1784-1854)|business community]] felt increasing dislike for Jackson's [[populism]].  As a member of this class and social network, Webb was pulled away from his old ties\u2014and attracted towards the political circle around Webb's new friend, federal senator [[Henry Clay]].  Clay, although he was from [[Kentucky]], was taking the lead in defense of New York's growing [[Bank of New York|banking sector]] against attacks from [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonians]].\n\n===Whig Party===\nNewspaper competition played a role in the accelerating movement of the ''Courier and Enquirer'' away from Jacksonianism.  One of its chief rival papers, the ''[[New York Post|New York Evening Post]]'', was edited by Webb's rival [[William Leggett (writer)|William Leggett]].  Leggett, who was allied with Jackson's New York political lieutenant [[Martin Van Buren]], edited the ''Evening Post'' to be hostile to banks and the New York financial sector.  Webb and the ''Courier and Enquirer'' sensed an opportunity to create an anti-Jackson newspaper with a national reach.  In a key sign of this split, in 1832 associate editor Bennett left the ''Courier and Enquirer'' to start his own Democratic paper, the ''[[New York Herald]]''.<ref name=\"Lehrman\"/>\n\nBy 1834 Webb, Clay, and the East Coast financial industry had joined hands to form a new, nationwide political party.  While its party machinery was based on Clay's [[National Republican Party]], the new name for the political gathering, the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] Party, was coined by Webb, who became the young party's chief [[media proprietor]].  The ''Courier and Enquirer'' thus became a key element in the United States's [[Second Party System]], in which the Democratic Party and the Whig Party confronted each other during the decades prior to the [[American Civil War]].  A standard history of New York states that during the 1830s, the ''Courier and Enquirer'' was \"the largest and most powerful paper in the United States.\"<ref name=\"Burrows\"/>\n\nDemocrats considered Webb to be a disloyal traitor to their side, and responded to the ''Courier and Enquirer's'' news coverage with great bitterness.  In 1837\u20131838, Democrats in [[25th United States Congress|Congress]] made floor speeches that attacked the ''Courier and Enquirer'' with such ferocity that one of Clay's Kentucky allies, congressman [[William J. Graves]], challenged a critic of the ''Courier and Enquirer'', Maine Democratic lawmaker [[Jonathan Cilley]], to a [[duel]].  Their personal combat, which began with editorials in the ''Courier and Enquirer'' and speeches on the [[National Statuary Hall|U.S. House floor]], ended with Cilley's death.\n\n===Decline===\nLike other United States newspapers of the era, the ''Courier and Enquirer'' was not founded as a provider of up-to-the-minute information.  Its pages tended to be filled with the texts of letters written on paper and physically delivered to the editor from distant locations (from where we get our word for a newspaper reporter, \"correspondent\"), and partisan editorials.\n\nThe successful operation of an American [[Electrical telegraph#Morse telegraphs|electrical telegraph]] in 1844 created a [[paradigm shift]] in American newspapering.  Soon the [[Samuel F.B. Morse|Morse lines]] reached New York City, and Webb's competitors, headed by rival Whig editor [[Horace Greeley]], proved to be more adept in adapting to the new technology and publishing [[New York Tribune|daily newspapers filled with fresh news]].  Webb grew increasingly uninterested in his journalistic duties, and began, starting in 1849, to trawl for appointment as a United States [[ambassador]] or to some other post that would grant him the social status he wanted.<ref name=\"Lehrman\"/>\n\nAs the ''Courier and Enquirer'' ceased to be a cutting-edge newspaper, the Whig Party also declined.  In line with the ties of many New York merchants to the U.S. South and its slaveholding community, the ''Courier and Enquirer'' had always supported [[American slavery]].  The paper's coverage of [[African-Americans]] was extremely hostile, marked by prejudice and [[Anti-abolitionist riots (1834)|bigotry]].  While this kind of coverage was little problem for the newspaper in the 1830s and 1840s, the growth of [[free soil]] and even [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] sentiment throughout the Northern states in the 1850s made the ''Courier and Enquirer'' look archaic.  Meanwhile, the Whigs, torn apart by the growing slavery crisis, could not field a candidate for the U.S. presidency in 1856.  Many New York Whigs joined the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name=\"Lehrman\"/>\n\nIn 1861, Webb's fellow former Whig, [[Abraham Lincoln]], became U.S. President; but the new chief executive had little use for the aging newspaper.  Lincoln appointed Webb first to be U.S. minister to [[Turkey]], which he declined, and then minister to [[Brazil]], an appointment that he accepted.  Both countries were far away from New York City.  The newly named diplomat consolidated the ''Courier and Enquirer'' into the new, rival newspaper, the ''New York World'', which carried on the ''Courier and Enquirer's'' [[racism|racist]] coverage.  As the ''World'' was a Democratic paper, the partisan history of the ''Courier and Enquirer'' had revolved through a full circle.  As former editor Webb sailed southward in 1861 to take on his new job, the ''Courier and Enquirer'' ceased publication forever.<ref name=\"Lehrman\"/>\n\n==Today==\nThe ''Courier and Enquirer's'' close coverage of three U.S. Senate opponents of Andrew Jackson, namely Henry Clay, [[John C. Calhoun]], and [[Daniel Webster]], is credited with enlarging the reputation of these three men into key figures of the Second Party System or [[History of the United States (1789-1849)|antebellum]] period of U.S. history, and eventually to their reputation as members of the [[Great Triumvirate]].\n\nA microfilm file of the ''New York Courier and Enquirer'' from its June 16, 1829 startup until its June 29, 1861 dissolution can be found on the shelves of the [[New York State Library]] under the title ''Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer''.<ref name=\"NYSL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/131.htm |title=New York County (NY) newspapers on microfilm at NYSL |work=[[New York State Library]] |accessdate=2011-02-09 }}</ref>\n\nA similar file, marked \"incomplete\", can be found in the [[New York Public Library]] under the title ''Morning Courier and New York Enquirer''.<ref name=\"NYPL\">{{cite web |url=http://legacy.www.nypl.org/research/chss/mic/images/newyork.pdf |title=New York Newspapers |work=[[New York Public Library]] |accessdate=2011-02-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727084802/http://legacy.www.nypl.org/research/chss/mic/images/newyork.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Stephen W. |date=2019 |title=The Bank War and the Partisan Press: Newspapers, Financial Institutions, and the Post Office in Jacksonian America |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Bank_War_and_the_Partisan_Press.html?id=qBuPvgEACAAJ |location=Lawrence, Kan. |publisher=[[University Press of Kansas]] |isbn=978-0-7006-2744-8 }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://fultonhistory.com/my%20photo%20albums/All%20Newspapers/New%20York%20NY%20Morning%20Courier/index.html Morning Courier archives] at fultonhistory.com\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Defunct newspapers of New York City]]\n[[Category:New York World]]\n[[Category:Publications established in 1829]]\n[[Category:Publications disestablished in 1861]]\n[[Category:1861 disestablishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1829 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox newspaper\n| name                = New York Courier and Enquirer\n| logo                = File:Morning Courier and New York Enquirer 1853 title.png\n| image               = \n| caption             = \n| type                = Daily\n| format              = [[broadsheet]]\n| foundation          = June 1829\n| ceased publication  = June 1861\n| price               = \n| owners              = \n| political position  = [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]\n| publisher           = [[James Watson Webb]]\n| editor              = \n| staff               = \n| circulation         = \n| headquarters        = New York\n| ISSN                = \n| oclc                = 9348981\n| website             = \n}}\n\nThe '''''New York Courier and Enquirer''''', properly called the '''''Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer''''', was a daily broadsheet [[newspaper]] published in [[New York City]] from June 1829 until June 1861, when it was merged into the ''[[New York World]]''.

Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried until she could be buried with him.

In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, [[Ebba Leijonhufvud]] and [[Christina Natt och Dag]] were appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title ''Upptuktelse-F\u00f6rest\u00e5nderska'' ('Castigation Mistress'), while [[Beata Oxenstierna]] and [[Ebba Ryning]] were appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of ''Hovm\u00e4starinna''.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\">Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62</ref>\n\n[[File:Queenchristine.jpg|thumb|The 14-year-old Christina as queen, painting by [[Jacob Heinrich Elbfas]]]]\nThe Royal Council's method of giving Queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person appears to have been effective, as Christina did not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and did not seem to have formed any attachment to any of them; in fact, with only a few exceptions, such as [[Ebba Sparre]], [[Lady Jane Ruthven]] and [[Louise van der Nooth]], Christina did not show any interest in any of her female courtiers, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than they.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\"/>\n\nChristina was educated as a royal male would have been.

Chancellor Oxenstierna taught her politics and discussed [[Tacitus]] with her. Oxenstierna wrote proudly of the 14-year-old girl that, \"She is not at all like a female\" and that she had \"a bright intelligence\". Christina seemed happy to study ten hours a day.

He won several battles, and in 1631, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] decided France would support Sweden with money and soldiers. But Gustavus was killed in 1632.\n\nCount Oxenstierna became regent and continued Sweden's part in the war. Defeated in the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)]], the Swedish army retreated from southern Germany to [[Pomerania]]. Though Sweden won some later battles, the war effort was exhausting.\n\nChristina reached her majority in 1644, and Chancellor Oxenstierna soon discovered that her political views differed from his own. In 1645 he sent his son, [[Johan Oxenstierna]], to the Peace Congress in the [[Westphalia]]n cities of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], to argue against peace.

Every Wednesday she held the palace open to visitors from the higher classes who kept themselves busy with poetry and intellectual discussions. Christina opened an academy in the palace on 24 January 1656, called [[Academy of Arcadia]], where the participants enjoyed music, theater, and literature. The poet [[Reyer Anslo]] was presented to her. Belonging to the Arcadia-circle was also [[Francesco Negri (travel writer)|Francesco Negri]], a Franciscan from [[Ravenna]] who is regarded as the first tourist to visit [[North Cape, Norway]].{{refn|group=note|Negri wrote eight letters about his walk through Scandinavia all the way up to \"Capo Nord\" in 1664.}} Another [[Franciscan]] was the Swede Lars Skytte, who, under the name pater Laurentius, served as Christina's confessor for eight years.{{refn|group=note|He too had been a pupil of Johannes Matthiae, and his uncle had been Gustav Adolf's teacher. As a diplomat in Portugal he had converted, and asked for a transfer to Rome when he learnt of Christina's arrival.}}\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Christina gave occasion to much gossip when socializing freely with men her own age.

Lanoye, p. 157.</ref> to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this \"does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave.\" As he had promised to remain celibate, his replies were more reserved.{{refn|group=note|Christina wrote him many letters during her travels.

On one occasion the couple had arranged to meet at the [[Villa Medici]] near [[Monte Pincio]], but the cardinal did not show up.

The French politician [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], an Italian himself, had attempted to liberate Naples from Spanish rule, against which the locals had fought before the [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)]] was created. A second expedition in 1654 had failed and the [[Henry II, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] gave up. <!--Supported by the [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena|Duke of Modena]], Mazarin was now considering Christina as a possible queen for Naples.--> Christina's goal was to become a mediator between France and Spain in their contest to control Naples. Her plan detailed that she would lead French troops to take Naples and rule until bequeathing the crown to France after her death. Christina sent home all her Spanish servants, including her confidant Pimentel and her confessor Gu\u00eames.<ref>D. Lanoye, p. 150.</ref> On 20 July 1656 Christina set sail from [[Civitavecchia]] for Marseille where she arrived nine days later. In early August she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship, but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.\n\nOn 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier|la Grande Mademoiselle]], she, as the latter recalls, \"surprised me very much \u2013 applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature\".<ref>''Memoirs of Mademoiselle de Montpensier''. H. Colburn, 1848. Page 48.</ref>\n\nChristina was treated with respect by the young [[Louis XIV]] and his mother, [[Anne of Austria]], in [[Compi\u00e8gne]]. On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready.  He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples, and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.{{refn|group=note|Mazarin however found another arrangement to ensure peace; he strengthened this with a marriage arrangement between Louis XIV and his first cousin, [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] \u2013 the wedding took place in 1660. But this was unknown to Christina, who sent different messengers to Mazarin to remind him of their plan.}}\n\nOn her way back Christina visited the beautiful and atheistic [[Ninon de l'Enclos]] in the convent at [[Lagny-sur-Marne]]. In early October she left France and arrived in [[Torino]]. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in [[Pesaro]], probably to flee the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Rome.

Rudolf's bulk purchases had included the famous collection of [[Emperor Charles V]]'s leading minister [[Cardinal Granvelle]] (1517\u201386), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the \"greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni|Leoni]] and many other artists\",<ref>Trevor-Roper, 112.</ref>\n\nChristina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia in the [[Early Modern period]].  Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.<ref>Watson, 97\u201398</ref>\n\nMost of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art.  She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to [[Antwerp]] in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.<ref>Watson, 127\u20139</ref>\n\nChristina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small [[Raphael]] [[predella]] panels from the [[Colonna Altarpiece]], including the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome.<ref>Watson, 158. The other panels are now in London: two at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the other National Gallery; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/studying-raphael-division-of-altarpieces National Gallery page on the division of the Raphael altarpiece].</ref>  She was apparently given Titian's ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' by the greatest collector of the age, [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]], Viceroy in Brussels \u2013 she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion,<ref>Penny, 255.  It is clearly shown in one of the Tenier's views of Leopold's galleries. Leopold's collection is now part of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.</ref> and gave some generous gifts herself, notably [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s panels of [[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|''Adam'' and ''Eve'']] to [[Philip IV of Spain]] (now [[Prado]]).  She also gave away two paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Dull Gret]]'' and ''[[The Cripples]]'' (now [[Louvre]]).  In such ways the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.<ref>Grate</ref>\n\nThe Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the ''Sala dei Quadri'' (\"Paintings Room\") had her finest works, with thirteen [[Titian]]s and eleven [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]s, five [[Raphael]]s and several [[Correggio]]s.<ref>Watson, 160\u2013161; not all these attributions would hold today.</ref> [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' was among them.

It is possible she was [[insanity|insane]]. After the king died on 6&nbsp;November 1632 on the battlefield, his corpse was brought home in a coffin, with his heart in a separate box. Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried until she could be buried with him. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open, and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking no notice of the [[putrefaction]]. Eventually, the embarrassed chancellor, [[Axel Oxenstierna]], saw no other solution than to have a guard posted at the room to prevent further episodes.<ref>Peter Englund: ''S\u00f8lvmasken'' (s. 159), edited by Spartacus, Oslo 2009, {{ISBN|978-82-430-0466-5}}</ref> As a result, he was not buried until 22&nbsp;June 1634, more than eighteen months later.\n\nIn 1634, the [[Instrument of Government (1634)]], a new constitution, was introduced by Oxenstierna.

In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, [[Ebba Leijonhufvud]] and [[Christina Natt och Dag]] were appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title ''Upptuktelse-F\u00f6rest\u00e5nderska'' ('Castigation Mistress'), while [[Beata Oxenstierna]] and [[Ebba Ryning]] were appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of ''Hovm\u00e4starinna''.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\">Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62</ref>\n\n[[File:Queenchristine.jpg|thumb|The 14-year-old Christina as queen, painting by [[Jacob Heinrich Elbfas]]]]\nThe Royal Council's method of giving Queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person appears to have been effective, as Christina did not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and did not seem to have formed any attachment to any of them; in fact, with only a few exceptions, such as [[Ebba Sparre]], [[Lady Jane Ruthven]] and [[Louise van der Nooth]], Christina did not show any interest in any of her female courtiers, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than they.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\"/>\n\nChristina was educated as a royal male would have been. The theologian [[Johannes Matthiae Gothus]] became her tutor; he gave her lessons in [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. Chancellor Oxenstierna taught her politics and discussed [[Tacitus]] with her. Oxenstierna wrote proudly of the 14-year-old girl that, \"She is not at all like a female\" and that she had \"a bright intelligence\". Christina seemed happy to study ten hours a day.

Christina, however, wanted peace at any cost and sent her own delegate, [[Johan Adler Salvius]].\n\nThe [[Peace of Westphalia]] was signed between May and October 1648, effectively ending the [[European wars of religion]]. Sweden received an indemnity of five million [[thaler]]s, used primarily to pay its troops. Sweden further received [[Western Pomerania]] (henceforth [[Swedish Pomerania]]), [[Wismar]], the [[Archbishopric of Bremen]], and the [[Bishopric of Verden]] as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the [[Diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] and in the respective diets (''[[Kreistag]]'') of three [[Imperial Circles]]: the [[Upper Saxon Circle]], [[Lower Saxon Circle]], and [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle]]; the city of Bremen was disputed.<ref>B\u00f6hme, Klaus-R (2001).

Every Wednesday she held the palace open to visitors from the higher classes who kept themselves busy with poetry and intellectual discussions. Christina opened an academy in the palace on 24 January 1656, called [[Academy of Arcadia]], where the participants enjoyed music, theater, and literature. The poet [[Reyer Anslo]] was presented to her. Belonging to the Arcadia-circle was also [[Francesco Negri (travel writer)|Francesco Negri]], a Franciscan from [[Ravenna]] who is regarded as the first tourist to visit [[North Cape, Norway]].{{refn|group=note|Negri wrote eight letters about his walk through Scandinavia all the way up to \"Capo Nord\" in 1664.}} Another [[Franciscan]] was the Swede Lars Skytte, who, under the name pater Laurentius, served as Christina's confessor for eight years.{{refn|group=note|He too had been a pupil of Johannes Matthiae, and his uncle had been Gustav Adolf's teacher. As a diplomat in Portugal he had converted, and asked for a transfer to Rome when he learnt of Christina's arrival.}}\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Christina gave occasion to much gossip when socializing freely with men her own age. One of them was [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Decio Azzolino]], who had been a secretary to the ambassador in Spain, and responsible for the Vatican's correspondence with European courts.<ref name=bargrave>''Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals'' by [[John Bargrave]], edited by [[James Craigie Robertson]] (reprint; 2009)</ref> He was also the leader of the ''[[Squadrone Volante]]'', the free thinking \"Flying Squad\" movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace; but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676<ref>D. Lanoye, p. 157.</ref> to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this \"does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave.\" As he had promised to remain celibate, his replies were more reserved.{{refn|group=note|Christina wrote him many letters during her travels.

On one occasion the couple had arranged to meet at the [[Villa Medici]] near [[Monte Pincio]], but the cardinal did not show up.

The French politician [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], an Italian himself, had attempted to liberate Naples from Spanish rule, against which the locals had fought before the [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)]] was created. A second expedition in 1654 had failed and the [[Henry II, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] gave up. <!--Supported by the [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena|Duke of Modena]], Mazarin was now considering Christina as a possible queen for Naples.--> Christina's goal was to become a mediator between France and Spain in their contest to control Naples. Her plan detailed that she would lead French troops to take Naples and rule until bequeathing the crown to France after her death. Christina sent home all her Spanish servants, including her confidant Pimentel and her confessor Gu\u00eames.<ref>D. Lanoye, p. 150.</ref> On 20 July 1656 Christina set sail from [[Civitavecchia]] for Marseille where she arrived nine days later. In early August she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship, but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.\n\nOn 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier|la Grande Mademoiselle]], she, as the latter recalls, \"surprised me very much \u2013 applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature\".<ref>''Memoirs of Mademoiselle de Montpensier''. H. Colburn, 1848. Page 48.</ref>\n\nChristina was treated with respect by the young [[Louis XIV]] and his mother, [[Anne of Austria]], in [[Compi\u00e8gne]]. On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready.  He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples, and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.{{refn|group=note|Mazarin however found another arrangement to ensure peace; he strengthened this with a marriage arrangement between Louis XIV and his first cousin, [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] \u2013 the wedding took place in 1660. But this was unknown to Christina, who sent different messengers to Mazarin to remind him of their plan.}}\n\nOn her way back Christina visited the beautiful and atheistic [[Ninon de l'Enclos]] in the convent at [[Lagny-sur-Marne]]. In early October she left France and arrived in [[Torino]]. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in [[Pesaro]], probably to flee the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Rome.

Rudolf's bulk purchases had included the famous collection of [[Emperor Charles V]]'s leading minister [[Cardinal Granvelle]] (1517\u201386), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the \"greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni|Leoni]] and many other artists\",<ref>Trevor-Roper, 112.</ref>\n\nChristina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia in the [[Early Modern period]].  Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.<ref>Watson, 97\u201398</ref>\n\nMost of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art.  She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to [[Antwerp]] in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.<ref>Watson, 127\u20139</ref>\n\nChristina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small [[Raphael]] [[predella]] panels from the [[Colonna Altarpiece]], including the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome.<ref>Watson, 158. The other panels are now in London: two at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the other National Gallery; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/studying-raphael-division-of-altarpieces National Gallery page on the division of the Raphael altarpiece].</ref>  She was apparently given Titian's ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' by the greatest collector of the age, [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]], Viceroy in Brussels \u2013 she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion,<ref>Penny, 255.  It is clearly shown in one of the Tenier's views of Leopold's galleries. Leopold's collection is now part of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.</ref> and gave some generous gifts herself, notably [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s panels of [[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|''Adam'' and ''Eve'']] to [[Philip IV of Spain]] (now [[Prado]]).  She also gave away two paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Dull Gret]]'' and ''[[The Cripples]]'' (now [[Louvre]]).  In such ways the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.<ref>Grate</ref>\n\nThe Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the ''Sala dei Quadri'' (\"Paintings Room\") had her finest works, with thirteen [[Titian]]s and eleven [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]s, five [[Raphael]]s and several [[Correggio]]s.<ref>Watson, 160\u2013161; not all these attributions would hold today.</ref> [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' was among them.

The team brought their record to 23\u201359 and improved upon their record of 20\u201362 from the team's final season in Seattle. The late-season successes of the Thunder contributed to the signing of Scott Brooks as the team's official head coach.\n\nAfter moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle, the team's operating situation improved markedly.

Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the off-season, other than drafting [[James Harden (basketball)|James Harden]] from [[Arizona State University]] with the third overall pick in the [[2009 NBA draft|NBA Draft]]. The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]]. The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]]. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]]. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]s [[Russell Westbrook]] and [[James Harden]], were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009\u201310 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point blowout over the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Orlando Magic]] and a 16-point blowout of the reigning NBA champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games.\n\n{{multiple image\n | width1 = 144\n | image1 = Russell Westbrook.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Russell Westbrook]]\n | image2 = James Harden 2.jpg\n | width2 = 123\n | caption2 = [[James Harden]]\n | width3 = 93\n | image3 = Kevin Durant 2.jpg\n | caption3 = [[Kevin Durant]]\n | image4 = Serge_Ibaka_Feb_2014.jpg\n | width4 = 145\n | caption4 = [[Serge Ibaka]]\n | image5 = Kendrick_Perkins.jpg\n | caption5 = [[Kendrick Perkins]]\n | width5 = 123\n}}\n\nThe Thunder finished 50\u201332, more than doubling their win total from the previous season.

He missed 16 games, during which Oklahoma City went 4\u201312. During the middle of the season Westbrook and Durant both came back, and similarly suffered more injuries. Durant was ruled out of the rest of the season in March, deciding to have foot surgery. Westbrook also had to undergo surgery in early March, to repair a fracture in the zygomatic arch bone of his right cheek. Several days later he returned and recorded several triple-doubles on his way to Western Conference Player of the Month honors from February to April. He also won the 2014\u20132015 NBA scoring title.

The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]]. The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]]. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]]. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]s [[Russell Westbrook]] and [[James Harden]], were signs of the Thunder's improvement.

Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention.

In fact, Halloween is among the Western celebrations that the Russian government and politicians\u2014which have grown increasingly anti-Western in the early 2010s\u2014are trying to eliminate from public celebration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shuster|first1=Simon|title=Russian Region Wages War on Halloween|url=http://world.time.com/2013/10/31/halloween-extremist-says-russian-region-enacting-ban/|journal=Time|accessdate=24 October 2014|date=31 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Bennetts|first1=Marc|title=Nyet on Halloween: Russian church warns of 'dangers'; Siberia bans holiday|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/30/authorities-warn-russians-dangers-halloween/|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=Washington Times|date=30 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Russia: Activist calls for Halloween ban|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-29742511|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Spain===\n\nIn Spain, celebrations involve eating castanyes (roast [[chestnut]]s), [[panellet]]s (special almond balls covered in pine nuts), moniatos (roast or baked [[sweet potato]]), Ossos de Sant cake and preserved fruit ([[Candied fruit|candied]] or [[Glac\u00e9|glazed fruit]]).

It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]]s are produced by countries or organizations which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policymakers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.<ref>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7\u20139 December 2000, retrieved 14 November 2012</ref>\n\nMajor species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of species included on the Red List has been increasing over time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Thomas E.|author-link=Thomas Lovejoy|date=8 August 2017|title=Extinction tsunami can be avoided|journal=[[PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=32|pages=8840\u20138841|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711074114|pmc=5559057|pmid=28747527|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2019, of 105,000 species surveyed, 28,338 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular [[overfishing]], [[hunting]] and [[land development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5629548/almost-30000-species-face-extinction-new-report|title='The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]]s are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.<ref>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7\u20139 December 2000, retrieved 14 November 2012</ref>\n\nMajor species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of species included on the Red List has been increasing over time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Thomas E.|author-link=Thomas Lovejoy|date=8 August 2017|title=Extinction tsunami can be avoided|journal=[[PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=32|pages=8840\u20138841|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711074114|pmc=5559057|pmid=28747527|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2019, of 105,000 species surveyed, 28,338 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular [[overfishing]], [[hunting]] and [[land development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5629548/almost-30000-species-face-extinction-new-report|title='The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

Historically, some mine fires were started when [[bootleg mining]] was stopped by authorities, usually by blowing the mine up.  Many recent mine fires have started from people burning trash in a [[landfill]] that was in proximity to abandoned coal mines, including the much-publicized [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]], fire, which has been burning since 1962. Of the hundreds of mine fires in the United States burning today, most are found in the state of [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nSome fires along [[coal]] seams are natural occurrences. Some coals may [[spontaneous combustion|self-ignite]] at temperatures as low as 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) for brown coal in the right conditions of moisture and grain size.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The fire usually begins a few decimeters inside the coal at a depth in which the permeability of the coal allows the inflow of air but in which the ventilation does not remove the heat which is generated. Self-ignition was a recognised problem in steamship times and is claimed to have contributed to [[RMS Titanic alternative theories#Fire in coal bunker|the sinking of the Titanic]].  One well known source of fires is mining breaking into a high pressure cavity of methane gas which on release can generate a spark of static electricity to ignite the gas and start a coal explosion and fire.  The same gas static is well known in ships and care has to be taken to ensure no such static sparking can occur.\n\nTwo basic factors determine whether spontaneous combustion occurs or not, the ambient temperature and the grain size:\n\n* The higher the ambient temperature, the more quickly the oxidation reactions proceed.\n* The grain size and structure determine its surface area. Kinetics will be limited by availability of reactant, which in this case is carbon exposed to oxygen.\n\n[[Wildfire]]s (lightning-caused or others) can ignite the coal closer to the surface or entrance, and the [[smouldering]] fire can spread through the seam, creating subsidence that may open further seams to oxygen and spawn future wildfires when the fire breaks to the surface. Prehistoric [[Clinker (waste)|clinker]] outcrops in the American West are the result of prehistoric coal fires that left a residue that resists erosion better than the matrix, leaving [[butte]]s and [[mesa]]. It is estimated that Australia's [[Burning Mountain]], the oldest known coal fire, has burned for 6,000 years.<ref name=Krajick>{{cite news | first=Kevin | last=Krajick | title=Fire in the Hole |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2005/may/firehole.php | work=Smithsonian Magazine | pages=54ff | date=2005-05-01 | accessdate=2007-01-16 }}</ref>\n\nGlobally, thousands of inextinguishable mine fires are burning, especially in China where poverty, lack of government regulations and runaway development combine to create an environmental disaster. Modern [[strip mining]] exposes smoldering coal seams to the air, revitalizing the flames.\n\nRural Chinese in coal-bearing regions often dig coal for household use, abandoning the pits when they become unworkably deep, leaving highly combustible [[coal dust]] exposed to the air. Using [[satellite imagery]] to map China's coal fires resulted in the discovery of many previously unknown fires. The oldest coal fire in China is in [[Baijigou]] ([[:zh:\u767d\u82a8\u6c9f\u8857\u9053|\u767d\u82a8\u6c9f]], in [[Dawukou District]] of [[Shizuishan]] City, [[Ningxia]]) and is said to have been burning since the [[Qing Dynasty]] (before 1912).<ref name=Rennie>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1383465/How-Chinas-scramble-for-black-gold-is-causing-a-green-disaster.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=How China's scramble for 'black gold' is causing a green disaster   | first=David | last=Rennie | date=1 February 2002 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Detection==\n[[File:Brandspalte mit Ausbluehungen.jpg|thumb|right|The effect of underground coal fire visible on the surface]]\n\nBefore attempting to extinguish a near-surface coal seam fire, its location and underground extent should be determined as precisely as possible. Besides studying the geographic, geologic and infrastructural context, information can be gained from direct measurements. These include:\n* Temperature measurements of the land surface, in fissures and boreholes, for example using [[pyrometers]]\n* Gas measurements to characterize the fire ventilation system (amount and velocity) and the gas composition, so that the combustion reactions can be described\n* Geophysical measurements on the ground and from airplanes and helicopters to establish the extent of conductivity or other underground parameters. For example, conductivity measurements map humidity changes near the fire; measuring the magnetism can determine changes in the magnetic characteristics of the adjacent rock caused by heat\n* Remote sensing from aircraft and satellites. High resolution optical mapping, thermal imaging and hyperspectral data play a role. Underground coal fires of several hundred to over a thousand degrees Celsius may raise the surface temperature by only a few degrees. This order of magnitude is similar to the temperature difference between the sunlit and shadowed slopes of a slag heap or sand dune. Infrared detecting equipment is able to track the fire's location as the fire heats the ground on all sides of it.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=J. Zhang |author2=W. Wagner |author3=A.

These relay pressure, temperature, airflow and gas composition measurements to the safety monitoring personnel, giving them early warning of any problems.\n\n== Environmental impact ==\n[[File:Coal seam fire.png|upright=1.2|thumb|Coal seam fire]]\n[[File:FEMA - 7515 - Photograph by Bryan Dahlberg taken on 06-08-2002 in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Residents evacuate West Glenwood, [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]], 2002]]\n[[File:Burning mine near Denniston, New Zealand.JPG|right|thumb|A coal seam fire near [[Denniston, New Zealand]]]]\nBesides destruction of the affected areas, coal fires often emit toxic gases, including [[carbon monoxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]]. China's coal fires, which consume an estimated 20 \u2013 200 million tons of coal a year, make up as much as 1 percent of the global carbon dioxide emissions from [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref name=Krajick />\n\nOne of the most visible changes will be the effect of subsidence upon the landscape. Another local environmental effect can include the presence of plants or animals that are aided by the coal fire.  The prevalence of otherwise non-native plants can depend upon the fire's duration and the size of the affected area. For example, near a coal fire in Germany, many Mediterranean insects and spiders were identified in a region with cold winters, and it is believed that elevated ground temperatures above the fires permitted their survival.<ref>nabu-aachen-land.de: Bergehalden im Aachener Revier</ref>\n\n== Extinguishing coal fires ==\nIn order to thrive, a fire requires [[Fire triangle|fuel, oxygen, and heat]]. As underground fires are very difficult to reach directly, firefighting involves finding an appropriate methodology which addresses the interaction of fuel and oxygen for the specific fire in question. A fire can be isolated from its fuel source, for example through firebreaks or fireproof barriers. Many fires, particularly those on steep slopes, can be completely excavated. In the case of near-surface coal seam fires, the influx of oxygen in the air can be interrupted by covering the area or installing gas-tight barriers. Another possibility is to hinder the outflow of combustion gases so that the fire is quenched by its own exhaust fumes. Energy can be removed by cooling, usually by injecting large amounts of water. However, if any remaining dry coal absorbs water, the resulting heat of absorption can lead to re-ignition of a once-quenched fire as the area dries. Accordingly, more energy must be removed than the fire generates. In practice these methods are combined, and each case depends on the resources available. This is especially true for water, for example in arid regions, and for covering material, such as [[loess]] or clay, to prevent contact with the atmosphere.\n\nExtinguishing underground coal fires, which sometimes exceed temperatures of 540&nbsp;\u00b0C (1,000&nbsp;\u00b0F), is both highly dangerous and very expensive.<ref name=Krajick />\n\nNear-surface coal seam fires are routinely extinguished in China following a standard method basically consisting of the following phases:\n\n* Smoothing the surface above the fire with heavy equipment to make it fit for traffic.\n* Drilling holes in the fire zone about 20 m apart down to the source of the fire, following a regular grid.\n* Injecting water or mud in the boreholes long term, usually 1 to 2 years.\n* Covering the entire area with an impermeable layer about 1 m thick, e.g., of [[loess]].\n* Planting vegetation to the extent the climate allows.\n\nEfforts are underway to refine this method, for example with additives to the quenching water or with alternative extinguishing agents.\n\nUnderground coal seam fires are customarily quenched by inertization through [[mine rescue]] personnel. Toward this end the affected area is isolated by dam constructions in the galleries. Then an inert gas, usually nitrogen, is introduced for a period of time, usually making use of available pipelines.\n\nIn 2004, the Chinese government claimed success in extinguishing a mine fire at a [[colliery]] near [[Urumqi]] in China's [[Xinjiang]] province that had been burning since 1874.  However, a March 2008 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article quotes researcher Steven Q. Andrews as saying, \"I decided to go to see how it was extinguished, and flames were visible and the entire thing was still burning....

Only a minuscule fraction of the country has been surveyed for coal fires.<ref name=\"Whitehouse, Alfred 2004\"/> The best data available come from a study based on systematic, on-the-ground observation. In 1998, a total of 125 coal fires were located and mapped within a 2-kilometer strip either side of a 100-kilometer stretch of road north of Balikpapan to Samarinda in East Kalimantan, using hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment.

Historically, some mine fires were started when [[bootleg mining]] was stopped by authorities, usually by blowing the mine up.  Many recent mine fires have started from people burning trash in a [[landfill]] that was in proximity to abandoned coal mines, including the much-publicized [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]], fire, which has been burning since 1962. Of the hundreds of mine fires in the United States burning today, most are found in the state of [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nSome fires along [[coal]] seams are natural occurrences. Some coals may [[spontaneous combustion|self-ignite]] at temperatures as low as 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) for brown coal in the right conditions of moisture and grain size.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The fire usually begins a few decimeters inside the coal at a depth in which the permeability of the coal allows the inflow of air but in which the ventilation does not remove the heat which is generated. Self-ignition was a recognised problem in steamship times and is claimed to have contributed to [[RMS Titanic alternative theories#Fire in coal bunker|the sinking of the Titanic]].  One well known source of fires is mining breaking into a high pressure cavity of methane gas which on release can generate a spark of static electricity to ignite the gas and start a coal explosion and fire.  The same gas static is well known in ships and care has to be taken to ensure no such static sparking can occur.\n\nTwo basic factors determine whether spontaneous combustion occurs or not, the ambient temperature and the grain size:\n\n* The higher the ambient temperature, the more quickly the oxidation reactions proceed.\n* The grain size and structure determine its surface area. Kinetics will be limited by availability of reactant, which in this case is carbon exposed to oxygen.\n\n[[Wildfire]]s (lightning-caused or others) can ignite the coal closer to the surface or entrance, and the [[smouldering]] fire can spread through the seam, creating subsidence that may open further seams to oxygen and spawn future wildfires when the fire breaks to the surface. Prehistoric [[Clinker (waste)|clinker]] outcrops in the American West are the result of prehistoric coal fires that left a residue that resists erosion better than the matrix, leaving [[butte]]s and [[mesa]]. It is estimated that Australia's [[Burning Mountain]], the oldest known coal fire, has burned for 6,000 years.<ref name=Krajick>{{cite news | first=Kevin | last=Krajick | title=Fire in the Hole |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2005/may/firehole.php | work=Smithsonian Magazine | pages=54ff | date=2005-05-01 | accessdate=2007-01-16 }}</ref>\n\nGlobally, thousands of inextinguishable mine fires are burning, especially in China where poverty, lack of government regulations and runaway development combine to create an environmental disaster. Modern [[strip mining]] exposes smoldering coal seams to the air, revitalizing the flames.\n\nRural Chinese in coal-bearing regions often dig coal for household use, abandoning the pits when they become unworkably deep, leaving highly combustible [[coal dust]] exposed to the air. Using [[satellite imagery]] to map China's coal fires resulted in the discovery of many previously unknown fires. The oldest coal fire in China is in [[Baijigou]] ([[:zh:\u767d\u82a8\u6c9f\u8857\u9053|\u767d\u82a8\u6c9f]], in [[Dawukou District]] of [[Shizuishan]] City, [[Ningxia]]) and is said to have been burning since the [[Qing Dynasty]] (before 1912).<ref name=Rennie>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1383465/How-Chinas-scramble-for-black-gold-is-causing-a-green-disaster.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=How China's scramble for 'black gold' is causing a green disaster   | first=David | last=Rennie | date=1 February 2002 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Detection==\n[[File:Brandspalte mit Ausbluehungen.jpg|thumb|right|The effect of underground coal fire visible on the surface]]\n\nBefore attempting to extinguish a near-surface coal seam fire, its location and underground extent should be determined as precisely as possible. Besides studying the geographic, geologic and infrastructural context, information can be gained from direct measurements. These include:\n* Temperature measurements of the land surface, in fissures and boreholes, for example using [[pyrometers]]\n* Gas measurements to characterize the fire ventilation system (amount and velocity) and the gas composition, so that the combustion reactions can be described\n* Geophysical measurements on the ground and from airplanes and helicopters to establish the extent of conductivity or other underground parameters. For example, conductivity measurements map humidity changes near the fire; measuring the magnetism can determine changes in the magnetic characteristics of the adjacent rock caused by heat\n* Remote sensing from aircraft and satellites. High resolution optical mapping, thermal imaging and hyperspectral data play a role. Underground coal fires of several hundred to over a thousand degrees Celsius may raise the surface temperature by only a few degrees. This order of magnitude is similar to the temperature difference between the sunlit and shadowed slopes of a slag heap or sand dune. Infrared detecting equipment is able to track the fire's location as the fire heats the ground on all sides of it.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=J. Zhang |author2=W. Wagner |author3=A.

China's coal fires, which consume an estimated 20 \u2013 200 million tons of coal a year, make up as much as 1 percent of the global carbon dioxide emissions from [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref name=Krajick />\n\nOne of the most visible changes will be the effect of subsidence upon the landscape. Another local environmental effect can include the presence of plants or animals that are aided by the coal fire.  The prevalence of otherwise non-native plants can depend upon the fire's duration and the size of the affected area. For example, near a coal fire in Germany, many Mediterranean insects and spiders were identified in a region with cold winters, and it is believed that elevated ground temperatures above the fires permitted their survival.<ref>nabu-aachen-land.de: Bergehalden im Aachener Revier</ref>\n\n== Extinguishing coal fires ==\nIn order to thrive, a fire requires [[Fire triangle|fuel, oxygen, and heat]]. As underground fires are very difficult to reach directly, firefighting involves finding an appropriate methodology which addresses the interaction of fuel and oxygen for the specific fire in question. A fire can be isolated from its fuel source, for example through firebreaks or fireproof barriers. Many fires, particularly those on steep slopes, can be completely excavated. In the case of near-surface coal seam fires, the influx of oxygen in the air can be interrupted by covering the area or installing gas-tight barriers. Another possibility is to hinder the outflow of combustion gases so that the fire is quenched by its own exhaust fumes. Energy can be removed by cooling, usually by injecting large amounts of water. However, if any remaining dry coal absorbs water, the resulting heat of absorption can lead to re-ignition of a once-quenched fire as the area dries. Accordingly, more energy must be removed than the fire generates. In practice these methods are combined, and each case depends on the resources available. This is especially true for water, for example in arid regions, and for covering material, such as [[loess]] or clay, to prevent contact with the atmosphere.\n\nExtinguishing underground coal fires, which sometimes exceed temperatures of 540&nbsp;\u00b0C (1,000&nbsp;\u00b0F), is both highly dangerous and very expensive.<ref name=Krajick />\n\nNear-surface coal seam fires are routinely extinguished in China following a standard method basically consisting of the following phases:\n\n* Smoothing the surface above the fire with heavy equipment to make it fit for traffic.\n* Drilling holes in the fire zone about 20 m apart down to the source of the fire, following a regular grid.\n* Injecting water or mud in the boreholes long term, usually 1 to 2 years.\n* Covering the entire area with an impermeable layer about 1 m thick, e.g., of [[loess]].\n* Planting vegetation to the extent the climate allows.\n\nEfforts are underway to refine this method, for example with additives to the quenching water or with alternative extinguishing agents.\n\nUnderground coal seam fires are customarily quenched by inertization through [[mine rescue]] personnel. Toward this end the affected area is isolated by dam constructions in the galleries. Then an inert gas, usually nitrogen, is introduced for a period of time, usually making use of available pipelines.\n\nIn 2004, the Chinese government claimed success in extinguishing a mine fire at a [[colliery]] near [[Urumqi]] in China's [[Xinjiang]] province that had been burning since 1874.  However, a March 2008 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article quotes researcher Steven Q. Andrews as saying, \"I decided to go to see how it was extinguished, and flames were visible and the entire thing was still burning....

It has been estimated that some 10\u2013200 million tons of coal uselessly burn annually, and that the same amount again is made inaccessible to mining.<ref name=Rennie /> Coal fires extend over a belt across the entire [[north China]], whereby over one hundred major fire areas are listed, each of which contains many individual fire zones. They are concentrated in the provinces of [[Xinjiang]], [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Ningxia]]. Beside losses from burned and inaccessible coal, these fires contribute to [[air pollution]] and considerably increased levels of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and have thereby become a problem which has gained international attention.\n\n===Germany===\nIn Planitz, now a part of the city of [[Zwickau]], a coal seam that had been burning since 1476 could only be quenched in 1860.<ref name=\"Peschke1998\">{{cite book|last=Peschke|first=Norbert|title=Planitz im Wandel der Zeiten|trans-title=Planitz Through the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2MAnDi6a34C&pg=PA18|year=1998|publisher=Sutton Verlag GmbH|isbn=978-3-89702-016-0|page=18|language=German}}</ref><ref name=\"wasi_DerP\">{{cite web | title = Der Planitzer Erdbrand | trans-title = The coal seam fire of Planitz | work = WAS IST WAS | accessdate = 2016-10-03 | url = http://www.wasistwas.de/archiv-wissenschaft-details/der-planitzer-erdbrand.html | language = German }}</ref> In [[Dudweiler]] (Saarland) a coal seam fire ignited around 1668 and is still burning today.<ref name=\"mineralienatlas\">{{cite web | title = Das Naturdenkmal Brennender Berg bei Dudweiler | trans-title = The natural monument Burning Mountain in Dudweiler | language = German | work = Mineralienatlas | accessdate = 2016-10-03 | url = https://www.mineralienatlas.de/?l=3741 }}</ref> This so-called ''Burning Mountain'' (\"''[[Brennender Berg]]''\") soon became a tourist attraction and was even visited by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref name=\"fell_Goet\">{{cite web | title = Goethe | last = Fell | first = G\u00fcnter | accessdate = 2016-10-03 | url = http://www.fell-dudweiler.de/goethe.htm | language = German }}</ref> Also well-known is the so-called ''Stinksteinwand'' (''stinking stone wall'') in Schwalbenthal on the eastern slope of the [[Hoher Mei\u00dfner]], where several seams caught fire centuries ago after lignite coal mining ceased; combustion gas continues to reach the surface today.<ref name=\"gem_mei\">{{cite web | title = Der Berg Mei\u00dfner | author = Gemeinde Mei\u00dfner | accessdate = 2016-10-03 | url = http://www.gemeinde-meissner.de/verzeichnis/objekt.php?mandat=100619 | language =  German | quote = An der Stinksteinwand in der N\u00e4he des Gasthauses Schwalbenthal str\u00f6men im \u00dcbrigen seit 300 Jahren durch die Kl\u00fcfte des Basaltes die Gase eines schwelenden Kohlefl\u00f6zes aus. }}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn India, as of 2010, 68 fires were burning beneath a {{convert|58|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} region of the [[Jharia coalfield]] in [[Dhanbad|Dhanbad, Jharkhand]]. \nMine fires started in this region in 1916 and are rapidly destroying the only source of prime [[Coke (fuel)|coking coal]] in the country.<ref name=\"Burning Jharkhand\">{{cite web |url=http://www.agencevu.com/stories/index.php?id=90&p=30 |title=Mine fires (India) |accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Indonesia===\nCoal and peat fires in Indonesia are often ignited by forest fires\nnear outcrop deposits at the surface. It is difficult to determine when a forest fire is started by a coal seam fire, or vice versa, in the absence of eyewitnesses.<ref name=\"Whitehouse, Alfred 2004\"/> The most common cause of forest fires and haze in Indonesia is intentional burning of forest to clear land for plantation crops of pulp wood, rubber and palm oil.\n\nNo accurate count of coal seam fires has been completed in Indonesia. Only a minuscule fraction of the country has been surveyed for coal fires.<ref name=\"Whitehouse, Alfred 2004\"/> The best data available come from a study based on systematic, on-the-ground observation. In 1998, a total of 125 coal fires were located and mapped within a 2-kilometer strip either side of a 100-kilometer stretch of road north of Balikpapan to Samarinda in East Kalimantan, using hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. Extrapolating this data to areas on Borneo and Sumatra underlain by known coal deposits, it was estimated that more than 250,000 coal seam fires may have been burning in Indonesia in 1998.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLand clearing practices which use fire, often starting forest fires, may be the cause of coal seam fires in Indonesia. In 1982\u201383 one of the largest forest fires in this century raged for several months through an estimated 5 million hectares of Borneo's tropical rainforests. [[Johann Goldammer|Goldammer]] and [[Berthold Seibert|Seibert]] however concluded that there are indications that coal seam fires already occurred between 13,200 and 15,000 [[Before Present|BP]].<ref>Goldammer, J.G.; Seibert, B. (1989): ''Natural rain forest fires in Eastern Borneo during the Pleistocene and Holocene'', ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'', November 1989, Volume 76, Issue 11, p. 518-520</ref>\n\nA fire season usually occurs every 3\u20135 years, when the climate in parts of Indonesia becomes exceptionally dry from June to November due to the El Nino Southern Oscillation off the west coast of South America. Since 1982, fire has been a recurring feature on the Islands of Borneo and Sumatra, burning large areas in 1987, 1991, 1994, 1997\u201398, 2001 and 2004.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn October 2004 smoke from land clearing again covered substantial portions of Borneo and Sumatra, disrupting air travel,<ref>\"Haze disrupts flights in Central Kalimantan.\" 2004.

In mid-2010, according to OSM, more than 100 fires were burning beneath nine states, most of them in Colorado, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Utah and West Virginia. But geologists say many fires go unreported, so that the actual number of them is nearer to 200, across 21 states.<ref name=\"Deep underground\"/>\n\nIn Pennsylvania, 45 fire zones are known, the most famous being the [[Centralia mine fire]] in the [[Centralia, Pennsylvania|Centralia]] mine in the hard coal region of Columbia County, which has been burning since 1962.<ref name=\"Deep underground\"/>  Burning Mine, near [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania|Summit Hill]], caught fire in 1859.<ref>\"Summit Hill\", in ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia'' (1953), New York:  Viking.</ref>\n\nIn Colorado, coal fires have arisen as a consequence of fluctuations in the groundwater level, which can [[Heat of compression#Temperature|increase the temperature]] of the coal up to 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, enough to cause it to [[Spontaneous combustion|spontaneously ignite]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe [[Powder River Basin]] in Wyoming and Montana contains some 800 billion tons of brown coal, and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804 to 1806) reported fires there. Fires have been a natural occurrence in this area for about three million years and have shaped the landscape.
