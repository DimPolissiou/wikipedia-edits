The [[Turkic Khaganate]] dominated southern Siberia during the 1st millennium CE, while in the early 2nd millennium CE, the [[Mongol Empire]] and its [[Division of the Mongol Empire|successor states]] ruled the region. The [[Khanate of Sibir]] was one of the last independent [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] states in North Asia before its [[Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|conquest]] by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the 16th century CE. Russia would then gradually incorporate the region into its territory until the [[Convention of Peking]] was signed in 1860. After the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, the region was [[Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War|contested]] between the Bolsheviks and Whites until the [[Soviet Union]] asserted full control in 1923.

But Northwest Asia sometimes refers to [[Caucasus]] or nearby provinces.\n\n=== Geomorphology ===\n{{further|Geology of Russia|Geology of Asia}}\nThe geomorphology of Asia in general is imperfectly known, although the deposits and mountain ranges are well known.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nTo compensate for new [[sea floor]] having been created in the [[Siberian basin]], the whole of the [[Eurasian Plate|Asian Plate]] has pivoted about a point in the [[New Siberian Islands]], causing compression in the [[Verkhoyansk Range|Verkhoyansk mountains]], which were formed along the eastern margin of the Angara Shield by [[tectonic uplift]] during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]]. There is a southern boundary to this across the northern margin of the [[Alps|Alpine]] folds of Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan, which at the east of [[Brahmaputra]] turns to run south towards the [[Bay of Bengal]] along the line of the [[Naga hills]] and the [[Arakan Yoma]], continues around [[Indonesia]], and follows the edge of the [[continental shelf]] along the eastern seaboard of [[China]]. The [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]] meet across the neck of [[Alaska]], following the line of the [[Aleutian Trench]], rather than meeting at the [[Bering Straits]].<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nNorthern Asia is built around the Angara Shield, which lies between the [[Yenisey River]] and the [[Lena River]]. It developed from fragments of [[Laurasia]], whose rocks were mainly [[Precambrian]] crystalline rocks, [[gneiss]]es, and [[schist]]s, and [[Gondwana]]. These rocks can be found in the Angara Shield, the [[Inner Mongolian-Korean Shield]], the [[Ordes Shield]] and the [[Southeast Asia Shield]]. The fragments have been subject to [[orogenesis]] around their margins, giving a complex of plateaux and mountain ranges. One can find [[outcrop]]s of these rocks in unfolded sections of the Shields. Their presence has been confirmed below Mesozoic and later sediments.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nThere are three main periods of mountain building in Northern Asia, although it has occurred many times. The outer fold mountains, that are on the margins of the Shields and that only affected Asia north of the line of the [[Himalayas]], are attributed to the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian]] and [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian]] orogenies of the late [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic Era]]. The Alpine orogeny caused extensive folding and faulting of Mesozoic and early [[Tertiary]] sediments from the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] [[geosyncline]]. The Tibetan and Mongolian plateaux, and the structural basins of [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]], [[Qaidam]], and [[Junggar]], are delimited by major east\u2013west lithospheric faults that were probably the results of stresses caused by the impact of the [[Indian Plate]] against Laurasia. Erosion of the mountains caused by this orogeny has created a large amount of sediment, which has been transported southwards to produce the [[alluvial plain]]s of India, China, and Cambodia, and which has also been deposited in large amounts in the Tarim and [[Dzungarian Basin|Dzungarian]] basins.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\n{{physical map of Siberia|width=200}}\nNorthern Asia was [[glaciation|glaciated]] in the [[Pleistocene]], but this played a less significant part in the geology of the area compared to the part that it played in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. The Scandinavian ice sheet extended to the east of the Urals, covering the northern two thirds of the [[Ob Basin]] and extending onto the Angara Shield between the [[Yenisei River]] and the [[Lena River]]. There are legacies of mountain glaciation to be found on the east Siberian mountains, on the mountains of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], on the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]], on [[Tian Shan]], and on other small areas of mountains, [[ice cap]]s remain on the islands of [[Severnaya Zemlya]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]], and several [[Central Asia]]n mountains still have individual glaciers. North Asia itself has [[permafrost]], ranging in depths from 30 to 600 metres and covering an area of 9.6 million km\u00b2.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nSeveral of the mountainous regions are volcanic, with both the [[Koryak Mountains]] and the Kamchatka Peninsula having active [[volcano]]es. The [[Anadyr Plateau]] is formed from [[igneous rock]]s. The [[Mongolian Plateau]] has an area of [[basalt]]ic [[lava]]s and [[volcanic cone]]s.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nThe Angara Shield also underlies the lowlands of the [[Ob River]], but to the south and east in the Central Asian mountains and in the East Siberian mountains there are folded and faulted mountains of Lower Palaeozoic rocks.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{further|Demographics of Siberia|Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Demographics of the Russian Far East}}\nMost estimates are that there are around 33 million [[Russian nationality law|Russian citizens]] living east of the [[Ural Mountains]], a widely recognized but informal geographical divide between Europe and Asia.

The region is sometimes also known as '''Asian Russia''' (as opposed to the smaller but more densely populated [[European Russia]] to the west). North Asia is bordered to the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the west by [[Eastern Europe]], to the south by [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[East Asia]] and to the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[North America]]. North Asia covers an area of approximately {{Convert|13,100,000|km2|sqmi}} or 8.8% of the [[Earth|earth's]] land area, or 1.5 times the size of [[Brazil]]. It is the largest subregion of Asia by area, but is also the least populated, with an approximate total population of only 33 million people or 0.74% of Asia's population. North Asia is solely administrated by Russia, and makes up more than 75% of the territory of the country, but only 22% of its population, at a density of 2.5 people per km<sup>2</sup> (6.5 per sq mi).<ref name=\"Vishnevsky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/popdecline/vishnevsky.pdf|title=Replacement Migration: Is it a solution for Russia?|last=Vishnevsky|first=Anatoly|date=15 August 2000|publisher=United Nations Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs|pages=6, 10|accessdate=2008-01-14|work=EXPERT GROUP MEETING ON POLICY RESPONSES TO POPULATION AGEING AND POPULATION DECLINE /UN/POP/PRA/2000/14}}</ref> The region of [[Western Siberia]] and occasionally [[Kazakhstan]] is usually called '''Northwestern Asia''' or '''Northwest Asia''' ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f|lit=Severo-zapadnaya Aziya}}), although the name sometimes refers to [[Caucasus]] or nearby provinces.\n\nTopographically, the region is dominated by the [[Eurasian Plate]], except for its eastern part, which lies on the [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Amurian Plate|Amurian]] and [[Okhotsk Plate]]s. It is divided by three major plains: the [[West Siberian Plain]], [[Central Siberian Plateau]] and Verhoyansk-Chukotka collision zone. The [[Uralian orogeny]] in the west raised [[Ural Mountains]], the informal boundary between [[Europe]] and Asia. Tectonic and volcanic activities are frequently occurred in the eastern part of the region as part of the [[Ring of Fire]], evidenced by the formation of [[island arc]] such as [[Kuril Islands]] and ultra-prominent peaks such as [[Klyuchevskaya Sopka]], [[Kronotsky]] and [[Koryaksky]]. The central part of North Asia is a [[large igneous province]] called the [[Siberian Traps]], formed by a massive eruption occurred 250 million years ago.

The [[Turkic Khaganate]] dominated southern Siberia during the 1st millennium CE, while in the early 2nd millennium CE, the [[Mongol Empire]] and its [[Division of the Mongol Empire|successor states]] ruled the region. The [[Khanate of Sibir]] was one of the last independent [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] states in North Asia before its [[Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|conquest]] by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the 16th century CE.

But Northwest Asia sometimes refers to [[Caucasus]] or nearby provinces.\n\n=== Geomorphology ===\n{{further|Geology of Russia|Geology of Asia}}\nThe geomorphology of Asia in general is imperfectly known, although the deposits and mountain ranges are well known.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nTo compensate for new [[sea floor]] having been created in the [[Siberian basin]], the whole of the [[Eurasian Plate|Asian Plate]] has pivoted about a point in the [[New Siberian Islands]], causing compression in the [[Verkhoyansk Range|Verkhoyansk mountains]], which were formed along the eastern margin of the Angara Shield by [[tectonic uplift]] during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]]. There is a southern boundary to this across the northern margin of the [[Alps|Alpine]] folds of Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan, which at the east of [[Brahmaputra]] turns to run south towards the [[Bay of Bengal]] along the line of the [[Naga hills]] and the [[Arakan Yoma]], continues around [[Indonesia]], and follows the edge of the [[continental shelf]] along the eastern seaboard of [[China]]. The [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]] meet across the neck of [[Alaska]], following the line of the [[Aleutian Trench]], rather than meeting at the [[Bering Straits]].<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nNorthern Asia is built around the Angara Shield, which lies between the [[Yenisey River]] and the [[Lena River]]. It developed from fragments of [[Laurasia]], whose rocks were mainly [[Precambrian]] crystalline rocks, [[gneiss]]es, and [[schist]]s, and [[Gondwana]]. These rocks can be found in the Angara Shield, the [[Inner Mongolian-Korean Shield]], the [[Ordes Shield]] and the [[Southeast Asia Shield]]. The fragments have been subject to [[orogenesis]] around their margins, giving a complex of plateaux and mountain ranges. One can find [[outcrop]]s of these rocks in unfolded sections of the Shields. Their presence has been confirmed below Mesozoic and later sediments.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nThere are three main periods of mountain building in Northern Asia, although it has occurred many times. The outer fold mountains, that are on the margins of the Shields and that only affected Asia north of the line of the [[Himalayas]], are attributed to the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian]] and [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian]] orogenies of the late [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic Era]]. The Alpine orogeny caused extensive folding and faulting of Mesozoic and early [[Tertiary]] sediments from the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] [[geosyncline]]. The Tibetan and Mongolian plateaux, and the structural basins of [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]], [[Qaidam]], and [[Junggar]], are delimited by major east\u2013west lithospheric faults that were probably the results of stresses caused by the impact of the [[Indian Plate]] against Laurasia. Erosion of the mountains caused by this orogeny has created a large amount of sediment, which has been transported southwards to produce the [[alluvial plain]]s of India, China, and Cambodia, and which has also been deposited in large amounts in the Tarim and [[Dzungarian Basin|Dzungarian]] basins.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\n{{physical map of Siberia|width=200}}\nNorthern Asia was [[glaciation|glaciated]] in the [[Pleistocene]], but this played a less significant part in the geology of the area compared to the part that it played in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. The Scandinavian ice sheet extended to the east of the Urals, covering the northern two thirds of the [[Ob Basin]] and extending onto the Angara Shield between the [[Yenisei River]] and the [[Lena River]]. There are legacies of mountain glaciation to be found on the east Siberian mountains, on the mountains of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], on the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]], on [[Tian Shan]], and on other small areas of mountains, [[ice cap]]s remain on the islands of [[Severnaya Zemlya]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]], and several [[Central Asia]]n mountains still have individual glaciers. North Asia itself has [[permafrost]], ranging in depths from 30 to 600 metres and covering an area of 9.6 million km\u00b2.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nSeveral of the mountainous regions are volcanic, with both the [[Koryak Mountains]] and the Kamchatka Peninsula having active [[volcano]]es. The [[Anadyr Plateau]] is formed from [[igneous rock]]s. The [[Mongolian Plateau]] has an area of [[basalt]]ic [[lava]]s and [[volcanic cone]]s.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nThe Angara Shield also underlies the lowlands of the [[Ob River]], but to the south and east in the Central Asian mountains and in the East Siberian mountains there are folded and faulted mountains of Lower Palaeozoic rocks.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{further|Demographics of Siberia|Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Demographics of the Russian Far East}}\nMost estimates are that there are around 33 million [[Russian nationality law|Russian citizens]] living east of the [[Ural Mountains]], a widely recognized but informal geographical divide between Europe and Asia.

The final cost of the bridge was $70 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transportation.wv.gov/highways/bridge_facts/Modern-Bridges/Pages/VeteransMemorial(Weirton-Steubenville).aspx |title=Veterans Memorial Bridge (Weirton-Steubenville) |author= |date= |work=Bridge Facts - Modern Bridges |publisher=[[West Virginia Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Veterans Memorial Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The Veterans Memorial Bridge connects [[Weirton, West Virginia]] to [[Steubenville, Ohio]] across the [[Ohio River]] and is the border crossing between the states of West Virginia and Ohio on [[U.S. Highway 22]].]]\n\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons cat}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Crossings navbox\n|structure       = [[List of crossings of the Ohio River|Crossings]]\n|place           = [[Ohio River]]\n|bridge          = Veterans Memorial Bridge\n|bridge signs    = [[Image:US 22.svg|25px]]\n|upstream        = [[Newell Toll Bridge]]\n|upstream signs  =\n|downstream      = [[Steubenville Railroad Bridge]]\n|downstream signs =\n}}\n[[Category:Road bridges in West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Weirton, West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Steubenville, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Monuments and memorials in West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Monuments and memorials in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1990]]\n[[Category:Cable-stayed bridges in the United States]]\n[[Category:Bridges over the Ohio River]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Hancock County, West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Hancock County, West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jefferson County, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Jefferson County, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in Ohio]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 22]]\n[[Category:Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways]]\n[[Category:1990 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:1990 establishments in West Virginia]]\n\n\n{{Ohio-bridge-struct-stub}}\n{{WestVirginia-bridge-struct-stub}}\n", "name_user": "NamelessLameless", "label": "safe", "comment": "replaces to replaced", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Memorial_Bridge_(Steubenville,_Ohio)"}

The laboratory's remit was to conduct research and development regarding chemical weapons agents used by the British armed forces in the [[First World War]], such as [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]], and [[phosgene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C14396|title=War Office, Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Defence : Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment, later Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton: Reports and Technical Papers|format=5136 files and volumes |publisher=The National Archives|date=1918-1993|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nWork at Porton started in March 1916. At the time, only a few cottages and farm buildings were scattered on the downs at Porton and [[Idmiston]]. By May 1917, the focus for anti-gas defence and respirator development had moved from London to Porton Down, and by 1918, the original two huts had become a large hutted camp with 50 officers and 1,100 other ranks. After the [[Armistice]] in 1918, Porton Down was reduced to a skeleton staff.<ref name=\"carter\">{{cite book|title=Chemical and Biological Defence at Porton Down 1916-2000|last=Carter|first=G B|date=2000|location=London|publisher=The Stationery Office|pages=126\u2013127|isbn=0-11-772933-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Post First World War ===\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:PortonOfficialHistory.JPG|thumb|200px|'[[Chemical and Biological Defence at Porton Down, 1916-2000]]' by [[G.B.

By 1920, the Cabinet agreed to the Committee's recommendation that work would continue at Porton Down. From that date a slow permanent building programme began, coupled with the gradual recruitment of civilian scientists. By 1922, there were 380 servicemen, 23 scientific and technical civil servants, and 25 \"civilian subordinates\". By 1925, the civilian staff had doubled.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nBy 1926, the chemical defence aspects of Air Raid Precautions (ARP) for the civilian population was added to the Station's responsibilities. In 1929 the Royal Engineers Experimental Station became the Chemical Warfare Experimental Station (CWES) (1929\u20131930), and in 1930 the Chemical Defence Experimental Station (CDES) (1930\u20131948).<ref name=\"carter\" />\nIn 1930 Britain ratified the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] with reservations, which permitted the use of chemical warfare agents only in retaliation. By 1938, the international situation was such that the Cabinet authorised offensive chemical warfare research and development and the production of war reserve stocks of chemical warfare agents by the chemical industry.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\n=== Second World War ===\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:PortonDownOrdnanceSurveyMap.JPG|thumb|200px|An Ordnance Survey map of 'Dstl, Porton Down' and its surrounding 'Danger Areas' as of 12 April 2007.

As [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies penetrated Germany, they discovered operational stockpiles of munitions and weapons that contained new chemical warfare agents, including highly toxic organophosphorous [[nerve agent]]s such as [[sarin]], unknown to Britain and the Allies at the time.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nTo examine biological weapons, a highly secret separate department, called the Biology Department, Porton (BDP), was established within CDES in 1940, under veteran microbiologist [[Paul Fildes]]. Its focus included [[anthrax]] and [[botulinum toxin]], and in 1942 it famously carried out tests of an anthrax bio-weapon at [[Gruinard Island]]. In 1946, it was renamed the Microbiological Research Department (MRD) and, in 1957, the Microbiological Research Establishment (MRE). \n\nThe [[Common Cold Unit]] (CCU) was sometimes confused with the MRE, with which it occasionally collaborated but was not officially connected. The CCU was located at Harvard Hospital, Harnham Down, on the west side of [[Salisbury]].<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\n=== Post-war period ===\n\nWhen the Second World War ended, the advanced state of German technology regarding the organophosphorous nerve agents, such as [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], [[sarin]] and [[soman]], had surprised the Allies, who were eager to capitalise on it. Subsequent research took the newly discovered German nerve agents as a starting point, and eventually [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] nerve agent was developed at Porton Down in 1952.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, research and development at Porton Down was aimed at providing Britain with the means to arm itself with a modern nerve agent-based capability and to develop specific means of defence against these agents. In the end these aims came to nothing on the offensive side because of the decision to abandon any sort of British chemical warfare capability in favour of nuclear weapons. On the defensive side there were years of difficult work to develop the means of prophylaxis, therapy, rapid detection and identification, decontamination, and more effective protection of the body against nerve agents, capable of exerting effects through the skin, the eyes and respiratory tract.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nTests were carried out on servicemen to determine the effects of nerve agents on human subjects, with one recorded death due to a nerve gas experiment. There have been persistent allegations of unethical [[human experimentation]] at Porton Down, such as those relating to the death of Leading Aircraftman [[Ronald Maddison]], aged 20, in 1953. Maddison was taking part in sarin nerve agent toxicity tests; sarin was dripped onto his arm and he died shortly afterwards. \n\nIn the 1950s, the station, now renamed the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment (CDEE), became involved with the development of [[CS gas|CS]], a riot-control agent, and took an increasing role in trauma and [[wound ballistics]] work. Both these facets of Porton Down's work had become more important because of the unrest and increasing violence in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"carter\" /> \n\nOn 1 August 1962, Geoffrey Bacon, a scientist at the Microbiological Research Establishment, died from an accidental infection of the plague bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. In the same month an [[autoclave]] exploded, shattering two windows. Both incidents generated considerable media coverage at the time.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nIn 1970, the senior establishment at Porton Down was renamed the Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) for the next 21 years.

The site switched to producing [[Adamsite]] in 1922. In 1923 the War Office halted the requisition and purchased the site, renaming it the War Office Research Establishment, a.k.a. Chemical Warfare Research Establishment, and later the Chemical Defence Research Establishment Sutton Oak. During the 1920s, the site switched to producing [[Mustard Gas|mustard gas]] products, starting with the HS variant and adding the HT variant in the 1930s, and also filling armaments. After WW2, the site also produced the [[nerve agent]] [[sarin]] for experimental purposes.

It was intended as a stockpile and production facility for the UK's chemical defences during the [[Cold War]], focussed on nerve agents, including small amounts of [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] intended mainly for laboratory test purposes and to validate plant designs and optimise chemical processes for potential mass-production; full-scale production of VX agent never took place. In the late 1950s, the chemical weapons production plant was mothballed, but was maintained through the 1960s and 1970s in a state whereby production could easily re-commence if required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk:80/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/Nancekuke/|title=Nancekuke Remediation Project|publisher=Ministry of Defence (Archived by The National Archives)|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101208174527/http://www.mod.uk:80/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/Nancekuke/|archive-date=8 December 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Non-government use ==\nA few small scientific start-ups were allowed to use buildings on the Porton Down campus from the mid-1990s.

In 1981, a team of activists landed on the island and collected soil samples, a bag of which was left at the door at Porton Down. Testing showed that it still contained anthrax spores and in 1986 the Government felt obliged to take necessary steps to successfully decontaminate the island.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1975 the MRE carried out [[Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments|trials in Lyme Bay]] in which live bacteria were sprayed from a ship to be carried ashore by the wind to simulate an anthrax attack. The bacteria sprayed were the less dangerous ''[[Bacillus globigii]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', but it was later admitted that the bacteria could adversely affect some vulnerable people. The town of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] lay downwind of the spraying. When the trials became public knowledge in the late 1990s, [[Dorset County Council]], [[Weymouth and Portland Borough Council]] and [[Purbeck District Council]] demanded a [[public inquiry]] to investigate the experiments. The Government refused a Public Inquiry but instead commissioned Professor Brian Spratt, to conduct an Independent Review of the possible adverse health effects. He concluded that individuals with certain chronic conditions may have been affected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nr23.net/govt/spray_dorset.htm|title=The Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments 1963-75|accessdate= 17 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Human trials ====\n[[File:Rmaddison.jpg|thumb|Leading Aircraftman Ronald Maddison who died an unlawful death at Porton Down in 1953, as determined by a jury in 2004]] Porton Down has been involved in human testing at various points throughout the Ministry of Defence's use of the site.

By 1920, the Cabinet agreed to the Committee's recommendation that work would continue at Porton Down. From that date a slow permanent building programme began, coupled with the gradual recruitment of civilian scientists. By 1922, there were 380 servicemen, 23 scientific and technical civil servants, and 25 \"civilian subordinates\". By 1925, the civilian staff had doubled.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nBy 1926, the chemical defence aspects of Air Raid Precautions (ARP) for the civilian population was added to the Station's responsibilities. In 1929 the Royal Engineers Experimental Station became the Chemical Warfare Experimental Station (CWES) (1929\u20131930), and in 1930 the Chemical Defence Experimental Station (CDES) (1930\u20131948).<ref name=\"carter\" />\nIn 1930 Britain ratified the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] with reservations, which permitted the use of chemical warfare agents only in retaliation.

As [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies penetrated Germany, they discovered operational stockpiles of munitions and weapons that contained new chemical warfare agents, including highly toxic organophosphorous [[nerve agent]]s such as [[sarin]], unknown to Britain and the Allies at the time.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nTo examine biological weapons, a highly secret separate department, called the Biology Department, Porton (BDP), was established within CDES in 1940, under veteran microbiologist [[Paul Fildes]]. Its focus included [[anthrax]] and [[botulinum toxin]], and in 1942 it famously carried out tests of an anthrax bio-weapon at [[Gruinard Island]]. In 1946, it was renamed the Microbiological Research Department (MRD) and, in 1957, the Microbiological Research Establishment (MRE). \n\nThe [[Common Cold Unit]] (CCU) was sometimes confused with the MRE, with which it occasionally collaborated but was not officially connected. The CCU was located at Harvard Hospital, Harnham Down, on the west side of [[Salisbury]].<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\n=== Post-war period ===\n\nWhen the Second World War ended, the advanced state of German technology regarding the organophosphorous nerve agents, such as [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], [[sarin]] and [[soman]], had surprised the Allies, who were eager to capitalise on it. Subsequent research took the newly discovered German nerve agents as a starting point, and eventually [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] nerve agent was developed at Porton Down in 1952.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, research and development at Porton Down was aimed at providing Britain with the means to arm itself with a modern nerve agent-based capability and to develop specific means of defence against these agents. In the end these aims came to nothing on the offensive side because of the decision to abandon any sort of British chemical warfare capability in favour of nuclear weapons. On the defensive side there were years of difficult work to develop the means of prophylaxis, therapy, rapid detection and identification, decontamination, and more effective protection of the body against nerve agents, capable of exerting effects through the skin, the eyes and respiratory tract.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nTests were carried out on servicemen to determine the effects of nerve agents on human subjects, with one recorded death due to a nerve gas experiment. There have been persistent allegations of unethical [[human experimentation]] at Porton Down, such as those relating to the death of Leading Aircraftman [[Ronald Maddison]], aged 20, in 1953. Maddison was taking part in sarin nerve agent toxicity tests; sarin was dripped onto his arm and he died shortly afterwards. \n\nIn the 1950s, the station, now renamed the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment (CDEE), became involved with the development of [[CS gas|CS]], a riot-control agent, and took an increasing role in trauma and [[wound ballistics]] work. Both these facets of Porton Down's work had become more important because of the unrest and increasing violence in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"carter\" /> \n\nOn 1 August 1962, Geoffrey Bacon, a scientist at the Microbiological Research Establishment, died from an accidental infection of the plague bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. In the same month an [[autoclave]] exploded, shattering two windows. Both incidents generated considerable media coverage at the time.<ref name=\"carter\" />\n\nIn 1970, the senior establishment at Porton Down was renamed the Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) for the next 21 years. Preoccupation with defence against nerve agents continued, but in the 1970s and 1980s, the Establishment was also concerned with studying reported chemical warfare by Iraq against Iran and against its own [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population.<ref name=\"carter\" /> \n\nPorton Down was the laboratory where initial samples of the [[Ebola]] virus were sent in 1976 during the first confirmed outbreak of the disease in Africa. The laboratory now contains samples of some of the world's most aggressive pathogens, including Ebola, anthrax and the plague, and is leading the UK's current research into viral inoculations.<ref>{{cite web|title=The front line of the UK's Ebola prevention efforts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28773174|website=BBC News|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nUntil 2001 the military installation of Porton Down was part of the UK government's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA) when it was split into [[QinetiQ]], initially a fully government-owned company, and the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] (Dstl).

Chemical Warfare Research Establishment, and later the Chemical Defence Research Establishment Sutton Oak. During the 1920s, the site switched to producing [[Mustard Gas|mustard gas]] products, starting with the HS variant and adding the HT variant in the 1930s, and also filling armaments. After WW2, the site also produced the [[nerve agent]] [[sarin]] for experimental purposes.

It was intended as a stockpile and production facility for the UK's chemical defences during the [[Cold War]], focussed on nerve agents, including small amounts of [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] intended mainly for laboratory test purposes and to validate plant designs and optimise chemical processes for potential mass-production; full-scale production of VX agent never took place. In the late 1950s, the chemical weapons production plant was mothballed, but was maintained through the 1960s and 1970s in a state whereby production could easily re-commence if required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk:80/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/Nancekuke/|title=Nancekuke Remediation Project|publisher=Ministry of Defence (Archived by The National Archives)|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101208174527/http://www.mod.uk:80/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/Nancekuke/|archive-date=8 December 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Non-government use ==\nA few small scientific start-ups were allowed to use buildings on the Porton Down campus from the mid-1990s.

In 1981, a team of activists landed on the island and collected soil samples, a bag of which was left at the door at Porton Down. Testing showed that it still contained anthrax spores and in 1986 the Government felt obliged to take necessary steps to successfully decontaminate the island.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1975 the MRE carried out [[Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments|trials in Lyme Bay]] in which live bacteria were sprayed from a ship to be carried ashore by the wind to simulate an anthrax attack. The bacteria sprayed were the less dangerous ''[[Bacillus globigii]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', but it was later admitted that the bacteria could adversely affect some vulnerable people. The town of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] lay downwind of the spraying. When the trials became public knowledge in the late 1990s, [[Dorset County Council]], [[Weymouth and Portland Borough Council]] and [[Purbeck District Council]] demanded a [[public inquiry]] to investigate the experiments. The Government refused a Public Inquiry but instead commissioned Professor Brian Spratt, to conduct an Independent Review of the possible adverse health effects.

Dstl's Biomedical Sciences department is involved with drug evaluation and efficacy testing (toxicology, pharmacology, physiology, behavioural science, human science), trauma and surgery studies, and animal breeding. The Physical Sciences department also uses animals in its \"Armour Physics\" research.\n\nLike other aspects of research at Porton Down, precise details of animal experiments are generally kept secret. Media reports have suggested they include exposing monkeys to [[anthrax]], draining the blood of pigs and injecting them with ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacteria, and exposing animals to a variety of lethal, toxic nerve agents. Different animals are used for very different purposes. According to a 2002 report from the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Defence, mice are used mainly to research \"the development of vaccines and treatments for microbial and viral infections\", while pigs are used to \"develop personal protective equipment to protect against blast injury to the thorax\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F4AAE7BE-9D64-4FB5-A41F-481807F4DB21/0/awac6threport.pdf |title=Sixth Report of the Animal Welfare Advistory Committee|date=February 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503133310/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F4AAE7BE-9D64-4FB5-A41F-481807F4DB21/0/awac6threport.pdf |archivedate=3 May 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{in popular culture|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Novels ===\n* An institute similar to Porton Down, the Mordon Microbiological Research Establishment, features in the 1962 novel [[The Satan Bug (novel)|''The Satan Bug'']] by [[Alistair MacLean]].\n* Porton Down features in the 1977 novel [[The Enemy (Bagley novel)|''The Enemy'']] by [[Desmond Bagley]], and the 2010 mystery novel ''Before the Poison'' by [[Peter Robinson (novelist)|Peter Robinson]].\n\n===Television===\n*Porton Down and activities there during the 1940s and early 1950s were a significant plot point in Episodes One and Two of the second season of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s mystery series ''[[The Bletchley Circle]]''.\n\n===Comics===\n*''[[Grimbledon Down]]'' was a [[comic strip]] by British cartoonist [[Bill Tidy]], published for many years by ''[[New Scientist]]''.

However, the season was marred by injuries, particularly in defense, with [[Ledley King]], [[Paul Stalteri]], [[Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto]], [[Lee Young-pyo]], [[Anthony Gardner]], [[Jermaine Jenas]], [[Steed Malbranque]] and [[Teemu Tainio]] all suffering long-term injuries, while [[Didier Zokora]], [[Dimitar Berbatov]], [[Robbie Keane]] and [[Aaron Lennon]] all suffered short-term injuries during the season, causing Martin Jol to rarely have a settled first XI to pick for extended periods.\n\nTottenham's Premiership form in the first half of the season was erratic, although there was a famous home win over reigning champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in November amongst the mire of mediocre results. Away form was poor during the first half of the season, but a vast improvement in the second half saw just two away losses from January to the end of the season, including one (narrow) defeat in their final six away games, against Chelsea, just 36 hours after playing a UEFA Cup tie in Spain. The improvement in Spurs' away form, good home performances and an excellent end to the season lifted Spurs into fifth position in the final table and UEFA Cup qualification for the second year running. Tottenham played attractive and effective football as Martin Jol made his mark on the squad, reaching the FA Cup quarter-final before losing 1\u20132 to Chelsea having drawn 3\u20133 away, and the League Cup semi-finals, where they were knocked out by Arsenal after drawing 2\u20132 at home and losing 3\u20131 away in extra time.

season]] was '''[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]''''s 15th season in the '''[[Premier League]]''' and 29th successive season in the top division of the [[English football league system]].\n\n==Season summary==\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}\nExpectations were high at the beginning of the season, after only a bout of food poisoning amongst the squad prevented Spurs from pipping arch-rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to fourth place in the Premiership and [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification at the end of the previous season. However, the season was marred by injuries, particularly in defense, with [[Ledley King]], [[Paul Stalteri]], [[Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto]], [[Lee Young-pyo]], [[Anthony Gardner]], [[Jermaine Jenas]], [[Steed Malbranque]] and [[Teemu Tainio]] all suffering long-term injuries, while [[Didier Zokora]], [[Dimitar Berbatov]], [[Robbie Keane]] and [[Aaron Lennon]] all suffered short-term injuries during the season, causing Martin Jol to rarely have a settled first XI to pick for extended periods.\n\nTottenham's Premiership form in the first half of the season was erratic, although there was a famous home win over reigning champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in November amongst the mire of mediocre results. Away form was poor during the first half of the season, but a vast improvement in the second half saw just two away losses from January to the end of the season, including one (narrow) defeat in their final six away games, against Chelsea, just 36 hours after playing a UEFA Cup tie in Spain. The improvement in Spurs' away form, good home performances and an excellent end to the season lifted Spurs into fifth position in the final table and UEFA Cup qualification for the second year running. Tottenham played attractive and effective football as Martin Jol made his mark on the squad, reaching the FA Cup quarter-final before losing 1\u20132 to Chelsea having drawn 3\u20133 away, and the League Cup semi-finals, where they were knocked out by Arsenal after drawing 2\u20132 at home and losing 3\u20131 away in extra time. In the UEFA Cup, Tottenham progressed to the quarter-finals, where they faced holders and eventual winners [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the quarter-finals, eliminated from the competition 4\u20133 on aggregate.\n\nOn 17 March 2007, [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]] became only the third goalkeeper in Premiership history to score a goal, following his 80-yard lob in the 3\u20131 victory over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].\n\nThe highly effective Dimitar Berbatov\u2013Robbie Keane strike partnership was rewarded when they were named joint Player of the Month for April.\n\n==Transfers==\n\n===In===\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|- bgcolor=AAD0FF\n!width=20% |Date\n!width=25% |Player\n!width=30% |Previous club\n!width=20% |Cost\n|-\n| June 2006||{{flagicon|CMR}} [[Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto]]||{{flagicon|FRA}} [[RC Lens|Lens]]||\u00a33,500,000\n|-\n| July 2006||{{flagicon|CIV}} [[Didier Zokora]]||{{flagicon|FRA}} [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]||\u00a38,600,000\n|-\n| July 2006||{{flagicon|BUL}} [[Dimitar Berbatov]]||{{flagicon|GER}} [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]]||\u00a310,900,000\n|-\n| July 2006||{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pekhart]]||{{flagicon|CZE}} [[SK Slavia Prague|Slavia Prague]]||Free\n|-\n| July 2006||{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Dorian Dervite]]||{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Lille OSC|Lille]]|| Undisclosed\n|-\n| August 2006||{{flagicon|EGY}} [[Mido (footballer)|Mido]]||{{flagicon|ITA}} [[A.S.
