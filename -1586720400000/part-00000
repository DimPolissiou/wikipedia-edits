Samhain played in more of a [[deathrock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]-infused style of [[horror punk]] than Danzig's previous band. Glenn Danzig originally planned Samhain as a [[side project]] with Eerie Von.<ref name=\"blankmaninc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blankmaninc.com/eerie-von-interview|title=Eerie Von Interview - BLANKMANinc|date=15 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> After his earlier group, the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], contentiously dissolved, Samhain became his full-time band. Samhain is the least-celebrated of Danzig's major musical outlets and catalogs a transitional period in his musical career, bridging the gap between the [[punk rock]] of the Misfits and the dark, [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] and [[blues]]-influenced sound of [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]]. Both Samhain and its successor, Danzig, use the same horned skull image originally drawn by artist [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]] for the cover of the 1984 comic book ''[[The Saga of Crystar]]'' No.&nbsp;8, published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The font often used in the name logo of Samhain, and later Danzig, is taken from the film ''[[The Giant Gila Monster]]''.\n\nDanzig took the name of the band from the ancient Celtic New Year: [[Samhain]], the origin of the modern [[Halloween]]. The band's name is typically pronounced \"sam-hane\", though when the word occurs in song lyrics, Danzig himself pronounces it \"sah-win\", in conformity with the generally accepted pronunciation of the eponymous ancient holiday.\n\nSamhain's lyrics were much darker than those of the Misfits, with themes rooted in [[paganism]] and the [[occult]] and eventually the horrors of reality, as opposed to the sometimes cartoonish ghouls and ghosts of the Misfits.<ref name=\"PennyBlood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblood.com/danzig.html|title=Glenn Danzig - Horror Business|last=Cipollini|first=Christian|publisher=Penny Blood|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref> Samhain's musical style was a dark, gritty, and experimental combination of [[punk rock|punk]], [[gothic rock]], and on the last album, [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]].\n\nSamhain released two full-length albums and one [[Extended play|EP]] during their three-year career as an active band. \nDanzig has said that he wrote two songs (\"Death Comes Ripping\" and \"Bloodfeast\") with the intention of using them on the first Samhain album, but instead recorded them with the Misfits for the ''[[Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood]]'' album in order to round out that band's final series of recordings and release a full album.<ref name=\"PennyBlood\" />\n\n==History==\n===Original run (1983\u20131990)===\nSamhain's debut album, [[Initium]] was released on lead singer [[Glenn Danzig]]'s independent record label, [[Plan 9 (record label)|Plan 9]] in August 1984. In various interviews Danzig states that the album's title, which translates from Latin to English as \"beginning\", represents his new start after disbanding his prior band, [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], in 1983. Most of the final track, \"Archangel\", was actually recorded in March 1981, and was originally meant to either be a Misfits song featuring [[Dave Vanian]] (who never did vocals for the song) or a track for the band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]]. The track \"[[Horror Business|Horror Biz]]\" likewise dates to Danzig's Misfits era, as it is a new version of \"Horror Business\" with different musical arrangements. The album was recorded at Reel Platinum studio in Lodi, New Jersey, excluding the introduction which was recorded at Eerie Von's home on a four track cassette.<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\">{{cite web|url=http://misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=sarticle&f=forced.84|title=Samhain Interview|author=Byron Coley and Jimmy Johnson|date=October 27, 1984|publisher=Forced Exposure|accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Samhain released their only EP, [[Unholy Passion]]. That next year, they released their second studio album titled [[Samhain III: November-Coming-Fire]]. The album contains a re-recorded version of the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]' \"Halloween II\". [[AllMusic]] wrote that the album \"continues to be an influence for both punk and [[thrash metal|thrash]] bands\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|title= Samhain: November-Coming-Fire |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/november-coming-fire-mw0000271998|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The track \"Mother of Mercy\" was featured in the 2009 video game ''[[Guitar Hero: Metallica]]''.\n[[Metallica]] co-founder James Hetfield lists ''November-Coming-Fire'' as one of his top ten albums of all time.\n\nIn 1986, Samhain was signed by [[Rick Rubin]] to his [[American Recordings (record label)|Def American]] label. Rubin at first wished only to sign Danzig. He hoped to assemble a \"super-group\" with the talented vocalist at the center, but Danzig refused to agree to the deal unless bassist [[Eerie Von]] could remain in the new group.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blush|first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Blush |date=1997|title=Glenn Danzig|url=http://misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=marticle&f=seconds.97|work=[[Seconds (magazine)|Seconds]]|accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref> Rubin and Danzig agreed, however, that the band's sound should be taken in a different direction, and so guitarist Damien was replaced by [[John Christ]]. Sometime in 1987, Danzig decided to change the name of Samhain to match his surname, Danzig, a move that would prevent him from ever again having to start anew, regardless of lineup changes. When [[London May]] was replaced with [[Chuck Biscuits]] on drums, Samhain officially ceased to exist, and the first Danzig lineup was complete.<ref name=\"2014reunion\"/>\n\nIn 1990, Samhain's final album, ''[[Final Descent (album)|Final Descent]]'', was released. Material for the album was completed in stages from 1986 to 1990, with one song (\"Death...In Its Arms\") recorded by the band Danzig, including drummer [[Chuck Biscuits]] (who had never been a member of Samhain) during the sessions for ''[[Danzig II: Lucifuge]]''. On all other tracks, a drum machine was used. As much of the material for ''[[Final Descent (album)|Final Descent]]'' was intended for a planned ''Samhain Grim'' album, its sound and songwriting bridges the gap between 1986's ''[[November-Coming-Fire|November Coming Fire]]'' and 1988's ''[[Danzig (album)|Danzig]]''. In its first pressings, ''[[Final Descent (album)|Final Descent]]'' also featured new remixed versions of the then out-of-print ''[[Unholy Passion]]'' EP. Possibly to avoid potential legal disputes with former guitarist Damien, Danzig had [[overdubbing|overdubbed]]/re-recorded all of the original guitar tracks with his own guitar playing. He also created a new track, a remix of the bass and vocal tracks from \"I Am Misery\", entitled \"Misery Tomb\".\n\n===Reunions (1999\u20132014)===\nSamhain briefly reunited in November 1999 to celebrate the release of the [[Box Set (Samhain)|Box Set]]. They went on one national tour with the band Danzig headlining. The lineup consisted of Danzig, Zing, May, and then Danzig guitarist [[Todd Youth]]. Damien was initially asked to play guitar, but couldn't as he was already on tour with [[Iggy Pop]]. In interviews Danzig said that co-founder [[Eerie Von]] was not asked to participate because he had slandered former members of the band\u2014notwithstanding Von's stand that he wouldn't have taken part in the reunion without Damien.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Danzig had since stated that the band would not tour again.\n\nSamhain would reunite again in October 2011 and 2012 as part of a series of shows called the Danzig Legacy performances. The shows consisted of a set from Danzig, Samhain, and a set of Misfits songs with [[Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein]]. Both London May and Steve Zing were part of this reunion.\n\nSamhain reunited for the fourth time to play [[Riot Fest]] in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/05/13/riot-fest-breaks-out-in-toronto-chicago-denver-in-september/9062525/|title=Riot Fest breaks out in Toronto, Chicago and Denver|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> At that show, they played their debut album ''[[Initium]]'' in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/slayer-janes-addiction-samhain-the-offspring-to-perform-entire-albums-at-chicagos-riot-fest/|title=SLAYER, JANE'S ADDICTION, SAMHAIN, THE OFFSPRING To Perform Entire Albums At Chicago's RIOT FEST|date=15 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> The band also played a series of West Coast and East Coast shows from September to November.<ref name=\"2014reunion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/55389/samhain-announces-more-dates|title=Samhain announces more dates|last=Gentile|first=John|publisher=Punknews.org|date=2010-07-17|accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref> Peter Adams of the bands Baroness and Valkyrie handled guitar duties.\n\nA partial reunion took place in 2014 on the ''Danzig Legacy'' television special during a set of Samhain songs \"Samhain\", and \"To Walk The Night\". The lineup remained the same with London May and Steve Zing sharing Bass and Drum duties, and with [[Tommy Victor]] playing guitar.\n\n== Live shows ==\nSometimes Danzig could be seen donning a bizarre horned leather [[Master/slave (BDSM)|S&M]] mask, and occasionally he and his bandmates went onstage covered in blood.<ref name=\"Samhain Live 85-86\">{{cite video|title=Samhain Live 85-86|date=September 5, 2000|medium=Videotape|publisher=E-Magine Records}}</ref> Danzig would play guitar on live performances of the song \"Archangel\", while the regular guitarist strapped on a bass guitar to perform a second bass line.<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/>\n\nWhen the Samhain [[Box Set (Samhain)|Box Set]] was released in 2000, these remixes were given a CD of their own, taking the place of the original ''[[Unholy Passion]]'' EP, while the backend of ''[[Final Descent (album)|Final Descent]]'' was filled out with four unreleased ''Samhain Grim'' era tracks, all featuring [[London May]] on drums. Among these were earlier, more abrasive arrangements of the eventual Danzig classics \"Twist of Cain\" and \"Possession\", a cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[Trouble (Elvis Presley song)|Trouble]]\" (later re-recorded for the Danzig EP''[[Thrall: Demonsweatlive]]''), and a faster version of \"Lords of the Left Hand\".\n\n==Musicians==\n\n===Members===\n*[[Glenn Danzig]] \u2013 vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums {{small|(1983-1987, 1999, 2011-2012, 2014)}}\n*[[Eerie Von]] \u2013 bass, drums {{small|(1983-1987)}}\n*[[London May]] \u2013 drums, bass {{small|(1985-1987, 1999, 2011-2012, 2014)}}\n*[[Pete \"Damien\" Marshall]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(1984-1986)}}\n*[[Steve Zing]] \u2013 drums, bass {{small|(1983-1985, 1999, 2011-2012, 2014)}}\n*[[John Christ]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(1987)}}\n*[[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] \u2013 bass <small>(1983)</small><ref>{{cite book |last1=Rettman |first1=Tony |title=Straight Edge A Clear-Headed Hardcore Punk History |date=14 November 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Lyle Preslar]] \u2013 guitar <small>(1983)</small><ref>{{cite web |title=MINOR THREAT Reunion Is 'A Non-Story,' Says Bassist BRIAN BAKER |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/minor-threat-reunion-is-a-non-story-says-bassist-brian-baker/ |website=[[Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Touring musicians===\n*[[Todd Youth]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(1999)}}\n*[[Tommy Victor]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(2011-2012, 2014)}}\n*[[Valkyrie (band)|Peter Adams]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(2014)}}\n\n===Session musicians===\n*[[Al Pike]] \u2013 bass {{small|(1983)}}\n*[[Lyle Preslar]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(1984)}}\n*[[Chuck Biscuits]] \u2013 drums {{small|(1990)}}\n\n==Discography==\n*''[[Initium]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Unholy Passion EP]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Samhain III: November-Coming-Fire]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Final Descent (album)|Final Descent]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Box Set (Samhain)|Box Set]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Samhain Live '85-'86]]'' (2001)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Samhain}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Samhain}}\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Hardcore punk groups from New Jersey]]\n[[Category:American deathrock groups]]\n[[Category:Horror punk groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from New Jersey]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the American rock band||Samhain (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n|name            = Samhain\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: |image = Samhain_Group.JPG -->\n|caption        = \n|background      = group_or_band\n|origin          = \n|image           = Danzig Getaway Rock Festival 2011.jpg\n|genre           = [[Deathrock]], [[horror punk]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], [[gothic rock]]\n|Instruments     = [[Guitar]], [[vocals]], [[bass guitar|bass]], [[drumkit|drums]]\n|years_active    = 1983&ndash;1987 <small>(changed their name to [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]]) (Partial reunions: 1999, 2011, 2012, 2014 [30 years of ''Initium'' shows and Danzig Legacy TV Special])</small>\n|label           = [[Plan 9 Records|Plan 9]], [[Caroline Records (U.S.)|Caroline]]\n|associated_acts = [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[Son of Sam (band)|Son of Sam]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Bad Religion]]\n|website             = \n|current_members =\n|past_members    = <!--Do not change.

Both Samhain and its successor, Danzig, use the same horned skull image originally drawn by artist [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]] for the cover of the 1984 comic book ''[[The Saga of Crystar]]'' No.&nbsp;8, published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The font often used in the name logo of Samhain, and later Danzig, is taken from the film ''[[The Giant Gila Monster]]''.\n\nDanzig took the name of the band from the ancient Celtic New Year: [[Samhain]], the origin of the modern [[Halloween]]. The band's name is typically pronounced \"sam-hane\", though when the word occurs in song lyrics, Danzig himself pronounces it \"sah-win\", in conformity with the generally accepted pronunciation of the eponymous ancient holiday.\n\nSamhain's lyrics were much darker than those of the Misfits, with themes rooted in [[paganism]] and the [[occult]] and eventually the horrors of reality, as opposed to the sometimes cartoonish ghouls and ghosts of the Misfits.<ref name=\"PennyBlood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblood.com/danzig.html|title=Glenn Danzig - Horror Business|last=Cipollini|first=Christian|publisher=Penny Blood|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref> Samhain's musical style was a dark, gritty, and experimental combination of [[punk rock|punk]], [[gothic rock]], and on the last album, [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]].\n\nSamhain released two full-length albums and one [[Extended play|EP]] during their three-year career as an active band. \nDanzig has said that he wrote two songs (\"Death Comes Ripping\" and \"Bloodfeast\") with the intention of using them on the first Samhain album, but instead recorded them with the Misfits for the ''[[Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood]]'' album in order to round out that band's final series of recordings and release a full album.<ref name=\"PennyBlood\" />\n\n==History==\n===Original run (1983\u20131990)===\nSamhain's debut album, [[Initium]] was released on lead singer [[Glenn Danzig]]'s independent record label, [[Plan 9 (record label)|Plan 9]] in August 1984. In various interviews Danzig states that the album's title, which translates from Latin to English as \"beginning\", represents his new start after disbanding his prior band, [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], in 1983. Most of the final track, \"Archangel\", was actually recorded in March 1981, and was originally meant to either be a Misfits song featuring [[Dave Vanian]] (who never did vocals for the song) or a track for the band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]]. The track \"[[Horror Business|Horror Biz]]\" likewise dates to Danzig's Misfits era, as it is a new version of \"Horror Business\" with different musical arrangements. The album was recorded at Reel Platinum studio in Lodi, New Jersey, excluding the introduction which was recorded at Eerie Von's home on a four track cassette.<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\">{{cite web|url=http://misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=sarticle&f=forced.84|title=Samhain Interview|author=Byron Coley and Jimmy Johnson|date=October 27, 1984|publisher=Forced Exposure|accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Samhain released their only EP, [[Unholy Passion]]. That next year, they released their second studio album titled [[Samhain III: November-Coming-Fire]]. The album contains a re-recorded version of the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]' \"Halloween II\". [[AllMusic]] wrote that the album \"continues to be an influence for both punk and [[thrash metal|thrash]] bands\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|title= Samhain: November-Coming-Fire |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/november-coming-fire-mw0000271998|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The track \"Mother of Mercy\" was featured in the 2009 video game ''[[Guitar Hero: Metallica]]''.\n[[Metallica]] co-founder James Hetfield lists ''November-Coming-Fire'' as one of his top ten albums of all time.\n\nIn 1986, Samhain was signed by [[Rick Rubin]] to his [[American Recordings (record label)|Def American]] label. Rubin at first wished only to sign Danzig. He hoped to assemble a \"super-group\" with the talented vocalist at the center, but Danzig refused to agree to the deal unless bassist [[Eerie Von]] could remain in the new group.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blush|first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Blush |date=1997|title=Glenn Danzig|url=http://misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=marticle&f=seconds.97|work=[[Seconds (magazine)|Seconds]]|accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref> Rubin and Danzig agreed, however, that the band's sound should be taken in a different direction, and so guitarist Damien was replaced by [[John Christ]]. Sometime in 1987, Danzig decided to change the name of Samhain to match his surname, Danzig, a move that would prevent him from ever again having to start anew, regardless of lineup changes. When [[London May]] was replaced with [[Chuck Biscuits]] on drums, Samhain officially ceased to exist, and the first Danzig lineup was complete.<ref name=\"2014reunion\"/>\n\nIn 1990, Samhain's final album, ''[[Final Descent]]'', was released. Material for the album was completed in stages from 1986 to 1990, with one song (\"Death...In Its Arms\") recorded by the band Danzig, including drummer [[Chuck Biscuits]] (who had never been a member of Samhain) during the sessions for ''[[Danzig II: Lucifuge]]''. On all other tracks, a drum machine was used. As much of the material for ''[[Final Descent]]'' was intended for a planned ''Samhain Grim'' album, its sound and songwriting bridges the gap between 1986's ''[[November-Coming-Fire|November Coming Fire]]'' and 1988's ''[[Danzig (album)|Danzig]]''. In its first pressings, ''[[Final Descent]]'' also featured new remixed versions of the then out-of-print ''[[Unholy Passion]]'' EP. Possibly to avoid potential legal disputes with former guitarist Damien, Danzig had [[overdubbing|overdubbed]]/re-recorded all of the original guitar tracks with his own guitar playing. He also created a new track, a remix of the bass and vocal tracks from \"I Am Misery\", entitled \"Misery Tomb\".\n\n===Reunions (1999\u20132014)===\nSamhain briefly reunited in November 1999 to celebrate the release of the [[Box Set (Samhain)|Box Set]]. They went on one national tour with the band Danzig headlining. The lineup consisted of Danzig, Zing, May, and then Danzig guitarist [[Todd Youth]]. Damien was initially asked to play guitar, but couldn't as he was already on tour with [[Iggy Pop]]. In interviews Danzig said that co-founder [[Eerie Von]] was not asked to participate because he had slandered former members of the band\u2014notwithstanding Von's stand that he wouldn't have taken part in the reunion without Damien.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Danzig had since stated that the band would not tour again.\n\nSamhain would reunite again in October 2011 and 2012 as part of a series of shows called the Danzig Legacy performances. The shows consisted of a set from Danzig, Samhain, and a set of Misfits songs with [[Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein]]. Both London May and Steve Zing were part of this reunion.\n\nSamhain reunited for the fourth time to play [[Riot Fest]] in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/05/13/riot-fest-breaks-out-in-toronto-chicago-denver-in-september/9062525/|title=Riot Fest breaks out in Toronto, Chicago and Denver|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> At that show, they played their debut album ''[[Initium]]'' in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/slayer-janes-addiction-samhain-the-offspring-to-perform-entire-albums-at-chicagos-riot-fest/|title=SLAYER, JANE'S ADDICTION, SAMHAIN, THE OFFSPRING To Perform Entire Albums At Chicago's RIOT FEST|date=15 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> The band also played a series of West Coast and East Coast shows from September to November.<ref name=\"2014reunion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/55389/samhain-announces-more-dates|title=Samhain announces more dates|last=Gentile|first=John|publisher=Punknews.org|date=2010-07-17|accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref> Peter Adams of the bands Baroness and Valkyrie handled guitar duties.\n\nA partial reunion took place in 2014 on the ''Danzig Legacy'' television special during a set of Samhain songs \"Samhain\", and \"To Walk The Night\". The lineup remained the same with London May and Steve Zing sharing Bass and Drum duties, and with [[Tommy Victor]] playing guitar.\n\n== Live shows ==\nSometimes Danzig could be seen donning a bizarre horned leather [[Master/slave (BDSM)|S&M]] mask, and occasionally he and his bandmates went onstage covered in blood.<ref name=\"Samhain Live 85-86\">{{cite video|title=Samhain Live 85-86|date=September 5, 2000|medium=Videotape|publisher=E-Magine Records}}</ref> Danzig would play guitar on live performances of the song \"Archangel\", while the regular guitarist strapped on a bass guitar to perform a second bass line.<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/>\n\nWhen the Samhain [[Box Set (Samhain)|Box Set]] was released in 2000, these remixes were given a CD of their own, taking the place of the original ''[[Unholy Passion]]'' EP, while the backend of ''[[Final Descent]]'' was filled out with four unreleased ''Samhain Grim'' era tracks, all featuring [[London May]] on drums. Among these were earlier, more abrasive arrangements of the eventual Danzig classics \"Twist of Cain\" and \"Possession\", a cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[Trouble (Elvis Presley song)|Trouble]]\" (later re-recorded for the Danzig EP''[[Thrall: Demonsweatlive]]''), and a faster version of \"Lords of the Left Hand\".\n\n==Musicians==\n\n===Members===\n*[[Glenn Danzig]] \u2013 vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums {{small|(1983-1987, 1999, 2011-2012, 2014)}}\n*[[Eerie Von]] \u2013 bass, drums {{small|(1983-1987)}}\n*[[London May]] \u2013 drums, bass {{small|(1985-1987, 1999, 2011-2012, 2014)}}\n*[[Pete \"Damien\" Marshall]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(1984-1986)}}\n*[[Steve Zing]] \u2013 drums, bass {{small|(1983-1985, 1999, 2011-2012, 2014)}}\n*[[John Christ]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(1987)}}\n*[[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] \u2013 bass <small>(1983)</small><ref>{{cite book |last1=Rettman |first1=Tony |title=Straight Edge A Clear-Headed Hardcore Punk History |date=14 November 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Lyle Preslar]] \u2013 guitar <small>(1983)</small><ref>{{cite web |title=MINOR THREAT Reunion Is 'A Non-Story,' Says Bassist BRIAN BAKER |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/minor-threat-reunion-is-a-non-story-says-bassist-brian-baker/ |website=[[Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Touring musicians===\n*[[Todd Youth]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(1999)}}\n*[[Tommy Victor]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(2011-2012, 2014)}}\n*[[Valkyrie (band)|Peter Adams]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(2014)}}\n\n===Session musicians===\n*[[Al Pike]] \u2013 bass {{small|(1983)}}\n*[[Lyle Preslar]] \u2013 guitar {{small|(1984)}}\n*[[Chuck Biscuits]] \u2013 drums {{small|(1990)}}\n\n==Discography==\n*''[[Initium]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Unholy Passion EP]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Samhain III: November-Coming-Fire]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Final Descent]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Box Set (Samhain)|Box Set]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Samhain Live '85-'86]]'' (2001)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Samhain}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Samhain}}\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Hardcore punk groups from New Jersey]]\n[[Category:American deathrock groups]]\n[[Category:Horror punk groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from New Jersey]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Final Descent", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain_(band)"}

The first premiered as '''''Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada''''' on [[Televisi\u00f3n Independiente de M\u00e9xico]] on October 14, 1970, after a two-year span of this sketch being part of the '''''S\u00e1bados de la Fortuna/S\u00e1bados con Neftal\u00ed/Carrousel con Neftal\u00ed''''' show, aired in the same channel, since October 1968, during the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]; the independent series adopted the ''Chespirito y La Mesa Cuadrada'' and later the ''Chespirito'' title in 1971, and aired until February 1973. The second series, which aired on the TIM's successor, [[Televisa]], premiered on 4 February 1980 and aired until 25 September 1995.\n\nAlongside Bola\u00f1os, other famous Mexican actors starred in the sketches. In the two periods, characters like ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]'', ''[[El Chapul\u00edn Colorado]]'', Los Caquitos, Dr. Chapat\u00edn, Los Chifladitos, El Ciudadano G\u00f3mez, La Chicharra, Chespirito (character), Los Chiripiojos and the parodies of [[The Tramp|Chaplin]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]] starred in sketches 2\u201315 minutes long. The 1980-1995 period also featured special 40-minute episodes, even consisting of two or three 40-minute long parts.\n\nThe show's first seasons featured a canned [[laugh track]], but Bola\u00f1os made the then-controversial decision to drop it, in 1982, after the departure of Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s. From 1982 to 1985, most presentations of the show include the announcer's warning that, out of respect for the audience's intelligence, there was no [[laugh track]].\n\n==History==\n\n===First period (1968\u20131973)===\n\nIn 1968, [[Chespirito|Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os]] created and starred in a segment named ''Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada'', in the show ''S\u00e1bados de la Fortuna'' of [[Televisi\u00f3n Independiente de M\u00e9xico]]'s [[XEQ-TV|XHTM-TV]] channel 8. The segment eventually became a separate show of its own due to its success. In this show, Chespirito read \"letters\" sent by the show's audience, most of which made fun of current events. Alongside him, [[Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s]], [[Rub\u00e9n Aguirre]], An\u00edbal de Mar (who left the cast after a short time), and Barbara Ramson (who was later replaced by [[Mar\u00eda Antonieta de las Nieves]]) also starred in the show, not only about the \"letters\", but also playing characters in other sketches eventually created by Bola\u00f1os. ''Los Supergenios'' was presented by Dr. Chespirito Chapat\u00edn (Bola\u00f1os), El Ingeniebrio Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s Tirado Alanis (Vald\u00e9s), El Profesor Rub\u00e9n Aguire Jirafales (Aguirre), Anibal and a \u201csecretary\u201d first played by Barbara Ramson and later replaced by La Mococha Pechocha, or, La Marioneta (played by Ma. Antonieta, who also went on to read the letters upon Anibal de Mar\u2019s departure) at a square table where they read the letters and comment about them. Sometimes the letters were answered by sketches. In one sketch, a viewer of the show asked what to do when a crazed person put a giant rock in the door of his house, then a sketch starring Mar\u00eda Antonieta de las Nieves, Rub\u00e9n Aguirre and Ram\u00f3n Valdes showed the solution to his problem.\n\nIn 1970, [[Carlos Villagr\u00e1n]] and [[Florinda Meza]] were added to the show\u2019s cast, playing secondary characters. In the same year, Bola\u00f1os decided to end the run of the \u2018supergenios\u2019 sketch and rename the show as Chespirito, and created the successful sketches of [[El Chapul\u00edn Colorado]] and Los Caquitos to replace it. From then on the sketches featured in the show were ''El Chapul\u00edn Colorado'', ''Dr. Chapat\u00edn'', ''Los Caquitos'', ''Chespirito'' and ''Los Chifladitos''.\n\nIn 1971, [[Rub\u00e9n Aguirre]] left the cast of Chespirito to host another show ''El Club de Shory'' in a rival network; ''El Shory'' was a nickname of Aguirre. Bola\u00f1os then created his most successful character, [[El Chavo del Ocho]], to fill in the void left by the sketch ''Los Chifladitos'', starring Bola\u00f1os and Aguirre, that had to be eliminated when Aguirre left.\n\nBy 1972, the show was almost entirely made of ''El Chavo'' and ''El Chapul\u00edn''. Then Bola\u00f1os decided to end the ''Chespirito'' show to star in the half-hour weekly series of ''El Chavo del Ocho'', ''El Chapulin Colorado'', and also a short lived series called Ciudadano Gomez, a parody of Citizen Kane. Aguirre returned to the show in the last episodes of Chespirito. That same year, channel 8 Television Independiente de Mexico was acquired by rival network Telesistema Mexicano and the new company resulting from the merger was renamed as Televisa. Then Bola\u00f1os\u2019 shows were all moved to Televisa\u2019s channel 2 and El chavo del Ocho was renamed simply as El Chavo (though the original name was still constantly repeated by the characters in every episode of the series).\n\n===Second period (1980\u20131995)===\n\nAfter the end of the half-hour series of [[El Chavo del Ocho]] and [[El Chapul\u00edn Colorado]] in 1979, as well as the flop of ''La Chicharra'', Bola\u00f1os decided to return the successful [[sketch comedy]] format of ''Los Supergenios'' in 1980 with the second version of the ''Chespirito'' show. The show featured the famous characters of Chespirito in a 60-minute show, ''El Chavo'', ''El Chapul\u00edn'', ''Ch\u00f3mpiras'' (a reboot of Los Caquitos), ''Los Chifladitos'', ''Vicente Chamb\u00f3n'' (reboot of La Chicharra), and the late introduction of ''Don Calavera'' in 1994, alongside the remake of ''El Ciudadano G\u00f3mez''. The parodies of [[The Tramp|Chaplin]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]] were also introduced in 1980.\n\n[[Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s]] returned to the show in 1981, playing only Don Ram\u00f3n in ''El Chavo'' and Super Sam and the villains in ''El Chapul\u00edn''. He also acted in other sketches with secondary characters (with the exception of ''Vicente Chamb\u00f3n'' and ''Laurel and Hardy''). Vald\u00e9s left the show in late 1981 for unknown reasons and went on to star in a couple of shows along with Carlos Villagran (some rumors say he left due to [[Stomach cancer|illness]], others say he could no longer get along with Florinda Meza). In 1981, [[Benny Ibarra]] starred in some sketches as a secondary character.\n\nIn 1982, [[Benny Ibarra]] returned playing a secondary character in the sketch \"Los Piratas\" of ''El Chapul\u00edn'' and \"Sr. Hurtado\" in ''El Chavo''. [[Raul Padilla|Raul \"Chato\" Padilla]] returned to the show after to substitute for Vald\u00e9s. The character \"Jaimito, el cartero\", of ''El Chavo'', became \"Se\u00f1or Jaimito\" and started living in the vecindad. His character got all the characteristics of Don Ram\u00f3n, a change which was heavily criticized by fans.\n\nIn 1984, [[Roberto G\u00f3mez Fern\u00e1ndez]], Bola\u00f1os' son, became another member of the cast.\n\nIn 1986, Roberto G\u00f3mez Fern\u00e1ndez and his uncle, [[Horacio G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os]], became directors of the show. Horacio now starred only as God\u00ednez in ''El Chavo'', as well as secondary characters in other sketches.\n\nIn 1987, various guest actors played secondary characters in sketches of the show. Also, ''El Chavo'' and ''El Chapul\u00edn'' became less important to the show. The same happened to the other characters, and with Bola\u00f1os giving attention to the sketch ''Ch\u00f3mpiras'', the sketch virtually became a half-hour series inside the show.\n\nOn August 9, 1988, [[Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s]] died of [[stomach cancer]], after a long agony in the hospital. Bola\u00f1os was the only friend of Vald\u00e9s who didn't attend the funeral. [[Carlos Villagr\u00e1n]], [[Edgar Vivar]], [[Rub\u00e9n Aguirre]] and [[Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez]] were some of his friends from ''El Chavo'' who attended the funeral. [[Mar\u00eda Antonieta de las Nieves]] became very worried of not knowing of his condition in his last moments of life, and sad not to have been able to attend his funeral, due to her being on tour in Peru at the time of his death (Peru was also where she had last seen him a year before).\n\nIn 1991, [[Florinda Meza]] left the show to star the [[telenovela]] [[Milagro y magia]]. After the end of the telenovela, she returned to the cast of the show. [[Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez]] left the show at the end of the year due to her lung cancer.\n\nIn 1992, Bola\u00f1os ended the sketches of ''El Chavo'', since he was too old to play the role of an 8-year-old boy. Also, [[Edgar Vivar]] left the show temporarily because of his [[obesity]].\n\nIn 1993, the sketch of ''El Chapul\u00edn Colorado'' ended.\n\nIn 1994, the sketch ''El Ciudadano G\u00f3mez'', parody of [[Citizen Kane]] returned to ''Dr. Chapat\u00edn'', ''Ch\u00f3mpiras'' and ''Los Chifladitos'' in the show. [[Raul Padilla|Raul \"Chato\" Padilla]] left the show, passing away in February 3 of that year. On March 25, [[Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez]] also died of [[lung cancer]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0273390/bio|title=Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-06-28}}</ref> Angelines was an acknowledged [[tobacco]] smoker.\n\nIn September 1995, [[Televisa]] decided to eliminate all comedy and sitcom shows airing on weeknights at 8 o\u2019clock and use that timeslot for more telenovelas (Mexican soap operas), while offering to transfer only the Chespirito comedy show and Silvia Pinal\u2019s TV show to a timeslot on weekends. Because of this, Bola\u00f1os preferred to end the 15-year-old ''Chespirito'' show.\n\n==After the show==\n\nRoberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os and Florinda Meza continued for some years the theater play ''11 y 12'' (also created and produced by Bola\u00f1os), which became very successful in [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]].\n\nIn 1997, the show was dubbed in Portuguese, especially to [[Brazil]], renamed ''Clube do Chaves''.\n\nOn November 21, 1999, Horacio G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os (younger brother of Roberto) died of a [[heart attack]].\n\nOn November 19, 2004, Roberto married Florinda Meza after dating for a long time.\n\nIn 2006, an animated series featuring the characters of El Chavo premiered. It ran for several seasons until 2014.\n\nIn 2007, the channel ''Cl\u00e1sico TV'' reran \"Chespirito\" episodes dating from 1980 to 1995. The series finale was broadcast in July 2012. In October 2012 the channel was renamed [[Distrito Comedia]]. The series was transmitted on the weekends (2007\u20132011) and Monday to Friday (2011\u2013present).\n\nIn 2008, the channel ''Cl\u00e1sico TV'' returned with ''Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada'', the first period of the ''Chespirito'' show, which was transmitted on Wednesdays. The series finale was broadcast in 2009.\n \nOn November 28, 2014, Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os passed away at age 85.\n\nIn 2015, an animated series featuring El Chapulin Colorado premiered.\n\n==Aperture==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The first premiered as '''''Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada''''' on [[Televisi\u00f3n Independiente de M\u00e9xico]] on October 14, 1970, after a two-year span of this sketch being part of the '''''S\u00e1bados de la Fortuna/S\u00e1bados con Neftal\u00ed/Carrousel con Neftal\u00ed''''' show, aired in the same channel, since October 1968, during the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]; the independent series adopted the ''Chespirito y La Mesa Cuadrada'' and later the ''Chespirito'' title in 1971, and aired until February 1973. The second series, which aired on the TIM's successor, [[Televisa]], premiered on 4 February 1980 and aired until 25 September 1995.\n\nAlongside Bola\u00f1os, other famous Mexican actors starred in the sketches. In the two periods, characters like ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]'', ''[[El Chapul\u00edn Colorado]]'', Los Caquitos, Dr. Chapat\u00edn, Los Chifladitos, El Ciudadano G\u00f3mez, La Chicharra, Chespirito (character), Los Chiripiojos and the parodies of [[The Tramp|Chaplin]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]] starred in sketches 2\u201315 minutes long. The 1980-1995 period also featured special 40-minute episodes, even consisting of two or three 40-minute long parts.\n\nThe show's first seasons featured a canned [[laugh track]], but Bola\u00f1os made the then-controversial decision to drop it, in 1982, after the departure of Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s. From 1982 to 1985, most presentations of the show include the announcer's warning that, out of respect for the audience's intelligence, there was no [[laugh track]].\n\n==History==\n\n===First period (1968\u20131973)===\n\nIn 1968, [[Chespirito|Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os]] created and starred in a segment named ''Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada'', in the show ''S\u00e1bados de la Fortuna'' of [[Televisi\u00f3n Independiente de M\u00e9xico]]'s [[XEQ-TV|XHTM-TV]] channel 8. The segment eventually became a separate show of its own due to its success. In this show, Chespirito read \"letters\" sent by the show's audience, most of which made fun of current events. Alongside him, [[Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s]], [[Rub\u00e9n Aguirre]], An\u00edbal de Mar (who left the cast after a short time), and Barbara Ramson (who was later replaced by [[Mar\u00eda Antonieta de las Nieves]]) also starred in the show, not only about the \"letters\", but also playing characters in other sketches eventually created by Bola\u00f1os. ''Los Supergenios'' was presented by Dr. Chespirito Chapat\u00edn (Bola\u00f1os), El Ingeniebrio Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s Tirado Alanis (Vald\u00e9s), El Profesor Rub\u00e9n Aguire Jirafales (Aguirre), Anibal and a \u201csecretary\u201d first played by Barbara Ramson and later replaced by La Mococha Pechocha, or, La Marioneta (played by Ma. Antonieta, who also went on to read the letters upon Anibal de Mar\u2019s departure) at a square table where they read the letters and comment about them. Sometimes the letters were answered by sketches. In one sketch, a viewer of the show asked what to do when a crazed person put a giant rock in the door of his house, then a sketch starring Mar\u00eda Antonieta de las Nieves, Rub\u00e9n Aguirre and Ram\u00f3n Valdes showed the solution to his problem.\n\nIn 1970, [[Carlos Villagr\u00e1n]] and [[Florinda Meza]] were added to the show\u2019s cast, playing secondary characters. In the same year, Bola\u00f1os decided to end the run of the \u2018supergenios\u2019 sketch and rename the show as Chespirito, and created the successful sketches of [[El Chapul\u00edn Colorado]] and Los Caquitos to replace it. From then on the sketches featured in the show were ''El Chapul\u00edn Colorado'', ''Dr. Chapat\u00edn'', ''Los Caquitos'', ''Chespirito'' and ''Los Chifladitos''.\n\nIn 1971, [[Rub\u00e9n Aguirre]] left the cast of Chespirito to host another show ''El Club de Shory'' in a rival network; ''El Shory'' was a nickname of Aguirre. Bola\u00f1os then created his most successful character, [[El Chavo del Ocho]], to fill in the void left by the sketch ''Los Chifladitos'', starring Bola\u00f1os and Aguirre, that had to be eliminated when Aguirre left.\n\nBy 1972, the show was almost entirely made of ''El Chavo'' and ''El Chapul\u00edn''. Then Bola\u00f1os decided to end the ''Chespirito'' show to star in the half-hour weekly series of ''El Chavo del Ocho'', ''El Chapulin Colorado'', and also a short lived series called Ciudadano Gomez, a parody of Citizen Kane. Aguirre returned to the show in the last episodes of Chespirito. That same year, channel 8 Television Independiente de Mexico was acquired by rival network Telesistema Mexicano and the new company resulting from the merger was renamed as Televisa. Then Bola\u00f1os\u2019 shows were all moved to Televisa\u2019s channel 2 and El chavo del Ocho was renamed simply as El Chavo (though the original name was still constantly repeated by the characters in every episode of the series).\n\n===Second period (1980\u20131995)===\n\nAfter the end of the half-hour series of [[El Chavo del Ocho]] and [[El Chapul\u00edn Colorado]] in 1979, as well as the flop of ''La Chicharra'', Bola\u00f1os decided to return the successful [[sketch comedy]] format of ''Los Supergenios'' in 1980 with the second version of the ''Chespirito'' show. The show featured the famous characters of Chespirito in a 60-minute show, ''El Chavo'', ''El Chapul\u00edn'', ''Ch\u00f3mpiras'' (a reboot of Los Caquitos), ''Los Chifladitos'', ''Vicente Chamb\u00f3n'' (reboot of La Chicharra), and the late introduction of ''Don Calavera'' in 1994, alongside the remake of ''El Ciudadano G\u00f3mez''. The parodies of [[The Tramp|Chaplin]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]] were also introduced in 1980.\n\n[[Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s]] returned to the show in 1981, playing only Don Ram\u00f3n in ''El Chavo'' and Super Sam and the villains in ''El Chapul\u00edn''. He also acted in other sketches with secondary characters (with the exception of ''Vicente Chamb\u00f3n'' and ''Laurel and Hardy''). Vald\u00e9s left the show in late 1981 for unknown reasons and went on to star in a couple of shows along with Carlos Villagran (some rumors say he left due to [[Stomach cancer|illness]], others say he could no longer get along with Florinda Meza). In 1981, [[Benny Ibarra]] starred in some sketches as a secondary character.\n\nIn 1982, [[Benny Ibarra]] returned playing a secondary character in the sketch \"Los Piratas\" of ''El Chapul\u00edn'' and \"Sr. Hurtado\" in ''El Chavo''. [[Raul Padilla|Raul \"Chato\" Padilla]] returned to the show after to substitute for Vald\u00e9s. The character \"Jaimito, el cartero\", of ''El Chavo'', became \"Se\u00f1or Jaimito\" and started living in the vecindad. His character got all the characteristics of Don Ram\u00f3n, a change which was heavily criticized by fans.\n\nIn 1984, [[Roberto G\u00f3mez Fern\u00e1ndez]], Bola\u00f1os' son, became another member of the cast.\n\nIn 1986, Roberto G\u00f3mez Fern\u00e1ndez and his uncle, [[Horacio G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os]], became directors of the show. Horacio now starred only as God\u00ednez in ''El Chavo'', as well as secondary characters in other sketches.\n\nIn 1987, various guest actors played secondary characters in sketches of the show. Also, ''El Chavo'' and ''El Chapul\u00edn'' became less important to the show. The same happened to the other characters, and with Bola\u00f1os giving attention to the sketch ''Ch\u00f3mpiras'', the sketch virtually became a half-hour series inside the show.\n\nOn August 9, 1988, [[Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s]] died of [[stomach cancer]], after a long agony in the hospital. Bola\u00f1os was the only friend of Vald\u00e9s who didn't attend the funeral. [[Carlos Villagr\u00e1n]], [[Edgar Vivar]], [[Rub\u00e9n Aguirre]] and [[Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez]] were some of his friends from ''El Chavo'' who attended the funeral. [[Mar\u00eda Antonieta de las Nieves]] became very worried of not knowing of his condition in his last moments of life, and sad not to have been able to attend his funeral, due to her being on tour in Peru at the time of his death (Peru was also where she had last seen him a year before).\n\nIn 1991, [[Florinda Meza]] left the show to star the [[telenovela]] [[Milagro y magia]]. After the end of the telenovela, she returned to the cast of the show. [[Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez]] left the show at the end of the year due to her lung cancer.\n\nIn 1992, Bola\u00f1os ended the sketches of ''El Chavo'', since he was too old to play the role of an 8-year-old boy. Also, [[Edgar Vivar]] left the show temporarily because of his [[obesity]].\n\nIn 1993, the sketch of ''El Chapul\u00edn Colorado'' ended.\n\nIn 1994, the sketch ''El Ciudadano G\u00f3mez'', parody of [[Citizen Kane]] returned to ''Dr. Chapat\u00edn'', ''Ch\u00f3mpiras'' and ''Los Chifladitos'' in the show. [[Raul Padilla|Raul \"Chato\" Padilla]] left the show, passing away in February 3 of that year. On March 25, [[Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez]] also died of [[lung cancer]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0273390/bio|title=Angelines Fern\u00e1ndez|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-06-28}}</ref> Angelines was an acknowledged [[tobacco]] smoker.\n\nIn September 1995, [[Televisa]] decided to eliminate all comedy and sitcom shows airing on weeknights at 8 o\u2019clock and use that timeslot for more telenovelas (mexican soap operas), while offering to transfer only the Chespirito comedy show and Silvia Pinal\u2019s TV show to a timeslot on weekends. Because of this, Bola\u00f1os preferred to end the 15-year-old ''Chespirito'' show.\n\n==After the show==\n\nRoberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os and Florinda Meza continued for some years the theater play ''11 y 12'' (also created and produced by Bola\u00f1os), which became very successful in [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]].\n\nIn 1997, the show was dubbed in Portuguese, especially to [[Brazil]], renamed ''Clube do Chaves''.\n\nOn November 21, 1999, Horacio G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os (younger brother of Roberto) died of a [[heart attack]].\n\nOn November 19, 2004, Roberto married Florinda Meza after dating for a long time.\n\nIn 2006, an animated series featuring the characters of El Chavo premiered. It ran for several seasons until 2014.\n\nIn 2007, the channel ''Cl\u00e1sico TV'' reran \"Chespirito\" episodes dating from 1980 to 1995. The series finale was broadcast in July 2012. In October 2012 the channel was renamed [[Distrito Comedia]]. The series was transmitted on the weekends (2007\u20132011) and Monday to Friday (2011\u2013present).\n\nIn 2008, the channel ''Cl\u00e1sico TV'' returned with ''Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada'', the first period of the ''Chespirito'' show, which was transmitted on Wednesdays. The series finale was broadcast in 2009.\n \nOn November 28, 2014, Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os passed away at age 85.\n\nIn 2015, an animated series featuring El Chapulin Colorado premiered.\n\n==Aperture==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In ''Jesus'', the life of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is depicted, primarily using the [[Gospel of Luke]] as the main basis for the story. A [[voice-over]] narration is featured sporadically throughout the film, providing background information on characters and events.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nShot on location in [[Israel]], the film was financed primarily by [[Cru (Christian organization)|Campus Crusade for Christ]] with a budget of $6 million, and was released without production or cast credits, as producer [[John Heyman]] declared that the creators of this picture were \u201csimply being translators\u201d of the New Testament's Gospel of Luke, \u201cso nobody will know who produced or directed the film.\u201d<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\">[https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/56823 AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS]</ref> The end of the film states that the [[Good News Bible]] (Today's English Version) was used during filming, and instead of telling a parallel story or embellishing the biblical account like other biblical films, the filmmakers chose to adhere to the [[Gospel of Luke]] as closely as possible.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news| title=Baptism by celluloid | author=Franklin Foer | publisher= New York Times | date = 2004-02-08 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/movies/baptism-by-celluloid.html}}</ref>\n\n''Jesus'' is sometimes described as the most-watched motion picture of all time,<ref>The New York Times, July 22, 2003, page 1AR \"1979 Bible Film is the Most-Watched Movie of All Time\"<!-- FACT checking: I can't find this title in the New York Times from that day, though an obituary of William R.

Later, Mary visits [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], the mother of [[John the Baptist]], who tells her that she is the most blessed of women and that her child is blessed.\n\nWhen the Romans hold a census, Mary travels with her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] to his hometown of [[Bethlehem]] to register. There, Jesus is born in a manger. A week later, Mary and Joseph travel to [[Jerusalem]] to present Jesus at the [[Second Temple|Temple]]. There, they are greeted by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], who blesses Jesus as the Christ. At the age of twelve, Jesus becomes separated from his parents during a [[Passover]] trip to Jerusalem. When Mary asks about his whereabouts, Jesus tells them that he was in [[God|His Father]]'s house. Years later, during the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]] and King [[Herod Antipas]], John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Holy Spirit]] descends upon Jesus.\n\nJesus is subsequently [[Temptation of Christ|tempted]] in the wilderness by [[Satan]] but withstands the Devil's trials. Travelling to [[Capernaum]], Jesus recruits the disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] after helping them to find a large haul of fish. During his preaching ministry, Jesus [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|resurrects]] the daughter of Jairus. Jesus then recruits twelve [[apostle]]s from among His disciples including [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] and [[Judas Iscariot]]. Jesus' followers also include several women including [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Joanna, wife of Chuza|Joanna]], and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]].\n\nThe film covers several of Jesus' teachings and messages including the [[Pharisee and the Publican|parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector]], the [[Beatitudes]], the [[Golden Rule]], loving your enemy, and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. While visiting the home of the [[Pharisee]] [[Simon the Pharisee|Simon]], a sinful woman [[Anointing of Jesus|anoints]] Jesus' feet, prompting Jesus to forgive her sins. Jesus and his disciples later travel across the [[Sea of Galilee]] where he calms the storm. At [[Gerasa]], Jesus [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|exorcises]] a demon-possessed man and the demons enter a herd of swine. At [[Bethsaida]], Jesus [[Feeding the multitude|feeds]] five thousand with five loaves and two pieces of fish. Later, Jesus and his disciples travel up a mountain where Jesus encounters the prophets [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] and is [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]].\n\nAs Jesus' preaching and healing ministry grows, he reaches out to the sinners and outcasts including prostitutes and tax collectors, earning the ire of the Pharisees and religious teachers. Jesus also befriends the tax collector [[Zaccheus]], convincing him to repay people he has extorted. While preaching the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], Jesus befriends a little girl and tells his disciples not to forbid the little children from coming to Him. Jesus draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders, and Romans after he drives the merchants out of the Temple. In Jerusalem, Jesus teaches the [[Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen|Parable of the Tenants]] and to pay taxes to Caesar. At the [[Last Supper]], Jesus warns his disciples of his impending betrayal and death. Judas conspires with the religious leaders to betray Jesus.\n\nAt the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus is betrayed by Judas and captured by the Jewish authorities. [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies knowing Jesus]] three times before the cock crows. The following day, Jesus is condemned by the religious leaders. He is then brought before by [[Pontius Pilate]], who sends him to Herod. While Pilate exonerates Jesus of wrongdoing, the Jesus leaders and crowd demand Jesus' death. After being scourged, Jesus is forced to carry his cross through the streets. When he collapses from exhaustion, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is obliged to carry his cross. At [[Calvary|Golgotha]], Jesus is crucified besides two robbers, one of whom recognizes him as the Messiah. Following Jesus' death at noon, the sky is plunged into darkness and the curtain of the Temple is ripped through the middle. [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Jesus in a tomb. Jesus rises from the dead on the third day. Before [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending]] back to [[Heaven]], Jesus tells his disciples that all power and authority has been given to Him and commands them to go and make disciples of all nations.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brian Deacon]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Rivka Neumann]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] \n* [[Yosef Shiloach]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Talia Shapira]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Alexander Scourby]] as [[Saint Luke|Luke]]\n* [[Niko Nitai]] as [[Simon Peter]]\n* [[Ori Levy]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Mosko Alkalai]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Kobi Assaf]] as [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\n* [[Moti Baharav]] as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n* [[Ya'ackov Ben-Sira]] as [[Zacchaeus]]\n* [[Ze'ev Berlinski]] as Blind Beggar\n* [[Eli Cohen (actor)|Eli Cohen]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Eli Danker]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Dina Doron]] as [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]\n* [[Shoshana Duer]] as the hunchback woman in the temple\n* [[Peter Frye]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Nisim Gerama]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* David Goldberg as [[Jude the Apostle|Judas]], son of James\n* [[Timothy Mark Hanson]] as the rich young ruler\n* [[Yftach Katzur]] as the epileptic boy\n* [[Rula Lenska]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Avi Loziah]] as the demonic man\n* [[Miki Mfir]] as [[Simon the Pharisee]]\n* [[Yitzhak Ne'eman]] as [[James, brother of Jesus|James]]\n* [[Shmuel Ornstein]] as [[Simon Peter|Simeon]]\n* [[Richard Peterson (actor)|Richard Peterson]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Milo Rafi]] as [[Simon Zelotes]]\n* [[Shmuel Rodensky]] as [[Annas]]\n* [[Gad Roll]] as [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\n* [[Israel Rubinek]] as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n* [[Michael Schneider (actor)|Michael Schneider]] as the father of the epileptic boy\n* [[Nahum Shalit]] as [[Jairus]]\n* [[Shmuel Tal]] as [[John the Evangelist|John]]\n* [[Michael Warshaviak]] as [[Saint Bartholomew|Bartholomew]]\n* [[Leonid Weinstein]] as James, son of Alphaeus\n* [[Rolf Brin]] as the centurian in charge of the [[Crucifixion]]\n* [[Dov Friedman]] as the soldier nailing sign to cross\n* [[Oshik Levi]] as Desmas, Good Thief on Cross\n* [[Nissan Nativ]] as John's disciple\n* Kevin O'Shea as Gestas, bad thief on cross\n* [[Yossi Pollak]] as the ruler of the [[Synagogue]]\n* [[Dada Rubin]] as the herdsmen\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Bill Bright]], founder of the [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], spent a lot of time in his early career trying to convert Hollywood celebrities in [[Los Angeles]], and he aspired to make a compelling film about the life of Christ. In 1976, the [[British Jews|British Jewish]] film and television producer [[John Heyman]] approached Bright to fund his Genesis Project to put the entire Bible on film and to obtain financing for his feature-length film on Jesus. After meeting Heyman, Bright asked the-then campus ministry director Paul Eshleman to consult with the filmmaker.\n\nEshleman was pleased with Heyman's short film on the first two chapters of the [[Gospel of Luke]] and convince Bright to endorse the project despite objections from other Campus Crusade leaders who objected to a non-Christian making a film about the Bible. Most of the film's dialogue comes from Luke, which was chosen after Heyman sought advice from [[clergy]] and scholars.{{sfn|Turner|2008|181-182}} On his motivation about the Jesus film, Heyman said: \"I believed the best-selling book in the world would sell a lot of 8-millimeter and 16-millimeter films.\" Instead of creating a parallel story for the film or embellishing the biblical account, as is the case with other biblical films such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' or ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', the filmmakers chose to adhere as closely as possible to the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nAfter failing to canvass funding from Hollywood studios, the ''Jesus'' film would be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters [[Nelson Bunker Hunt|Bunker and Caroline Hunt]] for a sum of $6 million.<ref>Come Help Change the World, by Bill Bright, pages 144-145</ref><ref>Jesus, the Gospels, and Cinematic Imagination Jeffrey Lloyd Staley, Richard G. Walsh - 2007 0664230318 \"By 1978 Heyman had secured additional funding for his project and with Peter Sykes and John Krisch as directors, the decision was made to finish the Gospel of Luke. \"</ref>{{sfn|Turner|2008|182}} Almost every line spoken by Jesus in the film is quoted directly from the gospel of Luke, with over 450 leaders and scholars who had reassessed the script for [[Biblical storytelling|biblical accuracy]]. [[Historical accuracy]] also was assured by implementing clothing, pottery and other props which were made with 1st century techniques to depict a 2,000-year-old Galilean culture.<ref name=\"Charisma\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n{{listen|filename=Jesustheme.ogg|title=''Jesus'' main theme |description=The lush, poignant theme music of ''Jesus''. It was composed by Israeli musician [[Nachum Heiman]] in the key of [[E minor]]. |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[Brian Deacon]], a [[Shakespearean actor]], was cast as Jesus for his \"ethnically correct\" [[olive skin|olive complexion]]. In addition to 45 main actors, who were mainly Israelis, another 5,000 extras were involved in the filming. The filmmakers cast [[Yemenite Jews]] as [[Extra (acting)|background extras]] because, according to Eshleman, \"their facial features have changed the least over 2,000 years.\" Filming began late November, 1978 on location in [[Tiberias]], Israel, which continued for 31 weeks throughout the country, including the cities of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]]. During the production, Heyman revealed that the filmmakers \"were required to [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|re-film]] three days' work,\" because they \"had shown [[eucalyptus tree]]s in a variety of shots,\" when, \"Eucalyptus trees were introduced to Palestine very much later\".<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nDeacon grew his hair and beard during the production, but producer Jon Heyman had decided for Deacon to wear a wig over his hair, and as well as a [[prosthetic]] nose so that he had a [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean look]]. Former [[Jesus Film Project]] director Paul Eshleman, who was on location during much of the principal photography, revealed in the [[DVD]]'s [[audio commentary]] that Deacon was so committed to the film and its message that he read several [[Bible translations]] a day in order to make certain that he properly presented Christ's teachings.<ref>DVD audio commentary</ref> Because Deacon developed [[pneumonia]] during principal photography, doubles were used in certain scenes. Deacon's dialogue mostly comprises full-length passages of scripture, and he is scarcely depicted doing anything other than making miracles and uttering speeches.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nEshleman revealed that Niko Nitai, the actor who played Peter, became a believer during the shooting. As for special effects, the film features puffs of smoke and transparent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] to indicate miracles and angel figures, and a hissing snake and a deep voiceover represent Satan.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/> Heyman's original cut of the ''Jesus'' film ran for more than four hours. However, in consultation with Bright and Eshleman, he edited a shorter version for Campus Crusade. Just after filming, Heyman was not satisfied with the native dialect of the [[Israeli people|Israeli]] cast members and decided that they all should be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] over by [[English people|English]] voice actors using the [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183}}\n\n==Release==\n''Jesus'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in the [[United States]] in over 2000 cinemas, which delineated a rare instance of a major studio releasing an \u201covertly religious picture.\u201d<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> To promote the film, Paul Eshleman worked with both [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Catholic]] churches to arrange group trips and discounts. Four million viewers reportedly watch the ''Jesus'' film in late 1979 and 1980. However, though the film was popular with Christian audiences, it failed to attract mainstream audiences. It was not a financial success and left John Heyman's Genesis Project US$4 million in debt.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183-184}}\n\nThe release date varied between countries; In [[Australia]], it was released on April 3, 1980; in [[Portugal]] on April 9, 1981; in [[Sweden]] on November 1, 1985; in [[Finland]] on March 14, 1986; in [[Hungary]] on 13 December 1990; and in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1991. Nonetheless, the film has been presented in 229 nations, being screened in dozens of large cities to the smallest villages in a lot of different countries.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. received backlash for distributing the film simultaneously with ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979), a Warner Bros. release that was stigmatised by some religious leaders for its satirical characterisation of events surrounding Jesus Christ, although the studio considered the coinciding releases as \u201c\u2018something for everybody.\u2019\u201d Yet the producers of this film evaluated whether to take [[legal action]] against the studio for a conflict of interest.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nDespite the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Flagellation of Christ|flagellation]] scenes, the film was rated G by the [[MPAA]] and, likewise in Australia, it was rated G by the [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]].<ref>[http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=z4wGCPclUAizfV7jm7FavA%253d%253d&ncdctx=9vxqzCN0E0g2pGK%252fYZeqBPoKesvkQPIRy%252fR%252f9q4L6alIhwqf3pH0wEiPVY3KVDph JESUS (VIDEOTAPE)] by the ACB</ref> In the UK, however, the film was rated PG by the [[BBFC]].<ref>[https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/jesus-1979 JESUS (1979) \u2013 British Board of Film Classification]</ref>\n\n===Latter versions===\n[[File:Jesus.film.1979.jpg|thumb|170px|2004 DVD poster.]]\n;1999-2002\nTo make the film more relevant for younger viewers, new footage for ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' was filmed in 1999. Being less violent than the original, it was interwoven into an edited version of the original film ''Jesus'' and released in 2000. In 2001, a new opening sequence depicting the [[Creationism|creation of humans]], the expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], [[Abraham]]'s blocked [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of his son, and the prophesies of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] was filmed to show, as Paul Eshleman states in the audio commentary, how Jesus' life fits into the span of history. In 2002, a special edition of ''Jesus'' commemorating the [[September 11 attacks]] was distributed in the [[VHS]] format. It contains introductions by [[New York City]] [[New York City Fire Department|firefighters]] and [[New York Police Department|police officers]] and has a running time of 83 minutes.\n\n;2003\nAn edited [[DVD]] version of ''Jesus'' was also packaged with ''JESUS: Fact or Fiction?'', which was produced in 2003 by Inspirational Films. This features a section called the \"Journey of Spiritual Discovery\". Biblical scholars, historians, philosophers, authors, and ministers answer specific questions relating to God, Jesus, Christianity, the archaeological, scientific and historical accuracy of the Bible, and testimony from many Christians. Viewers can browse the numerous topics individually or they can watch the film and, when prompted by a \"discovery glass\" icon, can access relevant comments. After they are finished, the viewer is returned to the scene they were watching.\n\nThe version was promoted to Muslims of [[Iraq]] during the hardships of the [[Iraqi War]], where its website featured a banner advert that said \"Send videocassettes of 'JESUS' to Iraq\". The 2003 version premiered in a politically unstable and [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentally Islamic]] region in northern [[Egypt]].

Heyman also objected to Campus Crusade making multiple different versions of his film. When Campus Crusade produced a shorter version ''The Story of Jesus for Children'', which included new footage, Heyman sued Crusade on the grounds that the new version damaged his reputation. Though the dispute was settled by the parties out of court, relations between Heyman and Campus Crusade remained poor.{{sfn|Turner|2008|184}}\n\nRegarding the foreign reception, documentary maker Seghal said \"The events we witnessed were often bewildering,\" he says. \"But what struck us most was the utter normality of those who were willing to risk their lives for Christ.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/> After the film's reels were sent to remote settlements in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they returned with reports of audiences being in tears during screening with others instantly [[Religious conversion|converting]]. In Phaphamani, a small village in [[South Africa]] with no [[electricity]], the film was screened on a [[projector]] which attracted over 350 people, who had probably never watched a motion picture in their life.

Based on the distribution rate by 2005, JVP did not expect to reach countrywide status until 2040 or later.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> As of August 2018, over 8 billion viewers were reported through in-person film showings, online platforms and apps.<ref>[https://www.jesusfilm.org/about/learn-more/statistics.html Jesusfilm.org]</ref>\n\n==Foreign-language versions==\nIn 1981, [[Bill Bright]] created the Jesus Film Project organization with the goal of accurately translating ''Jesus'' into other languages and showing them around the world. The first translation was done for the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking people of the [[Philippines]].  One of the group's first projects, they ordered for the broadcast of a Hindi version in [[Indian television]]. The organization works with thousands of missionaries around the world to show the film, sometimes to audiences who have never seen a motion picture. The [[Mandarin Chinese]] version of the film is widely distributed in China by the government-linked [[China Christian Council]]'s [[Amity Foundation]] in [[Nanjing]], both on [[VCD]]s and [[DVD]].<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nDistribution in the United States has included direct mail campaigns sponsored by churches to deliver a copy of the film to every address in select [[ZIP code]]s across the country, with more than 4.8 million copies sent to Ohio and Texas alone. In 2004, the organization made the film available for viewing on its website in over 300 languages. Both ''Jesus'' and ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' are available in [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] formats. Audio dramatizations in a number of languages are also available. It is the only film that has been dubbed into more than 1000 languages of the world. As of now, more than 1600 languages spoken all over the world have the ''Jesus'' film, including in all major international languages.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> Also in 2004, 300 employees at an office in [[Orlando, Fl]] translated the film into languages such as [[Kwanyama]], spoken in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]], and as well as the seven [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], a tongue of [[Quechua people]] in the [[Andes]].<ref name=\"NYT Jesus film 2\"/>\n\nRegarding its worldwide spread and translations, Eshleman states, \"People ask 'Why do you go to those far away places?' It's because those people haven't had a chance. That's all we want to do - to give them a chance to hear the [[Christian mission|message of Christ]] in an understandable language near where they live.\" John Meyer, one of the team members who has helped distributing and translating the film, has said, \"I'm willing to lay down my life for Jesus, should it come to that,\" he told the documentary maker Sehgal. \"So if there's a recording in a war-torn country, I'm more than willing to go. Or anywhere else, to be honest.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/>\n\nIncidentally, American [[aid worker]]s in [[Afghanistan]], who hadn't been working for the Jesus film project, were arrested by the [[Taliban]] in 2001 for showing the film to a family there.

Later, Mary visits [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], the mother of [[John the Baptist]], who tells her that she is the most blessed of women and that her child is blessed.\n\nWhen the Romans hold a census, Mary travels with her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] to his hometown of [[Bethlehem]] to register. There, Jesus is born in a manger. A week later, Mary and Joseph travel to [[Jerusalem]] to present Jesus at the [[Second Temple|Temple]]. There, they are greeted by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], who blesses Jesus as the Christ. At the age of twelve, Jesus becomes separated from his parents during a [[Passover]] trip to Jerusalem. When Mary asks about his whereabouts, Jesus tells them that he was in [[God|His Father]]'s house. Years later, during the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]] and King [[Herod Antipas]], John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Holy Spirit]] descends upon Jesus.\n\nJesus is subsequently [[Temptation of Christ|tempted]] in the wilderness by [[Satan]] but withstands the Devil's trials. Travelling to [[Capernaum]], Jesus recruits the disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] after helping them to find a large haul of fish. During his preaching ministry, Jesus [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|resurrects]] the daughter of Jairus. Jesus then recruits twelve [[apostle]]s from among His disciples including [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] and [[Judas Iscariot]]. Jesus' followers also include several women including [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Joanna, wife of Chuza|Joanna]], and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]].\n\nThe film covers several of Jesus' teachings and messages including the [[Pharisee and the Publican|parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector]], the [[Beatitudes]], the [[Golden Rule]], loving your enemy, and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. While visiting the home of the [[Pharisee]] [[Simon the Pharisee|Simon]], a sinful woman [[Anointing of Jesus|anoints]] Jesus' feet, prompting Jesus to forgive her sins. Jesus and his disciples later travel across the [[Sea of Galilee]] where he calms the storm. At [[Gerasa]], Jesus [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|exorcises]] a demon-possessed man and the demons enter a herd of swine. At [[Bethsaida]], Jesus [[Feeding the multitude|feeds]] five thousand with five loaves and two pieces of fish. Later, Jesus and his disciples travel up a mountain where Jesus encounters the prophets [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] and is [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]].\n\nAs Jesus' preaching and healing ministry grows, he reaches out to the sinners and outcasts including prostitutes and tax collectors, earning the ire of the Pharisees and religious teachers. Jesus also befriends the tax collector [[Zaccheus]], convincing him to repay people he has extorted. While preaching the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], Jesus befriends a little girl and tells his disciples not to forbid the little children from coming to Him. Jesus draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders, and Romans after he drives the merchants out of the Temple. In Jerusalem, Jesus teaches the [[Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen|Parable of the Tenants]] and to pay taxes to Caesar. At the [[Last Supper]], Jesus warns his disciples of his impending betrayal and death. Judas conspires with the religious leaders to betray Jesus.\n\nAt the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus is betrayed by Judas and captured by the Jewish authorities. [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies knowing Jesus]] three times before the cock crows. The following day, Jesus is condemned by the religious leaders. He is then brought before by [[Pontius Pilate]], who sends him to Herod. While Pilate exonerates Jesus of wrongdoing, the Jesus leaders and crowd demand Jesus' death. After being scourged, Jesus is forced to carry his cross through the streets. When he collapses from exhaustion, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is obliged to carry his cross. At [[Calvary|Golgotha]], Jesus is crucified besides two robbers, one of whom recognizes him as the Messiah. Following Jesus' death at noon, the sky is plunged into darkness and the curtain of the Temple is ripped through the middle. [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Jesus in a tomb. Jesus rises from the dead on the third day. Before [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending]] back to [[Heaven]], Jesus tells his disciples that all power and authority has been given to Him and commands them to go and make disciples of all nations.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brian Deacon]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Rivka Neumann]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] \n* [[Yosef Shiloach]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Talia Shapira]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Alexander Scourby]] as [[Saint Luke|Luke]]\n* [[Niko Nitai]] as [[Simon Peter]]\n* [[Ori Levy]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Mosko Alkalai]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Kobi Assaf]] as [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\n* [[Moti Baharav]] as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n* [[Ya'ackov Ben-Sira]] as [[Zacchaeus]]\n* [[Ze'ev Berlinski]] as Blind Beggar\n* [[Eli Cohen (actor)|Eli Cohen]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Eli Danker]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Dina Doron]] as [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]\n* [[Shoshana Duer]] as the hunchback woman in the temple\n* [[Peter Frye]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Nisim Gerama]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* David Goldberg as [[Jude the Apostle|Judas]], son of James\n* [[Timothy Mark Hanson]] as the rich young ruler\n* [[Yftach Katzur]] as the epileptic boy\n* [[Rula Lenska]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Avi Loziah]] as the demonic man\n* [[Miki Mfir]] as [[Simon the Pharisee]]\n* [[Yitzhak Ne'eman]] as [[James, brother of Jesus|James]]\n* [[Shmuel Ornstein]] as [[Simon Peter|Simeon]]\n* [[Richard Peterson (actor)|Richard Peterson]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Milo Rafi]] as [[Simon Zelotes]]\n* [[Shmuel Rodensky]] as [[Annas]]\n* [[Gad Roll]] as [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\n* [[Israel Rubinek]] as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n* [[Michael Schneider (actor)|Michael Schneider]] as the father of the epileptic boy\n* [[Nahum Shalit]] as [[Jairus]]\n* [[Shmuel Tal]] as [[John the Evangelist|John]]\n* [[Michael Warshaviak]] as [[Saint Bartholomew|Bartholomew]]\n* [[Leonid Weinstein]] as James, son of Alphaeus\n* [[Rolf Brin]] as the centurian in charge of the [[Crucifixion]]\n* [[Dov Friedman]] as the soldier nailing sign to cross\n* [[Oshik Levi]] as Desmas, Good Thief on Cross\n* [[Nissan Nativ]] as John's disciple\n* Kevin O'Shea as Gestas, bad thief on cross\n* [[Yossi Pollak]] as the ruler of the [[Synagogue]]\n* [[Dada Rubin]] as the herdsmen\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Bill Bright]], founder of the [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], spent a lot of time in his early career trying to convert Hollywood celebrities in [[Los Angeles]], and he aspired to make a compelling film about the life of Christ. In 1976, the [[British Jews|British Jewish]] film and television producer [[John Heyman]] approached Bright to fund his Genesis Project to put the entire Bible on film and to obtain financing for his feature-length film on Jesus. After meeting Heyman, Bright asked the-then campus ministry director Paul Eshleman to consult with the filmmaker.\n\nEshleman was pleased with Heyman's short film on the first two chapters of the [[Gospel of Luke]] and convince Bright to endorse the project despite objections from other Campus Crusade leaders who objected to a non-Christian making a film about the Bible. Most of the film's dialogue comes from Luke, which was chosen after Heyman sought advice from [[clergy]] and scholars.{{sfn|Turner|2008|181-182}} On his motivation about the Jesus film, Heyman said: \"I believed the best-selling book in the world would sell a lot of 8-millimeter and 16-millimeter films.\" Instead of creating a parallel story for the film or embellishing the biblical account, as is the case with other biblical films such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' or ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', the filmmakers chose to adhere as closely as possible to the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nAfter failing to canvass funding from Hollywood studios, the ''Jesus'' film would be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters [[Nelson Bunker Hunt|Bunker and Caroline Hunt]] for a sum of $6 million.<ref>Come Help Change the World, by Bill Bright, pages 144-145</ref><ref>Jesus, the Gospels, and Cinematic Imagination Jeffrey Lloyd Staley, Richard G.

[[Historical accuracy]] also was assured by implementing clothing, pottery and other props which were made with 1st century techniques to depict a 2,000-year-old Galilean culture.<ref name=\"Charisma\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n{{listen|filename=Jesustheme.ogg|title=''Jesus'' main theme |description=The lush, poignant theme music of ''Jesus''. It was composed by Israeli musician [[Nachum Heiman]] in the key of [[E minor]]. |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[Brian Deacon]], a [[Shakespearean actor]], was cast as Jesus for his \"ethnically correct\" [[olive skin|olive complexion]]. In addition to 45 main actors, who were mainly Israelis, another 5,000 extras were involved in the filming. The filmmakers cast [[Yemenite Jews]] as [[Extra (acting)|background extras]] because, according to Eshleman, \"their facial features have changed the least over 2,000 years.\" Filming began late November, 1978 on location in [[Tiberias]], Israel, which continued for 31 weeks throughout the country, including the cities of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]]. During the production, Heyman revealed that the filmmakers \"were required to [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|re-film]] three days' work,\" because they \"had shown [[eucalyptus tree]]s in a variety of shots,\" when, \"Eucalyptus trees were introduced to Palestine very much later\".<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nDeacon grew his hair and beard during the production, but producer Jon Heyman had decided for Deacon to wear a wig over his hair, and as well as a [[prosthetic]] nose so that he had a [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean look]]. Former [[Jesus Film Project]] director Paul Eshleman, who was on location during much of the principal photography, revealed in the [[DVD]]'s [[audio commentary]] that Deacon was so committed to the film and its message that he read several [[Bible translations]] a day in order to make certain that he properly presented Christ's teachings.<ref>DVD audio commentary</ref> Because Deacon developed [[pneumonia]] during principal photography, doubles were used in certain scenes. Deacon's dialogue mostly comprises full-length passages of scripture, and he is scarcely depicted doing anything other than making miracles and uttering speeches.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nEshleman revealed that Niko Nitai, the actor who played Peter, became a believer during the shooting. As for special effects, the film features puffs of smoke and transparent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] to indicate miracles and angel figures, and a hissing snake and a deep voiceover represent Satan.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/> Heyman's original cut of the ''Jesus'' film ran for more than four hours. However, in consultation with Bright and Eshleman, he edited a shorter version for Campus Crusade. Just after filming, Heyman was not satisfied with the native dialect of the [[Israeli people|Israeli]] cast members and decided that they all should be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] over by [[English people|English]] voice actors using the [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183}}\n\n==Release==\n''Jesus'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in the [[United States]] in over 2000 cinemas, which delineated a rare instance of a major studio releasing an \u201covertly religious picture.\u201d<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> To promote the film, Paul Eshleman worked with both [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Catholic]] churches to arrange group trips and discounts. Four million viewers reportedly watch the ''Jesus'' film in late 1979 and 1980. However, though the film was popular with Christian audiences, it failed to attract mainstream audiences. It was not a financial success and left John Heyman's Genesis Project US$4 million in debt.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183-184}}\n\nThe release date varied between countries; In [[Australia]], it was released on April 3, 1980; in [[Portugal]] on April 9, 1981; in [[Sweden]] on November 1, 1985; in [[Finland]] on March 14, 1986; in [[Hungary]] on 13 December 1990; and in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1991. Nonetheless, the film has been presented in 229 nations, being screened in dozens of large cities to the smallest villages in a lot of different countries.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. received backlash for distributing the film simultaneously with ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979), a Warner Bros. release that was stigmatised by some religious leaders for its satirical characterisation of events surrounding Jesus Christ, although the studio considered the coinciding releases as \u201c\u2018something for everybody.\u2019\u201d Yet the producers of this film evaluated whether to take [[legal action]] against the studio for a conflict of interest.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nDespite the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Flagellation of Christ|flagellation]] scenes, the film was rated G by the [[MPAA]] and, likewise in Australia, it was rated G by the [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]].<ref>[http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=z4wGCPclUAizfV7jm7FavA%253d%253d&ncdctx=9vxqzCN0E0g2pGK%252fYZeqBPoKesvkQPIRy%252fR%252f9q4L6alIhwqf3pH0wEiPVY3KVDph JESUS (VIDEOTAPE)] by the ACB</ref> In the UK, however, the film was rated PG by the [[BBFC]].<ref>[https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/jesus-1979 JESUS (1979) \u2013 British Board of Film Classification]</ref>\n\n===Latter versions===\n[[File:Jesus.film.1979.jpg|thumb|170px|2004 DVD poster.]]\n;1999-2002\nTo make the film more relevant for younger viewers, new footage for ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' was filmed in 1999. Being less violent than the original, it was interwoven into an edited version of the original film ''Jesus'' and released in 2000. In 2001, a new opening sequence depicting the [[Creationism|creation of humans]], the expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], [[Abraham]]'s blocked [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of his son, and the prophesies of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] was filmed to show, as Paul Eshleman states in the audio commentary, how Jesus' life fits into the span of history. In 2002, a special edition of ''Jesus'' commemorating the [[September 11 attacks]] was distributed in the [[VHS]] format. It contains introductions by [[New York City]] [[New York City Fire Department|firefighters]] and [[New York Police Department|police officers]] and has a running time of 83 minutes.\n\n;2003\nAn edited [[DVD]] version of ''Jesus'' was also packaged with ''JESUS: Fact or Fiction?'', which was produced in 2003 by Inspirational Films. This features a section called the \"Journey of Spiritual Discovery\". Biblical scholars, historians, philosophers, authors, and ministers answer specific questions relating to God, Jesus, Christianity, the archaeological, scientific and historical accuracy of the Bible, and testimony from many Christians. Viewers can browse the numerous topics individually or they can watch the film and, when prompted by a \"discovery glass\" icon, can access relevant comments. After they are finished, the viewer is returned to the scene they were watching.\n\nThe version was promoted to Muslims of [[Iraq]] during the hardships of the [[Iraqi War]], where its website featured a banner advert that said \"Send videocassettes of 'JESUS' to Iraq\". The 2003 version premiered in a politically unstable and [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentally Islamic]] region in northern [[Egypt]].

Heyman also objected to Campus Crusade making multiple different versions of his film. When Campus Crusade produced a shorter version ''The Story of Jesus for Children'', which included new footage, Heyman sued Crusade on the grounds that the new version damaged his reputation. Though the dispute was settled by the parties out of court, relations between Heyman and Campus Crusade remained poor.{{sfn|Turner|2008|184}}\n\nRegarding the foreign reception, documentary maker Seghal said \"The events we witnessed were often bewildering,\" he says. \"But what struck us most was the utter normality of those who were willing to risk their lives for Christ.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/> After the film's reels were sent to remote settlements in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they returned with reports of audiences being in tears during screening with others instantly [[Religious conversion|converting]]. In Phaphamani, a small village in [[South Africa]] with no [[electricity]], the film was screened on a [[projector]] which attracted over 350 people, who had probably never watched a motion picture in their life.

Based on the distribution rate by 2005, JVP did not expect to reach countrywide status until 2040 or later.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> As of August 2018, over 8 billion viewers were reported through in-person film showings, online platforms and apps.<ref>[https://www.jesusfilm.org/about/learn-more/statistics.html Jesusfilm.org]</ref>\n\n==Foreign-language versions==\nIn 1981, [[Bill Bright]] created the Jesus Film Project organization with the goal of accurately translating ''Jesus'' into other languages and showing them around the world. The first translation was done for the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking people of the [[Philippines]].  One of the group's first projects, they ordered for the broadcast of a Hindi version in [[Indian television]]. The organization works with thousands of missionaries around the world to show the film, sometimes to audiences who have never seen a motion picture. The [[Mandarin Chinese]] version of the film is widely distributed in China by the government-linked [[China Christian Council]]'s [[Amity Foundation]] in [[Nanjing]], both on [[VCD]]s and [[DVD]].<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nDistribution in the United States has included direct mail campaigns sponsored by churches to deliver a copy of the film to every address in select [[ZIP code]]s across the country, with more than 4.8 million copies sent to Ohio and Texas alone. In 2004, the organization made the film available for viewing on its website in over 300 languages. Both ''Jesus'' and ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' are available in [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] formats. Audio dramatizations in a number of languages are also available. It is the only film that has been dubbed into more than 1000 languages of the world. As of now, more than 1600 languages spoken all over the world have the ''Jesus'' film, including in all major international languages.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> Also in 2004, 300 employees at an office in [[Orlando, Fl]] translated the film into languages such as [[Kwanyama]], spoken in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]], and as well as the seven [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], a tongue of [[Quechua people]] in the [[Andes]].<ref name=\"NYT Jesus film 2\"/>\n\nRegarding its worldwide spread and translations, Eshleman states, \"People ask 'Why do you go to those far away places?' It's because those people haven't had a chance. That's all we want to do - to give them a chance to hear the [[Christian mission|message of Christ]] in an understandable language near where they live.\" John Meyer, one of the team members who has helped distributing and translating the film, has said, \"I'm willing to lay down my life for Jesus, should it come to that,\" he told the documentary maker Sehgal. \"So if there's a recording in a war-torn country, I'm more than willing to go. Or anywhere else, to be honest.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/>\n\nIncidentally, American [[aid worker]]s in [[Afghanistan]], who hadn't been working for the Jesus film project, were arrested by the [[Taliban]] in 2001 for showing the film to a family there.

Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Songbird Supreme]]\" by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', she is noted for her five-octave [[vocal range]], [[melisma]]tic singing style, and signature use of the [[whistle register]]. She rose to fame in 1990 after signing to [[Columbia Records]] and releasing her [[Mariah Carey (album)|eponymous debut album]], which topped the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for eleven consecutive weeks. Carey became the only artist ever to have their first five singles reach number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, from \"[[Vision of Love]]\" to \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\".\n\nIn 1993, Carey married [[Sony Music]] head [[Tommy Mottola]], the man who signed her to Columbia. She achieved worldwide success with follow-up albums ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994), and ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995). These albums spawned some of Carey's most successful singles, including \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\", \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\", \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\", \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\", \"[[Always Be My Baby]]\", as well as \"[[One Sweet Day]]\", which peaked at number one in the U.S. for 16 weeks and became ''Billboard''{{'}}s Song Of The Decade (1990s Decade). After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] into her music with the release of ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997). ''Billboard'' named her the country's most successful artist of the 1990s, while the [[World Music Awards]] honored her as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s, and the best-selling female artist of the millennium.\n\nAfter eleven consecutive years charting a U.S. number-one single, Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2000 and signed a $100&nbsp;million recording contract with [[Virgin Records]]. However, following her [[Glitter (soundtrack)#Controversies|highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown]], as well as the critical and commercial failure of her film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001) and its accompanying [[Glitter (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], her contract was bought out for $50 million by Virgin and she signed with [[Island Records]] the next year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005), the world's second-best-selling album of 2005.

Though a classically trained opera singer, Patricia never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Carey recalled that she had \"never been a pushy mom.

Sources differ.--> is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Songbird Supreme]]\" by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', she is noted for her five-octave [[vocal range]], [[melisma]]tic singing style, and signature use of the [[whistle register]]. She rose to fame in 1990 after signing to [[Columbia Records]] and releasing her [[Mariah Carey (album)|eponymous debut album]], which topped the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for eleven consecutive weeks. Carey became the only artist ever to have their first five singles reach number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, from \"[[Vision of Love]]\" to \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\".\n\nIn 1993, Carey married [[Sony Music]] head [[Tommy Mottola]], the man who signed her to Columbia. She achieved worldwide success with follow-up albums ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994), and ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995). These albums spawned some of Carey's most successful singles, including \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\", \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\", \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\", \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\", \"[[Always Be My Baby]]\", as well as \"[[One Sweet Day]]\", which peaked at number one in the U.S. for 16 weeks and became ''Billboard''{{'}}s Song Of The Decade (1990s Decade). After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] into her music with the release of ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997). ''Billboard'' named her the country's most successful artist of the 1990s, while the [[World Music Awards]] honored her as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s, and the best-selling female artist of the millennium.\n\nAfter eleven consecutive years charting a U.S. number-one single, Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2000 and signed a $100&nbsp;million recording contract with [[Virgin Records]].

After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005), the world's second-best-selling album of 2005. Its second single, \"[[We Belong Together]]\", topped the U.S. charts for 14 weeks and became ''Billboard''{{'}}s Song Of The Decade (2000s Decade). In 2009, she was cast in the critically acclaimed film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'', which won her Breakthrough Actress Performance Award at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]].\n\nThroughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.
