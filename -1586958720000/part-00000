{"title_page": "Phonetic symbols in Unicode", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2016}}\n{{ SpecialChars\n| special    = [[phonetic]] [[symbols]]\n| fix        = Help:Special_characters\n| characters = phonetic symbols\n}}\n'''Unicode''' supports several '''phonetic scripts''' and notations through the existing writing systems and the addition of extra blocks with phonetic characters. These phonetic extras are derived of an existing script, usually Latin, Greek or Cyrillic. In Unicode there is no \"IPA script\". Apart from IPA, [[extensions to the IPA]] and [[obsolete and nonstandard IPA symbols]], these blocks also contain characters from the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]] and the [[Americanist Phonetic Alphabet]].\n\n==Phonetic scripts==\nThe [[International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] makes use of letters from other writing systems as most phonetic scripts do. IPA notably uses Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters. Combining diacritics also adds meaning to the phonetic text. Finally, these phonetic alphabets make use of modifier letters, that are specially constructed for the phonetic meaning. A \"modifier letter\" is strictly intended not as an independent grapheme but as a modification of the preceding character<ref>{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Spacing%20Modifier%20Letters |title=Spacing modifier letters |website=Everything2.com |date=2002-08-29 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}</ref> resulting in a distinct grapheme, notably in the context of the International Phonetic Alphabet. For example, [[\u02b0]] should not occur on its own but modifies the preceding or following symbol. Thus, {{IPA|t\u02b0}} is a single IPA symbol, distinct from {{IPA|t}}. In practice, however, several of these \"modifier letters\" are also used as full graphemes, e.g. [[\u02bf]] as transliterating Semitic [[ayin]] or Hawaiian [[\u02bbOkina|okina]], or [[\u02da]] transliterating Abkhaz [[\u04d9]].\n\n==From IPA to Unicode==\n{{Main|International Phonetic Alphabet}}\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following tables indicates the Unicode code point sequences for phonemes as used in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. A bold code point indicates that the Unicode chart provides an application note such as \"voiced retroflex lateral\" for {{unichar|026D|LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH RETROFLEX HOOK|html=|size=100%}}. An entry in bold italics indicates the character name itself refers to a phoneme such as {{unichar|0298|LATIN LETTER BILABIAL CLICK|html=|size=100%}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\"| [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| [[Labiodental consonant|Labiodental]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| [[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| [[Labialized palatal consonant|Labialized palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| [[Postalveolar-velar consonant|Postalveolar-velar]]\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;

Diacritics are not always properly rendered, however. IPA fonts that are freely available online include [[Gentium]], several from the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics|SIL]] (such as [[Charis SIL]], and [[Doulos SIL]]), [[DejaVu fonts|DejaVu Sans]], and [[Bitstream Cyberbit|TITUS Cyberbit]], which are all [[Free software Unicode typefaces|freely available]]; as well as commercial typefaces such as Brill, available from [[Brill Publishers]], and  [[Lucida Sans Unicode]] and [[Arial Unicode MS]], shipping with various [[Microsoft]] products. These all include several ranges of characters in addition to the IPA. Modern [[Web browser]]s generally do not need any configuration to display these symbols, provided that a font capable of doing so is available to the operating system.\n\n\n== Input by selection from a screen==\nFurther Information: [[Unicode input#Selection from a screen]]\n[[File:Gucharmap screenshot.png|thumb|300px|Applet for character selection]]\n\nMany systems provide a way to select Unicode characters visually. [[ISO/IEC 14755]] refers to this as a ''screen-selection entry method''.\n\n[[Microsoft Windows]] has provided a Unicode version of the Character Map program (find it by hitting {{keypress|Win|R}} then type <code>charmap</code> then hit {{keypress|Enter}}) since version NT 4.0&nbsp;\u2013 appearing in the consumer edition since XP. This is limited to characters in the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP). Characters are searchable by Unicode character name, and the table can be limited to a particular code block. More advanced third-party tools of the same type are also available (a notable [[freeware]] example is [[Andrew West (linguist)#BabelMap|BabelMap]]).\n\n[[Mac OS X|macOS]] provides a \"character palette\" with much the same functionality, along with searching by related characters, glyph tables in a font, etc. It can be [https://web.archive.org/web/20110109234035/http://www.apple.com/pro/techniques/glyphspalette/ enabled] in the input menu in the menu bar under System Preferences \u2192 International \u2192 Input Menu (or System Preferences \u2192 Language and Text \u2192 Input Sources) or can be viewed under Edit \u2192 Emoji & Symbols in many programs.\n\nEquivalent tools&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[gucharmap]] ([[GNOME]]) or [[List of KDE applications|kcharselect]] ([[KDE]])&nbsp;\u2013 exist on most Linux desktop environments.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Unicode symbols]]\n*[[Universal Character Set characters]]\n*[[Latin script in Unicode]]\n*[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://unicode.org/charts/#PhoneticSymbols Links to PDFs of Unicode codes for several phonetic symbol sets]\n\n{{Unicode navigation}}\n{{IPA navigation}}\n\n[[Category:Phonetics|Unicode]]\n[[Category:Unicode blocks|Phonetic Symbols]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2016}}\n{{ SpecialChars\n| special    = [[phonetic]] [[symbols]]\n| fix        = Help:Special_characters\n| characters = phonetic symbols\n}}\n'''Unicode''' supports several '''phonetic scripts''' and notations through the existing writing systems and the addition of extra blocks with phonetic characters. These phonetic extras are derived of an existing script, usually Latin, Greek or Cyrillic. In Unicode there is no \"IPA script\". Apart from IPA, [[extensions to the IPA]] and [[obsolete and nonstandard IPA symbols]], these blocks also contain characters from the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]] and the [[Americanist Phonetic Alphabet]].\n\n==Phonetic scripts==\nThe [[International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] makes use of letters from other writing systems as most phonetic scripts do. IPA notably uses Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters. Combining diacritics also adds meaning to the phonetic text. Finally, these phonetic alphabets make use of modifier letters, that are specially constructed for the phonetic meaning. A \"modifier letter\" is strictly intended not as an independent grapheme but as a modification of the preceding character<ref>{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Spacing%20Modifier%20Letters |title=Spacing modifier letters |website=Everything2.com |date=2002-08-29 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}</ref> resulting in a distinct grapheme, notably in the context of the International Phonetic Alphabet. For example, [[\u02b0]] should not occur on its own but modifies the preceding or following symbol. Thus, {{IPA|t\u02b0}} is a single IPA symbol, distinct from {{IPA|t}}. In practice, however, several of these \"modifier letters\" are also used as full graphemes, e.g. [[\u02bf]] as transliterating Semitic [[ayin]] or Hawaiian [[\u02bbOkina|okina]], or [[\u02da]] transliterating Abkhaz [[\u04d9]].\n\n==From IPA to Unicode==\n{{Main|International Phonetic Alphabet}}\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following tables indicates the Unicode code point sequences for phonemes as used in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. A bold code point indicates that the Unicode chart provides an application note such as \"voiced retroflex lateral\" for {{unichar|026D|LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH RETROFLEX HOOK|html=|size=100%}}.

[[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Jubal Early]] launched a surprise attack against the encamped army of [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Philip Sheridan]], across [[Cedar Creek (North Fork Shenandoah River)|Cedar Creek]], northeast of [[Strasburg, Virginia]]. During the morning fighting, seven Union infantry divisions were forced to fall back and lost numerous prisoners and cannons. Early failed to continue his attack north of [[Middletown, Virginia|Middletown]], and Sheridan, dramatically riding to the battlefield from [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], was able to rally his troops to hold a new defensive line. A Union counterattack that afternoon routed Early's army.\n\nAt the conclusion of this battle, the final Confederate invasion of the North was effectively ended. The Confederacy was never again able to threaten [[Washington, D.C.]] through the [[Shenandoah Valley]], nor protect one of its key economic bases in Virginia. The stunning Union victory aided the [[1864 United States presidential election|reelection]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and won Sheridan lasting fame.\n\n==Background==\n===Military situation===\n{{Main|Valley Campaigns of 1864#Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (August&ndash;October 1864)|l1=Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (August&ndash;October 1864)|Third Battle of Winchester|Battle of Fisher's Hill}}\n{{further|Overland Campaign|Valley Campaigns of 1864|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}\n\n===Grant's strategy in 1864===\nAt the beginning of 1864, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]] and given command of all [[Union Army|Union]] armies. He chose to make his headquarters with the [[Army of the Potomac]], although [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]] remained the actual commander of that army. He left Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Sherman and President Lincoln, that only the utter defeat of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war. Therefore, [[scorched earth]] tactics would be required in some important theaters. He devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of the Confederacy from multiple directions: Grant, Meade, and Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] against [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] near [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; Sherman to invade [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and capture [[Atlanta]] and Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].<ref>Salmon, p. 251.</ref>\n\n===Shenandoah Valley===\n[[File:Shenandoah Valley May-July 1864.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Shenandoah Valley operations, May&ndash;July 1864]]\nThe final coordinated offensive was to be conducted by Maj. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]] through the Shenandoah Valley. During the Civil War, the Valley was one of the most important geographic features of Virginia. The watershed of the [[Shenandoah River]] passed between the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] on the east and the [[Allegheny Mountains]] to the west, extending {{convert|165|miles|km|-1}} southwest from the [[Potomac River]] at [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]] and [[Harpers Ferry]], at an average width of {{convert|25|miles|km}}. By the conventions of local residents, the \"upper Valley\" referred to the southwestern end, which had a generally higher elevation than the lower Valley to the northeast. Moving \"up the Valley\" meant traveling southwest, for instance. Between the North and South Forks of the Shenandoah River, [[Massanutten Mountain]] soared {{convert|2900|ft|m|-2}} and separated the Valley into two halves for about {{convert|50|miles|km|-1}}, from [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] to [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]]. During the 19th century, there was but a single road that crossed over the mountain, from [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]] to Luray.<ref>Gallagher, pp. 2&ndash;3; Wert, p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe Valley offered two strategic advantages to the Confederates. First, a Northern army invading Virginia could be subjected to Confederate flanking attacks pouring through the many [[wind gap (geographical feature)|wind gaps]] across the Blue Ridge. Second, the Valley offered a protected corridor that allowed Confederate armies to head north into Pennsylvania unimpeded, and a hard-surfaced road, the [[Valley Pike]] (current [[U.S. Route 11]]), allowed relatively swift movement. This was the route taken by Lee to invade the North in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] of 1863. In contrast, the orientation of the Valley offered little advantage to a Northern army headed toward Richmond. But denying the Valley to the Confederacy would be a significant blow. It was an agriculturally rich area&mdash;the 2.5 million bushels of wheat produced in 1860, for example, accounted for about 19% of the crop in the entire state and the Valley was also rich in livestock that was used to provision Virginia's armies and the Confederate capital of Richmond. [[Mark Grimsley]], writing in ''The Hard Hand of War'', argues that by 1864 Lee was receiving most of his supplies from the [[Deep South]], so that the agricultural importance of the Valley has been overstated. The Union wanted to control it to close the invasion route to the North and to deny the use of its supplies to guerrillas operating in the area. If the Federals could capture [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] in the upper Valley, they would threaten the vital [[Virginia and Tennessee Railroad]], which ran from Richmond to the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Grimsley, pp. 167&ndash;68; Wert, pp. 27&ndash;28.</ref>\n\n===Sigel and Hunter===\nSigel, in command of the Department of [[West Virginia]], had orders from Grant to move \"up the Valley\" with 10,000 men to destroy the railroad center at [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]]. Sigel's force was quickly intercepted by 4,000 Confederate troops under Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]], and defeated at the [[Battle of New Market]] on May 15. He retreated to Strasburg and was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[David Hunter]]. Hunter resumed the Union offensive and defeated Brig. Gen. [[William E. Jones|William E. \"Grumble\" Jones]], who was killed in the [[Battle of Piedmont]] on June 6. Hunter occupied Staunton and joined with Brig. Gen. [[George Crook]]. His force of 20,000 men, ordered by Grant to live off the land, began a campaign of destruction.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 298&ndash;303; Eicher, pp. 691&ndash;94; Salmon, pp. 329&ndash;30.</ref>\n\n===Early's campaign===\nGen. Robert E. Lee, whose Army of Northern Virginia was being maneuvered by Grant into a siege around Richmond and [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], was also concerned about Hunter's advances in the Valley. He sent his [[Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Second Corps]], now designated the [[Army of the Valley]], under [[Jubal Early]] to sweep Union forces from the Valley and, if possible, to menace [[Washington, D.C.]], hoping to compel Grant to dilute his forces around Petersburg. Early was operating in the shadow of [[Thomas J. Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]], whose 1862 [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]] against superior forces was fabled in Confederate history.<ref>Kennedy, p. 305; Eicher, p. 715; Salmon, p. 331.</ref>\n\nEarly got off to a good start. He drove down the Valley without opposition, bypassed [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], crossed the [[Potomac River]], and advanced into [[Maryland]]. Grant dispatched a corps under Maj. Gen. [[Horatio G. Wright]] and other troops under Crook to reinforce Washington and pursue Early. Early defeated a smaller force under Maj. Gen. [[Lew Wallace]] in the [[Battle of Monocacy]] on July 9, but this battle delayed his progress enough to allow time for the reinforcement of the defenses of Washington. Early attempted some tentative attacks against [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]] (July 11&ndash;12) on the northern outskirts of Washington, but then withdrew to Virginia. A number of small battles ensued as the Union pursued, including the defeat of Crook at the [[Second Battle of Kernstown]] on July 24.<ref>Eicher, pp. 715&ndash;18; Salmon, pp. 331&ndash;32; Kennedy, pp. 305&ndash;312; Welcher, p. 1017.</ref>\n\n===Sheridan's campaign===\n[[File:Shenandoah Valley August-October 1864.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Shenandoah Valley operations, August 1864 &ndash; March 1865]]\nGrant decided that Early's threat had to be eliminated, particularly in the wake of a cavalry raid that burned [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]]. He saw that Washington had to be heavily defended as long as Early was still on the loose. One problem was that Early's moves cut through four federal departments. Grant considered unity of command to be essential and recommended [[George Meade]] for the position, but Lincoln vetoed that because [[Radical Republicans|Radicals]] had launched a major political attack on Meade. Grant's next choice was a man aggressive enough to defeat Early: Philip Sheridan, the cavalry commander of the Army of the Potomac. Sheridan took command of all forces in West Virginia, western Maryland and the [[Middle Military Division]] responsible for operations around the Shenandoah Valley. His field army was called the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]]. Sheridan initially started slowly, primarily because the impending [[U.S. presidential election, 1864|presidential election of 1864]] demanded a cautious approach, avoiding any disaster that might lead to the defeat of Abraham Lincoln.<ref>Wert, p. 16; Eicher, p. 719; Salmon, pp. 332&ndash;33; Kennedy, p. 313; Welcher, p. 1018.</ref>\n\nAfter a month of maneuvering with a few small battles between Sheridan and Early, the Confederates became complacent about the threat. Robert E. Lee ordered Maj. Gen. [[Joseph B. Kershaw]]'s division to return to Richmond on September 16. Sheridan reacted immediately and struck Early with his entire force near [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], on September 19. The [[Battle of Opequon]] (the Third Battle of Winchester) was the largest of the campaign and Early sustained ruinous casualties. His army retreated to the south, taking up defensive positions on a long ridge called Fisher's Hill. Although this position was theoretically nearly impregnable, Early lacked the manpower to hold the entire line in strength. Sheridan hit Early in a [[flanking maneuver|flanking attack]] on September 22, again routing the Confederates, who retreated to [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]].<ref>Welcher, pp. 1024&ndash;32; Eicher, pp. 743&ndash;47; Salmon, pp. 334&ndash;35; Kennedy, pp. 315&ndash;18.</ref>\n\nWith Early damaged and pinned down, the Valley lay open to the Union. And because of Sherman's capture of [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta]], Lincoln's re-election now seemed assured. Sheridan pulled back slowly down the Valley and conducted a [[scorched earth]] campaign that would foreshadow [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] in November. The goal was to deny the Confederacy the means of feeding its armies in Virginia, and Sheridan's army did so aggressively, burning crops, barns, mills, and factories. The operation, conducted primarily from September 26 to October 8, has been known to locals ever since as \"the Burning\" or \"Red October\". It encompassed the area of Harrisonburg, Port Republic, Staunton and Waynesboro. Early was reinforced by the return of Kershaw's division and the arrival of Maj. Gen. [[Thomas L. Rosser]]'s cavalry division. As Sheridan began to withdraw down the Valley and Early began to pursue, Union cavalry defeated Rosser at [[Battle of Tom's Brook|Tom's Brook]] on October 9. The Union army encamped north of Cedar Creek, in parts of [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]], [[Shenandoah County|Shenandoah]] and [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren]] counties.<ref>Grimsley, pp. 167&ndash;68; Wert, pp. 144, 158; Lewis, p. 59; Eicher, p. 748; Salmon, pp. 335&ndash;36; Kennedy, p. 318.</ref>\n\n===Prelude to battle===\n[[File:ScottBattleCedarCr400.JPG|thumb|''The First Vermont Brigade at the Battle of Cedar Creek'', by [[Julian Scott]] (1870)]]\n\nBelieving that Early could no longer muster attacks after more than a month of battling, Sheridan ordered the [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[Horatio G. Wright]] to return to the [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]] siege lines. However, Early's troops arrived at Hupp's Hill, just north of Strasburg, on October 13, deployed in battle formation, and began shelling Federal camps around Belle Grove plantation. Col. [[Joseph Thoburn]]'s Union division moved forward to silence the guns and engaged in a sharp fight with Kershaw's division, resulting in 209 Union casualties, 182 Confederate. Sheridan recalled Wright's corps, which by this time had reached [[Ashby Gap|Ashby's Gap]] in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He departed on October 16 for a conference in Washington with [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]], accompanied by his Cavalry Corps as far as [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], intending that those two divisions would then raid the [[Virginia Central Railroad]]. However, Sheridan changed his plan when he was notified that Early was sending [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War#Wig-wag signaling|wig-wag signals]] implying that Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]'s corps might join him from Petersburg. This was disinformation on Early's part, hoping that it would induce the Federals to withdraw down the Valley, but instead Sheridan brought all of his forces back to the camps along Cedar Creek.<ref>Cullen, pp. 111&ndash;12; Patchan, pp. 8&ndash;12; Eicher, p. 748; Salmon, p. 336; Welcher, p. 1037.</ref>\n\nIn a letter of October 12, 1864, Lee told Early, \"You had better move against him and endeavor to crush him. ... I do not think Sheridan's infantry or cavalry numerically as large as you suppose.\" Early examined the Union position behind Cedar Creek and found an opening. Expecting an attack across the open valley floor to the west, the Union left relied on natural obstacles for cover. Furthermore, Sheridan expected each of his subordinate commands to provide for its own security, using [[Picket (military)|pickets]] deployed well forward of their camps. General Crook's army was not accustomed to that practice and discounted Sheridan's guidance, leaving the Union left more vulnerable. Gordon observed this vulnerability while surveying the Union position from the Confederate Signal Corps position at [[Signal Knob]] and devised a plan for a surprise attack that he shared with Early upon returning to Strasburg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cebe/learn/historyculture/signal-knob.htm | title=Signal Knob | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=2019-10-20}}</ref> Early's choice was either to retire from the area to replenish his dwindling supplies or to attack. He chose boldness and, using surprise to his advantage, planned an assault on superior forces&mdash;across the [[Shenandoah River#North Fork Shenandoah River|North Fork of the Shenandoah River]] and Cedar Creek to attack the Union left, rolling up the line and defeating each part in detail.<ref>Wert, pp. 171&ndash;74; Whitehorne, p. 11.</ref>\n\nOn October 18, the eve of battle, Sheridan was spending the night in Winchester, on his way back from the Washington conference. Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright was in temporary command of the Army of the Shenandoah.<ref>Welcher, p. 1038; Salmon, p. 368.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Cedar Creek Union order of battle|l1=Union order of battle}}\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#99ccff\"|Key Union commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|<center>Maj.

Gordon's column (the divisions of Ramseur, Pegram and Evans), with the farthest to march, departed just after it became dark, about 8 p.m. They stealthily followed a narrow path (a \"pig path\") between the Shenandoah and the nose of Massanutten Mountain, previously scouted by Gordon and mapmaker, Maj. [[Jedediah Hotchkiss]]. The path required single file passage in places, and did not support the movement of artillery. The columns of Wharton and Kershaw departed at about 1 a.m. on October 19, and all three columns of infantry were in position by 3:30&nbsp;a.m. Rosser's cavalry prepared to advance along the western side of the valley to attack in the vicinity of Cupp's Ford. The 300-man cavalry brigade of Col. William H. Payne, Rosser's division, was assigned to lead Gordon's men to the battle and then break off in an attempt to reach Belle Grove and capture General Sheridan from his headquarters. The Confederates were unaware that Sheridan was not present that morning. Lomax's cavalry was to advance on the Front Royal&ndash;Winchester Road to cut off any Union withdrawal in the area of Newtown (current [[Stephens City, Virginia|Stephens City]]).<ref>Cullen, pp. 112&ndash;15; Patchan, pp. 16&ndash;19; Lewis, pp. 185, 232; Kennedy, p. 322; Welcher, pp. 1039&ndash;40.</ref>\n\nSurprise was virtually complete and most of the Army of West Virginia troops were caught unprepared in their camps. The Confederates' quiet approach was aided by the presence of heavy fog. Kershaw's Division attacked the trenches of Col. Joseph Thoburn's division at 5 a.m. A few minutes later, Gordon's column attacked the position of Col. Rutherford B. Hayes's division. Crook's division-sized \"army\" was overwhelmed and many fled, half-dressed, in panic. A brigade under Col. Thomas Wildes was one of the more alert units, and it conducted a fighting withdrawal over 30 minutes to the Valley Pike. Heroic leadership by Capt. [[Henry A. du Pont]], acting chief of Crook's artillery, saved nine of his sixteen cannons while he kept them in action, stalling the Confederate advance, eventually establishing a rallying point for the Union north of Middletown. (Du Pont later received the [[Medal of Honor]] and a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] for his efforts.)<ref>Wert, pp. 180&ndash;83; Patchan, pp. 19&ndash;24; Lewis, pp. 192&ndash;98; Kennedy, p. 322. Coffey, p. 78, states that there is disagreement among veterans about whether it was Kershaw or Gordon who launched the first attack.</ref>\n\n[[File:The surprise at Cedar Creek.jpg|thumb|left|The Confederate attack hits the rear of the XIX Corps]]\nAt the XIX Corps camps, General Emory reacted to the sounds of battle and Crook's fleeing men entering his lines by reorienting his lines to face Gordon's oncoming attack. In doing so, he removed a covering force that was protecting a bridge over Cedar Creek, allowing Wharton's column to move forward unimpeded at 5:40&nbsp;a.m. Col. Wildes's brigade of Crook's army was ordered by Emory to stop its withdrawal, turn around, and attack the advancing Confederates to buy more time for reorienting the Union lines. General Wright accompanied Wildes and received a painful wound to his chin. The XIX Corps brigade of Col. Stephen Thomas made a similar gallant stand for over 30 minutes while McMillan's division withdrew through the thin lines of Grover's division. These actions around Belle Grove delayed the Confederates enough that most of the headquarters units and supply trains were able to withdraw to safety and the VI Corps could prepare a better defense on the high ground just northwest of the plantation.<ref>Lewis, pp. 201&ndash;204; Patchan, p. 40; Cullen, p. 116; Kennedy, p. 322; Whitehorne, pp. 19&ndash;21.</ref>\n\nThe three divisions of the VI Corps were able to establish proper defensive lines. Kiefer's division aligned itself with Cedar Creek, but as retreating XIX Corps soldiers flowed through, they were unable to hold their position and withdrew to just west of Meadow Brook. Elements of McMillan's division and Merritt's cavalry extended their line to the west. At approximately quarter after 7 in the morning, Kershaw's Division hit the line hard, gradually forcing it back. Wheaton's division, just to the north, was similarly forced back by Gordon's continued attack. The two Union divisions eventually linked up about a mile to the northeast, joining with Getty's division, which was pulling back from a fierce fight at the Middletown cemetery. Getty had originally marched his division toward the sound of battle, but when Wheaton withdrew, his men were unsupported. Briefly defending a slight rise south of Middletown, at 8 a.m. he moved his division to the town cemetery, on a hill to the west. For over an hour, Getty's division defended this position against assaults from four Confederate divisions. Jubal Early assumed by the ferocity of the defense that he was fighting the entire VI Corps. He allowed himself to become distracted, which diluted the momentum of the overall Confederate attack. Directing all of his artillery to concentrate on the cemetery position for 30 minutes, he was able to dislodge Getty's division, ordered to withdraw to the main Federal line, now being formed about a mile to the north, by temporary commander Brig. Gen. [[Lewis A. Grant]]. (The VI Corps' temporary commander, Brig. Gen. [[James B. Ricketts]], had been wounded and Getty assumed corps command.)<ref>Patchan, pp. 40&ndash;42; Lewis, pp. 213&ndash;39; Whitehorne, pp. 21&ndash;22; Welcher, p. 1042.</ref>\n\n===Sheridan's Ride===\n[[File:Sheridan s Ride.jpg|thumb|left|''Sheridan's Ride'', chromolithograph by Louis Prang & Co.]]\nSheridan was at Winchester at the start of the battle. At 6 a.m., pickets south of Winchester reported back that they heard the distant sounds of artillery. Not expecting any significant action from Early that day, Sheridan dismissed the report. As additional reports arrived, he assumed it was \"Grover's division banging away at the enemy simply to find out what he was up to\", but he ordered his horse, Rienzi, to be saddled and ate a quick breakfast. At 9 a.m. he departed with three staff officers, and soon he was joined by a 300-man cavalry escort, and with them he rode aggressively to his command. He noticed that the sounds of battle were increasing in volume quickly, so he inferred that his army was retreating in his direction. At Newtown, he ordered a young officer from Crook's staff, Capt. [[William McKinley]] (elected President 32 years later, in 1896), to set up a line that would intercept stragglers and send them back to the battlefield. He reached the battle about 10:30&nbsp;a.m. and began to rally his men to complete the defensive line north of Middletown that General Wright had begun to organize. His presence electrified the Union soldiers and he shouted, \"Come on back, boys! Give 'em hell, God damn 'em! We'll make coffee out of Cedar Creek tonight!\"<ref>Lewis, pp. 243&ndash;48; Welcher, p. 1043; Cullen, pp. 110&ndash;11; Coffey, pp. 87&ndash;88; Patchan, pp. 43&ndash;45, states that there were 20 in the escort.</ref>\n\nGeneral Sheridan wrote in his official report an account of the famous ride:\n\n{{Quote|[I] was unconscious of the true condition of affairs until about 9 o'clock, when having ridden through the town of Winchester, the sound of the artillery made a battle unmistakable, and on reaching Mill Creek, half a mile south of Winchester, the head of the fugitives appeared in sight, trains and men coming to the rear with appalling rapidity. I immediately gave directions to halt and park the trains at Mill Creek, and ordered the brigade at Winchester to stretch across the country and stop all stragglers. Taking twenty men from my escort, I pushed on to the front, leaving the balance under General Forsyth and Colonels Thom and Alexander to do what they could in stemming the torrent of fugitives. I am happy to say that hundreds of the men, when of reflection found they had not done themselves justice, came back with cheers. ... still none behaved more gallantly or exhibited greater courage than those who returned from the rear determined to reoccupy their lost camp.<ref>Report of Maj.

Sheridan, U.S. Army, commanding Middle Military Division, including operations August 4, 1864 &ndash; February 27, 1865: [[Official Records of the American Civil War|''Official Records'']], Series I, Vol. XLIII, Part 1, pp. 52&ndash;54.</ref>}}\n\n[[Thomas Buchanan Read]] wrote a popular poem, ''Sheridan's Ride'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheridan's Ride|url=http://www.bartleby.com/102/150.html))</ref> to commemorate Sheridan's exploit. The general took notice of the widespread public acclaim by renaming his horse \"Winchester\". In 1908, [[Gutzon Borglum]] created an equestrian statue of Sheridan and Winchester riding to Cedar Creek, which stands in [[Sheridan Circle]], Washington, D.C.<ref>Wert, p. 248;</ref>\n\n===The \"fatal halt\"===\n[[File:Cedar Creek Union counterattack.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Cedar Creek, Union counterattack]]\n\nFortunately for Sheridan, Early's men were too occupied to take notice of the Union general's dramatic arrival; they were hungry and exhausted and fell out of their ranks to pillage supplies from the Union camps. By 10 a.m., Jubal Early had developed a stunning Confederate victory, capturing 1,300 Union prisoners and 24 cannons, and driving seven infantry divisions off the field with a smaller force. But rather than exploiting his victory, Early ordered a halt in his offensive to reorganize, a decision for which he later received criticism from his surviving subordinates. John B. Gordon wrote years later, \"My heart went into my boots. Visions of the fatal halt on the first day at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], and of the whole day's hesitation to permit an assault on Grant's exposed flank on the 6th of May in [[Battle of the Wilderness|The Wilderness]] rose before me.\" Early wrote to Robert E. Lee, \"So many of our men had stopped in the camp to plunder (in which I am sorry to say that officers participated), the country was so open, and the enemy's cavalry so strong, that I did not deem it prudent to press further, especially as Lomax had not come up.\" The two armies stood about a mile apart in lines perpendicular to the Valley Pike. At 1 p.m. Early gave a halfhearted order to Gordon to attack the Union line, but \"not if he found the enemy's line too strong to attack with success.\" Gordon's division moved forward against the XIX Corps, with Kershaw and Ramseur ready to support them, but after firing a heavy volley into the Union line, they withdrew.<ref>Cullen, p. 118; Lewis, pp. 257&ndash;60; Patchan, pp. 42, 46; Welcher, p. 1044; Coffey, pp. 82&ndash;85.</ref>\n\n===Union counterattack===\nSheridan's boast about making coffee from Cedar Creek that evening meant that he was immediately contemplating a counterattack. He placed a cavalry division on each end of the line, which was made up of Wright's VI Corps and Emory's XIX Corps. Crook's Army of West Virginia was in reserve. While his cavalry pressed both of Early's flanks, Sheridan planned for the XIX Corps to execute a \"left half-wheel\" to the southeast, pivoting on Getty's VI Corps division, and driving the Confederates into the Pike. The main attack began at 4 p.m., meeting significant Confederate resistance north of Middletown for about an hour. Early's left flank began to crumble and Custer's cavalry raced into the Confederate rear. Many of the Confederate soldiers panicked as they envisioned their escape route across Cedar Creek being blocked by the Federal cavalrymen who had been so successful during the campaign. After the breakthrough on the Union right, Sheridan stepped up the pressure with an attack on Ramseur's Division. General Ramseur was mortally wounded and his men joined the retreat. Although the Confederate artillery made a few delaying stands along the way, Early had lost control of his army.<ref>Whitehorne, p. 24; Welcher, p. 1044; Cullen, pp. 118&ndash;19; Coffey, pp. 90&ndash;92; Patchan, pp. 46&ndash;50.</ref>\n\nThe situation worsened for the Confederates when a small bridge on the Valley Pike collapsed, making it impossible to cross with wagons or artillery over \"No Name Creek\" south of Strasburg. Early's army was forced to abandon all of the captured Union guns and wagons from the morning attack, as well as most of its own. Sheridan's pursuit ended at nightfall. The retreating Confederate soldiers gathered temporarily on Fisher's Hill and then the army retired the following day to [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]].<ref>Welcher, p. 1045; Cullen, p. 119; Patchan, p. 50.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Casualties===\nCasualties for the Union totaled 5,665 (644 killed, 3,430 wounded, 1,591 missing).

Bidwell]] and [[Charles Russell Lowell|Charles R. Lowell, Jr.]]<ref>Eicher, p. 752.</ref>\n\n===Outcome===\nThe battle was a crushing defeat for the Confederates. They were never again able to threaten the northern states through the Shenandoah Valley, nor protect the economic base in the Valley. In fact, Early still had the problem of feeding his own army. The reelection of [[Abraham Lincoln]] was materially aided by this victory and Phil Sheridan earned lasting fame. Ulysses S. Grant ordered a 100-gun salute be fired in his honor at Petersburg and he was rewarded with a promotion to major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]].<ref>Lewis, p. 292; Kennedy, p. 323.</ref>\n\n===Reactions and effects===\nJubal Early told Jed Hotchkiss that night that the \"fatal halt\" occurred because, \"the Yankees got whipped and we got scared\". But he soon became bitter about his defeat, heaping blame on his soldiers. He wrote to Robert E. Lee, \"but for ''their'' bad conduct ''I'' should have defeated Sheridan's whole force.\" Three days after the battle he addressed his army: \"Many of you, including some commissioned officers, yielded to a disgraceful propensity for plunder. ... Subsequently those who had remained at their post, seeing their ranks thinned by the absence of the plunderer ... yielded to a needless panic and fled the field in confusion.\"<ref>Bohannon, pp. 78, 71; Kennedy, pp. 323&ndash;24; Welcher, pp. 1047.</ref>\n\nEarly's military career was effectively ended. His surviving units returned to the Army of Northern Virginia in [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]] that December. He was left for the winter with a command of fewer than 3,000 men at Waynesboro. On March 2, 1865, Sheridan marched his command to join Grant in Petersburg and Custer's cavalry division routed Early's small command along the way. Early escaped with a small escort and spent the next two weeks running from Federal patrols before reporting to Lee's headquarters. On March 30, Lee told him to go home.<ref>Lewis, pp. 297&ndash;98.</ref>\n\n==Medals of Honor==\n{{Main|List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Battle of Cedar Creek}}\n\nTwelve Union enlisted men and nine officers received the [[Medal of Honor]] for their actions in the Battle of Cedar Creek.

[[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Jubal Early]] launched a surprise attack against the encamped army of [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Philip Sheridan]], across [[Cedar Creek (North Fork Shenandoah River)|Cedar Creek]], northeast of [[Strasburg, Virginia]]. During the morning fighting, seven Union infantry divisions were forced to fall back and lost numerous prisoners and cannons. Early failed to continue his attack north of [[Middletown, Virginia|Middletown]], and Sheridan, dramatically riding to the battlefield from [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], was able to rally his troops to hold a new defensive line. A Union counterattack that afternoon routed Early's army.\n\nAt the conclusion of this battle, the final Confederate invasion of the North was effectively ended. The Confederacy was never again able to threaten [[Washington, D.C.]] through the [[Shenandoah Valley]], nor protect one of its key economic bases in Virginia. The stunning Union victory aided the [[1864 United States presidential election|reelection]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and won Sheridan lasting fame.\n\n==Background==\n===Military situation===\n{{Main|Valley Campaigns of 1864#Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (August&ndash;October 1864)|l1=Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (August&ndash;October 1864)|Third Battle of Winchester|Battle of Fisher's Hill}}\n{{further|Overland Campaign|Valley Campaigns of 1864|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}\n\n===Grant's strategy in 1864===\nAt the beginning of 1864, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]] and given command of all [[Union Army|Union]] armies. He chose to make his headquarters with the [[Army of the Potomac]], although [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]] remained the actual commander of that army. He left Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Sherman and President Lincoln, that only the utter defeat of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war. Therefore, [[scorched earth]] tactics would be required in some important theaters. He devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of the Confederacy from multiple directions: Grant, Meade, and Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] against [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] near [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; Sherman to invade [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and capture [[Atlanta]] and Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].<ref>Salmon, p. 251.</ref>\n\n===Shenandoah Valley===\n[[File:Shenandoah Valley May-July 1864.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Shenandoah Valley operations, May&ndash;July 1864]]\nThe final coordinated offensive was to be conducted by Maj. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]] through the Shenandoah Valley. During the Civil War, the Valley was one of the most important geographic features of Virginia. The watershed of the [[Shenandoah River]] passed between the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] on the east and the [[Allegheny Mountains]] to the west, extending {{convert|165|miles|km|-1}} southwest from the [[Potomac River]] at [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]] and [[Harpers Ferry]], at an average width of {{convert|25|miles|km}}. By the conventions of local residents, the \"upper Valley\" referred to the southwestern end, which had a generally higher elevation than the lower Valley to the northeast. Moving \"up the Valley\" meant traveling southwest, for instance. Between the North and South Forks of the Shenandoah River, [[Massanutten Mountain]] soared {{convert|2900|ft|m|-2}} and separated the Valley into two halves for about {{convert|50|miles|km|-1}}, from [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] to [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]]. During the 19th century, there was but a single road that crossed over the mountain, from [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]] to Luray.<ref>Gallagher, pp. 2&ndash;3; Wert, p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe Valley offered two strategic advantages to the Confederates. First, a Northern army invading Virginia could be subjected to Confederate flanking attacks pouring through the many [[wind gap (geographical feature)|wind gaps]] across the Blue Ridge. Second, the Valley offered a protected corridor that allowed Confederate armies to head north into Pennsylvania unimpeded, and a hard-surfaced road, the [[Valley Pike]] (current [[U.S. Route 11]]), allowed relatively swift movement. This was the route taken by Lee to invade the North in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] of 1863. In contrast, the orientation of the Valley offered little advantage to a Northern army headed toward Richmond. But denying the Valley to the Confederacy would be a significant blow. It was an agriculturally rich area&mdash;the 2.5 million bushels of wheat produced in 1860, for example, accounted for about 19% of the crop in the entire state and the Valley was also rich in livestock that was used to provision Virginia's armies and the Confederate capital of Richmond. [[Mark Grimsley]], writing in ''The Hard Hand of War'', argues that by 1864 Lee was receiving most of his supplies from the [[Deep South]], so that the agricultural importance of the Valley has been overstated. The Union wanted to control it to close the invasion route to the North and to deny the use of its supplies to guerrillas operating in the area. If the Federals could capture [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] in the upper Valley, they would threaten the vital [[Virginia and Tennessee Railroad]], which ran from Richmond to the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Grimsley, pp. 167&ndash;68; Wert, pp. 27&ndash;28.</ref>\n\n===Sigel and Hunter===\nSigel, in command of the Department of [[West Virginia]], had orders from Grant to move \"up the Valley\" with 10,000 men to destroy the railroad center at [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]]. Sigel's force was quickly intercepted by 4,000 Confederate troops under Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]], and defeated at the [[Battle of New Market]] on May 15. He retreated to Strasburg and was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[David Hunter]]. Hunter resumed the Union offensive and defeated Brig. Gen. [[William E. Jones|William E. \"Grumble\" Jones]], who was killed in the [[Battle of Piedmont]] on June 6. Hunter occupied Staunton and joined with Brig. Gen. [[George Crook]]. His force of 20,000 men, ordered by Grant to live off the land, began a campaign of destruction.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 298&ndash;303; Eicher, pp. 691&ndash;94; Salmon, pp. 329&ndash;30.</ref>\n\n===Early's campaign===\nGen. Robert E. Lee, whose Army of Northern Virginia was being maneuvered by Grant into a siege around Richmond and [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], was also concerned about Hunter's advances in the Valley. He sent his [[Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Second Corps]], now designated the [[Army of the Valley]], under [[Jubal Early]] to sweep Union forces from the Valley and, if possible, to menace [[Washington, D.C.]], hoping to compel Grant to dilute his forces around Petersburg. Early was operating in the shadow of [[Thomas J. Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]], whose 1862 [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]] against superior forces was fabled in Confederate history.<ref>Kennedy, p. 305; Eicher, p. 715; Salmon, p. 331.</ref>\n\nEarly got off to a good start. He drove down the Valley without opposition, bypassed [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], crossed the [[Potomac River]], and advanced into [[Maryland]]. Grant dispatched a corps under Maj. Gen. [[Horatio G. Wright]] and other troops under Crook to reinforce Washington and pursue Early. Early defeated a smaller force under Maj. Gen. [[Lew Wallace]] in the [[Battle of Monocacy]] on July 9, but this battle delayed his progress enough to allow time for the reinforcement of the defenses of Washington. Early attempted some tentative attacks against [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]] (July 11&ndash;12) on the northern outskirts of Washington, but then withdrew to Virginia. A number of small battles ensued as the Union pursued, including the defeat of Crook at the [[Second Battle of Kernstown]] on July 24.<ref>Eicher, pp. 715&ndash;18; Salmon, pp. 331&ndash;32; Kennedy, pp. 305&ndash;312; Welcher, p. 1017.</ref>\n\n===Sheridan's campaign===\n[[File:Shenandoah Valley August-October 1864.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Shenandoah Valley operations, August 1864 &ndash; March 1865]]\nGrant decided that Early's threat had to be eliminated, particularly in the wake of a cavalry raid that burned [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]]. He saw that Washington had to be heavily defended as long as Early was still on the loose. One problem was that Early's moves cut through four federal departments. Grant considered unity of command to be essential and recommended [[George Meade]] for the position, but Lincoln vetoed that because [[Radical Republicans|Radicals]] had launched a major political attack on Meade. Grant's next choice was a man aggressive enough to defeat Early: Philip Sheridan, the cavalry commander of the Army of the Potomac. Sheridan took command of all forces in West Virginia, western Maryland and the [[Middle Military Division]] responsible for operations around the Shenandoah Valley. His field army was called the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]]. Sheridan initially started slowly, primarily because the impending [[U.S. presidential election, 1864|presidential election of 1864]] demanded a cautious approach, avoiding any disaster that might lead to the defeat of Abraham Lincoln.<ref>Wert, p. 16; Eicher, p. 719; Salmon, pp. 332&ndash;33; Kennedy, p. 313; Welcher, p. 1018.</ref>\n\nAfter a month of maneuvering with a few small battles between Sheridan and Early, the Confederates became complacent about the threat. Robert E. Lee ordered Maj. Gen. [[Joseph B. Kershaw]]'s division to return to Richmond on September 16. Sheridan reacted immediately and struck Early with his entire force near [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], on September 19. The [[Battle of Opequon]] (the Third Battle of Winchester) was the largest of the campaign and Early sustained ruinous casualties. His army retreated to the south, taking up defensive positions on a long ridge called Fisher's Hill. Although this position was theoretically nearly impregnable, Early lacked the manpower to hold the entire line in strength. Sheridan hit Early in a [[flanking maneuver|flanking attack]] on September 22, again routing the Confederates, who retreated to [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]].<ref>Welcher, pp. 1024&ndash;32; Eicher, pp. 743&ndash;47; Salmon, pp. 334&ndash;35; Kennedy, pp. 315&ndash;18.</ref>\n\nWith Early damaged and pinned down, the Valley lay open to the Union. And because of Sherman's capture of [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta]], Lincoln's re-election now seemed assured. Sheridan pulled back slowly down the Valley and conducted a [[scorched earth]] campaign that would foreshadow [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] in November. The goal was to deny the Confederacy the means of feeding its armies in Virginia, and Sheridan's army did so aggressively, burning crops, barns, mills, and factories. The operation, conducted primarily from September 26 to October 8, has been known to locals ever since as \"the Burning\" or \"Red October\". It encompassed the area of Harrisonburg, Port Republic, Staunton and Waynesboro. Early was reinforced by the return of Kershaw's division and the arrival of Maj. Gen. [[Thomas L. Rosser]]'s cavalry division. As Sheridan began to withdraw down the Valley and Early began to pursue, Union cavalry defeated Rosser at [[Battle of Tom's Brook|Tom's Brook]] on October 9. The Union army encamped north of Cedar Creek, in parts of [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]], [[Shenandoah County|Shenandoah]] and [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren]] counties.<ref>Grimsley, pp. 167&ndash;68; Wert, pp. 144, 158; Lewis, p. 59; Eicher, p. 748; Salmon, pp. 335&ndash;36; Kennedy, p. 318.</ref>\n\n===Prelude to battle===\n[[File:ScottBattleCedarCr400.JPG|thumb|''The First Vermont Brigade at the Battle of Cedar Creek'', by [[Julian Scott]] (1870)]]\n\nBelieving that Early could no longer muster attacks after more than a month of battling, Sheridan ordered the [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[Horatio G. Wright]] to return to the [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]] siege lines. However, Early's troops arrived at Hupp's Hill, just north of Strasburg, on October 13, deployed in battle formation, and began shelling Federal camps around Belle Grove plantation. Col. [[Joseph Thoburn]]'s Union division moved forward to silence the guns and engaged in a sharp fight with Kershaw's division, resulting in 209 Union casualties, 182 Confederate. Sheridan recalled Wright's corps, which by this time had reached [[Ashby Gap|Ashby's Gap]] in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He departed on October 16 for a conference in Washington with [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]], accompanied by his Cavalry Corps as far as [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], intending that those two divisions would then raid the [[Virginia Central Railroad]]. However, Sheridan changed his plan when he was notified that Early was sending [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War#Wig-wag signaling|wig-wag signals]] implying that Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]'s corps might join him from Petersburg. This was disinformation on Early's part, hoping that it would induce the Federals to withdraw down the Valley, but instead Sheridan brought all of his forces back to the camps along Cedar Creek.<ref>Cullen, pp. 111&ndash;12; Patchan, pp. 8&ndash;12; Eicher, p. 748; Salmon, p. 336; Welcher, p. 1037.</ref>\n\nIn a letter of October 12, 1864, Lee told Early, \"You had better move against him and endeavor to crush him. ... I do not think Sheridan's infantry or cavalry numerically as large as you suppose.\" Early examined the Union position behind Cedar Creek and found an opening. Expecting an attack across the open valley floor to the west, the Union left relied on natural obstacles for cover. Furthermore, Sheridan expected each of his subordinate commands to provide for its own security, using [[Picket (military)|pickets]] deployed well forward of their camps. General Crook's army was not accustomed to that practice and discounted Sheridan's guidance, leaving the Union left more vulnerable. Gordon observed this vulnerability while surveying the Union position from the Confederate Signal Corps position at [[Signal Knob]] and devised a plan for a surprise attack that he shared with Early upon returning to Strasburg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cebe/learn/historyculture/signal-knob.htm | title=Signal Knob | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=2019-10-20}}</ref> Early's choice was either to retire from the area to replenish his dwindling supplies or to attack. He chose boldness and, using surprise to his advantage, planned an assault on superior forces&mdash;across the [[Shenandoah River#North Fork Shenandoah River|North Fork of the Shenandoah River]] and Cedar Creek to attack the Union left, rolling up the line and defeating each part in detail.<ref>Wert, pp. 171&ndash;74; Whitehorne, p. 11.</ref>\n\nOn October 18, the eve of battle, Sheridan was spending the night in Winchester, on his way back from the Washington conference. Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright was in temporary command of the Army of the Shenandoah.<ref>Welcher, p. 1038; Salmon, p. 368.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Cedar Creek Union order of battle|l1=Union order of battle}}\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#99ccff\"|Key Union commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|<center>Maj.

Gordon's column (the divisions of Ramseur, Pegram and Evans), with the farthest to march, departed just after it became dark, about 8 p.m. They stealthily followed a narrow path (a \"pig path\") between the Shenandoah and the nose of Massanutten Mountain, previously scouted by Gordon and mapmaker, Maj. [[Jedediah Hotchkiss]]. The path required single file passage in places, and did not support the movement of artillery. The columns of Wharton and Kershaw departed at about 1 a.m. on October 19, and all three columns of infantry were in position by 3:30&nbsp;a.m. Rosser's cavalry prepared to advance along the western side of the valley to attack in the vicinity of Cupp's Ford. The 300-man cavalry brigade of Col. William H. Payne, Rosser's division, was assigned to lead Gordon's men to the battle and then break off in an attempt to reach Belle Grove and capture General Sheridan from his headquarters. The Confederates were unaware that Sheridan was not present that morning. Lomax's cavalry was to advance on the Front Royal&ndash;Winchester Road to cut off any Union withdrawal in the area of Newtown (current [[Stephens City, Virginia|Stephens City]]).<ref>Cullen, pp. 112&ndash;15; Patchan, pp. 16&ndash;19; Lewis, pp. 185, 232; Kennedy, p. 322; Welcher, pp. 1039&ndash;40.</ref>\n\nSurprise was virtually complete and most of the Army of West Virginia troops were caught unprepared in their camps. The Confederates' quiet approach was aided by the presence of heavy fog. Kershaw's Division attacked the trenches of Col. Joseph Thoburn's division at 5 a.m. A few minutes later, Gordon's column attacked the position of Col. Rutherford B. Hayes's division. Crook's division-sized \"army\" was overwhelmed and many fled, half-dressed, in panic. A brigade under Col. Thomas Wildes was one of the more alert units, and it conducted a fighting withdrawal over 30 minutes to the Valley Pike. Heroic leadership by Capt. [[Henry A. du Pont]], acting chief of Crook's artillery, saved nine of his sixteen cannons while he kept them in action, stalling the Confederate advance, eventually establishing a rallying point for the Union north of Middletown. (Du Pont later received the [[Medal of Honor]] and a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] for his efforts.)<ref>Wert, pp. 180&ndash;83; Patchan, pp. 19&ndash;24; Lewis, pp. 192&ndash;98; Kennedy, p. 322. Coffey, p. 78, states that there is disagreement among veterans about whether it was Kershaw or Gordon who launched the first attack.</ref>\n\n[[File:The surprise at Cedar Creek.jpg|thumb|left|The Confederate attack hits the rear of the XIX Corps]]\nAt the XIX Corps camps, General Emory reacted to the sounds of battle and Crook's fleeing men entering his lines by reorienting his lines to face Gordon's oncoming attack. In doing so, he removed a covering force that was protecting a bridge over Cedar Creek, allowing Wharton's column to move forward unimpeded at 5:40&nbsp;a.m. Col. Wildes's brigade of Crook's army was ordered by Emory to stop its withdrawal, turn around, and attack the advancing Confederates to buy more time for reorienting the Union lines. General Wright accompanied Wildes and received a painful wound to his chin. The XIX Corps brigade of Col. Stephen Thomas made a similar gallant stand for over 30 minutes while McMillan's division withdrew through the thin lines of Grover's division. These actions around Belle Grove delayed the Confederates enough that most of the headquarters units and supply trains were able to withdraw to safety and the VI Corps could prepare a better defense on the high ground just northwest of the plantation.<ref>Lewis, pp. 201&ndash;204; Patchan, p. 40; Cullen, p. 116; Kennedy, p. 322; Whitehorne, pp. 19&ndash;21.</ref>\n\nThe three divisions of the VI Corps were able to establish proper defensive lines. Kiefer's division aligned itself with Cedar Creek, but as retreating XIX Corps soldiers flowed through, they were unable to hold their position and withdrew to just west of Meadow Brook. Elements of McMillan's division and Merritt's cavalry extended their line to the west. At approximately quarter after 7 in the morning, Kershaw's Division hit the line hard, gradually forcing it back. Wheaton's division, just to the north, was similarly forced back by Gordon's continued attack. The two Union divisions eventually linked up about a mile to the northeast, joining with Getty's division, which was pulling back from a fierce fight at the Middletown cemetery. Getty had originally marched his division toward the sound of battle, but when Wheaton withdrew, his men were unsupported. Briefly defending a slight rise south of Middletown, at 8 a.m. he moved his division to the town cemetery, on a hill to the west. For over an hour, Getty's division defended this position against assaults from four Confederate divisions. Jubal Early assumed by the ferocity of the defense that he was fighting the entire VI Corps. He allowed himself to become distracted, which diluted the momentum of the overall Confederate attack. Directing all of his artillery to concentrate on the cemetery position for 30 minutes, he was able to dislodge Getty's division, ordered to withdraw to the main Federal line, now being formed about a mile to the north, by temporary commander Brig. Gen. [[Lewis A. Grant]]. (The VI Corps' temporary commander, Brig. Gen. [[James B. Ricketts]], had been wounded and Getty assumed corps command.)<ref>Patchan, pp. 40&ndash;42; Lewis, pp. 213&ndash;39; Whitehorne, pp. 21&ndash;22; Welcher, p. 1042.</ref>\n\n===Sheridan's Ride===\n[[File:Sheridan s Ride.jpg|thumb|left|''Sheridan's Ride'', chromolithograph by Louis Prang & Co.]]\nSheridan was at Winchester at the start of the battle. At 6 a.m., pickets south of Winchester reported back that they heard the distant sounds of artillery. Not expecting any significant action from Early that day, Sheridan dismissed the report. As additional reports arrived, he assumed it was \"Grover's division banging away at the enemy simply to find out what he was up to\", but he ordered his horse, Rienzi, to be saddled and ate a quick breakfast. At 9 a.m. he departed with three staff officers, and soon he was joined by a 300-man cavalry escort, and with them he rode aggressively to his command. He noticed that the sounds of battle were increasing in volume quickly, so he inferred that his army was retreating in his direction. At Newtown, he ordered a young officer from Crook's staff, Capt. [[William McKinley]] (elected President 32 years later, in 1896), to set up a line that would intercept stragglers and send them back to the battlefield. He reached the battle about 10:30&nbsp;a.m. and began to rally his men to complete the defensive line north of Middletown that General Wright had begun to organize. His presence electrified the Union soldiers and he shouted, \"Come on back, boys! Give 'em hell, God damn 'em! We'll make coffee out of Cedar Creek tonight!\"<ref>Lewis, pp. 243&ndash;48; Welcher, p. 1043; Cullen, pp. 110&ndash;11; Coffey, pp. 87&ndash;88; Patchan, pp. 43&ndash;45, states that there were 20 in the escort.</ref>\n\nGeneral Sheridan wrote in his official report an account of the famous ride:\n\n{{Quote|[I] was unconscious of the true condition of affairs until about 9 o'clock, when having ridden through the town of Winchester, the sound of the artillery made a battle unmistakable, and on reaching Mill Creek, half a mile south of Winchester, the head of the fugitives appeared in sight, trains and men coming to the rear with appalling rapidity. I immediately gave directions to halt and park the trains at Mill Creek, and ordered the brigade at Winchester to stretch across the country and stop all stragglers. Taking twenty men from my escort, I pushed on to the front, leaving the balance under General Forsyth and Colonels Thom and Alexander to do what they could in stemming the torrent of fugitives. I am happy to say that hundreds of the men, when of reflection found they had not done themselves justice, came back with cheers. ... still none behaved more gallantly or exhibited greater courage than those who returned from the rear determined to reoccupy their lost camp.<ref>Report of Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan, U.S. Army, commanding Middle Military Division, including operations August 4, 1864 &ndash; February 27, 1865: [[Official Records of the American Civil War|''Official Records'']], Series I, Vol. XLIII, Part 1, pp. 52&ndash;54.</ref>}}\n\n[[Thomas Buchanan Read]] wrote a popular poem, ''Sheridan's Ride'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheridan's Ride|url=http://www.bartleby.com/102/150.html))</ref> to commemorate Sheridan's exploit. The general took notice of the widespread public acclaim by renaming his horse \"Winchester\". In 1908, [[Gutzon Borglum]] created an equestrian statue of Sheridan and Winchester riding to Cedar Creek, which stands in [[Sheridan Circle]], Washington, D.C.<ref>Wert, p. 248;</ref>\n\n===The \"fatal halt\"===\n[[File:Cedar Creek Union counterattack.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Cedar Creek, Union counterattack]]\n\nFortunately for Sheridan, Early's men were too occupied to take notice of the Union general's dramatic arrival; they were hungry and exhausted and fell out of their ranks to pillage supplies from the Union camps. By 10 a.m., Jubal Early had developed a stunning Confederate victory, capturing 1,300 Union prisoners and 24 cannons, and driving seven infantry divisions off the field with a smaller force. But rather than exploiting his victory, Early ordered a halt in his offensive to reorganize, a decision for which he later received criticism from his surviving subordinates. John B. Gordon wrote years later, \"My heart went into my boots. Visions of the fatal halt on the first day at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], and of the whole day's hesitation to permit an assault on Grant's exposed flank on the 6th of May in [[Battle of the Wilderness|The Wilderness]] rose before me.\" Early wrote to Robert E. Lee, \"So many of our men had stopped in the camp to plunder (in which I am sorry to say that officers participated), the country was so open, and the enemy's cavalry so strong, that I did not deem it prudent to press further, especially as Lomax had not come up.\" The two armies stood about a mile apart in lines perpendicular to the Valley Pike. At 1 p.m. Early gave a halfhearted order to Gordon to attack the Union line, but \"not if he found the enemy's line too strong to attack with success.\" Gordon's division moved forward against the XIX Corps, with Kershaw and Ramseur ready to support them, but after firing a heavy volley into the Union line, they withdrew.<ref>Cullen, p. 118; Lewis, pp. 257&ndash;60; Patchan, pp. 42, 46; Welcher, p. 1044; Coffey, pp. 82&ndash;85.</ref>\n\n===Union counterattack===\nSheridan's boast about making coffee from Cedar Creek that evening meant that he was immediately contemplating a counterattack. He placed a cavalry division on each end of the line, which was made up of Wright's VI Corps and Emory's XIX Corps. Crook's Army of West Virginia was in reserve. While his cavalry pressed both of Early's flanks, Sheridan planned for the XIX Corps to execute a \"left half-wheel\" to the southeast, pivoting on Getty's VI Corps division, and driving the Confederates into the Pike. The main attack began at 4 p.m., meeting significant Confederate resistance north of Middletown for about an hour. Early's left flank began to crumble and Custer's cavalry raced into the Confederate rear. Many of the Confederate soldiers panicked as they envisioned their escape route across Cedar Creek being blocked by the Federal cavalrymen who had been so successful during the campaign. After the breakthrough on the Union right, Sheridan stepped up the pressure with an attack on Ramseur's Division. General Ramseur was mortally wounded and his men joined the retreat. Although the Confederate artillery made a few delaying stands along the way, Early had lost control of his army.<ref>Whitehorne, p. 24; Welcher, p. 1044; Cullen, pp. 118&ndash;19; Coffey, pp. 90&ndash;92; Patchan, pp. 46&ndash;50.</ref>\n\nThe situation worsened for the Confederates when a small bridge on the Valley Pike collapsed, making it impossible to cross with wagons or artillery over \"No Name Creek\" south of Strasburg. Early's army was forced to abandon all of the captured Union guns and wagons from the morning attack, as well as most of its own. Sheridan's pursuit ended at nightfall. The retreating Confederate soldiers gathered temporarily on Fisher's Hill and then the army retired the following day to [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]].<ref>Welcher, p. 1045; Cullen, p. 119; Patchan, p. 50.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Casualties===\nCasualties for the Union totaled 5,665 (644 killed, 3,430 wounded, 1,591 missing).

Bidwell]] and [[Charles Russell Lowell|Charles R. Lowell, Jr.]]<ref>Eicher, p. 752.</ref>\n\n===Outcome===\nThe battle was a crushing defeat for the Confederates. They were never again able to threaten the northern states through the Shenandoah Valley, nor protect the economic base in the Valley. In fact, Early still had the problem of feeding his own army. The reelection of [[Abraham Lincoln]] was materially aided by this victory and Phil Sheridan earned lasting fame. Ulysses S. Grant ordered a 100-gun salute be fired in his honor at Petersburg and he was rewarded with a promotion to major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]].<ref>Lewis, p. 292; Kennedy, p. 323.</ref>\n\n===Reactions and effects===\nJubal Early told Jed Hotchkiss that night that the \"fatal halt\" occurred because, \"the Yankees got whipped and we got scared\". But he soon became bitter about his defeat, heaping blame on his soldiers. He wrote to Robert E. Lee, \"but for ''their'' bad conduct ''I'' should have defeated Sheridan's whole force.\" Three days after the battle he addressed his army: \"Many of you, including some commissioned officers, yielded to a disgraceful propensity for plunder. ... Subsequently those who had remained at their post, seeing their ranks thinned by the absence of the plunderer ... yielded to a needless panic and fled the field in confusion.\"<ref>Bohannon, pp. 78, 71; Kennedy, pp. 323&ndash;24; Welcher, pp. 1047.</ref>\n\nEarly's military career was effectively ended. His surviving units returned to the Army of Northern Virginia in [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]] that December. He was left for the winter with a command of fewer than 3,000 men at Waynesboro. On March 2, 1865, Sheridan marched his command to join Grant in Petersburg and Custer's cavalry division routed Early's small command along the way. Early escaped with a small escort and spent the next two weeks running from Federal patrols before reporting to Lee's headquarters. On March 30, Lee told him to go home.<ref>Lewis, pp. 297&ndash;98.</ref>\n\n==Medals of Honor==\n{{Main|List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Battle of Cedar Creek}}\n\nTwelve Union enlisted men and nine officers received the [[Medal of Honor]] for their actions in the Battle of Cedar Creek.
