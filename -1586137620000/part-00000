Although he is considered to be greedy by [[1UP.com]], Rich Amtower and Reiko Ninomiya, members of Nintendo's Treehouse localization team, disagreed; describing him as a nice person. Amtower described him as \"that first boss you ever had\", adding that, \"despite him being all business and not always having the time for pleasantries, Nook isn't a bad person; because he hired someone new to town. Due to that involving risk, it shows generosity\". Ninomiya agreed, and both felt that Nook's greed is diminished by the city's price index compared to that of his shop. Amtower jokingly alludes to an \"anti-Nook bias\" several times throughout the interview with 1UP.com.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Animal Crossing: City Folk Afterthoughts from 1UP.com |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3172032 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013141517/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3172032 |archive-date=2012-10-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''D\u014dbutsu no Mori'' (2001, [[Nintendo 64]])\n*''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'' (2001, [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]])\n*''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World]]'' (2005, [[Nintendo DS]])\n*[[D\u014dbutsu no Mori (film)|''D\u014dbutsu no Mori'' (film)]] (2006)\n*''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]'' (2008, [[Wii]])\n*''[[Animal Crossing: New Leaf]]'' (2012, [[Nintendo 3DS]])\n*''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]'' (2015, [[Nintendo 3DS]])\n*''[[Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival]]'' (2015, [[Wii U]])\n*''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' (2017, mobile)\n*''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]'' (2020, [[Nintendo Switch]])\n\n==Role in the series==\nTom Nook first appears in the [[Nintendo 64]] title D\u014dbutsu no Mori (ported to the [[Nintendo GameCube]] as ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' in non-Japanese regions) as the town's main shop owner and continues his job in the next two installments. Nook's role in the series remained virtually unchanged from 2001 until 2012 with the release of ''[[Animal Crossing: New Leaf]]''. In addition to being the main shop owner, Nook will also sell the player a house at the beginning of the game for around 19,800 bells (in game currency). Because the player will only have 1000 bells in his or her pocket, Nook will request that the player work in his shop for a bit to pay off some of the debt. The chores Nook assigns you to do are meant for the player to get used to the controls of the game. After planting flowers, writing letters, and talking to villagers the player is sent off to do whatever they want, but have to pay the remaining amount of their mortgage on their own. Each time a mortgage payment is completed Nook will upgrade or add on to the player's house, each time putting the player more and more into debt to Nook, with the last addition being the most costly.\n\nNook's store also goes through three upgrades and changes throughout the game. The time of the upgrade depends on how many bells are spent in the store. Eventually his humble \"Nook's Cranny\" shack-like store with basic tools and very little objects to buy will become \"Nookington's Department Store\"\u2014a large, two story building with a wide variety of items for purchase. It is in this expansion that the player meets his two apprentices, Tommy and Timmy, who run the second floor of the store. In every game, no matter what upgrade the store is on, the items in the store will be changed everyday. This means that no two days will ever have the exact combination of items for sale.\n\n*In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', at the end of the month Nook will host a raffle with rare items to win. This was not continued in any sequel.\n*In ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]'', with the Nookington's expansion the player meets Harriet, a poodle who will do the player's hair for 3000 bells.\n*In ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk|City Folk]]'', Harriet has moved her shop to the city. With the Nookington's expansion, Nook will randomly ask the player a series of questions. How the player answers could change the store to a former appearance.\n*Nook returns in ''[[Animal Crossing: New Leaf]]''. Instead of being the local shop owner, Nook is now in charge of \"Nook's Homes\" and instead sells things to upgrade the exterior of the player's house. He also will expand the player's house for a price, which increases with each expansion. His apprentices now run the town shop by themselves.\n*Nook makes a minor appearance in ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' with the player being able to purchase him to put in their camp for 250 Leaf Tickets (Only available for purchase 45 days after starting the game). He later appeared as a free log-in gift to promote the release of New Horizons.\n*In New Horizons, Nook and his apprentices Timmy and Tommy control Residential Services, and offer the player a new program known as the Nook Mileage program as a new form of in-game currency.\n\n===In other media===\nTom Nook has made several minor appearances in the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series of video games]], appearing as various collectibles in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

He first appeared in the [[Nintendo 64]] game ''D\u014dbutsu no Mori'', released in Europe and North America on the [[Nintendo GameCube]] as ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]''. Nook sells a house to the player at the beginning of each title in the series, giving a set mortgage for them to pay and offering to upgrade it after the mortgage is paid off. He has also made several appearances in the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]]. Nintendo's Treehouse localization members Rich Amtower and Reiko Ninomiya have argued that, in spite of his perceived greed, he is a nice person due to taking the risk of hiring someone who is new to the town.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Concept and characteristics==\nTom Nook is based on the [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]], the raccoon dog. Although he is considered to be greedy by [[1UP.com]], Rich Amtower and Reiko Ninomiya, members of Nintendo's Treehouse localization team, disagreed; describing him as a nice person. Amtower described him as \"that first boss you ever had\", adding that, \"despite him being all business and not always having the time for pleasantries, Nook isn't a bad person; because he hired someone new to town. Due to that involving risk, it shows generosity\". Ninomiya agreed, and both felt that Nook's greed is diminished by the city's price index compared to that of his shop.

Nook's role in the series remained virtually unchanged from 2001 until 2012 with the release of ''[[Animal Crossing: New Leaf]]''. In addition to being the main shop owner, Nook will also sell the player a house at the beginning of the game for around 19,800 bells (in game currency). Because the player will only have 1000 bells in his or her pocket, Nook will request that the player work in his shop for a bit to pay off some of the debt. The chores Nook assigns you to do are meant for the player to get used to the controls of the game. After planting flowers, writing letters, and talking to villagers the player is sent off to do whatever they want, but have to pay the remaining amount of their mortgage on their own. Each time a mortgage payment is completed Nook will upgrade or add on to the player's house, each time putting the player more and more into debt to Nook, with the last addition being the most costly.\n\nNook's store also goes through three upgrades and changes throughout the game. The time of the upgrade depends on how many bells are spent in the store. Eventually his humble \"Nook's Cranny\" shack-like store with basic tools and very little objects to buy will become \"Nookington's Department Store\"\u2014a large, two story building with a wide variety of items for purchase. It is in this expansion that the player meets his two apprentices, Tommy and Timmy, who run the second floor of the store. In every game, no matter what upgrade the store is on, the items in the store will be changed everyday. This means that no two days will ever have the exact combination of items for sale.\n\n*In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', at the end of the month Nook will host a raffle with rare items to win. This was not continued in any sequel.\n*In ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]'', with the Nookington's expansion the player meets Harriet, a poodle who will do the player's hair for 3000 bells.\n*In ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk|City Folk]]'', Harriet has moved her shop to the city. With the Nookington's expansion, Nook will randomly ask the player a series of questions. How the player answers could change the store to a former appearance.\n*Nook returns in ''[[Animal Crossing: New Leaf]]''. Instead of being the local shop owner, Nook is now in charge of \"Nook's Homes\" and instead sells things to upgrade the exterior of the player's house. He also will expand the player's house for a price, which increases with each expansion. His apprentices now run the town shop by themselves.\n*Nook makes a minor appearance in ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' with the player being able to purchase him to put in their camp for 250 Leaf Tickets (Only available for purchase 45 days after starting the game). He later appeared as a free log-in gift to promote the release of New Horizons.\n*In New Horizons, Nook and his apprentices Timmy and Tommy control Residential Services, and offer the player a new program known as the Nook Mileage program as a new form of in-game currency.\n\n===In other media===\nTom Nook has made several minor appearances in the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series of video games]], appearing as various collectibles in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

Her formal art training began in 1953 when she entered [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] There she found a mentor in [[James A. Porter]] (1905\u20131970), who was head of the school's art department. He arranged for Thompson to receive a scholarship at the end of her junior year for summer study at the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]] in [[Maine]]. After Thompson received the Bachelor of Arts from Howard, Porter assisted her in entering the Brooklyn Museum of Art School on a [[Max Beckmann]] Scholarship. She began to exhibit, and her work was accepted for the ''Art U.S.A. \u201958'' exhibition in [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref>Thompson, M. (1977), \"Mildred Thompson, Sculptor: Experiences of a Black Artist in Europe and the United States\", p. 20, James A. Porter Gallery of Art, Howard University, Washington, DC.</ref>\n\nDuring that time Thompson applied and was turned down for a [[Fulbright Scholarship]]. Feeling herself ready for study in Europe, Thompson decided to go there on her own. She worked to save money during the rest of the school year and, through the auspices of [[Samella Lewis]] (1924\u2013), got a summer job teaching ceramics at [[Florida A&M University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]]. In this way she earned enough for steamship passage to Europe.<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 24.</ref>\n\n== Study in Europe ==\nHer trip to [[Germany]] was attended by good fortune. She had decided to study at the Art Academy of [[Hamburg]] ([[Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg]]) even though, at the time she arrived, she had not yet applied or been accepted there. Nor did she have any plans as to where she would live. A few private lessons were all she had to prepare herself for the German language. Nevertheless, armed with pluck, a strong portfolio and the help of some brand-new German friends, she found a room and was immediately accepted into the Academy. There her painting teachers were Walter Arno (1930\u2013) and [[Emil Schumacher]] (1912\u20131999). She learned [[etching]], [[lithography]] and other [[printmaking]] media from Willem Grimm (1904\u20131986) and [[Paul Wunderlich]] (1927\u20132010). She also met at this time the printmaker [[Horst Janssen]] (1929\u20131995), who introduced her to Galerie Sander in Hamburg, where Thompson had her first solo exhibition. At the end of her first year she received a scholarship, the Reemtsma Stipendium, that paid for her living and school expenses.<ref>Thompson (1977) pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n== An American expatriate ==\nAfter three years at the Academy, Thompson was ready to begin her professional career in the United States. In early 1961 she returned to [[New York City]]. The social and artistic acceptance Thompson had enjoyed in Germany, however, was not to be found even in that most cosmopolitan of American cities. She soon realized that because she was a black woman, she was refused the shows and gallery representation that she felt her work deserved. In an autobiographical essay, Thompson recounted that \"One woman dealer... said that it would be impossible for me to have a show in New York as an artist. [Another gallery owner said] ...that it would be better if I had a white friend to take my work around, someone to pass as Mildred Thompson.\"<ref name=\"Thompson 1977 page 28\">Thompson (1977), p. 28.</ref> She did, however, gain an audience with William Lieberman<ref>The son of German Expressionist artist Max Liebermann, William Lieberman (1923\u20132005) was an influential curator at the Museum of Modern Art from 1945 to 1979 and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1979 to 2004.</ref> at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]; two of her prints were purchased for the collection on his recommendation.<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 28. One of the prints, \"Love for Sale\" (1959), was reproduced in the book ''Fille de Joie'', Grove Press, 1967.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1961 and again in 1962 Thompson received fellowships to the [[MacDowell Colony]] in [[New Hampshire]], where she worked on drawings and paintings. In 1963 she returned to Germany to live, partly because she could find no sales outlet for her work, and partly because of growing racial tension in the United States.<ref name=\"Thompson 1977 page 28\"/> She was not alone. Other young black artists who chose to leave the U.S. during the 1950s and 1960s include [[Harvey Cropper]], [[Herbert Gentry]], Arthur Hardie, Clifford Jackson, Sam Middleton, Earl Miller, Norman Morgan, Larry Potter and Walter Williams. In the words of artist [[David Driskell]], \"They chose a form of cultural exile over expatriation, hoping for a better day to come about in the land of their birth.\"<ref>Driskell, David C. (1978), \"Bibliographies in Afro-American Art\", ''American Art Quarterly'', Vol. 30, No. 3, 1978, p. 385.</ref> All settled in Europe. Thompson established herself in the [[Rhineland]] town of [[D\u00fcren]] and once again began exhibiting and selling her work there and in the German cities of Bensberg, [[Aachen]], and [[Cologne]].\n\nThompson's work in the 1960s was figurative, but in the early 1970s she moved toward total abstraction. In Europe her works reflected the formal ideas of art for art's sake, and did not respond to the politicized art of the Black and Women's movements in the United States. According to writer [[Alexis De Veaux]], \"Thompson thought of herself as an expatriate and did not separate her identity as black from her identity as American...\" although she eventually disavowed \"...any claim to being American.\"<ref>De Veaux, Alexis (2006), ''Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde'', W.W. Norton & Co., p. 175. {{ISBN|0-393-01954-3}}</ref> Years later Thompson defended herself against the charge that because of her years spent in Europe, she was not a \"Black\" artist. In a 1987 essay for ''[[SAGE (journal)|SAGE]]'' magazine she wrote: <blockquote> \"On certain levels, perhaps we [black Americans] might be able to identify with certain parts of certain African cultures. To copy symbols that one does not understand, to deliberately make use of a form that one does not know how to analyze or appreciate was for me the height of prostitution. I had spent long years trying to find out who I am and what my influences were and where they came from. It was perhaps because I had lived and studied with \"whitey\" that I had learned to appreciate my Blackness as well as how American I truly am. My experiences throughout Africa had made my knowledge of being an American more than clear. There are recordings in our genes that remember Africa. If they are strong enough and we are free of false denials, they will surface and appear without deliberation no matter what we do.\"<ref>Thompson, Mildred, \"Memoirs of an Artist\", ''SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women'', Vol. IV, No.1 (Spring 1987), pp. 42\u201343.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nAfter ten years in Germany (during which she traveled to southern Europe and Africa) Thompson returned to the U.S. in 1975. She found that the social climate had changed somewhat for the better, and she was able to overcome many of the obstacles she encountered. She lived at first in [[Florida]], where she was named Artist-in-Residence of the City of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 31.</ref> In 1977 she moved to Washington, D.C., where she was Artist-in-Residence at Howard University for the 1977\u201378 academic year. She returned to Europe in 1981, this time to [[Paris]], where she opened a studio in the Rue de Parme. Thompson moved to Atlanta in 1986, which was \"home base\" for the remainder of her life. There she taught art and art history in several area colleges, including the [[Atlanta College of Art]].<ref>Irlbeck, A. (2001), [http://lubbockonline.com/stories/011701/upd_warhol.shtml \"Artist, teacher, musician to speak on Warhol exhibit\"], Lubbock Online.com, Wednesday, January 17, 2001. Accessed May 23, 2008.</ref> A talented writer and interviewer, she joined the staff of the periodical ''Art Papers'' in 1987.\n\n== Influences in Thompson\u2019s mature work ==\nIn 1987 Thompson's show ''In and Out of Germany'', at the [[Goethe Institute]] in Atlanta, contained 42 artworks executed in Germany, France and the United States. The Atlanta newsweekly ''[[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)|Creative Loafing]]'' mentioned that Thompson's most recent series of colored pencil drawings, \"Objective Music\", were based on her correlation of art with music. It also made reference to her sense of color and rhythmic line-making as \"[[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]-influenced.\"<ref>Perry, 1987.</ref> A contemporary review of the exhibition in ''Art Papers'' also mentioned Kandinsky as an influence for Thompson, as well as the artist's interest in the fiction of [[Hermann Hesse]] and the [[Jung]]ian concept of the [[collective unconscious]]. But Thompson's feeling for music seemed to have the strongest effect on the work in the exhibition. The reviewer, Leslie Schworm, wrote that Thompson's \"\u2026approach is to draw music or sound. She believes that patterns in music are among the purest natural recurrences, providing direct access to something basic.\"<ref>.Schworm, L. (1988), \"Mildred Thompson, Goethe Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, September 11\u2013October 17\", p. 59, ''Art Papers'', January/February 1988.</ref>\n\nIn the following year the visual description of music was still on Thompson's mind. A solo exhibition titled ''Concatenation'' at [[Agnes Scott College]] contained the wooden sculpture ''Mass'', whose six parts were named \"Kyrie\", \"Gloria\", \"Credo\", \"Sanctus\", \"Benedictus\", and \"Gloria Dei\".<ref>Gay-Griffin, L. (1989), \"Exhibit explores depth of spirit\", p. 16D, ''Daily News'', Lawrenceville, Georgia, Saturday, November 25, 1989.</ref> But other influences, including [[astronomy]], [[spiritualism]] and [[metaphysics]] were starting to appear in her work.  Included in ''Concatenations'' was a series of prints titled ''Five Mysteries''. Their abstract compositions, printed in black ink on white paper, were schematic representations of earth, atmosphere and sun, the latter a flat disc set in a sky filled with energetic marks and scratches. Thompson's series of watercolors, titled ''Lemurian Wanderings'', were described by critic Lorena Gay-Griffin as \u201c\u2026the time at the dawn of the world before the first ray of sun shone through the atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"Gay-Griffin 1989\">Gay-Griffin (1989).</ref> A series of colored pencil drawings, ''The Phases of Cynthia'', was reported by the same writer to refer to [[Galileo]]\u2019s study of the phases of the moon. The drawings featured \"...the same sun/moon image as the prints. The circles are layered with other geometric shapes and surrounded by fragments and rays emitting from the center.\"<ref name=\"Gay-Griffin 1989\"/> In 1990 Thompson told ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine: \"My work has to do with the cosmos and how it affects us.\"<ref>''Essence'' (1990).</ref> Such references continued in her printmaking. In 1993, as an artist-in-residence at Littleton Studios in [[North Carolina]], Thompson created prints in [[vitreography]] titled ''Helio Centric'', ''Particles'' and ''Wave Function''.\n\nA 1992 group exhibition entitled ''A/Cross Currents: Synthesis in African American Abstract Painting'' featured a catalog that cited the jazz of [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Thelonious Monk]] and the German baroque of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] as influences on Thomspon's art. The catalog's essayist, Corrine Jennings, wrote: \"The idea that man and certain animals can hear the sounds of eleven or twelve octaves, but can only see one octave of seven colors, has led to [Thompson\u2019s] interest in exploring the unseen and making it visible.\"<ref name=\"Jennings 1992\">Jennings (1992).</ref> The ''Magnetic Fields'' series of paintings that Thompson exhibited in the show, Jennings wrote, \"\u2026appear to visualize the force of unseen energy. They are intensely painted, tersely defined geometric structures with a direct physical application loosened by\u2026improvisation.\"<ref name=\"Jennings 1992\"/>\n\n== Teaching ==\nThompson had a long and varied teaching career. From 1961 to 1964, when she was trying to make her way as an artist in New York City, she taught elementary school as an employee of the New York Board of Education. In [[D\u00fcren]], Germany, she taught art and art history at the Eschweiler Volchoch Schule from 1965 to 1974. On being named Artist-in Residence for the City of Tampa<ref>The residency was awarded by the Florida State Arts Council with funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].</ref> Thompson taught classes and workshops in painting, drawing, sculpture, and mural painting to adults and children at the Tampa Bay Art Center and other local venues. She also had an \"open door\" policy at her studio on 7th Avenue in [[Ybor City, Tampa|Ybor City]]. There, she wrote: \"...anyone who wanted to come in and see could walk in. I felt it somehow served the community.\"<ref>Thompson, M. (1987), \"Memoirs of an Artist, p. 42, ''SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women'', 10/1:42.</ref> As an Artist-in-Residence at Howard University she taught etching. When she lived in Paris, Thompson gave private lessons at her studio at 4 Rue de Parme from 1981 until her return to the States in 1985. From 1986 to 1989 she taught studio classes, art history and art theory at [[Agnes Scott College]] in [[Decatur, Georgia]], and in Atlanta she taught at [[Morehouse College]] and [[Spelman College]]. From 1986 she taught at the [[Atlanta College of Art]].<ref>1993 resume for Mildred Thompson.</ref>\n\n== Public collections ==\nThompson's work is in the permanent collections of the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, DC; the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York; the [[Brooklyn Museum]]; and [[Howard University]], Washington, DC, among others.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External Links ==\n\n* [https://rose.library.emory.edu/ Stuart A.

(1989), \"Exhibit explores depth of spirit\", p. 16D, ''Daily News'', Lawrenceville, Georgia, Saturday, November 25, 1989.</ref> But other influences, including [[astronomy]], [[spiritualism]] and [[metaphysics]] were starting to appear in her work.  Included in ''Concatenations'' was a series of prints titled ''Five Mysteries''. Their abstract compositions, printed in black ink on white paper, were schematic representations of earth, atmosphere and sun, the latter a flat disc set in a sky filled with energetic marks and scratches. Thompson's series of watercolors, titled ''Lemurian Wanderings'', were described by critic Lorena Gay-Griffin as \u201c\u2026the time at the dawn of the world before the first ray of sun shone through the atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"Gay-Griffin 1989\">Gay-Griffin (1989).</ref> A series of colored pencil drawings, ''The Phases of Cynthia'', was reported by the same writer to refer to [[Galileo]]\u2019s study of the phases of the moon. The drawings featured \"...the same sun/moon image as the prints. The circles are layered with other geometric shapes and surrounded by fragments and rays emitting from the center.\"<ref name=\"Gay-Griffin 1989\"/> In 1990 Thompson told ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine: \"My work has to do with the cosmos and how it affects us.\"<ref>''Essence'' (1990).</ref> Such references continued in her printmaking. In 1993, as an artist-in-residence at Littleton Studios in [[North Carolina]], Thompson created prints in [[vitreography]] titled ''Helio Centric'', ''Particles'' and ''Wave Function''.\n\nA 1992 group exhibition entitled ''A/Cross Currents: Synthesis in African American Abstract Painting'' featured a catalog that cited the jazz of [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Thelonious Monk]] and the German baroque of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] as influences on Thomspon's art. The catalog's essayist, Corrine Jennings, wrote: \"The idea that man and certain animals can hear the sounds of eleven or twelve octaves, but can only see one octave of seven colors, has led to [Thompson\u2019s] interest in exploring the unseen and making it visible.\"<ref name=\"Jennings 1992\">Jennings (1992).</ref> The ''Magnetic Fields'' series of paintings that Thompson exhibited in the show, Jennings wrote, \"\u2026appear to visualize the force of unseen energy. They are intensely painted, tersely defined geometric structures with a direct physical application loosened by\u2026improvisation.\"<ref name=\"Jennings 1992\"/>\n\n== Teaching ==\nThompson had a long and varied teaching career. From 1961 to 1964, when she was trying to make her way as an artist in New York City, she taught elementary school as an employee of the New York Board of Education. In [[D\u00fcren]], Germany, she taught art and art history at the Eschweiler Volchoch Schule from 1965 to 1974. On being named Artist-in Residence for the City of Tampa<ref>The residency was awarded by the Florida State Arts Council with funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].</ref> Thompson taught classes and workshops in painting, drawing, sculpture, and mural painting to adults and children at the Tampa Bay Art Center and other local venues. She also had an \"open door\" policy at her studio on 7th Avenue in [[Ybor City, Tampa|Ybor City]]. There, she wrote: \"...anyone who wanted to come in and see could walk in. I felt it somehow served the community.\"<ref>Thompson, M. (1987), \"Memoirs of an Artist, p. 42, ''SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women'', 10/1:42.</ref> As an Artist-in-Residence at Howard University she taught etching. When she lived in Paris, Thompson gave private lessons at her studio at 4 Rue de Parme from 1981 until her return to the States in 1985. From 1986 to 1989 she taught studio classes, art history and art theory at [[Agnes Scott College]] in [[Decatur, Georgia]], and in Atlanta she taught at [[Morehouse College]] and [[Spelman College]]. From 1986 she taught at the [[Atlanta College of Art]].<ref>1993 resume for Mildred Thompson.</ref>\n\n== Public collections ==\nThompson's work is in the permanent collections of the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, DC; the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York; the [[Brooklyn Museum]]; and [[Howard University]], Washington, DC, among others.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External Links ==\n\n* [https://rose.library.emory.edu/ Stuart A.

The figure of Christ is slightly later. Probably made in [[Cologne]] or [[Essen]], the cross demonstrates several medieval techniques: [[casting|cast]] figurative sculpture, [[filigree]], enamelling, gem polishing and setting, and the reuse of Classical [[Cameo (carving)|cameos]] and [[engraved gem]]s.]]\n\nIn the [[history of Europe]], the '''Middle Ages''' (or '''medieval period''') lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and merged into the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]]. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: [[classical antiquity]], the medieval period, and the [[modern history|modern period]]. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]], [[High Middle Ages|High]], and [[Late Middle Ages]].\n\n[[Population decline]], [[counterurbanisation]], collapse of centralized authority, invasions, and mass migrations of [[tribe]]s, which had begun in [[Late Antiquity]], continued in the Early Middle Ages. The large-scale movements of the [[Migration Period]], including various [[Germanic peoples]], formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, [[North Africa]] and the Middle East\u2014once part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]\u2014came under the rule of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], an Islamic empire, after conquest by [[succession to Muhammad|Muhammad's successors]].  Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with classical antiquity was not complete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire, Rome's direct continuation, survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' or \"Code of Justinian\", was rediscovered in [[Northern Italy]] in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages.  In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to [[Christianization|Christianise]] [[paganism#Ethnic religions of pre-Christian Europe|pagan Europe]] continued. The [[Franks]], under the [[Carolingian dynasty]], briefly established the [[Carolingian Empire]] during the later 8th and early 9th centuries. It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions: [[Vikings]] from the north, [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Magyars]] from the east, and [[Saracen]]s from the south.\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the [[Medieval Warm Period]] climate change allowed crop yields to increase. [[Manorialism]], the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the [[Nobility|nobles]], and [[feudalism]], the political structure whereby [[knight]]s and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and [[manor]]s, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The [[Crusades]], first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim]]s. Kings became the heads of centralised nation-states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified [[Christendom]] more distant. Intellectual life was marked by [[scholasticism]], a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of [[University|universities]]. The theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]], the paintings of [[Giotto]], the poetry of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], the travels of [[Marco Polo]], and the [[Gothic architecture]] of cathedrals such as [[Chartres Cathedral|Chartres]] are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.\n\nThe Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the [[Black Death]] killed about a third of Europeans. Controversy, [[heresy]], and the [[Western Schism]] within the [[Catholic Church]] paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the [[early modern period]].\n\n==Terminology and periodisation==\n\nThe Middle Ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing [[History of Europe|European history]]: [[classical antiquity|classical civilisation]], or [[Ancient history|Antiquity]]; the Middle Ages; and the [[Modern history|Modern Period]].<ref name=Power304>Power ''Central Middle Ages'' p. 3</ref> The \"Middle Ages\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas'' or \"middle season\".<ref name=Miglio112>Miglio \"Curial Humanism\" ''Interpretations of Renaissance Humanism'' p. 112</ref>{{efn-ua|[[Giovanni Andrea Bussi]], librarian of the [[Vatican Library]], in his preface to the printed edition of [[Apuleius]]\u2019 works, praised the recently-deceased Cardinal [[Nicholas of Cusa]] as man knowledgeable of authors from ancient times and from the \"media tempestas\": \u201cVir ipse, quod rarum est in Germanis, supra opinionem eloquens et latinus, historias idem omnes non priscas modo, sed mediae tempestatis, tum veteres, tum recentiores usque ad nostra tempora, memoria, retinebat\u201d<ref name=G\u00fcnther107>G\u00fcnther, ''Le Temps de l'histoire: Exp\u00e9rience du monde et cat\u00e9gories temporelles en philosophie de l'histoire'', p.107</ref>}} In early usage, there were many variants, including ''medium aevum'', or \"middle age\", first recorded in 1604,<ref name=Albrow205>Albrow ''Global Age'' p. 205</ref> and ''media saecula'', or \"middle centuries\", first recorded in 1625.<ref name=Murray4/> The adjective \"medieval\" (or sometimes \"mediaeval\"<ref name=Random1194/> or \"medi\u00e6val\"),<ref name=OED290>\"Mediaeval\" ''Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary''</ref> meaning pertaining to the Middle Ages, derives from ''medium aevum''.<ref name=Random1194>Flexner (ed.)

Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as \"invasions\", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire.

In Gaul for instance, the invaders settled much more extensively in the north-east than in the south-west. [[Slavs]] settled in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] and the Balkan Peninsula. The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. [[Latin]], the literary language of the Western Roman Empire, was gradually replaced by vernacular languages which evolved from Latin, but were distinct from it, collectively known as [[Romance languages]]. These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries.

There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with the [[Sasanian Empire]], the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of [[Roman law]]; the first effort\u2014the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]''\u2014was completed in 438.<ref name=Wickham81>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 81\u201383</ref> Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''.<ref name=Bauer200>Bauer ''History of the Medieval World'' pp. 200\u2013202</ref> Justinian also oversaw the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths,<ref name=Bauer206/> under [[Belisarius]] (d. 565).<ref name=Collins126>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 126, 130</ref> The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of [[Plague of Justinian|plague in 542]] led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests.<ref name=Bauer206>Bauer ''History of the Medieval World'' pp. 206\u2013213</ref>\n\nAt the Emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of [[Exarchate of Ravenna|most of Italy]], North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the [[early Muslim conquests]], but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.<ref name=Brown8>Brown \"Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean\" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Empire the slow infiltration of the Balkans by the Slavs added a further difficulty for Justinian's successors. It began gradually, but by the late 540s Slavic tribes were in [[Thrace]] and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyrium]], and had defeated an imperial army near [[Edirne|Adrianople]] in 551. In the 560s the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] began to expand from their base on the north bank of the [[Danube]]; by the end of the 6th-century, they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the Eastern emperors to pay tribute. They remained a strong power until 796.<ref name=James95>James ''Europe's Barbarians'' pp. 95\u201399</ref>\n\nAn additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (r. 582\u2013602) in Persian politics when he intervened in a [[Khosrow II#Accession to the throne|succession dispute]]. This led to a period of peace, but when Maurice was overthrown, [[Byzantine\u2013Sassanid War of 602\u2013628|the Persians invaded]] and during the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (r. 610\u2013641) controlled large chunks of the empire, including Egypt, Syria, and [[Anatolia]] until Heraclius' successful counterattack.

Values attached to [[Latin literature|Latin scholarship]] and [[Education in Ancient Rome|education]] mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, [[Jerome]] (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading [[Cicero]] than the [[Bible]]. By the 6th century, [[Gregory of Tours]] (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning [[shorthand]].<ref name=Brown174>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' pp. 174\u2013175</ref> By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book.<ref name=Brown181>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' p. 181</ref> Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some [[Early medieval literature|original works]] were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] (d. 489), [[Cassiodorus]] (d. [[circa|c.]] 585), and [[Boethius]] (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.<ref name=Brown45>Brown \"Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean\" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 45\u201349</ref>\n\nChanges also took place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces.{{efn-ua|Such entourages are named ''[[Comitatus (classical meaning)|comitatus]]'' by historians, although it is not a contemporary term. It was adapted in the 19th century from a word used by the 2nd-century historian [[Tacitus]] to describe the close companions of a lord or king.<ref name=Dict80>Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 80</ref> The ''comitatus'' comprised young men who were supposed to be utterly devoted to their lord. If their sworn lord died, they were expected to fight to the death also.<ref name=Geary56>Geary ''Before France and Germany'' pp. 56\u201357</ref>}} Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of [[weregild|compensation]].<ref name=Wickham189>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 189\u2013193</ref> Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by [[abbess]]es of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.<ref name=Wickham195>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 195\u2013199</ref>\n\n[[File:Fr\u00fchmittelalterliches Dorf.jpg|Reconstruction of an early medieval peasant village in Bavaria|thumb|left]]\n\nPeasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from [[archaeology]]; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either [[Code (law)|law codes]] or writers from the upper classes.<ref name=Wickham204>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' p. 204</ref> Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy.<ref name=Wickham205>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 205\u2013210</ref> Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems.<ref name=Wickham211>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.<ref name=Wickham215>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' p. 215</ref>\n\nRoman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages. Although Italian cities remained inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. Rome, for instance, shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30,000 by the end of the 6th century. [[Roman temple]]s were converted into [[Christianised sites|Christian churches]] and city walls remained in use.<ref name=Brown24-26>Brown \"Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean\" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 24\u201326</ref> In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials.

[[Judaism]] was an active proselytising faith, and at least one [[Arabs|Arab]] political leader converted to it.{{efn-ua|[[Dhu Nuwas]], ruler of what is today [[Yemen]], converted in 525 and his subsequent persecution of Christians led to the invasion and conquest of his kingdom by the [[Axumite]]s of [[Ethiopia]].<ref name=Collins138>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 138\u2013139</ref>}} Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians' [[Zoroastrianism]] in seeking converts, especially among residents of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. All these strands came together with the emergence of [[Islam]] in Arabia during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] (d. 632).<ref name=Collins143>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 143\u2013145</ref> After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia, starting with [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Syria]] in 634\u2013635 and reaching [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]] in 640\u2013641, [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Persia]] between 637 and 642, [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|North Africa]] in the later seventh century, and the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberian Peninsula]] in 711.<ref name=Collins149>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 149\u2013151</ref> By 714, Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called [[Al-Andalus]].<ref name=Reilly52>Reilly ''Medieval Spains'' pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\nThe Islamic conquests reached their peak in the mid-eighth century. The defeat of Muslim forces at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732 led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks, but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and its replacement by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The Abbasids moved their capital to [[Baghdad]] and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing control of sections of the Muslim lands. Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula, the [[Aghlabids]] controlled North Africa, and the [[Tulunids]] became rulers of Egypt.<ref name=Brown15>Brown \"Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean\" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' p. 15</ref> By the middle of the 8th century, new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean; trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old [[Roman economy]].

African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or [[Naples]]. By the end of the 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally.<ref name=Wickham218>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 218\u2013219</ref>\n\nThe various Germanic states in the west all had [[coin]]ages that imitated existing Roman and Byzantine forms. Gold continued to be minted until the end of the 7th century in 693-94 when it was replaced by silver in the Merovingian kindgon. The basic Frankish silver coin was the [[denarius]] or [[French denier|denier]], while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a [[penny]]. From these areas, the denier or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, nor were gold except in Southern Europe. No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted.<ref name=Coin>Grierson \"Coinage and currency\" ''Middle Ages''</ref>\n\n===Church and monasticism===\n{{Main|Christianity in the Middle Ages}}\n\n[[File:Gregory I - Antiphonary of Hartker of Sankt Gallen.jpg|thumb|right|upright|left|An 11th-century illustration of [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] dictating to a secretary]]\n\nChristianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe before the Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africa sundered maritime connections between those areas. Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the Western Church. The Eastern Church used Greek instead of the Western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclasm]], [[clerical marriage]], and [[Caesaropapism|state control of the Church]] had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities.<ref name=Collins218>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 218\u2013233</ref> The formal break, known as the [[East\u2013West Schism]], came in 1054, when the [[Pope|papacy]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarchy of Constantinople]] clashed over [[papal supremacy]] and [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two Churches\u2014the Western branch became the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the Eastern branch the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].<ref name=Davies328>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 328\u2013332</ref>\n\nThe [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|ecclesiastical structure]] of the Roman Empire survived the movements and invasions in the west mostly intact, but the papacy was little regarded, and few of the Western [[bishop]]s looked to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership. [[Byzantine Papacy|Many of the popes]] prior to 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and Eastern theological controversies. The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] (pope 590\u2013604) survived, and of those more than 850 letters, the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the [[Gregorian mission]] in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity.<ref name=WIckham170>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 170\u2013172</ref> [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionaries]] were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries, going first to England and Scotland and then on to the continent.

The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the [[Desert Fathers]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, called [[Cenobitic monasticism|cenobitism]], which was pioneered by [[Pachomius the Great|Pachomius]] (d. 348) in the 4th century.

A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought, and gained, authority for this coup from Pope {{nowrap|[[Pope Stephen II|Stephen II]]}} (pope 752\u2013757). Pippin's takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers, exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel, and circulated stories of the family's great piety. At the time of his death in 768, Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons, Charles (r. 768\u2013814) and [[Carloman I|Carloman]] (r. 768\u2013771). When Carloman died of natural causes, Charles blocked the succession of Carloman's young son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria. Charles, more often known as Charles the Great or [[Charlemagne]], embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion in 774 that unified a large portion of Europe, eventually controlling modern-day France, northern Italy, and [[Saxon Wars|Saxony]].

Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean.<ref name=Backman109/> The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called [[count]]s, who administered the [[county|counties]] the empire had been divided into.

Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son {{nowrap|[[Lothair I]]}} (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and [[Charles the Bald]] (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took [[East Francia]], comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles [[West Francia]] with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. [[Louis the German]] (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the [[wikt:suzerainty|suzerainty]] of his elder brother. The division was disputed. [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|{{nowrap|Pepin II}} of Aquitaine]] (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for [[Aquitaine]], while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia.

The creation of heavily armoured [[cataphract]]-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphases on types of soldiers\u2014ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies.<ref name=NicolleWestern28>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 28\u201329</ref> During the early invasion period, the [[stirrup]] had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as [[shock troops]] because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider.<ref name=NicolleWestern30>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 30</ref> The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic [[composite bow]] in place of the earlier, and weaker, [[Scythia]]n composite bow.<ref name=NicolleWestern31>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 30\u201331</ref> Another development was the increasing use of [[longsword]]s<ref name=NicolleWestern34>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 34</ref> and the progressive replacement of [[scale armour]] by [[Mail (armour)|mail armour]] and [[lamellar armour]].<ref name=NicolleWestern39>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 39</ref>\n\nThe importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry.

Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as [[manor]]s or villages.<ref name=Backman156/> These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as [[manorialism]]. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond,<ref name=Backman164>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 164\u2013165</ref> with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of [[assarting]], or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population.<ref name=Epstein52>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\nThe [[open-field system]] of agriculture was commonly practiced in most of Europe, especially in \"northwestern and central Europe\".<ref name=Pounds166>Pounds ''Historical Geography of Europe'' p. 166</ref> Such agricultural communities had three basic characteristics: individual peasant holdings in the form of strips of land were scattered among the different fields belonging to the manor; crops were rotated from year to year to preserve soil fertility; and common land was used for grazing livestock and other purposes. Some regions used a three-field system of crop rotation, others retained the older two-field system.<ref name=Agri>Dawtry \"Agriculture\" ''Middle Ages'' pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nOther sections of society included the nobility, clergy, and townsmen. Nobles, both the titled [[nobility]] and simple [[knight]]s, exploited the manors and the peasants, although they did not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of [[feudalism]]. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or [[fief]]s, came to be considered hereditary, and in most areas they were no longer divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son.<ref name=Barber37>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 37\u201341</ref>{{efn-ua|This inheritance pattern is known as [[primogeniture]].<ref name=Wordbook193>Cosman ''Medieval Wordbook'' p. 193</ref>}} The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as [[heavy cavalry]], control of [[castle]]s, and various immunities from taxes or other impositions.{{efn-ua|Heavy cavalry had been introduced into Europe from the Persian [[cataphract]] of the 5th and 6th centuries, but the addition of the [[stirrup]] in the 7th allowed the full force of horse and rider to be used in combat.<ref name=Davies311/>}} Castles, initially in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time, and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords.<ref name=Davies311>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 311\u2013315</ref> Nobles were stratified; kings and the highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land, as well as other nobles.

Both secular law and [[canon law]], or ecclesiastical law, were studied in the High Middle Ages. Secular law, or Roman law, was advanced greatly by the discovery of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' in the 11th century, and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at [[University of Bologna|Bologna]]. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named [[Decretum Gratiani|Gratian]] (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of canon law\u2014the ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]''.<ref name=Backman237>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 237\u2013241</ref>\n\nAmong the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of [[Roman numerals]] with the [[decimal]] [[Positional notation|positional number system]] and the invention of [[algebra]], which allowed more advanced mathematics. Astronomy advanced following the translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century.

The ideals upon which it was based were brought to the papacy by Pope [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]] (pope 1049\u20131054), and provided the ideology of clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] (pope 1073\u201385) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of [[investiture]], clerical marriage, and [[simony]]. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the [[Concordat of Worms]]. The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to [[laity|lay]] authorities.

Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms, people sought to participate in new forms of religious life. New monastic orders were founded, including the [[Carthusian]]s and the [[Cistercians]]. The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (d. 1153). These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler [[hermit|hermetical]] monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic life]].<ref name=Barber145>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 145\u2013149</ref> [[Christian pilgrimage|Religious pilgrimages]] were also encouraged.

This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief in the power of the Devil. Mystics such as [[Meister Eckhart]] (d. 1327) and [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]] (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.<ref name=Davies436>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 436\u2013437</ref>\n\n===Scholars, intellectuals, and exploration===\n{{see also|Europeans in Medieval China}}\nDuring the Later Middle Ages, theologians such as [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]] (d. 1308) and [[William of Ockham]] (d. c. 1348)<ref name=MASchol/> led a reaction against intellectualist scholasticism, objecting to the application of reason to faith.

After his death, exploration continued; [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (d. 1500) went around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1486 and [[Vasco da Gama]] (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498.<ref name=Davies451>Davies ''Europe'' p. 451</ref> The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by [[Christopher Columbus]] (d. 1506) in 1492 that [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovered the Americas]].<ref name=Davies454>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 454\u2013455</ref> The English crown under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] sponsored the voyage of [[John Cabot]] (d. 1498) in 1497, which landed on [[Cape Breton Island]].<ref name=Davies511>Davies ''Europe'' p. 511</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Agriculture}}\n\n===Technological and military developments===\n[[File:Crescenzi calendar.jpg|thumb|Agricultural calendar, c. 1470, from a manuscript of [[Pietro de Crescenzi]]]]\n\nOne of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry.<ref name=NicolleWestern180>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 180</ref> The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success.<ref name=NicolleWestern183>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 183</ref> Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and [[plate armour]] was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed.<ref name=NicolleWestern188>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 188</ref> [[Pole weapon|Pole arms]] reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.<ref name=Nicolle185>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 185</ref>\n\nIn agriculture, the increased usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun.

Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles, which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century, until almost the end of the period. [[International Gothic]] was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400, producing masterpieces such as the [[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].<ref name=Benton253>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 253\u2013256</ref> All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality, and in the 15th century the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons, commissioning small portraits of themselves in oils as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery, [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|ivory caskets]], [[cassone]] chests, and [[maiolica]] pottery. These objects also included the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] produced by mostly [[Mud\u00e9jar]] potters in Spain. Although royalty owned huge collections of plate, little survives except for the [[Royal Gold Cup]].<ref>Lightbown ''Secular Goldsmiths' Work'' p. 78</ref> Italian silk manufacture developed, so that Western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders [[tapestry]] weaving of sets like ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn]]'' became a major luxury industry.<ref name=Benton257>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 257\u2013262</ref>\n\nThe large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the [[Pulpit of Sant' Andrea, Pistoia (Giovanni Pisano)|Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea]]. Painted or carved wooden relief [[altarpiece]]s became common, especially as churches created many [[Chapel|side-chapels]]. [[Early Netherlandish painting]] by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (d. 1441) and [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of [[Incunable|incunabula]], or works printed before 1500,<ref name=BL>British Library Staff \"[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]\" ''British Library''</ref> by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small [[woodcut]]s, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century. More expensive [[engraving]]s supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images.<ref name=Griffiths17>Griffiths ''Prints and Printmaking'' pp. 17\u201318; 39\u201346</ref>\n\n==Modern perceptions==\n{{see also| Dark Ages (historiography)|Medieval studies|Middle Ages in popular culture}}\n\n[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Medieval illustration of the [[spherical Earth]] in a 14th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'']]\n\nThe medieval period is frequently caricatured as a \"time of ignorance and superstition\" that placed \"the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity.\"<ref>Lindberg \"Medieval Church Encounters\" ''When Science & Christianity Meet'' p. 8</ref> This is a legacy from both the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] when scholars favourably contrasted their intellectual cultures with those of the medieval period. Renaissance scholars saw the Middle Ages as a period of decline from the high culture and civilisation of the Classical world; Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith, and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition.<ref name=Davies291>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 291\u2013293</ref>\n\nOthers argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages. Science historian [[Edward Grant]] writes, \"If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [in the 18th century]<!--original quotation says: \"expressed in the Age of Reason\"-->, they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities\".<ref name=Grant9>Grant ''God and Reason'' p. 9</ref> Also, contrary to common belief, [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] writes, \"the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the Church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led\".<ref name=QPeters>Quoted in Peters \"Science and Religion\" ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' p. 8182</ref>\n\nThe caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions. One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century<ref name=flat>Russell ''Inventing the Flat Earth'' pp. 49\u201358</ref> and still very common, is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the [[Myth of the flat Earth|Earth was flat]].<ref name=flat/> This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere.<ref>Grant ''Planets, Stars, & Orbs'' pp. 626\u2013630</ref> Lindberg and [[Ronald Numbers]], another scholar of the period, state that there \"was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference\".<ref>Lindberg and Numbers \"Beyond War and Peace\" ''Church History'' p. 342</ref> Other misconceptions such as \"the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages\", \"the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science\", or \"the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy\", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by historical research.<ref name=Numberslect>Numbers \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20171011022345/https://www.faraday.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/CIS/Numbers/Numbers_Lecture.pdf Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective]\" ''Lecture archive'' Archived 11 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist-ua|60em}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book |author=Adams, Laurie Schneider |title=A History of Western Art |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=Boston, MA |year=2001 |isbn=0-07-231717-5 |edition=Third}}\n* {{cite book |author=Albrow, Martin |title=The Global Age: State and Society Beyond Modernity |year=1997 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, CA |isbn=0-8047-2870-4}}\n* {{cite book |author=Backman, Clifford R. |title=The Worlds of Medieval Europe |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-512169-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Barber, Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Barber |title=The Two Cities: Medieval Europe 1050\u20131320 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1992 |isbn=0-415-09682-0}}\n* {{cite book |author=Barber, Richard |title=Edward, Prince of Wales and Aquitaine: A Biography of the Black Prince |authorlink=Richard Barber |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |year=1978 |isbn=0-684-15864-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Barlow, Frank |title=The Feudal Kingdom of England 1042\u20131216 |authorlink=Frank Barlow (historian) |edition=Fourth |publisher=Longman |location=New York |year=1988 |isbn=0-582-49504-0}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bauer, Susan Wise |authorlink=Susan Wise Bauer |title=The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade |publisher=W.

The figure of Christ is slightly later. Probably made in [[Cologne]] or [[Essen]], the cross demonstrates several medieval techniques: [[casting|cast]] figurative sculpture, [[filigree]], enamelling, gem polishing and setting, and the reuse of Classical [[Cameo (carving)|cameos]] and [[engraved gem]]s.]]\n\nIn the [[history of Europe]], the '''Middle Ages''' (or '''medieval period''') lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and merged into the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]]. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: [[classical antiquity]], the medieval period, and the [[modern history|modern period]]. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]], [[High Middle Ages|High]], and [[Late Middle Ages]].\n\n[[Population decline]], [[counterurbanisation]], collapse of centralized authority, invasions, and mass migrations of [[tribe]]s, which had begun in [[Late Antiquity]], continued in the Early Middle Ages. The large-scale movements of the [[Migration Period]], including various [[Germanic peoples]], formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, [[North Africa]] and the Middle East\u2014once part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]\u2014came under the rule of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], an Islamic empire, after conquest by [[succession to Muhammad|Muhammad's successors]].  Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with classical antiquity was not complete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire, Rome's direct continuation, survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' or \"Code of Justinian\", was rediscovered in [[Northern Italy]] in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages.  In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to [[Christianization|Christianise]] [[paganism#Ethnic religions of pre-Christian Europe|pagan Europe]] continued. The [[Franks]], under the [[Carolingian dynasty]], briefly established the [[Carolingian Empire]] during the later 8th and early 9th centuries. It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions: [[Vikings]] from the north, [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Magyars]] from the east, and [[Saracen]]s from the south.\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the [[Medieval Warm Period]] climate change allowed crop yields to increase. [[Manorialism]], the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the [[Nobility|nobles]], and [[feudalism]], the political structure whereby [[knight]]s and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and [[manor]]s, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The [[Crusades]], first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim]]s. Kings became the heads of centralised nation-states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified [[Christendom]] more distant. Intellectual life was marked by [[scholasticism]], a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of [[University|universities]]. The theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]], the paintings of [[Giotto]], the poetry of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], the travels of [[Marco Polo]], and the [[Gothic architecture]] of cathedrals such as [[Chartres Cathedral|Chartres]] are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.\n\nThe Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the [[Black Death]] killed about a third of Europeans. Controversy, [[heresy]], and the [[Western Schism]] within the [[Catholic Church]] paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the [[early modern period]].\n\n==Terminology and periodisation==\n\nThe Middle Ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing [[History of Europe|European history]]: [[classical antiquity|classical civilisation]], or [[Ancient history|Antiquity]]; the Middle Ages; and the [[Modern history|Modern Period]].<ref name=Power304>Power ''Central Middle Ages'' p. 3</ref> The \"Middle Ages\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas'' or \"middle season\".<ref name=Miglio112>Miglio \"Curial Humanism\" ''Interpretations of Renaissance Humanism'' p. 112</ref>{{efn-ua|[[Giovanni Andrea Bussi]], librarian of the [[Vatican Library]], in his preface to the printed edition of [[Apuleius]]\u2019 works, praised the recently-deceased Cardinal [[Nicholas of Cusa]] as man knowledgeable of authors from ancient times and from the \"media tempestas\": \u201cVir ipse, quod rarum est in Germanis, supra opinionem eloquens et latinus, historias idem omnes non priscas modo, sed mediae tempestatis, tum veteres, tum recentiores usque ad nostra tempora, memoria, retinebat\u201d<ref name=G\u00fcnther107>G\u00fcnther, ''Le Temps de l'histoire: Exp\u00e9rience du monde et cat\u00e9gories temporelles en philosophie de l'histoire'', p.107</ref>}} In early usage, there were many variants, including ''medium aevum'', or \"middle age\", first recorded in 1604,<ref name=Albrow205>Albrow ''Global Age'' p. 205</ref> and ''media saecula'', or \"middle centuries\", first recorded in 1625.<ref name=Murray4/> The adjective \"medieval\" (or sometimes \"mediaeval\"<ref name=Random1194/> or \"medi\u00e6val\"),<ref name=OED290>\"Mediaeval\" ''Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary''</ref> meaning pertaining to the Middle Ages, derives from ''medium aevum''.<ref name=Random1194>Flexner (ed.)

Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as \"invasions\", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the Western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration.<ref name=Brown122>Brown, ''World of Late Antiquity'', pp. 122\u2013124</ref> The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as [[Stilicho]] (d. 408), [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] (d. 454), [[Aspar]] (d. 471), [[Ricimer]] (d. 472), or [[Gundobad]] (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background.

There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with the [[Sasanian Empire]], the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of [[Roman law]]; the first effort\u2014the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]''\u2014was completed in 438.<ref name=Wickham81>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 81\u201383</ref> Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''.<ref name=Bauer200>Bauer ''History of the Medieval World'' pp. 200\u2013202</ref> Justinian also oversaw the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths,<ref name=Bauer206/> under [[Belisarius]] (d. 565).<ref name=Collins126>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 126, 130</ref> The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of [[Plague of Justinian|plague in 542]] led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests.<ref name=Bauer206>Bauer ''History of the Medieval World'' pp. 206\u2013213</ref>\n\nAt the Emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of [[Exarchate of Ravenna|most of Italy]], North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the [[early Muslim conquests]], but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.<ref name=Brown8>Brown \"Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean\" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Empire the slow infiltration of the Balkans by the Slavs added a further difficulty for Justinian's successors. It began gradually, but by the late 540s Slavic tribes were in [[Thrace]] and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyrium]], and had defeated an imperial army near [[Edirne|Adrianople]] in 551. In the 560s the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] began to expand from their base on the north bank of the [[Danube]]; by the end of the 6th-century, they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the Eastern emperors to pay tribute. They remained a strong power until 796.<ref name=James95>James ''Europe's Barbarians'' pp. 95\u201399</ref>\n\nAn additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (r. 582\u2013602) in Persian politics when he intervened in a [[Khosrow II#Accession to the throne|succession dispute]]. This led to a period of peace, but when Maurice was overthrown, [[Byzantine\u2013Sassanid War of 602\u2013628|the Persians invaded]] and during the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (r. 610\u2013641) controlled large chunks of the empire, including Egypt, Syria, and [[Anatolia]] until Heraclius' successful counterattack.

Values attached to [[Latin literature|Latin scholarship]] and [[Education in Ancient Rome|education]] mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, [[Jerome]] (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading [[Cicero]] than the [[Bible]]. By the 6th century, [[Gregory of Tours]] (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning [[shorthand]].<ref name=Brown174>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' pp. 174\u2013175</ref> By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book.<ref name=Brown181>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' p. 181</ref> Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some [[Early medieval literature|original works]] were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] (d. 489), [[Cassiodorus]] (d. [[circa|c.]] 585), and [[Boethius]] (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.<ref name=Brown45>Brown \"Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean\" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 45\u201349</ref>\n\nChanges also took place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces.{{efn-ua|Such entourages are named ''[[Comitatus (classical meaning)|comitatus]]'' by historians, although it is not a contemporary term. It was adapted in the 19th century from a word used by the 2nd-century historian [[Tacitus]] to describe the close companions of a lord or king.<ref name=Dict80>Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 80</ref> The ''comitatus'' comprised young men who were supposed to be utterly devoted to their lord. If their sworn lord died, they were expected to fight to the death also.<ref name=Geary56>Geary ''Before France and Germany'' pp. 56\u201357</ref>}} Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of [[weregild|compensation]].<ref name=Wickham189>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 189\u2013193</ref> Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by [[abbess]]es of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.<ref name=Wickham195>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 195\u2013199</ref>\n\n[[File:Fr\u00fchmittelalterliches Dorf.jpg|Reconstruction of an early medieval peasant village in Bavaria|thumb|left]]\n\nPeasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from [[archaeology]]; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either [[Code (law)|law codes]] or writers from the upper classes.<ref name=Wickham204>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' p. 204</ref> Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy.<ref name=Wickham205>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 205\u2013210</ref> Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems.<ref name=Wickham211>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.<ref name=Wickham215>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' p. 215</ref>\n\nRoman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages. Although Italian cities remained inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. Rome, for instance, shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30,000 by the end of the 6th century. [[Roman temple]]s were converted into [[Christianised sites|Christian churches]] and city walls remained in use.<ref name=Brown24-26>Brown \"Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean\" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 24\u201326</ref> In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials.

The defeat of Muslim forces at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732 led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks, but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and its replacement by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The Abbasids moved their capital to [[Baghdad]] and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing control of sections of the Muslim lands. Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula, the [[Aghlabids]] controlled North Africa, and the [[Tulunids]] became rulers of Egypt.<ref name=Brown15>Brown \"Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean\" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' p. 15</ref> By the middle of the 8th century, new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean; trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old [[Roman economy]].

African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or [[Naples]]. By the end of the 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally.<ref name=Wickham218>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 218\u2013219</ref>\n\nThe various Germanic states in the west all had [[coin]]ages that imitated existing Roman and Byzantine forms. Gold continued to be minted until the end of the 7th century in 693-94 when it was replaced by silver in the Merovingian kindgon. The basic Frankish silver coin was the [[denarius]] or [[French denier|denier]], while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a [[penny]]. From these areas, the denier or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, nor were gold except in Southern Europe.

Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the Western Church. The Eastern Church used Greek instead of the Western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclasm]], [[clerical marriage]], and [[Caesaropapism|state control of the Church]] had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities.<ref name=Collins218>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 218\u2013233</ref> The formal break, known as the [[East\u2013West Schism]], came in 1054, when the [[Pope|papacy]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarchy of Constantinople]] clashed over [[papal supremacy]] and [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two Churches\u2014the Western branch became the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the Eastern branch the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].<ref name=Davies328>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 328\u2013332</ref>\n\nThe [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|ecclesiastical structure]] of the Roman Empire survived the movements and invasions in the west mostly intact, but the papacy was little regarded, and few of the Western [[bishop]]s looked to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership. [[Byzantine Papacy|Many of the popes]] prior to 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and Eastern theological controversies. The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] (pope 590\u2013604) survived, and of those more than 850 letters, the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the [[Gregorian mission]] in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity.<ref name=WIckham170>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 170\u2013172</ref> [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionaries]] were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries, going first to England and Scotland and then on to the continent. Under such monks as [[Columba]] (d. 597) and [[Columbanus]] (d. 615), they founded monasteries, taught in Latin and Greek, and authored secular and religious works.<ref name=Colish62>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' pp. 62\u201363</ref>\n\nThe Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]] in the West. The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the [[Desert Fathers]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, called [[Cenobitic monasticism|cenobitism]], which was pioneered by [[Pachomius the Great|Pachomius]] (d. 348) in the 4th century.

The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria.<ref name=Bauer246>Bauer ''History of the Medieval World'' pp. 246\u2013253</ref> Such warfare was exploited by [[Pippin I|Pippin]] (d. 640), the [[Mayor of the Palace]] for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne.

A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought, and gained, authority for this coup from Pope {{nowrap|[[Pope Stephen II|Stephen II]]}} (pope 752\u2013757). Pippin's takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers, exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel, and circulated stories of the family's great piety. At the time of his death in 768, Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons, Charles (r. 768\u2013814) and [[Carloman I|Carloman]] (r. 768\u2013771). When Carloman died of natural causes, Charles blocked the succession of Carloman's young son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria. Charles, more often known as Charles the Great or [[Charlemagne]], embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion in 774 that unified a large portion of Europe, eventually controlling modern-day France, northern Italy, and [[Saxon Wars|Saxony]].

The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean.<ref name=Backman109/> The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called [[count]]s, who administered the [[county|counties]] the empire had been divided into.

Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk [[Alcuin]] (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the [[Northumbria's Golden Age|education]] available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]]\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new [[Writing system|script]] today known as [[Carolingian minuscule]],{{efn-ua|The [[Carolingian minuscule]] was developed from the [[uncial script]] of Late Antiquity, which was a smaller, rounder form of writing the [[Latin alphabet]] than the classical forms.<ref name=Davies241>Davies ''Europe'' p. 241</ref>}} allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in [[Christian liturgy|church liturgy]], imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the [[Gregorian chant]] in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced.<ref name=Colish66>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' pp. 66\u201370</ref> [[Linguistics|Grammarians]] of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the [[Classical Latin]] of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the Church and government.

Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son {{nowrap|[[Lothair I]]}} (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and [[Charles the Bald]] (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took [[East Francia]], comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles [[West Francia]] with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. [[Louis the German]] (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the [[wikt:suzerainty|suzerainty]] of his elder brother. The division was disputed. [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|{{nowrap|Pepin II}} of Aquitaine]] (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for [[Aquitaine]], while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia.

The various invading tribes had differing emphases on types of soldiers\u2014ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies.<ref name=NicolleWestern28>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 28\u201329</ref> During the early invasion period, the [[stirrup]] had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as [[shock troops]] because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider.<ref name=NicolleWestern30>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 30</ref> The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic [[composite bow]] in place of the earlier, and weaker, [[Scythia]]n composite bow.<ref name=NicolleWestern31>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 30\u201331</ref> Another development was the increasing use of [[longsword]]s<ref name=NicolleWestern34>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 34</ref> and the progressive replacement of [[scale armour]] by [[Mail (armour)|mail armour]] and [[lamellar armour]].<ref name=NicolleWestern39>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 39</ref>\n\nThe importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry.

Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as [[manor]]s or villages.<ref name=Backman156/> These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as [[manorialism]]. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond,<ref name=Backman164>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 164\u2013165</ref> with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of [[assarting]], or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population.<ref name=Epstein52>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\nThe [[open-field system]] of agriculture was commonly practiced in most of Europe, especially in \"northwestern and central Europe\".<ref name=Pounds166>Pounds ''Historical Geography of Europe'' p. 166</ref> Such agricultural communities had three basic characteristics: individual peasant holdings in the form of strips of land were scattered among the different fields belonging to the manor; crops were rotated from year to year to preserve soil fertility; and common land was used for grazing livestock and other purposes. Some regions used a three-field system of crop rotation, others retained the older two-field system.<ref name=Agri>Dawtry \"Agriculture\" ''Middle Ages'' pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nOther sections of society included the nobility, clergy, and townsmen. Nobles, both the titled [[nobility]] and simple [[knight]]s, exploited the manors and the peasants, although they did not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of [[feudalism]]. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or [[fief]]s, came to be considered hereditary, and in most areas they were no longer divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period.

Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords.<ref name=Davies311>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 311\u2013315</ref> Nobles were stratified; kings and the highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land, as well as other nobles.

Widows, who were often allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work.<ref name=Daily14>Singman ''Daily Life'' pp. 14\u201315</ref> Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade.

Philosophical discourse was stimulated by the rediscovery of [[Aristotle]] and his emphasis on [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]]. Scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] (d. 1142) and [[Peter Lombard]] (d. 1164) introduced [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]] into theology. In the late 11th and early 12th centuries [[cathedral school]]s spread throughout Western Europe, signalling the shift of learning from monasteries to cathedrals and towns.<ref name=Backman232>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 232\u2013237</ref> Cathedral schools were in turn replaced by the [[medieval university|universities]] established in major European cities.<ref name=Backman247>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 247\u2013252</ref> Philosophy and theology fused in [[scholasticism]], an attempt by 12th- and 13th-century scholars to reconcile authoritative texts, most notably Aristotle and the Bible. This movement tried to employ a systemic approach to truth and reason<ref name=MASchol>Loyn \"Scholasticism\" ''Middle Ages'' pp. 293\u2013294</ref> and culminated in the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (d. 1274), who wrote the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', or ''Summary of Theology''.<ref name=Colish295>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' pp. 295\u2013301</ref>\n\n[[File:Richard of Wallingford.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A medieval scholar making precise measurements in a 14th-century manuscript illustration]]\n\n[[Chivalry]] and the ethos of [[courtly love]] developed in royal and noble courts. This culture was expressed in the [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]] rather than Latin, and comprised poems, stories, legends, and popular songs spread by [[troubadour]]s, or wandering minstrels. Often the stories were written down in the ''[[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'', or \"songs of great deeds\", such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' or ''[[Hildebrand|The Song of Hildebrand]]''.<ref name=Backman252>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 252\u2013260</ref> Secular and religious histories were also produced.<ref name=Davies349>Davies ''Europe'' p. 349</ref> [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (d. c. 1155) composed his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', a collection of stories and legends about [[King Arthur|Arthur]].<ref name=SaulGeoffrey>Saul ''Companion to Medieval England'' pp. 113\u2013114</ref> Other works were more clearly history, such as [[Otto of Freising|Otto von Freising]]'s (d. 1158) ''Gesta Friderici Imperatoris'' detailing the deeds of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, or [[William of Malmesbury]]'s (d. c. 1143) ''Gesta Regum'' on the kings of England.<ref name=Davies349/>\n\nLegal studies advanced during the 12th century. Both secular law and [[canon law]], or ecclesiastical law, were studied in the High Middle Ages. Secular law, or Roman law, was advanced greatly by the discovery of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' in the 11th century, and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at [[University of Bologna|Bologna]]. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named [[Decretum Gratiani|Gratian]] (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of canon law\u2014the ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]''.<ref name=Backman237>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 237\u2013241</ref>\n\nAmong the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of [[Roman numerals]] with the [[decimal]] [[Positional notation|positional number system]] and the invention of [[algebra]], which allowed more advanced mathematics. Astronomy advanced following the translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|school at Salerno]].<ref name=Backman241>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 241\u2013246</ref>\n\n===Technology and military===\n{{main|Medieval technology|Medieval warfare|History of science#Science in the Middle Ages}}\n{{further|List of medieval European scientists}}\n[[File:Tommaso da modena, ritratti di domenicani (Ugo di Provenza) 1352 150cm, treviso, ex convento di san niccol\u00f2, sala del capitolo.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Cardinal [[Hugh of Saint-Cher]] by [[Tommaso da Modena]], 1352, the first known depiction of [[spectacles]]<ref>Ilardi, ''Renaissance Vision'', pp.&nbsp;18\u201319</ref>]]\n\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries, Europe experienced economic growth and innovations in methods of production.

Where available, Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials. From the tentative beginnings known as the [[First Romanesque]], the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form. Just before 1000 there was a great wave of building stone churches all over Europe.<ref name=Benton55>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' p. 55</ref> [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] buildings have massive stone walls, openings topped by semi-circular arches, small windows, and, particularly in France, arched stone vaults.<ref name=Adams181>Adams ''History of Western Art'' pp. 181\u2013189</ref> The large [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] with coloured sculpture in [[Relief|high relief]] became a central feature of fa\u00e7ades, especially in France, and the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals.<ref name=Benton58to75>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 58\u201360, 65\u201366, 73\u201375</ref> According to art historian [[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C.

[[Cluny Abbey]], founded in the [[M\u00e2con]] region of France in 909, was established as part of the [[Cluniac Reforms]], a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear.<ref name=Rhino>Rosenwein ''Rhinoceros Bound'' pp. 40\u201341</ref> Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour.

The ideals upon which it was based were brought to the papacy by Pope [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]] (pope 1049\u20131054), and provided the ideology of clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] (pope 1073\u201385) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of [[investiture]], clerical marriage, and [[simony]]. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the [[Concordat of Worms]]. The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to [[laity|lay]] authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.<ref name=Rhino/>\n\n[[File:Abbey-of-senanque-provence-gordes.jpg|[[S\u00e9nanque Abbey]], [[Gordes]], France|thumb|left]]\n\nThe High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements. Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms, people sought to participate in new forms of religious life. New monastic orders were founded, including the [[Carthusian]]s and the [[Cistercians]]. The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (d. 1153). These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler [[hermit|hermetical]] monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic life]].<ref name=Barber145>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 145\u2013149</ref> [[Christian pilgrimage|Religious pilgrimages]] were also encouraged.

They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the [[Black Sea]] and around the [[Aegean Sea]]. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom of Serbia]], the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] and the city-state of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and [[Byzantine\u2013Ottoman Wars|steadily expanded]] throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the [[Battle of Nicopolis]].<ref name=Davies385>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 385\u2013389</ref> Constantinople was finally [[Fall of Constantinople|captured]] by the Ottomans in 1453.<ref name=Davies446>Davies ''Europe'' p. 446</ref>\n\n===Controversy within the Church===\n{{Main|Western Schism|Bohemian Reformation|Hussites}}\n[[File:07 Gr\u00e9goire XI (couronn\u00e9 par Guy de Boulogne).jpg|thumb|left|[[Guy of Boulogne]] crowning Pope Gregory XI in a miniature from [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart's ''Chroniques'']]]]\n\nDuring the tumultuous 14th century, disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the [[Avignon Papacy]] of 1309\u201376,<ref name=Thomson170>Thomson ''Western Church'' pp. 170\u2013171</ref> also called the \"Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy\" (a reference to the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the Jews),<ref name=MAAvignon>Loyn \"Avignon\" ''Middle Ages'' p. 45</ref> and then to the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], lasting from 1378 to 1418, when there were two and later three rival popes, each supported by several states.<ref name= MAGreat>Loyn \"Great Schism\" ''Middle Ages'' p. 153</ref> Ecclesiastical officials convened at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1414, and in the following year the council deposed one of the rival popes, leaving only two claimants. Further depositions followed, and in November 1417 the council elected [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]] (pope 1417\u201331) as pope.<ref name=Thomson184>Thomson ''Western Church'' pp. 184\u2013187</ref>\n\nBesides the schism, the Western Church was riven by theological controversies, some of which turned into heresies. [[John Wycliffe]] (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the [[Eucharist]] that were contrary to Church doctrine.<ref name=Thomson197>Thomson ''Western Church'' pp. 197\u2013199</ref> Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: [[Lollardy]] in England and [[Hussites|Hussitism]] in Bohemia.<ref name=Thomson218>Thomson ''Western Church'' p. 218</ref> The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of [[Jan Hus]], who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite Church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages.<ref name=Thomson213>Thomson ''Western Church'' pp. 213\u2013217</ref> Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (r. 1285\u20131314) and the Hospitallers.<ref name=Templars>Loyn \"Knights of the Temple (Templars)\" ''Middle Ages'' pp. 201\u2013202</ref>\n\nThe papacy further refined the practice in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief in the power of the Devil. Mystics such as [[Meister Eckhart]] (d. 1327) and [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]] (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.<ref name=Davies436>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 436\u2013437</ref>\n\n===Scholars, intellectuals, and exploration===\n{{see also|Europeans in Medieval China}}\nDuring the Later Middle Ages, theologians such as [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]] (d. 1308) and [[William of Ockham]] (d. c. 1348),<ref name=MASchol/> led a reaction against intellectualist scholasticism, objecting to the application of reason to faith. Their efforts undermined the prevailing [[Platonic idealism|Platonic]] idea of universals. Ockham's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy.<ref name=Davies433>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 433\u2013434</ref> Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by [[Custom (law)|customary law]]. The lone exception to this trend was in England, where the [[common law]] remained pre-eminent. Other countries codified their laws; legal codes were promulgated in Castile, Poland, and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]].<ref name=Davies438>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 438\u2013439</ref>\n\n[[File:Studying astronomy and geometry.jpg|thumb|Clerics studying [[astronomy]] and [[geometry]], French, early 15th century]]\n\nEducation remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy. The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest, but the secondary subjects of the [[trivium]]\u2014grammar, rhetoric, logic\u2014were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities. Commercial secondary schools spread, and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise. Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Lay literacy rates rose, but were still low; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten percent of males and one percent of females in 1500.<ref name=Singman224>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 224</ref>\n\nThe publication of vernacular literature increased, with [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] (d. 1321), [[Petrarch]] (d. 1374) and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (d. 1375) in 14th-century Italy, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (d. 1400) and [[William Langland]] (d. c. 1386) in England, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]] (d. 1464) and [[Christine de Pizan]] (d. c. 1430) in France. Much literature remained religious in character, and although a great deal of it continued to be written in Latin, a new demand developed for saints' lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages.<ref name=Davies438/> This was fed by the growth of the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' movement, most prominently in the formation of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], but also in the works of [[German mystic]]s such as Meister Eckhart and [[Johannes Tauler]] (d. 1361).<ref name=Keen282>Keen ''Pelican History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 282\u2013283</ref> Theatre also developed in the guise of [[Mystery play|miracle plays]] put on by the Church.<ref name=Davies438/> At the end of the period, the development of the [[printing press]] in about 1450 led to the establishment of publishing houses throughout Europe by 1500.<ref name=Davies445>Davies ''Europe'' p. 445</ref>\n\nIn the early 15th century, the countries of the Iberian peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Azores]], and [[Cape Verde]] during his lifetime. After his death, exploration continued; [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (d. 1500) went around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1486 and [[Vasco da Gama]] (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498.<ref name=Davies451>Davies ''Europe'' p. 451</ref> The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by [[Christopher Columbus]] (d. 1506) in 1492 that [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovered the Americas]].<ref name=Davies454>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 454\u2013455</ref> The English crown under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] sponsored the voyage of [[John Cabot]] (d. 1498) in 1497, which landed on [[Cape Breton Island]].<ref name=Davies511>Davies ''Europe'' p. 511</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Agriculture}}\n\n===Technological and military developments===\n[[File:Crescenzi calendar.jpg|thumb|Agricultural calendar, c. 1470, from a manuscript of [[Pietro de Crescenzi]]]]\n\nOne of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry.<ref name=NicolleWestern180>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 180</ref> The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success.<ref name=NicolleWestern183>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 183</ref> Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and [[plate armour]] was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed.<ref name=NicolleWestern188>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 188</ref> [[Pole weapon|Pole arms]] reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.<ref name=Nicolle185>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 185</ref>\n\nIn agriculture, the increased usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun.

Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles, which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century, until almost the end of the period. [[International Gothic]] was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400, producing masterpieces such as the [[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].<ref name=Benton253>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 253\u2013256</ref> All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality, and in the 15th century the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons, commissioning small portraits of themselves in oils as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery, [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|ivory caskets]], [[cassone]] chests, and [[maiolica]] pottery. These objects also included the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] produced by mostly [[Mud\u00e9jar]] potters in Spain. Although royalty owned huge collections of plate, little survives except for the [[Royal Gold Cup]].<ref>Lightbown ''Secular Goldsmiths' Work'' p. 78</ref> Italian silk manufacture developed, so that Western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders [[tapestry]] weaving of sets like ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn]]'' became a major luxury industry.<ref name=Benton257>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 257\u2013262</ref>\n\nThe large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the [[Pulpit of Sant' Andrea, Pistoia (Giovanni Pisano)|Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea]]. Painted or carved wooden relief [[altarpiece]]s became common, especially as churches created many [[Chapel|side-chapels]]. [[Early Netherlandish painting]] by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (d. 1441) and [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of [[Incunable|incunabula]], or works printed before 1500,<ref name=BL>British Library Staff \"[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]\" ''British Library''</ref> by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small [[woodcut]]s, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century. More expensive [[engraving]]s supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images.<ref name=Griffiths17>Griffiths ''Prints and Printmaking'' pp. 17\u201318; 39\u201346</ref>\n\n==Modern perceptions==\n{{see also| Dark Ages (historiography)|Medieval studies|Middle Ages in popular culture}}\n\n[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Medieval illustration of the [[spherical Earth]] in a 14th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'']]\n\nThe medieval period is frequently caricatured as a \"time of ignorance and superstition\" that placed \"the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity.\"<ref>Lindberg \"Medieval Church Encounters\" ''When Science & Christianity Meet'' p. 8</ref> This is a legacy from both the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] when scholars favourably contrasted their intellectual cultures with those of the medieval period. Renaissance scholars saw the Middle Ages as a period of decline from the high culture and civilisation of the Classical world; Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith, and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition.<ref name=Davies291>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 291\u2013293</ref>\n\nOthers argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages. Science historian [[Edward Grant]] writes, \"If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [in the 18th century]<!--original quotation says: \"expressed in the Age of Reason\"-->, they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities\".<ref name=Grant9>Grant ''God and Reason'' p. 9</ref> Also, contrary to common belief, [[David C.

One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century<ref name=flat>Russell ''Inventing the Flat Earth'' pp. 49\u201358</ref> and still very common, is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the [[Myth of the flat Earth|Earth was flat]].<ref name=flat/> This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere.<ref>Grant ''Planets, Stars, & Orbs'' pp. 626\u2013630</ref> Lindberg and [[Ronald Numbers]], another scholar of the period, state that there \"was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference\".<ref>Lindberg and Numbers \"Beyond War and Peace\" ''Church History'' p. 342</ref> Other misconceptions such as \"the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages\", \"the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science\", or \"the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy\", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by historical research.<ref name=Numberslect>Numbers \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20171011022345/https://www.faraday.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/CIS/Numbers/Numbers_Lecture.pdf Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective]\" ''Lecture archive'' Archived 11 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist-ua|60em}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book |author=Adams, Laurie Schneider |title=A History of Western Art |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=Boston, MA |year=2001 |isbn=0-07-231717-5 |edition=Third}}\n* {{cite book |author=Albrow, Martin |title=The Global Age: State and Society Beyond Modernity |year=1997 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, CA |isbn=0-8047-2870-4}}\n* {{cite book |author=Backman, Clifford R. |title=The Worlds of Medieval Europe |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-512169-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Barber, Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Barber |title=The Two Cities: Medieval Europe 1050\u20131320 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1992 |isbn=0-415-09682-0}}\n* {{cite book |author=Barber, Richard |title=Edward, Prince of Wales and Aquitaine: A Biography of the Black Prince |authorlink=Richard Barber |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |year=1978 |isbn=0-684-15864-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Barlow, Frank |title=The Feudal Kingdom of England 1042\u20131216 |authorlink=Frank Barlow (historian) |edition=Fourth |publisher=Longman |location=New York |year=1988 |isbn=0-582-49504-0}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bauer, Susan Wise |authorlink=Susan Wise Bauer |title=The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade |publisher=W.

The Broadway production was converted to film with limited changes, and starred Palminteri and De Niro.\n\nDe Niro, who first viewed the play in Los Angeles in 1990, acquired the rights from Palminteri, intent on making the play his directorial debut. The duo then worked heavily together on the screenplay, with Palminteri aiming to retain many of the aspects of the original script, as it was based largely on his own childhood. Production began in 1991, and was funded in collaboration with De Niro's [[TriBeCa Productions]] and [[Savoy Pictures]], as the first film released by each studio.\n\n''A Bronx Tale'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 14, 1993, and released in the United States on September 29, 1993. The film achieved limited commercial success, grossing over $17 million domestically. However, it fared much better with critics, who praised the performances of the leads, and launched Palminteri's acting career, while also helping De Niro gain acceptance as a director.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1960, Lorenzo works as a [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] bus driver in Belmont, a working-class Italian-American neighborhood in [[The Bronx]], with his wife Rosina and his nine-year old son Calogero. Calogero becomes enamored of the criminal life and [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] presence in his neighborhood, led by Sonny. One day, Calogero witnesses a murder committed by Sonny in defense of a friend being assaulted. When Calogero chooses to keep quiet when questioned by NYPD detectives, Sonny takes a liking to him and gives him the nickname \"C\". Sonny's men offer Lorenzo a better paying job, but preferring a law-abiding life as a bus driver, politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and introduces him to his crew. Calogero earns tips amounting to $600 working in the Mafia bar and [[craps|throwing dice]], and is admonished harshly by Lorenzo when he discovers the cash. Lorenzo speaks severely to Sonny, returns the money, and angrily warns him to keep away from Calogero.\n\nEight years later, a 17-year old Calogero has grown into a young man who has been visiting Sonny regularly without his father's knowledge. Calogero is also part of a gang of local Italian-American boys, which concerns Sonny. Later, Calogero meets an black girl, Jane, and they develop a tentative friendship. Despite the high level of racial tension and dislike between Italian-Americans and blacks in the neighborhood, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from both his father and Sonny, with the latter lending Calogero his car. Later, Calogero's friends beat up black cyclists who ride through their neighborhood, despite Calogero's attempts to defend them. One of the cyclists turns out to be Jane's brother, and he mistakes Calogero for one of the assailants and accuses him of beating him up when he and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation, and calls him a [[nigger]], which he instantly regrets. Jane leaves with her brother.\n\nAt home, Calogero is confronted by his father who had just seen him driving Sonny's car. An argument ensues and Calogero storms out. Shortly thereafter, Calogero is confronted by Sonny and his crew, who found a bomb on Sonny's car and suspected Calogero of planning to assassinate him. Calogero tearfully pleads his unwavering dedication to Sonny. Sonny recognizes Calogero's innocence and allows him to leave. The black boys egg the Italian-American boys' usual spot in retaliation for the previous beating, and Calogero's friends make a plan to strike back using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. They force Calogero to participate, but while on their way, Sonny stops their car and orders Calogero out. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that her brother had since admitted that the boy who beat him up was not Calogero. Jane and Calogero make amends, but Calogero suddenly remembers his friends' plans to attack Jane's neighborhood, and the two rush to stop them. Calogero and Jane arrive to find the Italian-American boys' car in flames. During the attack, a black boy threw an unbroken Molotov cocktail back at the car. Entering through the window, it ignites the remaining Molotov cocktails, resulting in an explosion that kills everyone inside.\n\nCalogero rushes into the crowded Mafia bar to thank Sonny for saving his life, but an assailant shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the assailant was the son of the man he witnessed Sonny kill eight years earlier. At Sonny's funeral, countless people come to pay their respects. When the crowd disperses, a lone man, Carmine, visits the funeral, claiming that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the man being assaulted whom Sonny had defended when he committed the murder. Carmine tells Calogero that he will be filling in for Sonny in the neighborhood for the time being, and promises Calogero help should he ever need. Carmine leaves just as Calogero's father unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny. Lorenzo thanks him for saving his son's life and admits that he had never hated him, but that he had resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero and his father walk home together as Calogero narrates the lessons he learned from his two mentors.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Lorenzo\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Sonny\n* [[Lillo Brancato, Jr.]] as Calogero (age 17)\n* [[Francis Capra]] as Calogero (age 9)\n* [[Taral Hicks]] as Jane\n* [[Kathrine Narducci]] as Rosina\n* Clem Caserta as Jimmy Whispers\n* Frank Pietrangolare as Danny K.O\n* Alfred Sauchelli Jr. as Bobby Bars\n* Robert D'Andrea as Tony Toupee\n* Eddie Montanaro as Eddie Mush\n* Fred Fischer as JoJo The Whale\n* Dave Salerno as Frankie Coffeecake\n* Joe D'Onofrio as Slick (Age 17)\n* [[Louis Vanaria]] as Crazy Mario\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Nicky Zero\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Carmine (uncredited)\n}}\n*Rob Schneider as one of the bikers\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nAfter acquiring the rights to create the film, with De Niro claiming the deal was made solely with a [[gentlemen's agreement]] with Palminteri, the duo began crafting the screenplay.<ref>{{Cite web | last=Vlastelica | first=Ryan | title=Chazz Palminteri on A Bronx Tale, Keyser S\u00f6ze, and Stallone\u2019s career advice | url=https://film.avclub.com/chazz-palminteri-on-a-bronx-tale-keyser-soze-and-stal-1798245059| work=The A.V.

To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of Earth's [[elliptic orbit]] and the [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|attenuation]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]] have to be taken into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>ext</sub>}}), corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by<ref>{{cite journal|author=C.

The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989&nbsp;AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033&nbsp;AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.\n\nThe solar illuminance constant ({{math|''E''<sub>sc</sub>}}), is equal to 128\u00d710<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;[[lux]]. The direct normal illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>dn</sub>}}), corrected for the attenuating effects of the atmosphere is given by:\n:<math>E_{\\rm dn}=E_{\\rm ext}\\,e^{-cm},</math>\nwhere {{mvar|c}} is the [[atmospheric extinction]] and {{mvar|m}} is the relative optical [[airmass]].

Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full [[moonlight]] on Earth, a distance of about 500&nbsp;AU (~69&nbsp;[[light-hour]]s) is needed; only a handful of objects in the Solar System have been discovered that are known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them [[90377 Sedna]] and {{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}.\n\n== Surface illumination ==\n[[File:Sun_over_Lake_Hawea,_New_Zealand.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sunlight shining through [[cloud]]s, giving rise to [[crepuscular rays]]]]\nThe spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects, with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively, and red dominating during sunrise and sunset. These effects are apparent in natural light [[photography]] where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere.\n\nWhile the color of the sky is usually determined by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an exception occurs at sunset and twilight. \"Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|title=Atmospheric Optics|author=Craig Bohren|author-link=Craig Bohren|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175627/http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nSee [[diffuse sky radiation]] for more details.\n\n=== Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth's surface ===\nThe Sun may be said to [[Lighting|illuminate]], which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range.

Aside from effects that arise at sunset and sunrise, the spectral composition changes primarily in respect to how directly sunlight is able to illuminate.

Water vapour in the lower atmosphere produces further scattering and ozone, dust and water particles will also absorb selective wavelengths.<ref name=\"Wyszecki_and_Stiles\">{{cite book|last1=Wyszecki|first1=G\u00fcnter|last2=Stiles|first2=W.

When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].\n\nThe amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the Sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],\n:<math>\\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the \"areal velocity\" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.\n\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{T} \\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\mathrm{constant}.</math>\n\nIf we assume the solar radiation power&nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.\n\nBut the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |access-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archive-date=2012-01-12 |df= }}</ref> The [[effect of Sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).\n\n===Solar intensity variation===\n{{Further|Solar variation}}\nSpace-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.<ref name=\"acrim\"/> When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&nbsp;10,000 years.\nSuch reconstructions have been done.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522\u2013538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url =https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6539/datastream/PDF/view | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&A...523A..39S}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = 16| pages = 5967\u20135971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}</ref> These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activity varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).\n\n==Life on Earth==\nThe existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars\u2014a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.\n\n[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].\n\nIn [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.\n\nThe more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).\n\n==Cultural aspects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1862-63)]]\nThe effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.\n[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''T\u00e9li ver\u0151f\u00e9ny'' (\"Winter Sunshine\") by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Medny\u00e1nszky]], early 20th century]]\nMany people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.\n\nIn colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.\n\nIn many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on Earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].\n\n===Sunbathing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] -->\n{{main|Sun tanning}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.\n\nFor many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an \"all-over\" or \"even\" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.\n\nControlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.\n\nSkin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.\n\n==Effects on human health==\n{{main|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThe [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] and a [[mutagen]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12174089 | volume=147 | issue=2 | title=Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma? |date=August 2002 | journal=Br.

To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of Earth's [[elliptic orbit]] and the [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|attenuation]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]] have to be taken into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>ext</sub>}}), corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by<ref>{{cite journal|author=C.

The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989&nbsp;AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033&nbsp;AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.\n\nThe solar illuminance constant ({{math|''E''<sub>sc</sub>}}), is equal to 128\u00d710<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;[[lux]]. The direct normal illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>dn</sub>}}), corrected for the attenuating effects of the atmosphere is given by:\n:<math>E_{\\rm dn}=E_{\\rm ext}\\,e^{-cm},</math>\nwhere {{mvar|c}} is the [[atmospheric extinction]] and {{mvar|m}} is the relative optical [[airmass]]. The atmospheric extinction brings the number of lux down to around 100 000 lux.\n\nThe total amount of energy received at ground level from the Sun at the zenith depends on the distance to the Sun and thus on the time of year.

Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full [[moonlight]] on Earth, a distance of about 500&nbsp;AU (~69&nbsp;[[light-hour]]s) is needed; only a handful of objects in the Solar System have been discovered that are known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them [[90377 Sedna]] and {{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}.\n\n== Surface illumination ==\n[[File:Sun_over_Lake_Hawea,_New_Zealand.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sunlight shining through [[cloud]]s, giving rise to [[crepuscular rays]]]]\nThe spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects, with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively, and red dominating during sunrise and sunset. These effects are apparent in natural light [[photography]] where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere.\n\nWhile the color of the sky is usually determined by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an exception occurs at sunset and twilight. \"Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|title=Atmospheric Optics|author=Craig Bohren|author-link=Craig Bohren|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175627/http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nSee [[diffuse sky radiation]] for more details.\n\n=== Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth's surface ===\nThe Sun may be said to [[Lighting|illuminate]], which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range.

Aside from effects that arise at sunset and sunrise, the spectral composition changes primarily in respect to how directly sunlight is able to illuminate. When illumination is indirect, [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the upper atmosphere will lead blue wavelengths to dominate. Water vapour in the lower atmosphere produces further scattering and ozone, dust and water particles will also absorb selective wavelengths.<ref name=\"Wyszecki_and_Stiles\">{{cite book|last1=Wyszecki|first1=G\u00fcnter|last2=Stiles|first2=W.

When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].\n\nThe amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the Sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],\n:<math>\\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the \"areal velocity\" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.\n\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{T} \\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\mathrm{constant}.</math>\n\nIf we assume the solar radiation power&nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.\n\nBut the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |access-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archive-date=2012-01-12 |df= }}</ref> The [[effect of Sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).\n\n===Solar intensity variation===\n{{Further|Solar variation}}\nSpace-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.<ref name=\"acrim\"/> When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&nbsp;10,000 years.\nSuch reconstructions have been done.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522\u2013538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url =https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6539/datastream/PDF/view | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&A...523A..39S}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = 16| pages = 5967\u20135971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}</ref> These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activity varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).\n\n==Life on Earth==\nThe existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars\u2014a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.\n\n[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].\n\nIn [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.\n\nThe more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).\n\n==Cultural aspects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1862-63)]]\nThe effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.\n[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''T\u00e9li ver\u0151f\u00e9ny'' (\"Winter Sunshine\") by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Medny\u00e1nszky]], early 20th century]]\nMany people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.\n\nIn colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.\n\nIn many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on Earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].\n\n===Sunbathing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] -->\n{{main|Sun tanning}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.\n\nFor many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an \"all-over\" or \"even\" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.\n\nControlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.\n\nSkin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.\n\n==Effects on human health==\n{{main|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThe [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] and a [[mutagen]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12174089 | volume=147 | issue=2 | title=Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma? |date=August 2002 | journal=Br.
