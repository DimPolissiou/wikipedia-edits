She was the only surviving child of [[Madam C. J. Walker]], popularly credited as being the first self-made female [[millionaire]] in the United States and one of the first African American millionaires.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nA'Lelia Walker was born Lelia McWilliams in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], in 1885, the daughter of Moses and [[Madam C. J. Walker|Sarah]] (n\u00e9e Breedlove) McWilliams. Her father died when she was 2. Her mother later married John Davis in 1894 and divorced in 1903. In 1906, her mother married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper advertising salesman, and became an independent hairdresser and retailer of cosmetic creams. A'Lelia grew up in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and attended [[Knoxville College]] in Tennessee before entering the family business.<ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\">A'Lelia Bundles, ''On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C. J. Walker'', New York: Scribner (2001).</ref>\n\n===Career===\n====Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company====\nA'Lelia Walker became president of [[Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company|her mother's company]] in 1919 and remained in that position until her death in August 1931. She initiated a number of marketing campaigns to promote the company\u2014including a competition among prominent ministers for a Trip to the Holy Land in 1924\u2014and remained the face of the Walker Company after her mother's death, but the day-to-day operation was overseen by Attorney F. B. Ransom and factory manager Alice Kelly at the [[Indianapolis]] headquarters. During the 1920s, A'Lelia Walker immersed herself in Harlem's dynamic social life as a patron of the arts and hostess of some of [[Harlem Renaissance|the era]]'s most notable social gatherings.<ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/>\n\nWalker Company sales began to suffer in 1929, with the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. Increased expenses associated with a new million dollar headquarters and manufacturing facility opened in late 1927 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], placed additional financial pressure on the operation and A'Lelia was forced to sell a great deal of her valuable art and antiques.<ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Her adopted daughter Mae Walker was president of the company from 1931 until her death in 1945.

Today the company's building is known as the [[Madame Walker Theatre Center|Madam Walker Theatre Center]] and is a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n====Arts Patron====\nA'Lelia Walker counted among her friends many accomplished African American musicians. She developed an early love of [[classical music]] and [[opera]] in part because the [[choir director]] at the AME church she and her mother attended in [[St. Louis]] was a classically trained opera singer and [[organist]]. She grew up in the neighborhood where [[Scott Joplin]] and other [[ragtime]] musicians gathered at Tom Turpin's Rosebud Cafe on [[Streets of St. Louis#Market Street|St. Louis's Market Street]]<nowiki/>.\n\nDuring the 1920s she hosted many musicians, actors, writers, artists, political figures and socialites in her townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street near Lenox Avenue.<ref>http://www.aleliabundles.com/2013/11/23/writing-biography-an-update-on-the-joy-goddess-of-harlem/\n</ref> The elegant [[brick]] and [[limestone]] building had been designed by [[Vertner Tandy]], a founder of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity and the first black architect licensed in New York State. Almost from the time of her arrival in Harlem in 1913, her dinner parties, dances and [[Soir\u00e9es|soirees]] included well known Harlem figures like [[James Reese Europe]], [[J. Rosamond Johnson|J. Rosamand Johnson]], [[Bert Williams]] and [[Florence Mills]]. Live music\u2014from classical and ragtime to [[jazz]] and [[blues]]\u2014was a regular feature with entertainment provided by her musician friends.\n\nIn October 1927, she converted a floor of the home into The Dark Tower, a cultural salon that became legendary as one of the gathering places of the era, a place where Harlem's talented artists socialized with their [[Greenwich Village]] counterparts as well as European and African royalty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Big Sea: An Autobiography|last=Hughes|first=Langston|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1940|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> She commissioned Austrian designer [[Paul Frankl]] to create the interior.  She also entertained at [[Villa Lewaro]], her country house in [[Westchester County]] and at her pied-a-terre at 80 Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem.\n\n==Personal life==\nWalker was married three times: to John Robinson, a hotel waiter,<ref>U. S. Census 1910</ref> from whom she separated about 1911 and whom she divorced in 1914; to Dr. Wiley Wilson in 1919; and to Dr. James Arthur Kennedy, in 1926, whom she divorced just a few months before her death in 1931. Her adoptive daughter was Fairy Mae Bryant, born in November 1898, who became an orphan and got adopted in 1912. She was known as Mae Walker and traveled with Madam C. J. Walker as a model and assistant.

She was the only surviving child of [[Madam C. J. Walker]], popularly credited as being the first self-made female [[millionaire]] in the United States and one of the first African American millionaires.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nA'Lelia Walker was born Lelia McWilliams in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], in 1885, the daughter of Moses and [[Madam C. J. Walker|Sarah]] (n\u00e9e Breedlove) McWilliams. Her father died when she was 2. Her mother later married John Davis in 1894 and divorced in 1903. In 1906, her mother married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper advertising salesman, and became an independent hairdresser and retailer of cosmetic creams. A'Lelia grew up in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and attended [[Knoxville College]] in Tennessee before entering the family business.<ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\">A'Lelia Bundles, ''On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C. J. Walker'', New York: Scribner (2001).</ref>\n\n===Career===\n====Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company====\nA'Lelia Walker became president of [[Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company|her mother's company]] in 1919 and remained in that position until her death in August 1931. She initiated a number of marketing campaigns to promote the company\u2014including a competition among prominent ministers for a Trip to the Holy Land in 1924\u2014and remained the face of the Walker Company after her mother's death, but the day-to-day operation was overseen by Attorney F. B. Ransom and factory manager Alice Kelly at the [[Indianapolis]] headquarters. During the 1920s, A'Lelia Walker immersed herself in Harlem's dynamic social life as a patron of the arts and hostess of some of [[Harlem Renaissance|the era]]'s most notable social gatherings.<ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/>\n\nWalker Company sales began to suffer in 1929, with the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. Increased expenses associated with a new million dollar headquarters and manufacturing facility opened in late 1927 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], placed additional financial pressure on the operation and A'Lelia was forced to sell a great deal of her valuable art and antiques.<ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Her adopted daughter Mae Walker was president of the company from 1931 until her death in 1945. Mae's daughter, A'Lelia Mae Perry Bundles (b. 1928\u2013 d. 1976),<ref name='SSDI-AB'>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ancestry.com\n |title=Social Security Death Index <nowiki>[database on-line]</nowiki>\n |publisher=The Generations Network\n |location=[[United States]]\n |year=2009\n |accessdate=2009-11-06\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091105205658/http://www.ancestry.com/| archivedate= 5 November 2009 | url-status= live}}\n</ref> succeeded her mother as president of the company. Today the company's building is known as the [[Madame Walker Theatre Center|Madam Walker Theatre Center]] and is a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n====Arts Patron====\nA'Lelia Walker counted among her friends many accomplished African American musicians. She developed an early love of [[classical music]] and [[opera]] in part because the [[choir director]] at the AME church she and her mother attended in [[St. Louis]] was a classically trained opera singer and [[organist]]. She grew up in the neighborhood where [[Scott Joplin]] and other [[ragtime]] musicians gathered at Tom Turpin's Rosebud Cafe on [[Streets of St. Louis#Market Street|St. Louis's Market Street]]<nowiki/>.\n\nDuring the 1920s she hosted many musicians, actors, writers, artists, political figures and socialites in her townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street near Lenox Avenue.<ref>http://www.aleliabundles.com/2013/11/23/writing-biography-an-update-on-the-joy-goddess-of-harlem/\n</ref> The elegant [[brick]] and [[limestone]] building had been designed by [[Vertner Tandy]], a founder of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity and the first black architect licensed in New York State. Almost from the time of her arrival in Harlem in 1913, her dinner parties, dances and [[Soir\u00e9es|soirees]] included well known Harlem figures like [[James Reese Europe]], [[J. Rosamond Johnson|J. Rosamand Johnson]], [[Bert Williams]] and [[Florence Mills]]. Live music\u2014from classical and ragtime to [[jazz]] and [[blues]]\u2014was a regular feature with entertainment provided by her musician friends.\n\nIn October 1927, she converted a floor of the home into The Dark Tower, a cultural salon that became legendary as one of the gathering places of the era, a place where Harlem's talented artists socialized with their [[Greenwich Village]] counterparts as well as European and African royalty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Big Sea: An Autobiography|last=Hughes|first=Langston|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1940|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> She commissioned Austrian designer [[Paul Frankl]] to create the interior.  She also entertained at [[Villa Lewaro]], her country house in [[Westchester County]] and at her pied-a-terre at 80 Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem.\n\n==Personal life==\nWalker was married three times: to John Robinson, a hotel waiter,<ref>U. S. Census 1910</ref> from whom she separated about 1911 and whom she divorced in 1914; to Dr. Wiley Wilson in 1919; and to Dr. James Arthur Kennedy, in 1926, whom she divorced just a few months before her death in 1931. Her adoptive daughter was Fairy Mae Bryant, born in November 1898, who became an orphan and got adopted in 1912. She was known as Mae Walker and traveled with Madam C. J. Walker as a model and assistant. In November 1923, A'Lelia Walker orchestrated an elaborate \"Million Dollar Wedding\" (actually closer to $40,000) for Mae's marriage to Dr. Gordon Jackson.<ref>http://www.aleliabundles.com/2011/12/01/my-grandmothers-harlem-renaissance-wedding/</ref> Mae Walker, a graduate of [[Spelman College|Spelman Seminary]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], divorced Jackson in 1926 and married Attorney Marion R.
