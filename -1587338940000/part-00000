Glessner House''', operated as the '''[https://www.glessnerhouse.org/ Glessner House]''', is an architecturally important 19th-century residence located at 1800 S. [[Prairie Avenue]], [[Chicago, Illinois]].  It was designed in 1885\u20131886 by architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] and completed in late 1887.    The property was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on October 14, 1970.  The site was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 17, 1970, and as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on January 7, 1976.\n\n==John J. Glessner==\nJohn Jacob Glessner (1843\u20131936) was a partner in the firm of [[Benjamin H. Warder|Warder, Bushnell & Glessner]], a farm machinery manufacturer headquartered in [[Springfield, Ohio]].  Immediately after his marriage in 1870 to Frances Macbeth, Glessner relocated to Chicago where he opened a branch office.  In 1902, the firm and four others, including firms controlled by [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Cyrus McCormick]], and [[James Deering]], merged to form [[International Harvester]] (now known as [[Navistar International Corporation]]), which became the fourth largest corporation in the country.  Glessner was appointed vice president and continued in that capacity for many years.  He died in 1936 at the age of 92.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1936 }}\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Chicago's most prestigious residential street was Prairie Avenue on the [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|South Side]].  Enjoying economic success, Glessner decided to build a home for his family on Prairie Avenue and 18th Street.  He chose one of the young nation's foremost architects, [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H. H. Richardson]].\n\n==Henry Hobson Richardson==\n[[File:Glessner3678107877 3f5db1c89a o.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Glessner House in 1887, as construction was being completed.

The Richardsonian Romanesque style took elements of European [[Romanesque architecture]] from buildings constructed in the 11th and 12th centuries, and adapted them to American idioms.\n\nFor example, the heavy, rough-cut facing stones of Romanesque architecture were no longer necessary for [[engineering]] reasons.  Architects and builders had discovered more efficient ways for walls to distribute and bear a building's weight.  Richardson believed that what was no longer necessary for function could be made to serve a new purpose of form, by creating a new visual language of individual separation and privacy.\n\nThe Glessner residence was Richardson's last work. He died at 48, just 3 weeks after completion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Drury|first=John|title=Old Chicago Houses|year=1976|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago IL|isbn=0-226-16555-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/oldchicagohouses0000drur/page/45 45]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oldchicagohouses0000drur/page/45}}</ref>\n\n==The significance of the Glessner House==\nThe innovative [[floor plan]] and design of the Glessner house rank it as one of the most important residential commissions of the 19th century.  The walls of the house are pushed close to the lot lines, allowing for a spacious private [[courtyard]] within.  The courtyard allowed abundant natural light to enter the main rooms of the house through south-facing windows, and also provided a level of privacy rarely achieved in urban residences.  Additionally, a long [[Servants' hall|servant hall]] is placed along the north side of the house, buffering the family spaces from the noise and dirt of 18th Street as well as the brutal winter winds.  \nThe exterior of the house is clad in [[Braggville, Massachusetts|Braggville]] [[granite]], laid in courses of various heights, giving the house a strong horizontal appearance.  Ornamentation is minimal, and includes an [[arch]] of stylized foliage over the front entrance and a series of carved capitals on the second floor [[column]]s.  \nThe design was distinctly different from the other houses on Prairie Avenue, and many neighbors did not understand it.  Sleeping-car CEO [[George Pullman]], who lived across the street in a traditional [[Second Empire architecture in the United States and Canada|Second Empire]] mansion, said, \"I do not know what I have ever done to have that thing staring me in the face every time I go out of my door.\"\n\n==Later history==\n[[File:Glessner House.jpg|thumb|245px|Glessner House, 18th Street facade, from [[Historic American Buildings Survey|HABS]].

In 1937, the family deeded the house to the Armour Institute (precursor to the present day [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]).{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1938 }}  In 1945 the Institute leased the house to the [[Graphic Arts Technical Foundation|Lithographic Technical Foundation]], which installed large printing presses in many of the rooms and conducted research for the printing industry.

Prior to IP-based connection to the greater Internet, there existed an IP-based network, linking academic institutions within Australia, known as [[ACSNet]], using the .oz domain and connected to international networks using other technologies. When Australia was fully integrated into the Internet, this domain was moved under .au to become .oz.au and still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/OzI04.html#7584 |title=Roger Clarke's 'The Internet in Australia' \u2013 4.2 1975\u20131984 |publisher=Rogerclarke.com |accessdate=13 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent circuit connecting [[AARNet]] to [[ARPANet]] using TCP/IP over X.25 was established in May 1989. It linked the [[University of Melbourne]] with the [[University of Hawaii]] via a 2400-bit/s (bits per second) satellite connection. It was later upgraded to 56 kbit/s (kilobits per second), and then 256 kbit/s, at a time during which the US end-point was moved to San Jose at a [[NASA]] facility.<ref name=\"rogerclarke.com\"/><ref name=\"AARNET - History\"/><ref name=\"Hobbes' Internet Timeline\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.internethalloffame.org/blog/2012/07/09/father-australian-internet-warns-address-crunch-0|title=Father of Australian Internet Warns of Address Crunch {{!}} Internet Hall of Fame|website=www.internethalloffame.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 there were two commercial ISPs competing with one another. DIALix provided services to Perth, and the other was [[Pegasus Networks]] in [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In late 1994 the Telstra team led by Max Bosotti commenced negotiations to acquire all the assets of AARNet and establish a fully fledged commercial operation. Under AARNet the internet link to the node in Los Angeles consisted of a 1.5Mbps link, accommodating all the dial-up services for Australia. After extensive negotiations with the AVCC [ Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee] Telstra Internet commenced operation out of Canberra on 1 July 1995. Prior to this operation the tariffs charged by the then small internet providers was based on time used on the service. Telstra Internet developed a world first tariff in charging by megabits downloaded, soon acclaimed by the rest of the world which followed suit. Some three months after Telstra Internet became operational a new link to the USA was purchased bringing the capacity to 45 Mbps and followed three months later by an additional 45Mbps link such was the growth of the internet in 1995/96.\n\nA further early provider was the not-for-profit Australian Public Access Network Association (APANA). Founded in 1992 by Mark Gregson, APANA ran many small, widely dispersed gratis hosts for bulletin board systems and newsgroups, but developed into a provider of low-cost, non-commercial access to the Internet for its members.<ref name=\"rogerclarke.com\"/>\n\n===First broadband===\nIn the late 1990s, [[Telstra]] and [[Optus]] rolled-out separate [[cable Internet]] services, focusing on the east coast. The first broadband service over HFC was around 1995 using the Motorola proprietary protocols. In around 2000 [[DOCSIS]] was rolled out then in around 2008 the HFC was upgraded to support 30mb/s. In 2000, the first consumer [[ADSL]] services were made available via [[Telstra Bigpond]], at speeds of 256/64 kbit/s (downstream/upstream), 512/128 kbit/s, and 1500/256 kbit/s. Telstra chose to artificially limit all ADSL speeds to a maximum of 1500/256 kbit/s. As ADSL required access to the telephone exchange and the copper line \u2014 which only Telstra had \u2014 this allowed Telstra to be dominant due to the expense of roll-out for other companies and Telstra's established customer base. Other ISPs followed suit soon after; offering a [[Telstra Wholesale]]\u2013based service.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Competition, faster broadband===\nGradually, larger ISPs began taking over more of the delivery infrastructure themselves by taking advantage of regulated access to the [[Local loop unbundling|unconditioned local loop]]. As well as significantly reducing costs, it gave the service providers complete control of their own service networks, other than the [[local loop|copper pair]] (phone line from the exchange to the customer).<ref>[http://archive.iinet.net.au/about/mediareleases/00mediarelease6.html \"iinet archives\"] Retrieved on 25 September 2008.</ref> The first competition to Telstra's [[DSLAM]]s was provided by then [[Optus]] subsidiary XYZed, launching business-grade [[Digital subscriber line|xDSL]] services from 50 exchanges in September 2000.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160120155819/http://www.xyzed.com.au/admin/uploads/pdf/00.09.04.pdf] Press Release \u2014 First competitive DSL network opens for business</ref> Competition in the residential infrastructure market began in 2003, when [[Adelaide]]-based ISP [[Internode Systems|Internode]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internode.on.net/about/news/20060920-coorongsolar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106010305/http://www.internode.on.net/about/news/20060920-coorongsolar.htm |archivedate=6 January 2007 |df=dmy }} Details on Internode Coorong Network</ref> installed a [[DSLAM]] in the town of [[Meningie, South Australia]]. Several other service providers have since begun deploying their own DSLAMs. The presence of non-Telstra DSLAMs allowed the service providers to control the speed of connection, and most offered \"uncapped\" speeds, allowing the customers to connect at whatever speed their copper pair would allow, up to 8 Mbit/s. Ratification of [[ADSL2|ADSL2 and ADSL2+]] increased the maximum to 12 Mbit/s, then 24 Mbit/s. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn 2005, Telstra announced it would invest A$210 million in upgrading all of its ADSL exchanges to support ADSL2+ by mid-2006, though they did not say whether they would continue to restrict access speeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whirlpool.net.au/article.cfm/1456|title=Telstra confirms ADSL2+ network upgrade|publisher=[[Whirlpool (web site)|Whirlpool News]]|date=10 March 2005}}</ref> However, in 2006, they announced new intentions to substantially alter their copper phone network and set up a [[FTTN|Fibre to the Node (FTTN)]]<nowiki/>network. This was later scrapped, with Telstra citing regulations forcing it to provide cheap wholesale access to its competitors as the reason not to invest in upgrading their network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1708697.htm|title=Telstra scraps broadband network plan|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=7 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2006, Telstra uncapped its retail and wholesale ADSL offerings to the maximum attainable speed of [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|ADSL]] to 8 Mbit/s, however with a limited 384 kbit/s upstream speed. This has allowed many Australians access to higher speed broadband, while the comparatively lower wholesale rates discouraged competitive infrastructure investment in most cases.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nWireless broadband in Australia is widespread, with many point-to-point fixed wireless broadband providers serving broadband-poor regional and rural areas, predominantly with [[Canopy (wireless)|Motorola Canopy]] and [[WiMAX]] technologies.

Under AARNet the internet link to the node in Los Angeles consisted of a 1.5Mbps link, accommodating all the dial-up services for Australia. After extensive negotiations with the AVCC [ Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee] Telstra Internet commenced operation out of Canberra on 1 July 1995. Prior to this operation the tariffs charged by the then small internet providers was based on time used on the service. Telstra Internet developed a world first tariff in charging by megabits downloaded, soon acclaimed by the rest of the world which followed suit. Some three months after Telstra Internet became operational a new link to the USA was purchased bringing the capacity to 45 Mbps and followed three months later by an additional 45Mbps link such was the growth of the internet in 1995/96.\n\nA further early provider was the not-for-profit Australian Public Access Network Association (APANA).

Telstra chose to artificially limit all ADSL speeds to a maximum of 1500/256 kbit/s. As ADSL required access to the telephone exchange and the copper line \u2014 which only Telstra had \u2014 this allowed Telstra to be dominant due to the expense of roll-out for other companies and Telstra's established customer base. Other ISPs followed suit soon after; offering a [[Telstra Wholesale]]\u2013based service.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Competition, faster broadband===\nGradually, larger ISPs began taking over more of the delivery infrastructure themselves by taking advantage of regulated access to the [[Local loop unbundling|unconditioned local loop]].
