On the surface of the [[Earth]], wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In [[outer space]], [[solar wind]] is the movement of gases or charged particles from the [[Sun]] through space, while [[planetary wind]] is the [[outgassing]] of light [[chemical element]]s from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their [[scale (spatial)|spatial scale]], their [[speed]], the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the [[Solar System]] occur on [[Neptune]] and [[Saturn]]. Winds have various aspects: [[velocity]] ([[wind speed]]); the density of the gas involved; energy content or [[wind energy]]. Wind is also an important means of transportation for seeds and small birds; with time things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.\n\nIn [[meteorology]], winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high-speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed [[squall]]s. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, [[gale]], [[Storm#Classification|storm]], and [[hurricane]]. Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] between the [[climate zone]]s on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale [[atmospheric circulation]] are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet ([[Coriolis effect]]). Within the tropics, [[thermal low]] circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive [[monsoon]] circulations. In coastal areas the [[sea breeze]]/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.\n\nIn human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in [[mythology]], influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a [[wind power|power source]] for mechanical work, electricity, and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of [[sailing ship]]s across Earth's oceans. [[Hot air balloon]]s use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of [[wind shear]] caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.\n\nWinds can shape landforms, via a variety of [[aeolian processes]] such as the formation of fertile soils, such as [[loess]], and by [[erosion]]. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the [[prevailing winds]]; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.\n\n== Causes ==\n{{See also|Atmospheric pressure}}\n[[File:10 PM March 12 surface analysis of Great Blizzard of 1888.png|thumb|right|[[surface weather analysis|Surface analysis]] of the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]. Areas with greater isobaric packing indicate higher winds.]]\n\nWind is caused by differences in the [[atmospheric pressure]]. When a [[pressure gradient force|difference in atmospheric pressure]] exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the [[Coriolis effect]], except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the [[atmospheric circulation]]) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] leading to [[buoyancy force]]s) and the [[Coriolis effect|rotation of the planet]]. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach [[geostrophic balance]]. Near the Earth's surface, [[friction]] causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.<ref>{{cite web|author = JetStream|title = Origin of Wind|publisher = [[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters|year= 2008|accessdate=2009-02-16 |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//synoptic/wind.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Makarieva|first=Anastassia|author2=V.

The kinetic energy of a packet of air of mass ''m'' with velocity ''v'' is given by ''\u00bd m v<sup>2</sup>''. To find the mass of the packet passing through an area ''A'' perpendicular its velocity (which could be the rotor area of a turbine), we multiply its volume after time ''t'' has passed with the [[air density]] ''\u03c1'', which gives us ''m'' = ''A'' ''v'' ''t'' ''\u03c1''. So, we find that the total wind energy is:\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^3 t</math>\n\n[[Derivative|Differentiating]] with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy, we find that the total wind [[Power (physics)|power]] is:\n\n:<math>P = dE/dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^3</math>\n\nWind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity.\n\n=== Theoretical power captured by a wind turbine ===\nTotal wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine, this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of [[stream tube]], the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is {{sfrac|16|27}} \u2248 59% of the total theoretical wind power<ref>[http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/digitalcommons/assets/pacp_7.pdf The Physics of Wind Turbines].

Retrieved 2011-11-03.</ref> (see: [[Betz' law]]).\n\n=== Practical wind turbine power ===\nFurther insufficiencies, such as rotor blade [[friction]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]], gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine.

The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2&nbsp;millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher [[sea level pressure]], flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of {{convert|sp=us|8|kn|km/h}} exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.\n\nAt night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their [[specific heat]] values.

In gliding, wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a [[Glider aircraft|glider]]. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on [[ground launch]]es, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient.<ref>{{cite book|title=Glider Flying Handbook|year=2003|publisher=U.S. Federal Aviation Administration|location=U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.|id=FAA-8083-13_GFH|pages=7\u201316|url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218083721/http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-12-18|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong.

Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants.\n\n=== Erosion ===\n[[File:Im Salar de Uyuni.jpg|thumb|right|A rock formation in the [[Altiplano]], [[Bolivia]], sculpted by wind erosion]]\nErosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand [[dunes]], on a beach or in a desert.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2004|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/dunes/index.html|title=Dunes&nbsp;\u2013 Getting Started|accessdate=2009-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726013120/http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/dunes/index.html|archive-date=2009-07-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, [[friable]], slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, [[silt]]y, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) [[sediment]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=F. von Richthofen|year=1882|title=On the mode of origin of the loess|journal=Geological Magazine (Decade II)|doi=10.1017/S001675680017164X |volume= 9|issue=7|pages=293\u2013305|bibcode=1882GeoM....9..293R|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1880729/files/article.pdf}}</ref> It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.

An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for [[germination]]. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=M.

On the surface of the [[Earth]], wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In [[outer space]], [[solar wind]] is the movement of gases or charged particles from the [[Sun]] through space, while [[planetary wind]] is the [[outgassing]] of light [[chemical element]]s from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their [[scale (spatial)|spatial scale]], their [[speed]], the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the [[Solar System]] occur on [[Neptune]] and [[Saturn]]. Winds have various aspects: [[velocity]] ([[wind speed]]); the density of the gas involved; energy content or [[wind energy]]. Wind is also an important means of transportation for seeds and small birds; with time things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.\n\nIn [[meteorology]], winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high-speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed [[squall]]s. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, [[gale]], [[Storm#Classification|storm]], and [[hurricane]]. Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] between the [[climate zone]]s on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale [[atmospheric circulation]] are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet ([[Coriolis effect]]). Within the tropics, [[thermal low]] circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive [[monsoon]] circulations. In coastal areas the [[sea breeze]]/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.\n\nIn human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in [[mythology]], influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a [[wind power|power source]] for mechanical work, electricity, and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of [[sailing ship]]s across Earth's oceans. [[Hot air balloon]]s use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of [[wind shear]] caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.\n\nWinds can shape landforms, via a variety of [[aeolian processes]] such as the formation of fertile soils, such as [[loess]], and by [[erosion]]. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the [[prevailing winds]]; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.\n\n== Causes ==\n{{See also|Atmospheric pressure}}\n[[File:10 PM March 12 surface analysis of Great Blizzard of 1888.png|thumb|right|[[surface weather analysis|Surface analysis]] of the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]. Areas with greater isobaric packing indicate higher winds.]]\n\nWind is caused by differences in the [[atmospheric pressure]]. When a [[pressure gradient force|difference in atmospheric pressure]] exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the [[Coriolis effect]], except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the [[atmospheric circulation]]) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] leading to [[buoyancy force]]s) and the [[Coriolis effect|rotation of the planet]]. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach [[geostrophic balance]]. Near the Earth's surface, [[friction]] causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.<ref>{{cite web|author = JetStream|title = Origin of Wind|publisher = [[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters|year= 2008|accessdate=2009-02-16 |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//synoptic/wind.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Makarieva|first=Anastassia|author2=V.

The kinetic energy of a packet of air of mass ''m'' with velocity ''v'' is given by ''\u00bd m v<sup>2</sup>''. To find the mass of the packet passing through an area ''A'' perpendicular its velocity (which could be the rotor area of a turbine), we multiply its volume after time ''t'' has passed with the [[air density]] ''\u03c1'', which gives us ''m'' = ''A'' ''v'' ''t'' ''\u03c1''. So, we find that the total wind energy is:\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^3 t</math>\n\n[[Derivative|Differentiating]] with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy, we find that the total wind [[Power (physics)|power]] is:\n\n:<math>P = dE/dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^3</math>\n\nWind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity.\n\n=== Theoretical power captured by a wind turbine ===\nTotal wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine, this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of [[stream tube]], the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is {{sfrac|16|27}} \u2248 59% of the total theoretical wind power<ref>[http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/digitalcommons/assets/pacp_7.pdf The Physics of Wind Turbines].

Retrieved 2011-11-03.</ref> (see: [[Betz' law]]).\n\n=== Practical wind turbine power ===\nFurther insufficiencies, such as rotor blade [[friction]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]], gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine.

The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater [[specific heat]] compared to land.<ref>{{cite web|author= Steve Ackerman|year=1995|url=http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/seabrz.html|title=Sea and Land Breezes|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref> As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2&nbsp;millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher [[sea level pressure]], flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of {{convert|sp=us|8|kn|km/h}} exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.\n\nAt night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their [[specific heat]] values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.<ref name=\"Jet\">{{cite web|author=JetStream: An Online School For Weather |year=2008 |url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/ocean/seabreezes.htm |title=The Sea Breeze |publisher=National Weather Service |accessdate=2006-10-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923233344/http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/ocean/seabreezes.htm |archivedate=2006-09-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Near mountains ===\n[[File:Vol d'onde.svg|right|thumb|Mountain wave schematic.

In areas where there is rugged [[topography]] that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys is the most important contributor to the prevailing winds.

In gliding, wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a [[Glider aircraft|glider]]. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on [[ground launch]]es, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient.<ref>{{cite book|title=Glider Flying Handbook|year=2003|publisher=U.S. Federal Aviation Administration|location=U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.|id=FAA-8083-13_GFH|pages=7\u201316|url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218083721/http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-12-18|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong.

Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants.\n\n=== Erosion ===\n[[File:Im Salar de Uyuni.jpg|thumb|right|A rock formation in the [[Altiplano]], [[Bolivia]], sculpted by wind erosion]]\nErosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.

An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for [[germination]]. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=M.

Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include [[tumbleweed]]s. A related process to anemochory is [[anemophily]], which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind.

The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause a low level of [[environmental noise]]. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/how-does-wind-produce-sounds.118880/|title=How does wind produce sounds?|author=|date=|website=physicsforums.com}}</ref> Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions.

The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper [[New York State]], for rebroadcast on W2XB in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] (now [[WRGB]]), making this among the first \"network\" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.\n\nAbout this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, ([[WNBC]]), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia and [[WRGB]] in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' was renamed ''[[Camel Newsreel Theatre]]'' and then, when [[John Cameron Swayze]] was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed ''[[Camel News Caravan]]''.\n\nIn 1948, NBC teamed up with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine to provide election night coverage of President [[Harry S.

The loss of Huntley, along with a reluctance by RCA to fund NBC News at a similar level as CBS was funding its news division, left NBC News in the doldrums.

However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.\n\nMSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.\n\nThe [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 07:00 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:00 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012.

The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper [[New York State]], for rebroadcast on W2XB in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] (now [[WRGB]]), making this among the first \"network\" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.\n\nAbout this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, ([[WNBC]]), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia and [[WRGB]] in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' was renamed ''[[Camel Newsreel Theatre]]'' and then, when [[John Cameron Swayze]] was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed ''[[Camel News Caravan]]''.\n\nIn 1948, NBC teamed up with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine to provide election night coverage of President [[Harry S.

However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.\n\nMSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.\n\nThe [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 07:00 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:00 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012. NBC News share facilities and crew in the UK with [[ITN]], who is the news provider for ITV.\n\n==Theme music==\nMost of NBC's news television programs use \"[[The Mission (theme song)|The Mission]]\" by [[John Williams]] as their theme. The composition was first used by NBC in 1985 and was updated in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|author=Submitted by NBC Universal|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|title=SoundtrackNet: News: Legendary Composer John Williams Composes New \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" Theme|publisher=[[Soundtrack.net]]|date=August 30, 2006|accessdate=November 27, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021032305/http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|archivedate=October 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\nOfficial website\n{{White House James S.

A girl named Ritsa lived there with three brothers [[Agepsta]], [[Atsetuka]] and [[Pshegishkha]]. Ritsa used to pasture her animals in the valley and her brothers hunted in the high mountains by day and returned to the valley in the evening, where they ate, sang songs, and admired their sister.\n\nOnce the brothers went too far into the mountains. Ritsa missed them and sang. The forest robbers [[Gega]] and [[Iupshara]] heard her and decided to kidnap her. Iupshara caught her and rode down the valley, while Gega covered his flank.  Ritsa's brothers heard her crying and came to the rescue.\n\nPshegishkha threw a sword at the robbers, but he missed and the sword flew over the river. The valley was filled with water and turned into a lake. Ritsa broke from Iupshara's grip, but fell into the lake. The brothers couldn't save her. Then Pshegishkha threw the robber Iupshara into the lake, but Ritsa's water wouldn't accept him and threw out him over Pshegishkha's sword and the water carried him away to the sea.

He is the older of Randy and Renee Shaffer's two sons. He graduated from the local high school in 1997 and went to OSU for his undergraduate work. Six years later he graduated with a degree in [[microbiology]].<ref name=\"Charley Project Page\" />\n[[File:Brian Shaffer with his mother Renee.jpg|thumb|left|Brian and his mother|alt=The same man seen in the infobox, here shown smiling with his teeth showing wearing a white doctor's coat over a shirt and tie, standing on the left of a smiling older woman with red hair and rosy cheeks wearing a black print dress with a pale yellow jacket. Behind them is a tage with a portion of a large seal visible]]\nFollowing that, he began studies at [[Ohio State University College of Medicine]] in 2004. During his second year there, in March 2006, his mother Renee died of [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]].<ref name=\"Mel story\">{{cite news|last=Pepi|first=Kirk|title=A Guy Walks into a Bar \u2014 And is Never Seen Again|url=https://melmagazine.com/a-guy-walks-into-a-bar-53c784e7369b#.flo6z2xcq|newspaper=Mel|date=November 13, 2016|accessdate=January 5, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212184125/https://melmagazine.com/a-guy-walks-into-a-bar-53c784e7369b#.flo6z2xcq|archivedate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> His friends say that although he appeared to be handling it well, her death was hard for him.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nRenee was not the only woman important in Brian's life. He had become romantically involved with a fellow second-year medical student, Alexis Waggoner. She, along with their families and friends, believed that Brian would probably be [[Marriage proposal|proposing marriage]] to her later that year, most likely on a trip to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] the couple had planned for spring break at the beginning of April.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nTropical locations such as Miami were attractive to Brian; he liked the relaxed lifestyles. He told his friends that despite his decision to pursue a medical career, his real ambition was to start a band playing music in the vein of [[Jimmy Buffett]].<ref name=\"Mel story\" />\n\n==Disappearance==\nOn March 31, a Friday, classes at OSU ended for [[spring break]] the next week. Brian and Randy Shaffer, his father, celebrated the occasion by going out for a steak dinner together earlier that evening. Randy noted that his son seemed exhausted from having pulled [[Sleep deprivation#School|all-nighters]] earlier in the week [[Cramming (education)|cramming]] for some important upcoming exams. He did not think Brian should go out with a friend, William \"Clint\" Florence, later that night as he planned to do, but did not express his reservations to his son.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nAt 9 p.m., Brian met Florence at the Ugly Tuna Saloona, a bar in the South Campus Gateway complex on High Street. An hour later, Brian called Waggoner. She had returned to her home in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] to visit with her family before she and Brian were due to depart for Miami. He and Florence went [[pub crawl|bar-hopping]], visiting several other drinking establishments and working their way down to the [[Arena District]]. At each stop the two had one shot each of hard liquor, according to Florence.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n[[File:The South Campus Gateway.JPG|right|thumb|South Campus Gateway in 2015. The Ugly Tuna was located in the upper story of the building on the right.|alt=A view across a signalized intersection, with a green sign opposite reading \"High Street\", to some buildings with an irregular, stylized entrance on one side of a pedestrian mall, lit by low raking sunlight. In the rear is a sign with \"Gateway\" on it in vertical red letters.]] \nAfter midnight, the two met Meredith Reed, a friend of Florence, in [[The Short North]]. She gave them a ride back to the Ugly Tuna Saloona, where they had started the night, and joined them there for a last round.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" /> While the three were there, Brian separated from his companions. Florence and Reed had been trying to find him, repeatedly calling him. They left with other patrons when the bar closed at 2 a.m., waiting outside for Brian. When he was not among the departing crowd, they assumed he had gone back to his apartment without letting them know.<ref name=\"Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nWaggoner and Randy Shaffer both tried to call Brian later that weekend but he did not answer. On Monday morning, he missed the flight to Miami he and Waggoner had scheduled long before. He was then reported [[missing person|missing]] to the Columbus police.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nPolice began their search for Brian at the Ugly Tuna, the bar where he had last been seen. Since the area around South Campus Gateway was somewhat [[urban decay|blighted]] with a high crime rate, the bar had installed [[security camera]]s. They reviewed the footage, which showed Brian, Florence and Reed going up an escalator to the bar's main entrance at 1:15&nbsp;a.m. Brian was seen outside of the bar around 1:55&nbsp;a.m., talking briefly with two young women and saying goodbye, then moving off-camera in the direction of the bar, apparently to re-enter. The camera did not record him leaving shortly afterwards when the Ugly Tuna closed; that was the last time he was seen.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nIt was possible, investigators realized, that he could have changed his clothes in the bar or put on a hat and kept his head down, hiding his face from the camera. The cameras might also have missed him\u2014one [[Panning (camera)|panned]] across the area constantly, and the other was operated manually. He might have also left the building by another route. However, the building's only other exit, a service door not generally used by the public, opened at the time onto a construction site that officers believed would have been difficult to walk through while sober, much less intoxicated, as Brian likely was at the time.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nSince Columbus has the most security cameras of any city in Ohio, more than [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Cincinnati]] and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] combined, officers next looked to the footage from other bars to see if cameras there could explain how Brian had left the Ugly Tuna. However, footage from cameras at three other nearby bars showed no trace of Brian.<ref name=\"Mel story\" />\n\nThe search began to fan out from the Ugly Tuna, with officers, sometimes accompanied by [[police dog]]s, looking closely in the street, inspecting [[dumpster]]s and other [[waste container]]s and asking residents if they had seen him. Flyers of Brian's picture, showing a [[tattoo]] on his upper right arm of a [[stick figure]] logo from the cover artwork for the single of \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\"<ref name=\"Mel story\" /> by [[Pearl Jam]], one of his favorite bands, and noting a distinctive fleck in one of his irises, were posted widely. The police even persuaded the city to let them into the sewer system and search there.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" /> No useful information was uncovered. At Brian's apartment on King Avenue six [[city block|blocks]] from the Ugly Tuna, his car was still parked outside. Inside, nothing appeared amiss.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nAfter searching miles away from the bar in every direction, police began to consider other possibilities besides an accident or foul play. Since his mother had recently died, it was speculated he had gone away temporarily to grieve in solitude. Yet, his disappearance proved permanent. No evident reasons appeared for him voluntarily disappearing.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nThose who had seen Brian that evening, including his father, were asked to take [[lie detector]] tests. Reed and Randy Shaffer passed theirs, as did reportedly all the others, while Florence refused. The two women Brian had last been seen talking to were later identified; they said in 2009 that they had never been asked to take one themselves.<ref name=\"2009 Lantern story\" />\n\nWaggoner called Brian's phone every evening before going to bed for a long time after the disappearance. Usually it went to [[voicemail]], but one night in September it actually rang three times. \"I kept calling it to hear it purely because it was one of the best sounds I have ever heard, even if no one picked up\", she wrote on her [[MySpace]] page. [[Cingular]], Brian's wireless provider, said what Waggoner heard may have been due to a computer glitch. A [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] from the phone was detected at a [[cell tower]] in [[Hilliard, Ohio|Hilliard]], {{convert|14|mi}} northwest of Columbus.<ref name=\"Mel story\" />\n\nThe police received many tips, none of which resulted in any breakthroughs in the case. At a Pearl Jam concert later that year in [[Cincinnati]], lead singer [[Eddie Vedder]] took time between songs to ask for tips in Brian's disappearance, but none of those were useful either. Possible sightings in [[Michigan]], [[Texas]] and even [[Sweden]] were investigated.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nRandy Shaffer, who had recently suffered the death of his wife, continued the search for his son on his own. A [[psychic]] he consulted told him Brian's body was in water near a bridge pier. He and Derek, Brian's brother, along with some other citizens who had become interested in the case, bought [[Waders (footwear)|waders]] and spent much of their free time along the shores of the [[Olentangy River]], which flows through Columbus adjacent to the OSU campus, searching in vain for the body near bridges.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nThis possibility also led police to briefly consider the heavily disputed [[Smiley face murder theory]]. Brian Shaffer, under this theory, would be the killer's only victim whose body had not yet been found. Columbus police eventually rejected any connection to the alleged killer in Brian's case, following the lead of most [[law enforcement]] agencies, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], that have looked into it.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\n=== Death of Randy Shaffer ===\n[[File:Brian Shaffer with his father Randy.jpg|thumb|right|Brian and Randy Shaffer|alt=The same young man seen with his mother in the photo above, in the same setting, with an older bespectacled man on his right this time]]\n\nIn September 2008, during a heavy windstorm in Central Ohio, Randy Shaffer was out in the yard of his [[Baltimore, Ohio|Baltimore]] home clearing debris. A branch blew off from a nearby tree and fatally struck him. Neighbors found his body the next morning and called police.<ref name=\"Randy Shaffer's death\">{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=Mary Beth|last2=Ludlow|first2=Randy|title=Missing OSU student's dad among six killed in storm, aftermath|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2008/09/15/wbnsshafferredirect.html|newspaper=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=March 17, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324055348/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2008/09/15/wbnsshafferredirect.html|archivedate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter his [[obituary]] ran online, a [[condolence]] book was posted. One of the signatures in it said \"To Dad, love Brian ([[U.S. Virgin Islands]])\". This suggested Brian might have left Columbus for a new life elsewhere.<ref name=\"2008 Lantern story\" /> However, upon further investigation, the note was found to have been posted from a computer accessible to the public in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]]; it was determined to be a hoax.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\n==Subsequent developments==\nShortly after Randy Shaffer's death, Neil Rosenberg, attorney for Clint Florence, wrote to Don Corbett, a [[private investigator]] who has volunteered his time to help the Shaffer family find Brian, regarding his client's ongoing refusal to take a [[lie detector]] test.

He is the older of Randy and Renee Shaffer's two sons. He graduated from the local high school in 1997 and went to OSU for his undergraduate work. Six years later he graduated with a degree in [[microbiology]].<ref name=\"Charley Project Page\" />\n[[File:Brian Shaffer with his mother Renee.jpg|thumb|left|Brian and his mother|alt=The same man seen in the infobox, here shown smiling with his teeth showing wearing a white doctor's coat over a shirt and tie, standing on the left of a smiling older woman with red hair and rosy cheeks wearing a black print dress with a pale yellow jacket. Behind them is a tage with a portion of a large seal visible]]\nFollowing that, he began studies at [[Ohio State University College of Medicine]] in 2004. During his second year there, in March 2006, his mother Renee died of [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]].<ref name=\"Mel story\">{{cite news|last=Pepi|first=Kirk|title=A Guy Walks into a Bar \u2014 And is Never Seen Again|url=https://melmagazine.com/a-guy-walks-into-a-bar-53c784e7369b#.flo6z2xcq|newspaper=Mel|date=November 13, 2016|accessdate=January 5, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212184125/https://melmagazine.com/a-guy-walks-into-a-bar-53c784e7369b#.flo6z2xcq|archivedate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> His friends say that although he appeared to be handling it well, her death was hard for him.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nRenee was not the only woman important in Brian's life. He had become romantically involved with a fellow second-year medical student, Alexis Waggoner. She, along with their families and friends, believed that Brian would probably be [[Marriage proposal|proposing marriage]] to her later that year, most likely on a trip to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] the couple had planned for spring break at the beginning of April.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nTropical locations such as Miami were attractive to Brian; he liked the relaxed lifestyles. He told his friends that despite his decision to pursue a medical career, his real ambition was to start a band playing music in the vein of [[Jimmy Buffett]].<ref name=\"Mel story\" />\n\n==Disappearance==\nOn March 31, a Friday, classes at OSU ended for [[spring break]] the next week. Brian and Randy Shaffer, his father, celebrated the occasion by going out for a steak dinner together earlier that evening. Randy noted that his son seemed exhausted from having pulled [[Sleep deprivation#School|all-nighters]] earlier in the week [[Cramming (education)|cramming]] for some important upcoming exams. He did not think Brian should go out with a friend, William \"Clint\" Florence, later that night as he planned to do, but did not express his reservations to his son.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nAt 9 p.m., Brian met Florence at the Ugly Tuna Saloona, a bar in the South Campus Gateway complex on High Street. An hour later, Brian called Waggoner. She had returned to her home in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] to visit with her family before she and Brian were due to depart for Miami. He and Florence went [[pub crawl|bar-hopping]], visiting several other drinking establishments and working their way down to the [[Arena District]]. At each stop the two had one shot each of hard liquor, according to Florence.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n[[File:The South Campus Gateway.JPG|right|thumb|South Campus Gateway in 2015. The Ugly Tuna was located in the upper story of the building on the right.|alt=A view across a signalized intersection, with a green sign opposite reading \"High Street\", to some buildings with an irregular, stylized entrance on one side of a pedestrian mall, lit by low raking sunlight. In the rear is a sign with \"Gateway\" on it in vertical red letters.]] \nAfter midnight, the two met Meredith Reed, a friend of Florence, in [[The Short North]]. She gave them a ride back to the Ugly Tuna Saloona, where they had started the night, and joined them there for a last round.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" /> While the three were there, Brian separated from his companions. Florence and Reed had been trying to find him, repeatedly calling him. They left with other patrons when the bar closed at 2 a.m., waiting outside for Brian. When he was not among the departing crowd, they assumed he had gone back to his apartment without letting them know.<ref name=\"Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nWaggoner and Randy Shaffer both tried to call Brian later that weekend but he did not answer. On Monday morning he missed the flight to Miami he and Waggoner had scheduled long before. He was then reported [[missing person|missing]] to the Columbus police.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nPolice began their search for Brian at the Ugly Tuna, the bar where he had last been seen. Since the area around South Campus Gateway was somewhat [[urban decay|blighted]] with a high crime rate, the bar had installed [[security camera]]s. They reviewed the footage, which showed Brian, Florence and Reed going up an escalator to the bar's main entrance at 1:15&nbsp;a.m. Brian was seen outside of the bar around 1:55&nbsp;a.m., talking briefly with two young women and saying goodbye, then moving off-camera in the direction of the bar, apparently to re-enter. The camera did not record him leaving shortly afterwards when the Ugly Tuna closed; that was the last time he was seen.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nIt was possible, investigators realized, that he could have changed his clothes in the bar or put on a hat and kept his head down, hiding his face from the camera. The cameras might also have missed him\u2014one [[Panning (camera)|panned]] across the area constantly, and the other was operated manually. He might have also left the building by another route. However, the building's only other exit, a service door not generally used by the public, opened at the time onto a construction site that officers believed would have been difficult to walk through while sober, much less intoxicated, as Brian likely was at the time.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nSince Columbus has the most security cameras of any city in Ohio, more than [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Cincinnati]] and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] combined, officers next looked to the footage from other bars to see if cameras there could explain how Brian had left the Ugly Tuna. However, footage from cameras at three other nearby bars showed no trace of Brian.<ref name=\"Mel story\" />\n\nThe search began to fan out from the Ugly Tuna, with officers, sometimes accompanied by [[police dog]]s, looking closely in the street, inspecting [[dumpster]]s and other [[waste container]]s and asking residents if they had seen him. Flyers of Brian's picture, showing a [[tattoo]] on his upper right arm of a [[stick figure]] logo from the cover artwork for the single of \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\"<ref name=\"Mel story\" /> by [[Pearl Jam]], one of his favorite bands, and noting a distinctive fleck in one of his irises, were posted widely. The police even persuaded the city to let them into the sewer system and search there.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" /> No useful information was uncovered. At Brian's apartment on King Avenue six [[city block|blocks]] from the Ugly Tuna, his car was still parked outside. Inside, nothing appeared amiss.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nAfter searching miles away from the bar in every direction, police began to consider other possibilities besides an accident or foul play. Since his mother had recently died, it was speculated he had gone away temporarily to grieve in solitude. Yet, his disappearance proved permanent. No evident reasons appeared for him voluntarily disappearing.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nThose who had seen Brian that evening, including his father, were asked to take [[lie detector]] tests. Reed and Randy Shaffer passed theirs, as did reportedly all the others, while Florence refused. The two women Brian had last been seen talking to were later identified; they said in 2009 that they had never been asked to take one themselves.<ref name=\"2009 Lantern story\" />\n\nWaggoner called Brian's phone every evening before going to bed for a long time after the disappearance. Usually it went to [[voicemail]], but one night in September it actually rang three times. \"I kept calling it to hear it purely because it was one of the best sounds I have ever heard, even if no one picked up\", she wrote on her [[MySpace]] page. [[Cingular]], Brian's wireless provider, said what Waggoner heard may have been due to a computer glitch. A [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] from the phone was detected at a [[cell tower]] in [[Hilliard, Ohio|Hilliard]], {{convert|14|mi}} northwest of Columbus.<ref name=\"Mel story\" />\n\nThe police received many tips, none of which resulted in any breakthroughs in the case. At a Pearl Jam concert later that year in [[Cincinnati]], lead singer [[Eddie Vedder]] took time between songs to ask for tips in Brian's disappearance, but none of those were useful either. Possible sightings in [[Michigan]], [[Texas]] and even [[Sweden]] were investigated.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nRandy Shaffer, who had recently suffered the death of his wife, continued the search for his son on his own. A [[psychic]] he consulted told him Brian's body was in water near a bridge pier. He and Derek, Brian's brother, along with some other citizens who had become interested in the case, bought [[Waders (footwear)|waders]] and spent much of their free time along the shores of the [[Olentangy River]], which flows through Columbus adjacent to the OSU campus, searching in vain for the body near bridges.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\nThis possibility also led police to briefly consider the heavily disputed [[Smiley face murder theory]]. Brian Shaffer, under this theory, would be the killer's only victim whose body had not yet been found. Columbus police eventually rejected any connection to the alleged killer in Brian's case, following the lead of most [[law enforcement]] agencies, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], that have looked into it.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\n=== Death of Randy Shaffer ===\n[[File:Brian Shaffer with his father Randy.jpg|thumb|right|Brian and Randy Shaffer|alt=The same young man seen with his mother in the photo above, in the same setting, with an older bespectacled man on his right this time]]\n\nIn September 2008, during a heavy windstorm in Central Ohio, Randy Shaffer was out in the yard of his [[Baltimore, Ohio|Baltimore]] home clearing debris. A branch blew off from a nearby tree and fatally struck him. Neighbors found his body the next morning and called police.<ref name=\"Randy Shaffer's death\">{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=Mary Beth|last2=Ludlow|first2=Randy|title=Missing OSU student's dad among six killed in storm, aftermath|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2008/09/15/wbnsshafferredirect.html|newspaper=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=March 17, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324055348/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2008/09/15/wbnsshafferredirect.html|archivedate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter his [[obituary]] ran online, a [[condolence]] book was posted. One of the signatures in it said \"To Dad, love Brian ([[U.S. Virgin Islands]])\". This suggested Brian might have left Columbus for a new life elsewhere.<ref name=\"2008 Lantern story\" /> However, upon further investigation, the note was found to have been posted from a computer accessible to the public in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]]; it was determined to be a hoax.<ref name=\"2009 Columbus Monthly story\" />\n\n==Subsequent developments==\nShortly after Randy Shaffer's death, Neil Rosenberg, attorney for Clint Florence, wrote to Don Corbett, a [[private investigator]] who has volunteered his time to help the Shaffer family find Brian, regarding his client's ongoing refusal to take a [[lie detector]] test. Rosenberg intimated that he had learned that the Columbus police investigating the case believed Brian was alive.<ref name=\"2009 Lantern story\" />\n\nIn April 2009, ''[[The Lantern]]'', Ohio State's [[student newspaper]], disclosed the exchange. \"If Brian is alive, which is what I'm led to believe after speaking with the detective involved, then it is Brian, and not Clint [Florence] who is causing his family pain and hardship,\" Rosenberg wrote. \"Brian should come forward and end this.\" Florence, he said, did not have anything to hide; he had merely told everything he knew from the beginning and did not see the value of doing so again.<ref name=\"2009 Lantern story\" />\n\nRosenberg's assertions notwithstanding, many of those who were close to Brian have criticized Florence for not being forthcoming enough. \"As soon as the detective started getting involved, that's when he pretty much had no contact with anybody,\" recalled Derek Shaffer, Brian's brother and last surviving immediate family member. \"I've always thought he definitely knows something\u2013just won't come forward with it.\" He believes it is still possible that Brian is alive, and Florence knows where he might have gone. \"If Brian did take off somewhere, if that is the case, we just always had a strong feeling that Clint would possibly know that,\" he said.
