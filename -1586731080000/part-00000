As a young man he spent some time in [[London]] studying law at [[Gray's Inn]].  He  was [[knighted]] in 1605, the year of his marriage.\n\nIn 1608 he narrowly avoided being caught up  in the rebellion of Sir [[Cahir O'Doherty]], having stood [[surety]]  for the good behaviour of O'Doherty, who had married Thomas's  aunt Mary Preston.<ref>Ball, p.12</ref> A messenger arrived at Merrion Castle ordering FitzWilliam to produce the person of O'Doherty; fortunately FitzWilliam was not at home.  \n\nHe was [[knighted]]  the same year, and  served as [[Sheriff of County Dublin]]  in 1609. In  1610  he received a substantial grant of land in [[County Armagh]] from the English Crown.  No doubts   seem to have been entertained about his own loyalty to the Crown, except perhaps during the latter part of the  English  Civil War, In  1629 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] created him [[Viscount FitzWilliam]] in recognition of his family's long record of service to the Crown.<ref>Cokayne  ''Complete Peerage'' 6 volumes.

He spent some time in  England, where the King received him courteously.   He was promised an English [[Earldom]],  but the promise was not kept. He returned to Ireland, only to discover that he had been [[outlawed]]].

I do not conclude from this absence of evidence that the Phoenicians did not exist, nor that nobody ever called her- or himself a Phoenician under any circumstances: Phoenician-speakers undoubtedly had a larger repertoire of self-classifications than survives in our fragmentary evidence, and it would be surprising if, for instance, they never described themselves as Phoenicians to the Greeks who invented that term; indeed, I have drawn attention to several cases where something very close to that is going on... A distaste even for self-government could also explain a phenomenon I have drawn attention to throughout the book: our \u201cPhoenicians\u201d not only fail to visibly identify as Phoenician, they often omit to identify at all. It is striking in this light that the first surviving visible expression of an explicitly \u201cPhoenician\u201d identity was imposed by the Carthaginians on their subjects as they extended state power to a degree unprecedented among Phoenician-speakers, that it was then adopted by Tyre as a symbol of colonial success, and that it was subsequently exploited by Roman rulers in support of their imperial activities.}}</ref> In terms of culture, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians significantly apart from other residents of the Levant.<ref name=\"Quinn24204\">{{cite book|author=Josephine Quinn|authorlink=Josephine Crawley Quinn|title=In Search of the Phoenicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QAuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=11 December 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8911-2|page=24, 204|quote=My answer to the question Moscati posed in 1963 is that nothing did in fact unite the Phoenicians in their own eyes or those of their neighbors, and that his Phoenician people, or civilization, or nation, is not actually a real historical object, but rather a product of the scholarly and political ideologies I have discussed in this chapter. Such modern ideas about the ancient Phoenicians are thoroughly interwoven with ideas about the modern nation-state. That does not in itself, of course, mean that they cannot also be true. But the picture presented by our ancient sources is very different... In the end, it is modern nationalism that has created the Phoenicians, along with much else of our modern idea of the ancient Mediterranean.}}</ref>\n\nAround 1050 BC, a [[Phoenician alphabet]] was used for the writing of [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].<ref name=\"Markoe 2000 p. 111\">Markoe (2000) p. 111</ref> It became one of the most widely used [[writing system]]s, spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world, where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures.<ref name=\"Fischer 2004 90\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of writing|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2004|page=90}}</ref> The Phoenician alphabet gave rise to the [[Greek alphabet]], which in turn gave rise to the [[Latin alphabet]]. \n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Image from page 35 of \"Ancient seals of the Near East\" (1940).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Early Phoenician seal, dedicated to goddess [[Kubaba]] by Matrunna, daughter of [[Aplahanda]], 19th century BCE.]]\nThe name ''Phoenicians'', like [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Poen\u012b}}'' (adj.

In the resulting power vacuum, a number of Phoenician cities rose as significant maritime powers.\n\nPhoenician societies rested on three power-bases: the king; temples and their priests; and councils of elders. [[Byblos]] first became the predominant center from where the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Erythraean (Red) Sea routes.

The [[rise of Macedon]] gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Between 286 and 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of [[Astarte]] as vassal rulers in Sidon ([[Eshmunazar I]], [[Tabnit]], [[Eshmunazar II]]).\n\nIn 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the [[Seleucids]]. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126&nbsp;BC, followed by Sidon in 111. While Phoenician culture disappeared entirely in the motherland, Carthage continued to flourish in Northwest Africa. It oversaw the mining of iron and [[precious metal]]s from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests, until Rome finally destroyed it in 146&nbsp;BC at the end of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\nSyria, including Phoenicia, was seized and ruled by king [[Tigranes the Great]] of [[Armenia]] from 82 until 69&nbsp;BC, when he was defeated by [[Lucullus]].

At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, trading [[wood]], [[slave]]s, [[glass]] and powdered [[Tyrian purple]]. Tyrian purple was a violet-purple dye used by the Greek [[elite]] to color garments. As trading and colonizing spread over the Mediterranean, Phoenicians and Greeks seemed to have split that sea in two: the Phoenicians sailed along and eventually dominated the southern shore, while the Greeks were active along the northern shores. The two cultures rarely clashed, mainly in the [[Sicilian Wars]], and eventually settled into two spheres of influence, the Phoenician in the west and the Greek to the east.\n\nIn the centuries after 1200&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the [[hypobranchial gland]] of the ''[[Murex]]'' sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. [[James B. Pritchard]]'s excavations at [[Sarepta]] in present-day [[Lebanon]] revealed crushed ''Murex'' shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in [[Mogador]], in present-day [[Morocco]]. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician [[glass]] was another export ware.\n\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the 8th-century Phoenicians sold [[wine]]: the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea {{convert|50|km|-1}} west of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought [[Nubia]]n gold. Additionally, great cedar logs were traded with lumber-poor Egypt for significant sums. Sometime between 1075 and 1060 BC an Egyptian envoy by the name of Wen-Amon visited Phoenicia and secured seven great cedar logs in exchange for a mixed cargo including \"4 crocks and 1 kak-men of gold; 5 silver jugs; 10 garments of royal linen; 10 kherd of good linen from Upper Egypt; 500 rolls of finished papyrus; 500 cows' hides; 500 ropes; 20 bags of lentils and 30 baskets of fish.\" Those logs were then moved by ship from Phoenicia to Egypt.{{sfnp|Cunliffe|2008|pp=241\u20132}}\n\nFrom elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being [[silver]] from (at least) [[Sardinia]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Tin was required which, when smelted with copper from Cyprus, created the durable metal alloy bronze. The archaeologist Glenn Markoe suggests that tin \"may have been acquired from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe ([[Cornwall]] or [[Brittany]]) via the [[Rhone valley]] and coastal [[Marseille|Massalia]]\".{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=103}} [[Strabo]] states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the [[Cassiterides]] whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Christopher Hawkes, \"Britain and Julius Caesar,\" Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124\u2013192</ref> Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall. In fact, he says quite the opposite: the production of [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|Cornish tin]] was in the hands of the natives of Cornwall, and its transport to the Mediterranean was organised by local merchants, by sea and then over land through France, well outside Phoenician control.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Champion |first=Timothy |title=The appropriation of the Phoenicians in British imperial ideology |journal=Nations and Nationalism |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=451\u2013465 |doi=10.1111/1469-8219.00027 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\n[[Tarshish]] ({{lang-he|\u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1}}) occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, and one of the most recurring is that Tarshish is a place, probably a city or country, that is far from the [[Land of Israel]] by sea where trade occurs with Israel and Phoenicia.

Ancient Gaelic mythologies attribute a Phoenician/Scythian influx to Ireland by a leader called [[Fenius Farsa]]. Others also sailed south along the coast of Africa. A Carthaginian expedition led by [[Hanno the Navigator]] explored and colonized the Atlantic coast of Africa as far as the [[Gulf of Guinea]]; and according to Herodotus, a Phoenician expedition sent down the [[Red Sea]] by pharaoh [[Necho II]] of Egypt ({{circa|600&nbsp;BC}}) even [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] Africa and returned through the [[Pillars of Hercules]] after three years.\n\nIn the [[2nd millennium BC]], the Phoenicians traded with the [[Maritime history of Somalia|Somalis]].

These names are readily explained by depictions of Phoenician ships in the palaces of Assyrian kings from the 7th and 8th centuries, as the ships in these images are tub shaped (''{{lang|grc-Latn|galloi}}'') and have horse heads on the ends of them (''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}''). It is possible that these ''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}'' come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god [[Poseidon]] equated with the Semitic God \"[[Yam (god)|Yam]]\".\n\nIn 2014, a Phoenician trading ship, dating to 700 BC, was found near [[Gozo]] island.

The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|p=114}}: Himilco's acts of sacrilege and his subsequent military defeat in Sicily, later his penance and suicide at Carthage; thereafter, introduction to Carthage of Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore.</ref>\n\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city ([[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]]); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice. Yet eventually the cosmopolitan religious reform and the popular worship of Tanit together contributed to \"breaking through the wall of isolation which had surrounded Carthage.\"{{sfnp|Charles-Picard|Picard|1968|pp=146\u201354}}<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|pp=202\u20133}}, shows his criticism of the theory that Tanit was adopted in Carthage when it passed from monarchy to oligarchy.</ref><ref>Giovanni Garbini, \"Continuit\u00e0 ed innovazioni nella religione fenicia\" in ''Atti del colloquio in Roma: la religione fenicia'' (Roma 1981) pp 34\u20136.

In a shipwreck found off of the coast of Turkey (the Ulu Bulurun wreck), Canaanite storage pottery along with pottery from Cyprus and Greece was found.

New York: Bookman Associates</ref> Baal, on the other hand, is a representative for order. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power. In some versions of this myth, Baal kills Yamm with a mace fashioned for him, and in others, the goddess Athtart saves Yamm and says that since defeated, he should stay in his own province.

A distaste even for self-government could also explain a phenomenon I have drawn attention to throughout the book: our \u201cPhoenicians\u201d not only fail to visibly identify as Phoenician, they often omit to identify at all. It is striking in this light that the first surviving visible expression of an explicitly \u201cPhoenician\u201d identity was imposed by the Carthaginians on their subjects as they extended state power to a degree unprecedented among Phoenician-speakers, that it was then adopted by Tyre as a symbol of colonial success, and that it was subsequently exploited by Roman rulers in support of their imperial activities.}}</ref> In terms of culture, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians significantly apart from other residents of the Levant.<ref name=\"Quinn24204\">{{cite book|author=Josephine Quinn|authorlink=Josephine Crawley Quinn|title=In Search of the Phoenicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QAuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=11 December 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8911-2|page=24, 204|quote=My answer to the question Moscati posed in 1963 is that nothing did in fact unite the Phoenicians in their own eyes or those of their neighbors, and that his Phoenician people, or civilization, or nation, is not actually a real historical object, but rather a product of the scholarly and political ideologies I have discussed in this chapter. Such modern ideas about the ancient Phoenicians are thoroughly interwoven with ideas about the modern nation-state. That does not in itself, of course, mean that they cannot also be true.

Around 1200&nbsp;BC, a series of [[Late Bronze Age collapse|poorly-understood events]] weakened and destroyed the adjacent [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Collapse of the Hittite Empire|Hittite]] empires. In the resulting power vacuum, a number of Phoenician cities rose as significant maritime powers.\n\nPhoenician societies rested on three power-bases: the king; temples and their priests; and councils of elders. [[Byblos]] first became the predominant center from where the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Erythraean (Red) Sea routes. It was here that the first inscription in the Phoenician alphabet was found, on the sarcophagus of [[Ahiram]] (c. 1200&nbsp;BC).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLater, [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon|South Lebanon]] gained in power.

The [[rise of Macedon]] gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Between 286 and 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of [[Astarte]] as vassal rulers in Sidon ([[Eshmunazar I]], [[Tabnit]], [[Eshmunazar II]]).\n\nIn 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the [[Seleucids]]. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126&nbsp;BC, followed by Sidon in 111. While Phoenician culture disappeared entirely in the motherland, Carthage continued to flourish in Northwest Africa. It oversaw the mining of iron and [[precious metal]]s from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests, until Rome finally destroyed it in 146&nbsp;BC at the end of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\nSyria, including Phoenicia, was seized and ruled by king [[Tigranes the Great]] of [[Armenia]] from 82 until 69&nbsp;BC, when he was defeated by [[Lucullus]].

At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, trading [[wood]], [[slave]]s, [[glass]] and powdered [[Tyrian purple]]. Tyrian purple was a violet-purple dye used by the Greek [[elite]] to color garments. As trading and colonizing spread over the Mediterranean, Phoenicians and Greeks seemed to have split that sea in two: the Phoenicians sailed along and eventually dominated the southern shore, while the Greeks were active along the northern shores. The two cultures rarely clashed, mainly in the [[Sicilian Wars]], and eventually settled into two spheres of influence, the Phoenician in the west and the Greek to the east.\n\nIn the centuries after 1200&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the [[hypobranchial gland]] of the ''[[Murex]]'' sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. [[James B. Pritchard]]'s excavations at [[Sarepta]] in present-day [[Lebanon]] revealed crushed ''Murex'' shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in [[Mogador]], in present-day [[Morocco]]. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician [[glass]] was another export ware.\n\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the 8th-century Phoenicians sold [[wine]]: the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea {{convert|50|km|-1}} west of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought [[Nubia]]n gold. Additionally, great cedar logs were traded with lumber-poor Egypt for significant sums. Sometime between 1075 and 1060 BC an Egyptian envoy by the name of Wen-Amon visited Phoenicia and secured seven great cedar logs in exchange for a mixed cargo including \"4 crocks and 1 kak-men of gold; 5 silver jugs; 10 garments of royal linen; 10 kherd of good linen from Upper Egypt; 500 rolls of finished papyrus; 500 cows' hides; 500 ropes; 20 bags of lentils and 30 baskets of fish.\" Those logs were then moved by ship from Phoenicia to Egypt.{{sfnp|Cunliffe|2008|pp=241\u20132}}\n\nFrom elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being [[silver]] from (at least) [[Sardinia]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Tin was required which, when smelted with copper from Cyprus, created the durable metal alloy bronze. The archaeologist Glenn Markoe suggests that tin \"may have been acquired from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe ([[Cornwall]] or [[Brittany]]) via the [[Rhone valley]] and coastal [[Marseille|Massalia]]\".{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=103}} [[Strabo]] states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the [[Cassiterides]] whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Christopher Hawkes, \"Britain and Julius Caesar,\" Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124\u2013192</ref> Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall.

It is possible that these ''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}'' come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god [[Poseidon]] equated with the Semitic God \"[[Yam (god)|Yam]]\".\n\nIn 2014, a Phoenician trading ship, dating to 700 BC, was found near [[Gozo]] island.

She is the daughter of El, the god of heaven, and of his wife the Lady Asherah of the Sea. ... Her foremost lover was her brother [[Hadad|Baal]]. ... She was easily provoked to violence and, once she began to fight, would go berserk, smiting and killing left and right.\" (60\u20132), who adds that the Phoenician [[Philo of Byblos]] (64\u2013141) compared Anath to the Greek virgin war goddess [[Athena]]. Also, Patai at 63\u20136 identifies Anath with the biblical \"Queen of Heaven\". At 61 Patai, referring to Anath in her r\u00f4le as goddess of love, mentions the Babylonian goddess [[Ishtar]], and remarks that both Astarte and Anath as \"typical goddesses of love, both chaste and promiscuous... [were] perennially fruitful without ever losing their virginity.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"Asherah was the chief goddess of the Canaanite pantheon... at Ugarit... . ...Asherah figured prominently as the wife of El the chief god. Her full name was 'Lady Asherah of the Sea'--apparently her domain proper was the sea, just as that of her husband El was heaven. She was, however, also referred to simply as Elath or Goddess.

And whatever [our] explanation or interpretation does to it, we do to our souls as well, with corresponding results for our own well being. ... Hence the \"explanation\" should always be such that the functional significance of the archetype remains unimpaired, so that an adequate and meaningful connection between the conscious mind and the archetype is assured. ... It represents or personifies certain instinctive data of the dark, primitive psyche, the real but invisible roots of consciousness.\" ... \"The archetype... is a psychic organ present in all of us. ... There is no 'rational' substitute for the archetype any more than there is for the cerebellum or the kidneys.\"</blockquote></ref>\n\nA problematic theory derived from [[sociology of religion]] proposes that as Carthage passed from being a Phoenician trading station into a wealthy and sovereign city-state, and from a monarchy anchored to Tyre into a native-born ''Libyphoenician'' oligarchy, Carthaginians began to turn away from deities associated with Phoenicia, and slowly to discover or synthesize a Punic deity, the goddess Tanit.<ref>Compare {{harvp|Lancel|1995|pp=202\u20133}}.</ref> A parallel theory posits that when Carthage acquired as a source of wealth substantial agricultural lands in Africa, a local fertility goddess, Tanit, developed or evolved eventually to become supreme.<ref name=\"Abun-Nasr, 1971\"/> A basis for such theories may well be the religious reform movement that emerged and prevailed at Carthage during the years 397-360. The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|p=114}}: Himilco's acts of sacrilege and his subsequent military defeat in Sicily, later his penance and suicide at Carthage; thereafter, introduction to Carthage of Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore.</ref>\n\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city ([[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]]); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice.

There are, however, names for sea gods from individual city-states. Yamm is the god of the sea of [[Ugarit]], an ancient city-state north to Phoenicia. Yamm and Baal, the storm god of Ugaritic myth and often associated with Zeus, have an epic battle for power over the universe. While Yamm is the god of the sea, he truly represents vast chaos.<ref>Habel, N.C. 1964. ''Yahweh Versus Baal: A Conflict of Religious Cultures''. New York: Bookman Associates</ref> Baal, on the other hand, is a representative for order. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power. In some versions of this myth, Baal kills Yamm with a mace fashioned for him, and in others, the goddess Athtart saves Yamm and says that since defeated, he should stay in his own province. Yamm is the brother of the god of death, Mot.<ref>Ringgren, H. 1917. ''Religions of the Ancient Near East''.

The Greeks then retaliated by kidnapping Europa, a Phoenician, and later Medea. The Greeks refused to compensate the Phoenicians for the additional abduction, a fact which Paris used a generation later to justify the abduction of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] from [[Argos]].

Eisenhower]] requested permission from the [[Pakistan]]i prime minister for the U.S. to establish a secret intelligence facility in Pakistan and for the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spyplane to fly from Pakistan. The U-2 flew at altitudes that could not be reached by Soviet fighter jets of the era; it was believed to be beyond the reach of Soviet missiles as well. A facility established in [[Badaber]] ([[Peshawar Air Station]]), {{convert|10|mi|km}} from [[Peshawar]], was a cover for a major communications intercept operation run by the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). Badaber was an excellent location because of its proximity to Soviet central Asia. This enabled the monitoring of missile test sites, key infrastructure and communications. The U-2 \"spy-in-the-sky\" was allowed to use the [[PAF Base Peshawar|Pakistan Air Force section]] of [[Peshawar International Airport|Peshawar Airport]] to gain vital photo intelligence in an era before satellite observation.<ref>[[Amjad Ali (civil servant)|Amjad Ali]], the Pakistani ambassador to the US at the time, narrated in his book ''Glimpses'' (Lahore: Jang Publishers, 1992) that the personal assistant of Suhrawardy advised embassy staff of the Prime Minister's agreement to the US facility on Pakistan soil.</ref>\n\nPresident Eisenhower did not want to fly American U-2 pilots over the Soviet Union because he felt that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or captured, it could be seen as an act of aggression. At a time like the [[Cold War]], any act of aggression could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the [[Royal Air Force]] fly these missions in place of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). With the [[United Kingdom]] still reeling from the aftermath of the [[Suez Crisis]] and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower to be able to use the U-2 plane to see what the Soviet Union was hiding, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.\n\nAfter the success of the first two British pilots and because of pressure to determine the number of Soviet [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] more accurately, Eisenhower allowed the flying of two more missions before the Four Power Paris Summit, scheduled for 16 May. The final two missions before the summit were to be flown by American pilots.<ref>Brugioni, Dino A., and Doris G. Taylor.

His plan began with the release of information to the world that a spy plane had been shot down in Soviet territory, but he did not reveal that the pilot of this plane had also been found and that he was alive. With the information that Khrushchev released, the Americans believed that they would be able to continue with their cover story that the crashed plane was a weather research aircraft and not a military spy plane. The cover-up said that the pilot of the U-2 weather plane had radioed in that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties while flying over Turkey. From there they claimed that the plane could have continued on its path because of auto-pilot, and that this could be the plane that crashed in the Soviet Union. The final attempt to make the cover story seem as real as possible was the grounding of all U-2 planes for mandatory inspection of oxygen systems in order to make sure that no other \"weather missions\" would have the same result as the one that was lost and possibly crashed in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"BrugioniDino\">Brugioni and Taylor (2010), pp. 346\u201347.</ref>\n\nOn 7 May, Khrushchev sprang his trap and announced:<ref name=Powers&Gentry1970/> {{quote|I must tell you a secret.

Press reports were creating a belief in the public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not let stand. Knowing that he was jeopardizing the Paris Peace Summit, Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. president. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from the real problems of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: \"They had better look at their own [espionage] record.\" As he finished, he told reporters he was still going to the Paris Peace Summit.<ref>''Public Papers of the Presidents, 1960'', pp. 403\u201309, 414\u201315; quoted in Barrett (2005), pp. 398\u2013400.</ref>\n\nFrom the Congressional Research Service report \"Covert Action: An Effective Instrument of U.S. Foreign Policy?\", dated 21 October 1996, released by Wikileaks: \"Many observers believed that when President Eisenhower in 1960 accepted responsibility for U-2 overflights of the Soviet Union, he made reaching agreements with Moscow much more difficult; had he blamed the flights on the Pentagon or the CIA, Khrushchev arguably might not have felt forced to react so strongly even though he might not believe the denials.

In an effort to present a less hostile, more cordial Soviet Union, Khrushchev publicly advocated a policy of \"peaceful coexistence with the United States.\"<ref name=\"Walter Cronkite: History Lessons\"/> The May Day celebrations on 1 May of that year were marked by this newfound cooperative spirit. Absent were the militarized symbols of previous parades, such as artillery and armor. Instead there were children, white doves, and athletes.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://archive.org/details/1960-05-05_russia |title=Russia, 1960/05/05 | date = 5 May 1960 | medium = newsreel | publisher = Universal-International News |accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref> But the reaction of the Soviet government to the spy plane incident and the response from the United States doomed any potential meaningful peace agreement.<ref name=\"BBC 'On this Day' May 17th\"/>\n\nIn the days directly leading up to the conference, tensions increased dramatically between the United States and the Soviet Union over the U-2 incident. At this point in the negotiations, the hardliners of the Soviet government were applying heavy pressure to Khrushchev. In the weeks leading up to the summit there had been a revitalization of anti-American sentiment within the Kremlin, with the Soviets blocking a planned trip to Washington D.C. of a Soviet air marshal, inviting Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong to Moscow, and launching an anti-American press campaign designed to critique \"American aggression\".<ref name=\"Beschloss1986\">{{cite book|last=Beschloss|first=Michael|title=Mayday: Eisenhower, Khrushchev, and the U-2 Affair|year=1986|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-015565-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/maydayeisenhower00besc/page/274 274]|url=https://archive.org/details/maydayeisenhower00besc/page/274}}</ref> At this time east and west were divided about how to move forward in Berlin, and the American press characterized Khrushchev's decision to emphasize the U-2 incident at the summit as an attempt to gain leverage on this issue.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://archive.org/details/1960-05-16_summit_crisis |title=Summit Crisis.

Both Eisenhower and Khrushchev gave statements on the 16th. Khrushchev blasted the United States on the U-2 incident. He pointed out that the policy of secret spying was one of mistrust and that the incident had doomed the summit before it even began. He expected the United States and Eisenhower to condemn the spying and pledge to end further reconnaissance missions.<ref name=\"Modern History Sourcebook\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1960summit-statements1.asp |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Khrushchev and Eisenhower: Summit Statements, May 16, 1960 |accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the summit, after Khrushchev had blown Eisenhower's cover, Eisenhower did not deny that the plane had been spying on Soviet military installations but contended that the action was not aggressive but defensive. He argued that the current state of international relations was not one in which peaceful coexistence was an already established fact. The policy of the United States towards the Soviet Union at that time was defensive and cautionary. Eisenhower also made the point that dialogue at the Four Powers Summit was the type of international negotiation that could lead to a relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union where there would be no need to spy on each other. Eisenhower also laid out a plan for an international agreement that authorized the U.N. to \"inspect\" any nations willing to submit to its authority for signs of increased militarization and aggressive action. He stated that the United States would be more than willing to submit to such an inspection by the U.N. and that he hoped to circumvent the spying controversy with this alternative international surveillance agreement.<ref name=\"Modern History Sourcebook\"/>\n\nThe meeting during which both parties made their statements lasted just over three hours. During this time Khrushchev rescinded an invitation he had earlier given to Eisenhower to visit the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAccording to Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev would go on to say that this incident was the beginning of his decline in power as party chairman, perhaps because he seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home.<ref name=\"Walter Cronkite: History Lessons\"/> The collapse of the summit also saw an increased tension between the Soviets and the Americans in the years to come. After this debacle the arms race accelerated and any considerations for negotiations were dashed for the immediate future.<ref>{{cite book |last=Geelhoed |first=Bruce E. |title=Eisenhower, Macmillan, and Allied Unity, 1957\u20131961 |year=2003 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-64227-6 |page=101 |author2=Anthony O. Edmonds}}</ref>\n\n===Consequences of the failed summit===\nAs a result of the spy plane incident and the attempted cover-up, the Four Power Paris Summit was not completed. At the beginning of the talks on 16 May, there was still hope that the two sides could come together even after the events that took place earlier in May, but Eisenhower refused to apologize and Khrushchev left the summit one day after it had begun. Some people{{Who|date=June 2015}} said that Khrushchev had overreacted to the event in an attempt to strengthen his own position, and for that, he was the one to blame for the collapse of the Four Power Paris Summit.<ref name=Tucker-1319-1320/>\n\nBefore the U-2 incident Khrushchev and Eisenhower had been getting along well and the summit was going to be an opportunity for the two sides to come together. Also, Eisenhower had been looking forward to a visit to the Soviet Union and was very upset when his invitation was retracted. The two sides were going to discuss topics such as nuclear arms reduction and also how to deal with increasing tensions surrounding Berlin. According to Eisenhower, had it not been for the U-2 incident, the summit and his visit to the Soviet Union could have greatly helped Soviet and American relations.<ref name=Tucker-1320>Tucker (2008), p. 1320.</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union convened a meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 23 May to tell their side of the story.<ref name=\"UN_SPV857\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-857 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=857 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=23 May 1960}}</ref> The meetings continued for four days with other allegations of spying being exchanged, as well as recriminations over the Paris Summit, and a US offer of an \"open skies\" proposal to allow reciprocal flights over one another's territory,<ref name=\"UN_SPV858\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-858 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=858 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=24 May 1960}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_SPV859\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-859 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=859 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=25 May 1960}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_SPV860\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-860 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=860 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=26 May 1960}}</ref> at the end of which the Soviet Union overwhelmingly lost a vote<ref name=\"UN_SPV860_page17\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-860 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=860 |highlight=rect_142,1005_509,1200 |page=17 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=26 May 1960}}</ref> on a concise resolution which would have condemned the incursions and requested the US to prevent their recurrence.<ref name=\"UN_S4321\">{{UN document |docid=S-4321 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=-1 |document_number=4321 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=23 May 1960|title=Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: draft resolution}}</ref>\n\nThe incident severely compromised Pakistan's security and worsened [[Pakistan\u2013United States relations|relations with the United States]].

As a result, the United States began emphasizing high-speed, low-level flights for its previously high altitude [[B-47]], [[B-52]] and [[B-58]] bombers, and began developing the supersonic [[F-111]], which would include an [[F-111|FB-111A]] variant for the [[Strategic Air Command]].<ref name=\"lax2010\">{{cite book | title=From Controversy to Cutting Edge: A History of the F-111 in Australian Service | url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/431/From-Controversy-to-Cutting-Edge.aspx | page=15 | publisher=Air Power Development Centre, [[Department of Defence (Australia)]] | author=Lax, Mark | location=Canberra, Australia | isbn=978-1-920800-54-3}}</ref> The [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] spy satellite project was accelerated.

This story was originated by [[Oleg Penkovsky]], a [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] agent who spied for [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Penkovsky Papers: The Russian Who Spied for the West |last=Penkovsky |first=Oleg |year=1966 |publisher=Collins | location = London | oclc = 2714427}}</ref> In 2010, CIA documents were released indicating that \"top US officials never believed Powers's account of his fateful flight because it appeared to be directly contradicted by a report from the National Security Agency\" which alleged that the U-2 had descended from 65,000 to 34,000 feet (19,812 to 10,363&nbsp;m) before changing course and disappearing from radar. One contemporary reading of the NSA's story is that they mistakenly tracked the descent of a [[MiG-19]] piloted by Sr. Lt. Sergei Safronov.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7113512.ece | title = CIA documents show US never believed Gary Powers was shot down | work = [[The Times]] | publisher = Times Newspapers Limited |url-access=registration  }}</ref>\n\n===Igor Mentyukov===\nIn 1996, Soviet pilot Captain Igor Mentyukov claimed that, at {{convert|65000|ft|m|-2}} altitude, under orders to ram the intruder, he had caught the U-2 in the [[slipstream]] of his unarmed [[Sukhoi Su-9]], causing the U-2 to flip over and break its wings. The salvo of missiles had indeed scored a hit, downing a pursuing [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]], not the U-2.

With no weapons, the only attack option open to him was [[aerial ramming]]. Mentyukov asserted that Soviet generals concealed these facts to avoid challenging Nikita Khrushchev's faith in the efficiency of Soviet air defenses.<ref name=1997Schwatz/>\n\n===Sergei Khrushchev===\nIn 2000, [[Sergei Khrushchev]] wrote about the experience of his father, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], in the incident. He described how Mentyukov attempted to intercept the U-2, but failed to gain visual contact. Major Mikhail Voronov, in control of a battery of anti-aircraft missiles, fired three SA-2s at the radar contact but only one ignited. It quickly rose toward the target and exploded in the air behind the U-2 but near enough to violently shake the aircraft, tearing off its long wings. At a lower altitude, Powers climbed out of the falling fuselage and parachuted to the ground. Uncertainty about the initial shootdown success resulted in 13 further anti-aircraft missiles being fired by neighboring batteries, but the later missiles only hit a pursuing MiG-19 piloted by Sr. Lt. Sergei Safronov, mortally wounding him.<ref name=SKhrushchev/> This account of the events that occurred during the mission match the details that were given to the CIA by Gary Powers. According to Powers, a missile exploded behind him and after this occurred his U-2 began to nosedive. It is at this point that Powers began to make all of the preparations to eject. Powers landed safely and tried to hide in the Russian countryside until he could get help. His attempts to do this failed and he was captured.<ref name=\"BrugioniDino\" /> Sergei Safronov was [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]].<ref name=howPowers/>\n\n===Selmer Nilsen===\nIn 1981, [[Selmer Nilsen]], a Norwegian convicted for spying for the Soviet Union, claimed in his book \u2018 I Was a Russian Spy\u2019 that Power's U2 had actually been sabotaged. He alleged that a bomb had been placed in the tail of the plane by two Soviet spies disguised as mechanics at a Turkish airfield. He claimed to have been told this by Soviet officials shortly after the incident.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/10/04/Claim-U-2-spy-plane-sabotaged/5465371016000/ |title= Claim U-2 spy plane sabotaged |author=UPI|work=UPI|date=4 October 1981|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Film==\nIn 2015 the [[Steven Spielberg]] feature film ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]'' was released, which dramatized [[James B.

The single-seat aircraft, flown by pilot [[Francis Gary Powers]], was hit by an [[S-75 Dvina]] (SA-2 Guideline) [[surface-to-air missile]] and crashed near [[Sverdlovsk, Russia|Sverdlovsk]] (today's Yekaterinburg). Powers parachuted safely and was captured.\n\nInitially, the US authorities acknowledged the incident as the loss of a civilian weather research aircraft operated by [[NASA]], but were forced to admit the mission's true purpose when a few days later the Soviet government produced the captured pilot and parts of the U-2's [[surveillance]] equipment, including photographs of Soviet military bases taken during the mission.\n\nThe incident occurred during the presidency of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and the premiership of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], around two weeks before the scheduled opening of an east\u2013west summit in Paris. It caused great embarrassment to the United States and prompted a marked deterioration in its [[Soviet Union\u2013United States relations#Cold War (1945\u201391)|relations with the Soviet Union]], already strained by the ongoing [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"us news\">{{cite news|title=Presidential Lies and Deceptions |last=Walsh |first=Kenneth T. |date=6 June 2008 |publisher=US News and World Report |url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2008/06/06/presidential-lies-and-deceptions.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929194001/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2008/06/06/presidential-lies-and-deceptions.html |archivedate=29 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nPowers was convicted of [[espionage]] and sentenced to three years of [[imprisonment]] plus seven years of [[hard labor]] but was released two years later on 10 February 1962 during a [[prisoner exchange]] for Soviet officer [[Rudolf Abel]].<ref name=\"Russian officer\"/>\n\n==Background==\nIn July 1958, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] requested permission from [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister for the U.S. to establish a secret intelligence facility in Pakistan and for the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spyplane to fly from Pakistan. The U-2 flew at altitudes that could not be reached by Soviet fighter jets of the era; it was believed to be beyond the reach of Soviet missiles as well. A facility established in [[Badaber]] ([[Peshawar Air Station]]), {{convert|10|mi|km}} from [[Peshawar]], was a cover for a major communications intercept operation run by the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). Badaber was an excellent location because of its proximity to Soviet central Asia. This enabled the monitoring of missile test sites, key infrastructure and communications. The U-2 \"spy-in-the-sky\" was allowed to use the [[PAF Base Peshawar|Pakistan Air Force section]] of [[Peshawar International Airport|Peshawar Airport]] to gain vital photo intelligence in an era before satellite observation.<ref>[[Amjad Ali (civil servant)|Amjad Ali]], the Pakistani ambassador to the US at the time, narrated in his book ''Glimpses'' (Lahore: Jang Publishers, 1992) that the personal assistant of Suhrawardy advised embassy staff of the Prime Minister's agreement to the US facility on Pakistan soil.</ref>\n\nPresident Eisenhower did not want to fly American U-2 pilots over the Soviet Union because he felt that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or captured, it could be seen as an act of aggression. At a time like the [[Cold War]], any act of aggression could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the [[Royal Air Force]] fly these missions in place of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). With the [[United Kingdom]] still reeling from the aftermath of the [[Suez Crisis]] and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower to be able to use the U-2 plane to see what the Soviet Union was hiding, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.\n\nAfter the success of the first two British pilots and because of pressure to determine the number of Soviet [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] more accurately, Eisenhower allowed the flying of two more missions before the Four Power Paris Summit, scheduled for 16 May. The final two missions before the summit were to be flown by American pilots.<ref>Brugioni, Dino A., and Doris G. Taylor.

The U-2 left Soviet air space and landed at an Iranian airstrip at [[Zahedan]].

[[Mike Mansfield]], the [[Senate Majority Whip]], stated, \"First reports indicate that the President had no knowledge of the plane incident.

His plan began with the release of information to the world that a spy plane had been shot down in Soviet territory, but he did not reveal that the pilot of this plane had also been found and that he was alive. With the information that Khrushchev released, the Americans believed that they would be able to continue with their cover story that the crashed plane was a weather research aircraft and not a military spy plane. The cover-up said that the pilot of the U-2 weather plane had radioed in that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties while flying over Turkey. From there they claimed that the plane could have continued on its path because of auto-pilot, and that this could be the plane that crashed in the Soviet Union. The final attempt to make the cover story seem as real as possible was the grounding of all U-2 planes for mandatory inspection of oxygen systems in order to make sure that no other \"weather missions\" would have the same result as the one that was lost and possibly crashed in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"BrugioniDino\">Brugioni and Taylor (2010), pp. 346\u201347.</ref>\n\nOn 7 May, Khrushchev sprang his trap and announced:<ref name=Powers&Gentry1970/> {{quote|I must tell you a secret.

Cannon said,\n\n{{quote|Mr. Chairman, on May 1 the Soviet Government captured, 1300 miles inside the boundaries of the Russian empire, an American plane, operated by an American pilot, under the direction and control of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, and is now holding both the plane and the pilot.

Press reports were creating a belief in the public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not let stand. Knowing that he was jeopardizing the Paris Peace Summit, Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. president. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from the real problems of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: \"They had better look at their own [espionage] record.\" As he finished, he told reporters he was still going to the Paris Peace Summit.<ref>''Public Papers of the Presidents, 1960'', pp. 403\u201309, 414\u201315; quoted in Barrett (2005), pp. 398\u2013400.</ref>\n\nFrom the Congressional Research Service report \"Covert Action: An Effective Instrument of U.S. Foreign Policy?\", dated 21 October 1996, released by Wikileaks: \"Many observers believed that when President Eisenhower in 1960 accepted responsibility for U-2 overflights of the Soviet Union, he made reaching agreements with Moscow much more difficult; had he blamed the flights on the Pentagon or the CIA, Khrushchev arguably might not have felt forced to react so strongly even though he might not believe the denials.

In an effort to present a less hostile, more cordial Soviet Union, Khrushchev publicly advocated a policy of \"peaceful coexistence with the United States.\"<ref name=\"Walter Cronkite: History Lessons\"/> The May Day celebrations on 1 May of that year were marked by this newfound cooperative spirit.

At this point in the negotiations, the hardliners of the Soviet government were applying heavy pressure to Khrushchev. In the weeks leading up to the summit there had been a revitalization of anti-American sentiment within the Kremlin, with the Soviets blocking a planned trip to Washington D.C. of a Soviet air marshal, inviting Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong to Moscow, and launching an anti-American press campaign designed to critique \"American aggression\".<ref name=\"Beschloss1986\">{{cite book|last=Beschloss|first=Michael|title=Mayday: Eisenhower, Khrushchev, and the U-2 Affair|year=1986|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-015565-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/maydayeisenhower00besc/page/274 274]|url=https://archive.org/details/maydayeisenhower00besc/page/274}}</ref> At this time east and west were divided about how to move forward in Berlin, and the American press characterized Khrushchev's decision to emphasize the U-2 incident at the summit as an attempt to gain leverage on this issue.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://archive.org/details/1960-05-16_summit_crisis |title=Summit Crisis.

Both Eisenhower and Khrushchev gave statements on the 16th. Khrushchev blasted the United States on the U-2 incident. He pointed out that the policy of secret spying was one of mistrust and that the incident had doomed the summit before it even began. He expected the United States and Eisenhower to condemn the spying and pledge to end further reconnaissance missions.<ref name=\"Modern History Sourcebook\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1960summit-statements1.asp |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Khrushchev and Eisenhower: Summit Statements, May 16, 1960 |accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the summit, after Khrushchev had blown Eisenhower's cover, Eisenhower did not deny that the plane had been spying on Soviet military installations but contended that the action was not aggressive but defensive. He argued that the current state of international relations was not one in which peaceful coexistence was an already established fact. The policy of the United States towards the Soviet Union at that time was defensive and cautionary. Eisenhower also made the point that dialogue at the Four Powers Summit was the type of international negotiation that could lead to a relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union where there would be no need to spy on each other. Eisenhower also laid out a plan for an international agreement that authorized the U.N. to \"inspect\" any nations willing to submit to its authority for signs of increased militarization and aggressive action. He stated that the United States would be more than willing to submit to such an inspection by the U.N. and that he hoped to circumvent the spying controversy with this alternative international surveillance agreement.<ref name=\"Modern History Sourcebook\"/>\n\nThe meeting during which both parties made their statements lasted just over three hours. During this time Khrushchev rescinded an invitation he had earlier given to Eisenhower to visit the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAccording to Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev would go on to say that this incident was the beginning of his decline in power as party chairman, perhaps because he seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home.<ref name=\"Walter Cronkite: History Lessons\"/> The collapse of the summit also saw an increased tension between the Soviets and the Americans in the years to come.

At the beginning of the talks on 16 May, there was still hope that the two sides could come together even after the events that took place earlier in May, but Eisenhower refused to apologize and Khrushchev left the summit one day after it had begun.

Also, Eisenhower had been looking forward to a visit to the Soviet Union and was very upset when his invitation was retracted. The two sides were going to discuss topics such as nuclear arms reduction and also how to deal with increasing tensions surrounding Berlin. According to Eisenhower, had it not been for the U-2 incident, the summit and his visit to the Soviet Union could have greatly helped Soviet and American relations.<ref name=Tucker-1320>Tucker (2008), p. 1320.</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union convened a meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 23 May to tell their side of the story.<ref name=\"UN_SPV857\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-857 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=857 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=23 May 1960}}</ref> The meetings continued for four days with other allegations of spying being exchanged, as well as recriminations over the Paris Summit, and a US offer of an \"open skies\" proposal to allow reciprocal flights over one another's territory,<ref name=\"UN_SPV858\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-858 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=858 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=24 May 1960}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_SPV859\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-859 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=859 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=25 May 1960}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_SPV860\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-860 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=860 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=26 May 1960}}</ref> at the end of which the Soviet Union overwhelmingly lost a vote<ref name=\"UN_SPV860_page17\">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-860 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=860 |highlight=rect_142,1005_509,1200 |page=17 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=26 May 1960}}</ref> on a concise resolution which would have condemned the incursions and requested the US to prevent their recurrence.<ref name=\"UN_S4321\">{{UN document |docid=S-4321 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=-1 |document_number=4321 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=23 May 1960|title=Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: draft resolution}}</ref>\n\nThe incident severely compromised Pakistan's security and worsened [[Pakistan\u2013United States relations|relations with the United States]].

Mentyukov asserted that Soviet generals concealed these facts to avoid challenging Nikita Khrushchev's faith in the efficiency of Soviet air defenses.<ref name=1997Schwatz/>\n\n===Sergei Khrushchev===\nIn 2000, [[Sergei Khrushchev]] wrote about the experience of his father, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], in the incident. He described how Mentyukov attempted to intercept the U-2, but failed to gain visual contact. Major Mikhail Voronov, in control of a battery of anti-aircraft missiles, fired three SA-2s at the radar contact but only one ignited. It quickly rose toward the target and exploded in the air behind the U-2 but near enough to violently shake the aircraft, tearing off its long wings. At a lower altitude, Powers climbed out of the falling fuselage and parachuted to the ground. Uncertainty about the initial shootdown success resulted in 13 further anti-aircraft missiles being fired by neighboring batteries, but the later missiles only hit a pursuing MiG-19 piloted by Sr. Lt. Sergei Safronov, mortally wounding him.<ref name=SKhrushchev/> This account of the events that occurred during the mission match the details that were given to the CIA by Gary Powers. According to Powers, a missile exploded behind him and after this occurred his U-2 began to nosedive. It is at this point that Powers began to make all of the preparations to eject. Powers landed safely and tried to hide in the Russian countryside until he could get help. His attempts to do this failed and he was captured.<ref name=\"BrugioniDino\" /> Sergei Safronov was [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]].<ref name=howPowers/>\n\n===Selmer Nilsen===\nIn 1981, [[Selmer Nilsen]], a Norwegian convicted for spying for the Soviet Union, claimed in his book \u2018 I Was a Russian Spy\u2019 that Power's U2 had actually been sabotaged.

Merge needed? -->\n\nOne design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support.\nThis is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called [[Java bytecode]], instead of directly to architecture-specific [[machine code]]. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a [[virtual machine]] (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. [[End user]]s commonly use a [[Java virtual machine|Java Runtime Environment]] (JRE) installed on their machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for [[Java applet]]s.\n\nStandard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, [[thread (computing)|threading]], and [[Computer network|networking]].\n\nThe use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreting]] bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native [[executable]]s. [[Just-in-time compilation|Just-in-time]] (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a [[Java virtual machine]] for it, which translates the [[Java bytecode]] into the platform's machine language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/java-questions/jvm-platform-dependent/|title=Is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) platform dependent or platform independent?

The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the [[unreachable memory]] becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a [[memory leak]] may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use. If methods for a non-existent object are called, a [[null pointer]] exception is thrown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html |title=NullPointerException |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=2014-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506214735/http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html |archive-date=May 6, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/exceptions.html |title=Exceptions in Java |publisher=Artima.com |accessdate=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121152332/http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/exceptions.html |archive-date=January 21, 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOne of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the [[Memory management#DYNAMIC|heap]]. In the latter case, the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a [[memory leak]] occurs. If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of [[smart pointer]]s, but these add overhead and complexity. Note that garbage collection does not prevent [[logical address|logical memory]] leaks, i.e. those where the memory is still referenced but never used.\n\nGarbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java.\n\nJava does not support C/C++ style [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer arithmetic]], where object addresses can be arithmetically manipulated (e.g. by adding or subtracting an offset). This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security.\n\nAs in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's [[primitive data type]]s are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]] (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for non-primitive data types (but see [[escape analysis]]). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance reasons.\n\nJava contains multiple types of garbage collectors. By default, HotSpot uses the [[parallel scavenge garbage collector]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html |title=Java HotSpot\u2122 Virtual Machine Performance Enhancements |publisher=Oracle.com |accessdate=2017-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529071720/http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html |archive-date=May 29, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap.

There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (<code>//</code>), a multiple line style opened with <code>/*</code> and closed with <code>*/</code>, and the [[Javadoc]] commenting style opened with <code>/**</code> and closed with <code>*/</code>. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be read by some [[integrated development environment]]s (IDEs) such as [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.\n\n===Hello world example===\n\nThe traditional [[\"Hello, world!\" program|Hello world program]] can be written in Java as:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/application/index.html |title=Lesson: A Closer Look at the Hello World Application |work=The Java\u2122 Tutorials > Getting Started |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |accessdate=2011-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317072804/http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/application/index.html |archive-date=March 17, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n<!--\nNOTE:\nPLEASE *do not* change the example code; it's written in Sun's recommended style.

It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a [[Java compiler]], producing a file with the <code>.class</code> suffix (<code>HelloWorldApp.class</code>, in this case). Only then can it be executed, or launched. The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with a non-public access modifier and any number of public [[inner class]]es. When the source file contains multiple classes, it is necessary to make one class (introduced by the <code>'''class'''</code> keyword) public (preceded by the <code>'''public'''</code> keyword) and name the source file with that public class name.\n\nA class that is not declared public may be stored in any .java file. The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file. The name of the class file is the name of the class, with ''.class'' appended. For class file generation, [[Class (computer programming)#Unnamed|anonymous classes]] are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class, a ''$'', and an integer.\n\nThe [[List of Java keywords|keyword]] <code>'''public'''</code> denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes, or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy. The class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the .java file is located. This is called an access level modifier. Other access level modifiers include the keywords <code>'''private'''</code> and <code>'''protected'''</code>.\n\nThe keyword <code>'''static'''</code><ref name=\":0\" /> in front of a method indicates a [[Method (computer programming)#Static methods|static method]], which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class. Only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object. Static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static. Methods that are not designated static are instance methods and require a specific instance of a class to operate.\n\nThe keyword <code>'''void'''</code> indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller. If a Java program is to exit with an error code, it must call System.exit() explicitly.\n\nThe method name <code>main</code> is not a keyword in the Java language. It is simply the name of the method the Java launcher calls to pass control to the program. Java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and [[Enterprise JavaBeans]] do not use or need a <code>main()</code> method. A Java program may contain multiple classes that have <code>main</code> methods, which means that the VM needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from.\n\nThe main method must accept an [[array data type|array]] of '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|String}}''' objects. By convention, it is referenced as <code>'''args'''</code> although any other legal identifier name can be used. Since Java&nbsp;5, the main method can also use [[variadic function|variable arguments]], in the form of <code>public static void main(String... args)</code>, allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of <code>String</code> arguments. The effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical (to the <code>args</code> parameter which is still an array of <code>String</code> objects), but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array.\n\nThe Java launcher launches Java by loading a given class (specified on the command line or as an attribute in a [[JAR (file format)|JAR]]) and starting its <code>public static void main(String[])</code> method. Stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly. The <code>String[] args</code> parameter is an [[array data type|array]] of {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|String}} objects containing any arguments passed to the class. The parameters to <code>main</code> are often passed by means of a [[command-line interface|command line]].\n\nPrinting is part of a Java standard library: The '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|System}}''' class defines a public static field called '''{{Javadoc:SE|name=out|java/lang|System|out}}'''. The <code>out</code> object is an instance of the {{Javadoc:SE|java/io|PrintStream}} class and provides many methods for printing data to [[standard streams|standard out]], including '''{{Javadoc:SE|name=println(String)|java/io|PrintStream|println(java.lang.String)}}''' which also appends a new line to the passed string.\n\nThe string <code>\"Hello World!\"</code> is automatically converted to a String object by the compiler.\n\n===Example with methods===\n<source lang=\"java\">\n// This is an example of a single line comment using two slashes\n\n/*\n * This is an example of a multiple line comment using the slash and asterisk.\n * This type of comment can be used to hold a lot of information or deactivate\n * code, but it is very important to remember to close the comment.\n */\n\npackage fibsandlies;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\n\n/**\n * This is an example of a Javadoc comment; Javadoc can compile documentation\n * from this text.

The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java&nbsp;8 in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/9-deprecated-features-3745636.html#JDK-8074165|title=Deprecated APIs, Features, and Options|website=www.oracle.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\n===Servlet===\n{{Main Article| Java servlet}}\n\n[[Java servlet]] technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are [[server-side]] Java EE components that generate responses (typically [[HTML]] pages) to requests (typically [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests) from [[client (computing)|clients]].\n\nThe Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded by two standard Java technologies for web services:\n\n* the [[Java API for RESTful Web Services]] (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON and REST services, and\n* the [[Java API for XML Web Services]] (JAX-WS) useful for  [[SOAP]] [[Web Service]]s.\n\n===JavaServer Pages===\n{{Main|JavaServer Pages}}\n\nJavaServer Pages (JSP) are [[server-side]] Java EE components that generate responses, typically [[HTML]] pages, to [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests from [[client (computing)|clients]]. JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special [[delimiter]]s <code><%</code> and <code>%></code>. A JSP is compiled to a Java ''servlet'', a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.\n\n===Swing application===\n{{Main|Swing (Java)}}\n\n[[Swing (Java)|Swing]] is a graphical user interface [[library (computing)|library]] for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the [[pluggable look and feel]] system of Swing. Clones of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[GTK+]], and [[Motif (software)|Motif]] are supplied by Sun. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] also provides an [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] look and feel for [[macOS]]. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native [[Graphical control element|GUI widget]] drawing routines of the underlying platforms.\n\n===JavaFX application===\n{{Main|JavaFX}}\n[[JavaFX]] is a [[Computing platform|software platform]] for creating and delivering [[Application software|desktop applications]], as well as [[Rich Internet application|rich Internet applications (RIAs)]] that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] as the standard [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]] library for [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|Java SE]], but both will be included for the foreseeable future. JavaFX has support for [[desktop computer]]s and [[web browser]]s on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[macOS]]. JavaFX does not have support for native OS look and feels.\n\n===Generics===\n{{Main|Generics in Java}}\n\nIn 2004, [[generic programming|generics]] were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually <code>Object</code>, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (<code>ClassCastException</code>s) from occurring, it would be [[type safety|type safe]].\n\nIn 2016, the type system of Java was proven [[soundness|unsound]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namin/unsound/master/doc/unsound-oopsla16.pdf|title=Java and Scala's Type Systems are Unsound|access-date=February 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128174902/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namin/unsound/master/doc/unsound-oopsla16.pdf|archive-date=November 28, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Main|Criticism of Java}}\n\nCriticisms directed at Java include the implementation of generics,<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Arnold \n |first=Ken \n |title=Generics Considered Harmful \n |url=https://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics_consid_1.html \n |publisher=java.net \n |accessdate=September 10, 2015 \n |url-status=bot: unknown \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010002142/http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics_consid_1.html \n |archivedate=October 10, 2007 \n}}.

This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for [[Microsoft Windows]] (still works for XP, while only later versions are currently officially supported), [[macOS]], [[Linux]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by [[Ecma International]], ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organization, the Oracle implementation is the [[de facto standard]].\n\nThe Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users, and the [[Java Development Kit]] (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the [[Java compiler]], [[Javadoc]], [[JAR (file format)|Jar]], and a [[debugger]]. Oracle has also released [[GraalVM]], a high performance Java dynamic compiler and interpreter.\n\n[[OpenJDK]] is another notable Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GNU GPL. The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation.\n\nThe goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be ''compatible''. This resulted in a legal dispute with [[Microsoft]] after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support [[Java remote method invocation|RMI]] or [[Java Native Interface|JNI]] and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and, in 2001, won a settlement of US$20&nbsp;million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun.<ref>{{cite news |author=Niccolai, James |title=Sun, Microsoft settle Java lawsuit |url=https://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2001/jw-0124-iw-mssuncourt.html |work=JavaWorld |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=January 23, 2001 |accessdate=2008-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528233154/http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2001/jw-0124-iw-mssuncourt.html |archive-date=May 28, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\n\nPlatform-independent Java is essential to [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]], and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.\n\n==Use outside the Java platform==\nThe Java programming language requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed.\n\nOracle supplies the [[Java platform]] for use with Java. The [[Android SDK]] is an alternative software platform, used primarily for developing [[Android application]]s with its own GUI system.\n\n===Android===\n[[File:Android 6.0-en.png|thumb|upright|The [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system makes extensive use of Java-related technology]]\n\nThe Java language is a key pillar in [[Android (operating system)|Android]], an [[open source software|open source]] [[mobile operating system]].

Depending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the [[Dalvik virtual machine]] or compiled into native code by the [[Android Runtime]].\n\nAndroid does not provide the full Java SE standard library, although the Android SDK does include an independent implementation of a large subset of it. It supports Java&nbsp;6 and some Java&nbsp;7 features, offering an implementation compatible with the standard library ([[Apache Harmony]]).\n\n====Controversy====\n{{See also|Oracle America, Inc. v.

Merge needed? -->\n\nOne design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support.\nThis is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called [[Java bytecode]], instead of directly to architecture-specific [[machine code]]. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a [[virtual machine]] (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. [[End user]]s commonly use a [[Java virtual machine|Java Runtime Environment]] (JRE) installed on their machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for [[Java applet]]s.\n\nStandard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, [[thread (computing)|threading]], and [[Computer network|networking]].\n\nThe use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreting]] bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native [[executable]]s. [[Just-in-time compilation|Just-in-time]] (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a [[Java virtual machine]] for it, which translates the [[Java bytecode]] into the platform's machine language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/java-questions/jvm-platform-dependent/|title=Is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) platform dependent or platform independent?

The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the [[unreachable memory]] becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a [[memory leak]] may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use. If methods for a non-existent object are called, a [[null pointer]] exception is thrown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html |title=NullPointerException |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=2014-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506214735/http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html |archive-date=May 6, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/exceptions.html |title=Exceptions in Java |publisher=Artima.com |accessdate=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121152332/http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/exceptions.html |archive-date=January 21, 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOne of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the [[Memory management#DYNAMIC|heap]]. In the latter case, the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a [[memory leak]] occurs. If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of [[smart pointer]]s, but these add overhead and complexity. Note that garbage collection does not prevent [[logical address|logical memory]] leaks, i.e. those where the memory is still referenced but never used.\n\nGarbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java.\n\nJava does not support C/C++ style [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer arithmetic]], where object addresses can be arithmetically manipulated (e.g. by adding or subtracting an offset). This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security.\n\nAs in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's [[primitive data type]]s are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]] (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for non-primitive data types (but see [[escape analysis]]). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance reasons.\n\nJava contains multiple types of garbage collectors. By default, HotSpot uses the [[parallel scavenge garbage collector]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html |title=Java HotSpot\u2122 Virtual Machine Performance Enhancements |publisher=Oracle.com |accessdate=2017-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529071720/http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html |archive-date=May 29, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap.

It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a [[Java compiler]], producing a file with the <code>.class</code> suffix (<code>HelloWorldApp.class</code>, in this case). Only then can it be executed, or launched. The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with a non-public access modifier and any number of public [[inner class]]es. When the source file contains multiple classes, it is necessary to make one class (introduced by the <code>'''class'''</code> keyword) public (preceded by the <code>'''public'''</code> keyword) and name the source file with that public class name.\n\nA class that is not declared public may be stored in any .java file. The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file. The name of the class file is the name of the class, with ''.class'' appended. For class file generation, [[Class (computer programming)#Unnamed|anonymous classes]] are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class, a ''$'', and an integer.\n\nThe [[List of Java keywords|keyword]] <code>'''public'''</code> denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes, or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy. The class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the .java file is located. This is called an access level modifier. Other access level modifiers include the keywords <code>'''private'''</code> and <code>'''protected'''</code>.\n\nThe keyword <code>'''static'''</code><ref name=\":0\" /> in front of a method indicates a [[Method (computer programming)#Static methods|static method]], which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class. Only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object. Static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static. Methods that are not designated static are instance methods and require a specific instance of a class to operate.\n\nThe keyword <code>'''void'''</code> indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller. If a Java program is to exit with an error code, it must call System.exit() explicitly.\n\nThe method name <code>main</code> is not a keyword in the Java language. It is simply the name of the method the Java launcher calls to pass control to the program. Java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and [[Enterprise JavaBeans]] do not use or need a <code>main()</code> method. A Java program may contain multiple classes that have <code>main</code> methods, which means that the VM needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from.\n\nThe main method must accept an [[array data type|array]] of '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|String}}''' objects. By convention, it is referenced as <code>'''args'''</code> although any other legal identifier name can be used. Since Java&nbsp;5, the main method can also use [[variadic function|variable arguments]], in the form of <code>public static void main(String... args)</code>, allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of <code>String</code> arguments. The effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical (to the <code>args</code> parameter which is still an array of <code>String</code> objects), but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array.\n\nThe Java launcher launches Java by loading a given class (specified on the command line or as an attribute in a [[JAR (file format)|JAR]]) and starting its <code>public static void main(String[])</code> method. Stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly. The <code>String[] args</code> parameter is an [[array data type|array]] of {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|String}} objects containing any arguments passed to the class. The parameters to <code>main</code> are often passed by means of a [[command-line interface|command line]].\n\nPrinting is part of a Java standard library: The '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|System}}''' class defines a public static field called '''{{Javadoc:SE|name=out|java/lang|System|out}}'''. The <code>out</code> object is an instance of the {{Javadoc:SE|java/io|PrintStream}} class and provides many methods for printing data to [[standard streams|standard out]], including '''{{Javadoc:SE|name=println(String)|java/io|PrintStream|println(java.lang.String)}}''' which also appends a new line to the passed string.\n\nThe string <code>\"Hello World!\"</code> is automatically converted to a String object by the compiler.\n\n===Example with methods===\n<source lang=\"java\">\n// This is an example of a single line comment using two slashes\n\n/*\n * This is an example of a multiple line comment using the slash and asterisk.\n * This type of comment can be used to hold a lot of information or deactivate\n * code, but it is very important to remember to close the comment.\n */\n\npackage fibsandlies;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\n\n/**\n * This is an example of a Javadoc comment; Javadoc can compile documentation\n * from this text.

The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java&nbsp;8 in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/9-deprecated-features-3745636.html#JDK-8074165|title=Deprecated APIs, Features, and Options|website=www.oracle.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\n===Servlet===\n{{Main Article| Java servlet}}\n\n[[Java servlet]] technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are [[server-side]] Java EE components that generate responses (typically [[HTML]] pages) to requests (typically [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests) from [[client (computing)|clients]].\n\nThe Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded by two standard Java technologies for web services:\n\n* the [[Java API for RESTful Web Services]] (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON and REST services, and\n* the [[Java API for XML Web Services]] (JAX-WS) useful for  [[SOAP]] [[Web Service]]s.\n\n===JavaServer Pages===\n{{Main|JavaServer Pages}}\n\nJavaServer Pages (JSP) are [[server-side]] Java EE components that generate responses, typically [[HTML]] pages, to [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests from [[client (computing)|clients]]. JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special [[delimiter]]s <code><%</code> and <code>%></code>. A JSP is compiled to a Java ''servlet'', a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.\n\n===Swing application===\n{{Main|Swing (Java)}}\n\n[[Swing (Java)|Swing]] is a graphical user interface [[library (computing)|library]] for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the [[pluggable look and feel]] system of Swing. Clones of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[GTK+]], and [[Motif (software)|Motif]] are supplied by Sun. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] also provides an [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] look and feel for [[macOS]]. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native [[Graphical control element|GUI widget]] drawing routines of the underlying platforms.\n\n===JavaFX application===\n{{Main|JavaFX}}\n[[JavaFX]] is a [[Computing platform|software platform]] for creating and delivering [[Application software|desktop applications]], as well as [[Rich Internet application|rich Internet applications (RIAs)]] that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] as the standard [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]] library for [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|Java SE]], but both will be included for the foreseeable future. JavaFX has support for [[desktop computer]]s and [[web browser]]s on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[macOS]]. JavaFX does not have support for native OS look and feels.\n\n===Generics===\n{{Main|Generics in Java}}\n\nIn 2004, [[generic programming|generics]] were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually <code>Object</code>, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (<code>ClassCastException</code>s) from occurring, it would be [[type safety|type safe]].\n\nIn 2016, the type system of Java was proven [[soundness|unsound]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namin/unsound/master/doc/unsound-oopsla16.pdf|title=Java and Scala's Type Systems are Unsound|access-date=February 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128174902/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namin/unsound/master/doc/unsound-oopsla16.pdf|archive-date=November 28, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Main|Criticism of Java}}\n\nCriticisms directed at Java include the implementation of generics,<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Arnold \n |first=Ken \n |title=Generics Considered Harmful \n |url=https://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics_consid_1.html \n |publisher=java.net \n |accessdate=September 10, 2015 \n |url-status=bot: unknown \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010002142/http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics_consid_1.html \n |archivedate=October 10, 2007 \n}}.

This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for [[Microsoft Windows]] (still works for XP, while only later versions are currently officially supported), [[macOS]], [[Linux]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by [[Ecma International]], ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organization, the Oracle implementation is the [[de facto standard]].\n\nThe Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users, and the [[Java Development Kit]] (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the [[Java compiler]], [[Javadoc]], [[JAR (file format)|Jar]], and a [[debugger]]. Oracle has also released [[GraalVM]], a high performance Java dynamic compiler and interpreter.\n\n[[OpenJDK]] is another notable Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GNU GPL. The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation.\n\nThe goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be ''compatible''. This resulted in a legal dispute with [[Microsoft]] after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support [[Java remote method invocation|RMI]] or [[Java Native Interface|JNI]] and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and, in 2001, won a settlement of US$20&nbsp;million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun.<ref>{{cite news |author=Niccolai, James |title=Sun, Microsoft settle Java lawsuit |url=https://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2001/jw-0124-iw-mssuncourt.html |work=JavaWorld |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=January 23, 2001 |accessdate=2008-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528233154/http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2001/jw-0124-iw-mssuncourt.html |archive-date=May 28, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\n\nPlatform-independent Java is essential to [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]], and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.\n\n==Use outside the Java platform==\nThe Java programming language requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed.\n\nOracle supplies the [[Java platform]] for use with Java. The [[Android SDK]] is an alternative software platform, used primarily for developing [[Android application]]s with its own GUI system.\n\n===Android===\n[[File:Android 6.0-en.png|thumb|upright|The [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system makes extensive use of Java-related technology]]\n\nThe Java language is a key pillar in [[Android (operating system)|Android]], an [[open source software|open source]] [[mobile operating system]].

Depending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the [[Dalvik virtual machine]] or compiled into native code by the [[Android Runtime]].\n\nAndroid does not provide the full Java SE standard library, although the Android SDK does include an independent implementation of a large subset of it.

It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] database developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"design\" /><ref name=\"about/history\" /> In 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for [[SQL]]. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL.<ref name=\"Project name\" />\n\nPostgreSQL features [[Transaction processing|transactions]] with [[ACID (computer science)|Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability]] (ACID) properties, automatically updatable [[View (SQL)|view]]s, [[materialized view]]s, [[Database trigger|triggers]], [[foreign key]]s, and [[stored procedure]]s.<ref name=\"intro-whatis\" /> It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to [[data warehouse]]s or [[Web services]] with many [[concurrent user]]s. It is the default database for [[macOS Server]],<ref name=\"OS X Lion Server\" /><ref name=\"MySQL not included\" /><ref name=\"OS X\" /> and is also available for [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\n\n== History ==\nPostgreSQL evolved from the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, [[Michael Stonebraker]], left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.<ref name=\"design\" /> He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the [[Turing Award]] in 2014 for these and other projects,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/stonebraker_1172121.cfm |title=Michael Stonebraker \u2013 A.M. Turing Award Winner |quote=Techniques pioneered in Postgres were widely implemented [..] Stonebraker is the only Turing award winner to have engaged in serial entrepreneurship on anything like this scale, giving him a distinctive perspective on the academic world. |website=amturing.acm.org |language=en |access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref> and techniques pioneered in them.\n\nThe new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support [[data type]]s.<ref name=\"Stonebraker\" /> These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships \u2013 something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using ''rules''. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.<ref name=\"pavel-history\" />\n\nStarting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM [[SIGMOD]] Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers<ref> A Brief History of PostgreSQL [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/history.html \"Version 3 appeared in 1991 and added support for multiple storage managers, an improved query executor, and a rewritten rule system.\"]. ''postgresql.org''. ''The PostgreSQL Global Development Group'', Retrieved on 18 March 2020.</ref> and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2<ref name=\"University POSTGRES\" /> on June 30, 1994 \u2013 primarily a cleanup \u2013 the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an [[MIT License]] variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced [[QUEL query languages|POSTQUEL query language]] interpreter, which could be interactively used with a [[console application]] named <kbd>''monitor''</kbd>. <!-- See http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres-v4r2/postgres-setup.ps -->\n\nIn 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. <kbd>''monitor''</kbd> was also replaced by <kbd>psql</kbd>. Yu and Chen announced the first version (0.01) to [[beta tester]]s on May 5, 1995.<!-- email lists are not citable, however see message 3165 of |url=http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres-v4r2/mail-archive/1995.05.tar.gz |title=Announcement: Postgres95 Beta |author=Andrew K.

Mikheev, work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley.\n\nIn 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. The online presence at the website PostgreSQL.org began on October 22, 1996.<ref name=\"20th anniversary\" /> The first PostgreSQL release formed version 6.0 on January 29, 1997. Since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as The PostgreSQL Global Development Group.<ref name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThe project continues to make releases available under its [[free and open-source software]] PostgreSQL License. Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors, support companies, and open-source programmers.\n\n== Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) ==\nPostgreSQL manages [[concurrency control|concurrency]] through [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC), which gives each transaction a \"snapshot\" of the database, allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions. This largely eliminates the need for read locks, and ensures the database maintains [[ACID (computer science)|ACID]] principles. PostgreSQL offers three levels of [[isolation (database systems)|transaction isolation]]: Read Committed, Repeatable Read and Serializable. Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads, requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead. PostgreSQL supports full [[serializability]] via the serializable [[snapshot isolation]] (SSI) method.<ref name=\"ports\" />\n\n== Storage and replication ==\n\n=== Replication ===\nPostgreSQL includes built-in binary replication based on shipping the changes ([[Write-ahead logging|write-ahead logs]] (WAL)) to replica nodes asynchronously, with the ability to run read-only queries against these replicated nodes. This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently. Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master, increasing load.\n\nPostgreSQL includes built-in synchronous replication<ref name=\"H Online\" /> that ensures that, for each write transaction, the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log. Unlike other database systems, the durability of a transaction (whether it is asynchronous or synchronous) can be specified per-database, per-user, per-session or even per-transaction. This can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees, and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby.\n\nStandby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication. The first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server. When this fails, the system fails over to the next in line.\n\nSynchronous [[multi-master replication]] is not included in the PostgreSQL core. Postgres-XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi-master replication.<ref name=\"Postgres-XC\" /> It is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL. A related project is called [[Postgres-XL]]. Postgres-R is yet another [[Fork (software development)|fork]].<ref name=postgres-r /> Bidirectional replication (BDR) is an asynchronous multi-master replication system for PostgreSQL.<ref name=bdr />\n\nTools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier.\n\nSeveral asynchronous trigger-based replication packages are available. These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities, for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate:\n\n* [[Slony-I]]\n* Londiste, part of SkyTools (developed by [[Skype]])\n* Bucardo multi-master replication (developed by [[Backcountry.com]])<ref name=\"Fischer\" />\n* [[SymmetricDS]] multi-master, multi-tier replication\n\n=== Indexes ===\nPostgreSQL includes built-in support for regular [[B-tree]] and [[hash table]] indexes, and four index access methods: generalized search trees ([[GiST]]), generalized [[inverted index]]es (GIN), Space-Partitioned GiST (SP-GiST)<ref name=\"SP-GiST\" /> and [[Block Range Index]]es (BRIN). In addition, user-defined index methods can be created, although this is quite an involved process. Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features:\n\n* [[Expression index]]es can be created with an index of the result of an expression or function, instead of simply the value of a column.\n* [[Partial index]]es, which only index part of a table, can be created by adding a WHERE clause to the end of the CREATE INDEX statement. This allows a smaller index to be created.\n* The planner is able to use multiple indexes together to satisfy complex queries, using temporary in-memory [[bitmap index]] operations (useful for [[data warehouse]] applications for joining a large [[fact table]] to smaller [[dimension table]]s such as those arranged in a [[star schema]]).\n* [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbors]] (''k''-NN) indexing (also referred to KNN-GiST<ref name=\"KNN-GiST\" />) provides efficient searching of \"closest values\" to that specified, useful to finding similar words, or close objects or locations with [[Geographic data and information|geospatial]] data. This is achieved without exhaustive matching of values.\n* Index-only scans often allow the system to fetch data from indexes without ever having to access the main table.\n* PostgreSQL 9.5 introduced [[Block Range Index]]es (BRIN).\n\n=== Schemas ===\nIn PostgreSQL, a [[Database schema|schema]] holds all objects, except for roles and tablespaces. Schemas effectively act like namespaces, allowing objects of the same name to co-exist in the same database. By default, newly created databases have a schema called ''public'', but any further schemas can be added, and the public schema isn't mandatory.\n\nA {{code|search_path}} setting determines the order in which PostgreSQL checks schemas for unqualified objects (those without a prefixed schema). By default, it is set to {{code|$user, public}} ({{code|$user}} refers to the currently connected database user). This default can be set on a database or role level, but as it is a session parameter, it can be freely changed (even multiple times) during a client session, affecting that session only.\n\nNon-existent schemas listed in search_path are silently skipped during objects lookup.\n\nNew objects are created in whichever valid schema (one that presently exists) appears first in the search_path.Schema is an outline of database.\n\n=== Data types ===\nA wide variety of native [[data type]]s are supported, including:\n\n* Boolean\n* [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|Arbitrary precision]] numerics\n* Character (text, varchar, char)\n* Binary\n* Date/time (timestamp/time with/without timezone, date, interval)\n* Money\n* Enum\n* Bit strings\n* Text search type\n* Composite\n* HStore, an extension enabled key-value store within PostgreSQL<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/postgresql-nosql-database |title=PostgreSQL, the NoSQL Database &#124; Linux Journal |website=www.linuxjournal.com}}</ref> \n* Arrays (variable length and can be of any data type, including text and composite types) up to 1&nbsp;GB in total storage size\n* Geometric primitives\n* [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] addresses\n* [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) blocks and [[MAC address]]es\n* [[XML]] supporting [[XPath]] queries\n* [[Universally unique identifier]] (UUID)\n* JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]), and a faster [[Binary code|binary]] JSONB (since version 9.4; not the same as [[BSON]]<ref name=\"jsonb\" />)\n\nIn addition, users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL's indexing infrastructures \u2013 GiST, GIN, SP-GiST. Examples of these include the [[geographic information system]] (GIS) data types from the [[PostGIS]] project for PostgreSQL.\n\nThere is also a data type called a ''domain'', which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain. This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain.\n\nA data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types. These can be discrete ranges (e.g. all integer values 1 to 10) or continuous ranges (e.g., any time between 10:00 am and 11:00 am). The built-in range types available include ranges of integers, big integers, decimal numbers, time stamps (with and without time zone) and dates.\n\nCustom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available, such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base, or float ranges using the float data type as a base. Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the {{kbd|[}}/{{kbd|]}} and {{kbd|(}}/{{kbd|)}} characters respectively. (e.g., {{code|[4,9)}} represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9.) Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap, containment, right of etc.\n\n=== User-defined objects ===\nNew types of almost all objects inside the database can be created, including:\n\n* Casts\n* Conversions\n* Data types\n* [[Data domain]]s\n* Functions, including aggregate functions and window functions\n* Indexes including custom indexes for custom types\n* Operators (existing ones can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]])\n* Procedural languages\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nTables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a ''parent'' table. Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables, unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword, i.e. {{code|lang=\"sql\" | SELECT * FROM ONLY parent_table;}}. Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table.\n\nInheritance can be used to implement table partitioning, using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, this feature is not fully supported yet \u2013 in particular, table constraints are not currently inheritable. All check constraints and not-null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children. Other types of constraints (unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints) are not inherited.\n\nInheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in [[Entity\u2013relationship model|entity relationship diagrams]] (ERDs) directly into the PostgreSQL database.\n\n=== Other storage features ===\n* [[Referential integrity]] constraints including [[foreign key]] constraints, column [[Constraint satisfaction |constraints]], and row checks\n* Binary and textual large-object storage\n* [[Tablespace]]s\n* Per-column collation\n* Online backup\n* Point-in-time recovery, implemented using write-ahead logging\n* In-place upgrades with pg_upgrade for less downtime (supports upgrades from 8.3.x and later)\n\n== Control and connectivity ==\n\n=== Foreign data wrappers ===\nPostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers (FDWs).<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Obe\n |first=Regina\n |last2=Hsu\n |first2=Leo S.\n |chapter=10: Replication and External Data\n |title=PostgreSQL: Up and Running\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8jkIZkMTPcC\n |edition=1\n |location=Sebastopol, CA\n |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly Media, Inc.]]\n |date=2012\n |page=129\n |isbn=978-1-4493-2633-3\n |access-date=October 17, 2016\n |quote=Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) [...] are mechanisms of querying external datasources.

This means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables, and even join multiple data-sources together.\n\n=== Interfaces ===\nFor connecting to applications, PostgreSQL includes the built-in interfaces libpq (the official C application interface) and [[ECPG]] (an embedded C system). Third-party libraries for connecting to PostgreSQL are available for many [[programming language]]s, including [[C++]],<ref>{{cite web|title=libpqxx|url=http://pqxx.org/development/libpqxx/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web|title=PostgreSQL JDBC Driver|url=https://jdbc.postgresql.org/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]],<ref name=\"psycopg2\" /> [[Node.js]],<ref>{{cite web|title=node-postgres|url=https://node-postgres.com/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Go (programming language)|Go]],<ref>{{cite web |title=SQL database drivers |url=https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers#drivers |website=Go wiki |publisher=golang.org |access-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref> and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rust-Postgres|url=https://crates.io/crates/postgres|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Procedural languages ===\nProcedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom [[subroutine]]s (functions), often called ''[[stored procedure]]s''. These functions can be used to build [[database trigger]]s (functions invoked on modification of certain data) and custom data types and [[aggregate function]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-programming.html|title=Server Programming|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref> Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function, using a DO command at SQL level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-do.html|title=DO|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref>\n\nLanguages are divided into two groups: Procedures written in ''safe'' languages are [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]] and can be safely created and used by any user. Procedures written in ''unsafe'' languages can only be created by [[superuser]]s, because they allow bypassing a database's security restrictions, but can also access sources external to the database. Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions.\n\nPostgreSQL has built-in support for three procedural languages:\n\n* Plain SQL (safe). Simpler SQL functions can get [[inline expansion|expanded inline]] into the calling (SQL) query, which saves function call overhead and allows the query optimizer to \"see inside\" the function.\n* Procedural Language/PostgreSQL ([[PL/pgSQL]]) (safe), which resembles Oracle's Procedural Language for SQL ([[PL/SQL]]) procedural language and SQL/Persistent Stored Modules ([[SQL/PSM]]).\n* [[C (programming language)|C]] (unsafe), which allows loading one or more custom [[shared library]] into the database. Functions written in C offer the best performance, but bugs in code can crash and potentially corrupt the database. Most built-in functions are written in C.\n\nIn addition, PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions. Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html|title=PL/Python - Python Procedural Language|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref> and [[Tcl]]. There are external projects to add support for many other languages,<ref>{{cite web |date=March 31, 2016 |title=Procedural Languages |publisher=postgresql.org |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/external-pl.html |access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> including [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]] (PL/V8), [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and others.\n\n=== Triggers ===\nTriggers are events triggered by the action of SQL [[data manipulation language]] (DML) statements. For example, an [[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]] statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid. Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] statements.\n\nTriggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables. Triggers can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table, and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger's WHERE clause. Triggers can be attached to [[View (SQL)|views]] by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.\n\n=== Asynchronous notifications ===\nPostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY, LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands. A session can issue a NOTIFY command, along with the user-specified channel and an optional payload, to mark a particular event occurring. Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command, which can listen to a particular channel. This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed. Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed, and reducing unnecessary overhead. Notifications are fully transactional, in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed. This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back.\n\nMany connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system (including libpq, JDBC, Npgsql, psycopg and node.js) so it can be used by external applications.\n\nPostgreSQL can act as an effective, persistent [[Publish-subscribe pattern|\"pub/sub\" server]] or job server by combining LISTEN with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED<ref name=\"postgres-jobserver\">{{cite web |last1=Chartier |first1=Colin |title=System design hack: Postgres is a great pub/sub & job server |url=https://layerci.com/blog/postgres-is-the-answer/ |website=LayerCI blog |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>, a combination which has existed since PostgreSQL version 9.5<ref name=\"release-9.5\">{{cite web |title=Release 9.5 |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/release-9-5.html |website=postgresql.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ringer-skip-locked\">{{cite web |last1=Ringer |first1=Craig |title=What is SKIP LOCKED for in PostgreSQL 9.5? |url=https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/ |website=2nd Quadrant |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Rules ===\nRules allow the \"query tree\" of an incoming query to be rewritten. \"Query Re-Write Rules\" are attached to a table/class and \"Re-Write\" the incoming DML (select, insert, update, and/or delete) into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it. Query Re-Write occurs after DML statement parsing, but before query planning.\n\n=== Other querying features ===\n* [[Database transaction|Transactions]]\n* [[Full-text search]]\n* Views\n** Materialized views<ref name=\"materialized_views\" />\n** Updateable views<ref name=\"updatable_views\" />\n** Recursive views<ref name=\"recursive_views\" />\n* Inner, outer (full, left and right), and cross [[Join (SQL)|joins]]\n* Sub-[[Select (SQL)|selects]]\n** Correlated sub-queries<ref name=\"Introduction and Concepts\" />\n* [[Regular expression]]s<ref name=\"Bernier\" />\n* [[Hierarchical and recursive queries in SQL#Common table expression|common table expressions]] and writable common table expressions\n* Encrypted connections via [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS); current versions do not use vulnerable SSL, even with that configuration option<ref name=\"POODLE\" />\n* Domains\n* [[Savepoint]]s\n* [[Two-phase commit protocol|Two-phase commit]]\n* The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique (TOAST) is used to transparently store large table attributes (such as big MIME attachments or XML messages) in a separate area, with automatic compression.\n* [[Embedded SQL]] is implemented using preprocessor. SQL code is first written embedded into C code. Then code is run through ECPG preprocessor, which replaces SQL with calls to code library. Then code can be compiled using a C compiler. Embedding works also with [[C++]] but it does not recognize all C++ constructs.\n\n=== Concurrency model ===\nPostgreSQL server is [[Process (computing)|process]]-based (not threaded), and uses one operating system process per database session. Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the operating system. Starting with PostgreSQL 9.6, many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes, taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/689387/ |title=PostgreSQL 9.6 Beta and PGCon 2016 |last=Berkus |first=Josh |date=June 2, 2016 |website=LWN.net}}</ref> Client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/FAQ#How_does_PostgreSQL_use_CPU_resources.3F |title=FAQ \u2013 PostgreSQL wiki |website=wiki.postgresql.org |language=en |access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nPostgreSQL manages its internal security on a per-[[Role-oriented programming|role]] basis. A role is generally regarded to be a user (a role that can log in), or a group (a role of which other roles are members). Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level, and can also allow/prevent the creation of new objects at the database, schema or table levels.\n\nPostgreSQL's SECURITY LABEL feature (extension to SQL standards), allows for additional security; with a bundled loadable module that supports label-based [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) based on [[Security-Enhanced Linux]] (SELinux) security policy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SEPostgreSQL_Documentation |title=SEPostgreSQL Documentation \u2013 PostgreSQL wiki |website=wiki.postgresql.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://selinuxproject.org/page/NB_SQL_9.3 |title=NB SQL 9.3 - SELinux Wiki |website=selinuxproject.org}}</ref><!--through the use of \"sepgsql extension\"; provided in all supported versions; in \"contrib\"<ref>https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sepgsql.html</ref>).-->\n\nPostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms, including:\n\n* Password: either [[Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism|SCRAM-SHA-256]] (since PostgreSQL 10<ref>{{cite web |title = PostgreSQL 10 Documentation: Appendix E. Release Notes |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.16.3}}</ref>), [[MD5]] or plain-text\n* [[Generic Security Services Application Program Interface]] (GSSAPI)\n* [[Security Support Provider Interface]] (SSPI)\n* [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]\n* [[Ident protocol|ident]] (maps O/S user-name as provided by an ident server to database user-name)\n* Peer (maps local user name to database user name)\n* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP)\n** [[Active Directory]] (AD)\n* [[RADIUS]]\n* Certificate\n* [[Pluggable authentication module]] (PAM)\n\nThe GSSAPI, SSPI, Kerberos, peer, ident and certificate methods can also use a specified \"map\" file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user.\n\nThese methods are specified in the cluster's host-based authentication configuration file (<kbd>pg_hba.conf</kbd>), which determines what connections are allowed. This allows control over which user can connect to which database, where they can connect from (IP address, IP address range, domain socket), which authentication system will be enforced, and whether the connection must use [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS).\n\n== Standards compliance ==\nPostgreSQL claims high, but not complete, conformance with the SQL standard. One exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names. In PostgreSQL they are folded \u2013 internal \u2013 to lower case characters<ref name=\"identifiers\"/> whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case. Thus, {{code|Foo}} should be equivalent to {{code|FOO}} not {{code|foo}} according to the standard.\n\n== Benchmarks and performance ==\nMany informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done.<ref name=\"Berkus\" /> Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version 8.1. Simple benchmarks between version 8.0 and version 8.4 showed that the latter was more than 10 times faster on read-only workloads and at least 7.5 times faster on both read and write workloads.<ref name=\"Vilmos\" />\n\nThe first industry-standard and peer-validated benchmark was completed in June 2007, using the Sun Java System Application Server (proprietary version of [[GlassFish]]) 9.0 Platform Edition, [[UltraSPARC T1]]-based [[Sun Fire]] server and PostgreSQL 8.2.<ref name=\"SPECJ\" /> This result of 778.14 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard compares favourably with the 874 JOPS@Standard with Oracle 10 on an [[Itanium]]-based [[HP-UX]] system.<ref name=\"Berkus\" />\n\nIn August 2007, Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 813.73 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard. With the [[system under test]] at a reduced price, the price/performance improved from $84.98/JOPS to $70.57/JOPS.<ref name=\"SPECjAppServer2004\" />\n\nThe default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance-critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting. This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of [[shared memory]].<ref name=\"Kernel Resources\" /> PostgreSQL.org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a [[wiki]].<ref name=\"pg9hiperf\" />\n\nIn April 2012, Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL 9.2's linear CPU scalability using a server with 64 cores.<ref name=\"Haas\" />\n\nMatloob Khushi performed benchmarking between Postgresql 9.0 and MySQL 5.6.15 for their ability to process genomic data. In his performance analysis he found that PostgreSQL extracts overlapping genomic regions eight times faster than MySQL using two datasets of 80,000 each forming random human DNA regions. Insertion and data uploads in PostgreSQL were also better, although general searching ability of both databases was almost equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Matloob |last=Khushi |pmid=25560631 |title=Benchmarking database performance for genomic data |journal=J Cell Biochem |date=June 2015 |volume=116 |issue=6 |doi=10.1002/jcb.25049 |pages=877\u201383}}</ref>\n\n== Platforms ==\nPostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems: [[Linux]] (all recent distributions), 64-bit installers available for [[macOS]] (OS X)<ref name=\"OS X\" /> version 10.6 and newer{{snd}} [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (with installers available for 64-bit version; tested on latest versions and back to [[Windows 2012 R2]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/|title=PostgreSQL: Windows installers|website=www.postgresql.org|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> while for PostgreSQL version 10 and older a 32-bit installer is available and tested down to 32-bit [[Windows 2008]] R1; compilable by e.g. [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]], version 2013 up up to most recent 2019 version){{snd}} [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]],<ref name=openbsd>{{cite web |url=http://ports.su/databases/postgresql,-main |title=postgresql-client-10.5p1 \u2013 PostgreSQL RDBMS (client) |work=[[OpenBSD ports]] |date=October 4, 2018 |access-date=October 10, 2018}}</ref> [[NetBSD]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[UnixWare]]; and not officially tested: [[DragonFly BSD]], [[BSD/OS]], [[IRIX]], [[OpenIndiana]],<ref name=\"OpenIndiana\" /> [[OpenSolaris]], [[OpenServer]]<!--formerly SCO UNIX [..] now owned by Xinuos-->, and [[Tru64 UNIX]].

Beyond these, it is possible to build PostgreSQL for an unsupported CPU by disabling [[spinlock]]s.<ref name=\"SupportedPlatforms\" />\n\n== Database administration ==\n{{See also|Comparison of database tools}}\n\nOpen source front-ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include:\n\n; {{anchor|psql}}psql: The primary [[Front and back ends|front-end]] for PostgreSQL is the {{code|psql}} [[command-line program]], which can be used to enter SQL queries directly, or execute them from a file. In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks; for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax.\n; {{anchor|pgAdmin}}pgAdmin: The pgAdmin package is a free and open-source [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) administration tool for PostgreSQL, which is supported on many computer platforms.<ref name=\"pgAdmin\" /> The program is available in more than a dozen languages. The first prototype, named pgManager, was written for PostgreSQL 6.3.2 from 1998, and rewritten and released as pgAdmin under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in later months. The second incarnation (named pgAdmin II) was a complete rewrite, first released on January 16, 2002. The third version, pgAdmin III, was originally released under the [[Artistic License]] and then released under the same license as PostgreSQL. Unlike prior versions that were written in [[Visual Basic]], pgAdmin III is written in C++, using the [[wxWidgets]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://packages.debian.org/jessie/pgadmin3 | title=Debian -- Details of package pgadmin3 in jessie | accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref> framework allowing it to run on most common operating systems. The query tool includes a scripting language called pgScript for supporting admin and development tasks.

'''Postgres''', is a [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[relational database]] [[relational database management system|management system]] (RDBMS) emphasizing [[extensibility]] and [[SQL compliance]]. It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] database developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"design\" /><ref name=\"about/history\" /> In 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for [[SQL]]. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL.<ref name=\"Project name\" />\n\nPostgreSQL features [[Transaction processing|transactions]] with [[ACID (computer science)|Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability]] (ACID) properties, automatically updatable [[View (SQL)|view]]s, [[materialized view]]s, [[Database trigger|triggers]], [[foreign key]]s, and [[stored procedure]]s.<ref name=\"intro-whatis\" /> It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to [[data warehouse]]s or [[Web services]] with many [[concurrent user]]s. It is the default database for [[macOS Server]],<ref name=\"OS X Lion Server\" /><ref name=\"MySQL not included\" /><ref name=\"OS X\" /> and is also available for [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\n\n== History ==\nPostgreSQL evolved from the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, [[Michael Stonebraker]], left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.<ref name=\"design\" /> He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the [[Turing Award]] in 2014 for these and other projects,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/stonebraker_1172121.cfm |title=Michael Stonebraker \u2013 A.M. Turing Award Winner |quote=Techniques pioneered in Postgres were widely implemented [..] Stonebraker is the only Turing award winner to have engaged in serial entrepreneurship on anything like this scale, giving him a distinctive perspective on the academic world. |website=amturing.acm.org |language=en |access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref> and techniques pioneered in them.\n\nThe new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support [[data type]]s.<ref name=\"Stonebraker\" /> These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships \u2013 something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using ''rules''. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.<ref name=\"pavel-history\" />\n\nStarting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM [[SIGMOD]] Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers<ref> A Brief History of PostgreSQL [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/history.html \"Version 3 appeared in 1991 and added support for multiple storage managers, an improved query executor, and a rewritten rule system.\"]. ''postgresql.org''. ''The PostgreSQL Global Development Group'', Retrieved on 18 March 2020.</ref> and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2<ref name=\"University POSTGRES\" /> on June 30, 1994 \u2013 primarily a cleanup \u2013 the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an [[MIT License]] variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced [[QUEL query languages|POSTQUEL query language]] interpreter, which could be interactively used with a [[console application]] named <kbd>''monitor''</kbd>. <!-- See http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres-v4r2/postgres-setup.ps -->\n\nIn 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. <kbd>''monitor''</kbd> was also replaced by <kbd>psql</kbd>. Yu and Chen announced the first version (0.01) to [[beta tester]]s on May 5, 1995.<!-- email lists are not citable, however see message 3165 of |url=http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres-v4r2/mail-archive/1995.05.tar.gz |title=Announcement: Postgres95 Beta |author=Andrew K.

Mikheev, work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley.\n\nIn 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. The online presence at the website PostgreSQL.org began on October 22, 1996.<ref name=\"20th anniversary\" /> The first PostgreSQL release formed version 6.0 on January 29, 1997. Since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as The PostgreSQL Global Development Group.<ref name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThe project continues to make releases available under its [[free and open-source software]] PostgreSQL License. Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors, support companies, and open-source programmers.\n\n== Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) ==\nPostgreSQL manages [[concurrency control|concurrency]] through [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC), which gives each transaction a \"snapshot\" of the database, allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions. This largely eliminates the need for read locks, and ensures the database maintains [[ACID (computer science)|ACID]] principles. PostgreSQL offers three levels of [[isolation (database systems)|transaction isolation]]: Read Committed, Repeatable Read and Serializable. Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads, requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead. PostgreSQL supports full [[serializability]] via the serializable [[snapshot isolation]] (SSI) method.<ref name=\"ports\" />\n\n== Storage and replication ==\n\n=== Replication ===\nPostgreSQL includes built-in binary replication based on shipping the changes ([[Write-ahead logging|write-ahead logs]] (WAL)) to replica nodes asynchronously, with the ability to run read-only queries against these replicated nodes. This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently. Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master, increasing load.\n\nPostgreSQL includes built-in synchronous replication<ref name=\"H Online\" /> that ensures that, for each write transaction, the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log. Unlike other database systems, the durability of a transaction (whether it is asynchronous or synchronous) can be specified per-database, per-user, per-session or even per-transaction. This can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees, and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby.\n\nStandby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication. The first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server. When this fails, the system fails over to the next in line.\n\nSynchronous [[multi-master replication]] is not included in the PostgreSQL core. Postgres-XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi-master replication.<ref name=\"Postgres-XC\" /> It is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL. A related project is called [[Postgres-XL]]. Postgres-R is yet another [[Fork (software development)|fork]].<ref name=postgres-r /> Bidirectional replication (BDR) is an asynchronous multi-master replication system for PostgreSQL.<ref name=bdr />\n\nTools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier.\n\nSeveral asynchronous trigger-based replication packages are available. These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities, for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate:\n\n* [[Slony-I]]\n* Londiste, part of SkyTools (developed by [[Skype]])\n* Bucardo multi-master replication (developed by [[Backcountry.com]])<ref name=\"Fischer\" />\n* [[SymmetricDS]] multi-master, multi-tier replication\n\n=== Indexes ===\nPostgreSQL includes built-in support for regular [[B-tree]] and [[hash table]] indexes, and four index access methods: generalized search trees ([[GiST]]), generalized [[inverted index]]es (GIN), Space-Partitioned GiST (SP-GiST)<ref name=\"SP-GiST\" /> and [[Block Range Index]]es (BRIN). In addition, user-defined index methods can be created, although this is quite an involved process. Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features:\n\n* [[Expression index]]es can be created with an index of the result of an expression or function, instead of simply the value of a column.\n* [[Partial index]]es, which only index part of a table, can be created by adding a WHERE clause to the end of the CREATE INDEX statement. This allows a smaller index to be created.\n* The planner is able to use multiple indexes together to satisfy complex queries, using temporary in-memory [[bitmap index]] operations (useful for [[data warehouse]] applications for joining a large [[fact table]] to smaller [[dimension table]]s such as those arranged in a [[star schema]]).\n* [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbors]] (''k''-NN) indexing (also referred to KNN-GiST<ref name=\"KNN-GiST\" />) provides efficient searching of \"closest values\" to that specified, useful to finding similar words, or close objects or locations with [[Geographic data and information|geospatial]] data. This is achieved without exhaustive matching of values.\n* Index-only scans often allow the system to fetch data from indexes without ever having to access the main table.\n* PostgreSQL 9.5 introduced [[Block Range Index]]es (BRIN).\n\n=== Schemas ===\nIn PostgreSQL, a [[Database schema|schema]] holds all objects, except for roles and tablespaces. Schemas effectively act like namespaces, allowing objects of the same name to co-exist in the same database. By default, newly created databases have a schema called ''public'', but any further schemas can be added, and the public schema isn't mandatory.\n\nA {{code|search_path}} setting determines the order in which PostgreSQL checks schemas for unqualified objects (those without a prefixed schema). By default, it is set to {{code|$user, public}} ({{code|$user}} refers to the currently connected database user). This default can be set on a database or role level, but as it is a session parameter, it can be freely changed (even multiple times) during a client session, affecting that session only.\n\nNon-existent schemas listed in search_path are silently skipped during objects lookup.\n\nNew objects are created in whichever valid schema (one that presently exists) appears first in the search_path.Schema is an outline of database.\n\n=== Data types ===\nA wide variety of native [[data type]]s are supported, including:\n\n* Boolean\n* [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|Arbitrary precision]] numerics\n* Character (text, varchar, char)\n* Binary\n* Date/time (timestamp/time with/without timezone, date, interval)\n* Money\n* Enum\n* Bit strings\n* Text search type\n* Composite\n* HStore, an extension enabled key-value store within PostgreSQL<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/postgresql-nosql-database |title=PostgreSQL, the NoSQL Database &#124; Linux Journal |website=www.linuxjournal.com}}</ref> \n* Arrays (variable length and can be of any data type, including text and composite types) up to 1&nbsp;GB in total storage size\n* Geometric primitives\n* [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] addresses\n* [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) blocks and [[MAC address]]es\n* [[XML]] supporting [[XPath]] queries\n* [[Universally unique identifier]] (UUID)\n* JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]), and a faster [[Binary code|binary]] JSONB (since version 9.4; not the same as [[BSON]]<ref name=\"jsonb\" />)\n\nIn addition, users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL's indexing infrastructures \u2013 GiST, GIN, SP-GiST. Examples of these include the [[geographic information system]] (GIS) data types from the [[PostGIS]] project for PostgreSQL.\n\nThere is also a data type called a ''domain'', which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain. This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain.\n\nA data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types. These can be discrete ranges (e.g. all integer values 1 to 10) or continuous ranges (e.g., any time between 10:00 am and 11:00 am). The built-in range types available include ranges of integers, big integers, decimal numbers, time stamps (with and without time zone) and dates.\n\nCustom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available, such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base, or float ranges using the float data type as a base. Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the {{kbd|[}}/{{kbd|]}} and {{kbd|(}}/{{kbd|)}} characters respectively. (e.g., {{code|[4,9)}} represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9.) Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap, containment, right of etc.\n\n=== User-defined objects ===\nNew types of almost all objects inside the database can be created, including:\n\n* Casts\n* Conversions\n* Data types\n* [[Data domain]]s\n* Functions, including aggregate functions and window functions\n* Indexes including custom indexes for custom types\n* Operators (existing ones can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]])\n* Procedural languages\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nTables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a ''parent'' table. Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables, unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword, i.e. {{code|lang=\"sql\" | SELECT * FROM ONLY parent_table;}}. Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table.\n\nInheritance can be used to implement table partitioning, using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, this feature is not fully supported yet \u2013 in particular, table constraints are not currently inheritable. All check constraints and not-null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children. Other types of constraints (unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints) are not inherited.\n\nInheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in [[Entity\u2013relationship model|entity relationship diagrams]] (ERDs) directly into the PostgreSQL database.\n\n=== Other storage features ===\n* [[Referential integrity]] constraints including [[foreign key]] constraints, column [[Constraint satisfaction |constraints]], and row checks\n* Binary and textual large-object storage\n* [[Tablespace]]s\n* Per-column collation\n* Online backup\n* Point-in-time recovery, implemented using write-ahead logging\n* In-place upgrades with pg_upgrade for less downtime (supports upgrades from 8.3.x and later)\n\n== Control and connectivity ==\n\n=== Foreign data wrappers ===\nPostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers (FDWs).<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Obe\n |first=Regina\n |last2=Hsu\n |first2=Leo S.\n |chapter=10: Replication and External Data\n |title=PostgreSQL: Up and Running\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8jkIZkMTPcC\n |edition=1\n |location=Sebastopol, CA\n |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly Media, Inc.]]\n |date=2012\n |page=129\n |isbn=978-1-4493-2633-3\n |access-date=October 17, 2016\n |quote=Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) [...] are mechanisms of querying external datasources. PostgreSQL 9.1 introduced this [[SQL/MED]] standards compliant feature.\n}}</ref>\nThese can take the form of any data source, such as a file system, another [[relational database]] management system (RDBMS), or a web service. This means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables, and even join multiple data-sources together.\n\n=== Interfaces ===\nFor connecting to applications, PostgreSQL includes the built-in interfaces libpq (the official C application interface) and [[ECPG]] (an embedded C system). Third-party libraries for connecting to PostgreSQL are available for many [[programming language]]s, including [[C++]],<ref>{{cite web|title=libpqxx|url=http://pqxx.org/development/libpqxx/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web|title=PostgreSQL JDBC Driver|url=https://jdbc.postgresql.org/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]],<ref name=\"psycopg2\" /> [[Node.js]],<ref>{{cite web|title=node-postgres|url=https://node-postgres.com/|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Go (programming language)|Go]],<ref>{{cite web |title=SQL database drivers |url=https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers#drivers |website=Go wiki |publisher=golang.org |access-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref> and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rust-Postgres|url=https://crates.io/crates/postgres|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Procedural languages ===\nProcedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom [[subroutine]]s (functions), often called ''[[stored procedure]]s''. These functions can be used to build [[database trigger]]s (functions invoked on modification of certain data) and custom data types and [[aggregate function]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-programming.html|title=Server Programming|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref> Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function, using a DO command at SQL level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-do.html|title=DO|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref>\n\nLanguages are divided into two groups: Procedures written in ''safe'' languages are [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]] and can be safely created and used by any user. Procedures written in ''unsafe'' languages can only be created by [[superuser]]s, because they allow bypassing a database's security restrictions, but can also access sources external to the database. Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions.\n\nPostgreSQL has built-in support for three procedural languages:\n\n* Plain SQL (safe). Simpler SQL functions can get [[inline expansion|expanded inline]] into the calling (SQL) query, which saves function call overhead and allows the query optimizer to \"see inside\" the function.\n* Procedural Language/PostgreSQL ([[PL/pgSQL]]) (safe), which resembles Oracle's Procedural Language for SQL ([[PL/SQL]]) procedural language and SQL/Persistent Stored Modules ([[SQL/PSM]]).\n* [[C (programming language)|C]] (unsafe), which allows loading one or more custom [[shared library]] into the database. Functions written in C offer the best performance, but bugs in code can crash and potentially corrupt the database. Most built-in functions are written in C.\n\nIn addition, PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions. Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html|title=PL/Python - Python Procedural Language|accessdate=19 May 2019|website=Postgresql documentation}}</ref> and [[Tcl]]. There are external projects to add support for many other languages,<ref>{{cite web |date=March 31, 2016 |title=Procedural Languages |publisher=postgresql.org |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/external-pl.html |access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> including [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]] (PL/V8), [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and others.\n\n=== Triggers ===\nTriggers are events triggered by the action of SQL [[data manipulation language]] (DML) statements. For example, an [[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]] statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid. Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] statements.\n\nTriggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables. Triggers can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table, and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger's WHERE clause. Triggers can be attached to [[View (SQL)|views]] by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.\n\n=== Asynchronous notifications ===\nPostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY, LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands. A session can issue a NOTIFY command, along with the user-specified channel and an optional payload, to mark a particular event occurring. Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command, which can listen to a particular channel. This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed. Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed, and reducing unnecessary overhead. Notifications are fully transactional, in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed. This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back.\n\nMany connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system (including libpq, JDBC, Npgsql, psycopg and node.js) so it can be used by external applications.\n\nPostgreSQL can act as an effective, persistent [[Publish-subscribe pattern|\"pub/sub\" server]] or job server by combining LISTEN with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED<ref name=\"postgres-jobserver\">{{cite web |last1=Chartier |first1=Colin |title=System design hack: Postgres is a great pub/sub & job server |url=https://layerci.com/blog/postgres-is-the-answer/ |website=LayerCI blog |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>, a combination which has existed since PostgreSQL version 9.5<ref name=\"release-9.5\">{{cite web |title=Release 9.5 |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/release-9-5.html |website=postgresql.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ringer-skip-locked\">{{cite web |last1=Ringer |first1=Craig |title=What is SKIP LOCKED for in PostgreSQL 9.5? |url=https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/ |website=2nd Quadrant |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Rules ===\nRules allow the \"query tree\" of an incoming query to be rewritten. \"Query Re-Write Rules\" are attached to a table/class and \"Re-Write\" the incoming DML (select, insert, update, and/or delete) into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it. Query Re-Write occurs after DML statement parsing, but before query planning.\n\n=== Other querying features ===\n* [[Database transaction|Transactions]]\n* [[Full-text search]]\n* Views\n** Materialized views<ref name=\"materialized_views\" />\n** Updateable views<ref name=\"updatable_views\" />\n** Recursive views<ref name=\"recursive_views\" />\n* Inner, outer (full, left and right), and cross [[Join (SQL)|joins]]\n* Sub-[[Select (SQL)|selects]]\n** Correlated sub-queries<ref name=\"Introduction and Concepts\" />\n* [[Regular expression]]s<ref name=\"Bernier\" />\n* [[Hierarchical and recursive queries in SQL#Common table expression|common table expressions]] and writable common table expressions\n* Encrypted connections via [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS); current versions do not use vulnerable SSL, even with that configuration option<ref name=\"POODLE\" />\n* Domains\n* [[Savepoint]]s\n* [[Two-phase commit protocol|Two-phase commit]]\n* The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique (TOAST) is used to transparently store large table attributes (such as big MIME attachments or XML messages) in a separate area, with automatic compression.\n* [[Embedded SQL]] is implemented using preprocessor. SQL code is first written embedded into C code. Then code is run through ECPG preprocessor, which replaces SQL with calls to code library. Then code can be compiled using a C compiler. Embedding works also with [[C++]] but it does not recognize all C++ constructs.\n\n=== Concurrency model ===\nPostgreSQL server is [[Process (computing)|process]]-based (not threaded), and uses one operating system process per database session. Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the operating system. Starting with PostgreSQL 9.6, many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes, taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/689387/ |title=PostgreSQL 9.6 Beta and PGCon 2016 |last=Berkus |first=Josh |date=June 2, 2016 |website=LWN.net}}</ref> Client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/FAQ#How_does_PostgreSQL_use_CPU_resources.3F |title=FAQ \u2013 PostgreSQL wiki |website=wiki.postgresql.org |language=en |access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nPostgreSQL manages its internal security on a per-[[Role-oriented programming|role]] basis. A role is generally regarded to be a user (a role that can log in), or a group (a role of which other roles are members). Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level, and can also allow/prevent the creation of new objects at the database, schema or table levels.\n\nPostgreSQL's SECURITY LABEL feature (extension to SQL standards), allows for additional security; with a bundled loadable module that supports label-based [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) based on [[Security-Enhanced Linux]] (SELinux) security policy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SEPostgreSQL_Documentation |title=SEPostgreSQL Documentation \u2013 PostgreSQL wiki |website=wiki.postgresql.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://selinuxproject.org/page/NB_SQL_9.3 |title=NB SQL 9.3 - SELinux Wiki |website=selinuxproject.org}}</ref><!--through the use of \"sepgsql extension\"; provided in all supported versions; in \"contrib\"<ref>https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sepgsql.html</ref>).-->\n\nPostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms, including:\n\n* Password: either [[Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism|SCRAM-SHA-256]] (since PostgreSQL 10<ref>{{cite web |title = PostgreSQL 10 Documentation: Appendix E. Release Notes |url=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.16.3}}</ref>), [[MD5]] or plain-text\n* [[Generic Security Services Application Program Interface]] (GSSAPI)\n* [[Security Support Provider Interface]] (SSPI)\n* [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]\n* [[Ident protocol|ident]] (maps O/S user-name as provided by an ident server to database user-name)\n* Peer (maps local user name to database user name)\n* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP)\n** [[Active Directory]] (AD)\n* [[RADIUS]]\n* Certificate\n* [[Pluggable authentication module]] (PAM)\n\nThe GSSAPI, SSPI, Kerberos, peer, ident and certificate methods can also use a specified \"map\" file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user.\n\nThese methods are specified in the cluster's host-based authentication configuration file (<kbd>pg_hba.conf</kbd>), which determines what connections are allowed. This allows control over which user can connect to which database, where they can connect from (IP address, IP address range, domain socket), which authentication system will be enforced, and whether the connection must use [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS).\n\n== Standards compliance ==\nPostgreSQL claims high, but not complete, conformance with the SQL standard. One exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names. In PostgreSQL they are folded \u2013 internal \u2013 to lower case characters<ref name=\"identifiers\"/> whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case. Thus, {{code|Foo}} should be equivalent to {{code|FOO}} not {{code|foo}} according to the standard.\n\n== Benchmarks and performance ==\nMany informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done.<ref name=\"Berkus\" /> Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version 8.1. Simple benchmarks between version 8.0 and version 8.4 showed that the latter was more than 10 times faster on read-only workloads and at least 7.5 times faster on both read and write workloads.<ref name=\"Vilmos\" />\n\nThe first industry-standard and peer-validated benchmark was completed in June 2007, using the Sun Java System Application Server (proprietary version of [[GlassFish]]) 9.0 Platform Edition, [[UltraSPARC T1]]-based [[Sun Fire]] server and PostgreSQL 8.2.<ref name=\"SPECJ\" /> This result of 778.14 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard compares favourably with the 874 JOPS@Standard with Oracle 10 on an [[Itanium]]-based [[HP-UX]] system.<ref name=\"Berkus\" />\n\nIn August 2007, Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 813.73 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard. With the [[system under test]] at a reduced price, the price/performance improved from $84.98/JOPS to $70.57/JOPS.<ref name=\"SPECjAppServer2004\" />\n\nThe default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance-critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting. This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of [[shared memory]].<ref name=\"Kernel Resources\" /> PostgreSQL.org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a [[wiki]].<ref name=\"pg9hiperf\" />\n\nIn April 2012, Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL 9.2's linear CPU scalability using a server with 64 cores.<ref name=\"Haas\" />\n\nMatloob Khushi performed benchmarking between Postgresql 9.0 and MySQL 5.6.15 for their ability to process genomic data. In his performance analysis he found that PostgreSQL extracts overlapping genomic regions eight times faster than MySQL using two datasets of 80,000 each forming random human DNA regions. Insertion and data uploads in PostgreSQL were also better, although general searching ability of both databases was almost equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Matloob |last=Khushi |pmid=25560631 |title=Benchmarking database performance for genomic data |journal=J Cell Biochem |date=June 2015 |volume=116 |issue=6 |doi=10.1002/jcb.25049 |pages=877\u201383}}</ref>\n\n== Platforms ==\nPostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems: [[Linux]] (all recent distributions), 64-bit installers available for [[macOS]] (OS X)<ref name=\"OS X\" /> version 10.6 and newer{{snd}} [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (with installers available for 64-bit version; tested on latest versions and back to [[Windows 2012 R2]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/|title=PostgreSQL: Windows installers|website=www.postgresql.org|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> while for PostgreSQL version 10 and older a 32-bit installer is available and tested down to 32-bit [[Windows 2008]] R1; compilable by e.g. [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]], version 2013 up up to most recent 2019 version){{snd}} [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]],<ref name=openbsd>{{cite web |url=http://ports.su/databases/postgresql,-main |title=postgresql-client-10.5p1 \u2013 PostgreSQL RDBMS (client) |work=[[OpenBSD ports]] |date=October 4, 2018 |access-date=October 10, 2018}}</ref> [[NetBSD]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[UnixWare]]; and not officially tested: [[DragonFly BSD]], [[BSD/OS]], [[IRIX]], [[OpenIndiana]],<ref name=\"OpenIndiana\" /> [[OpenSolaris]], [[OpenServer]]<!--formerly SCO UNIX [..] now owned by Xinuos-->, and [[Tru64 UNIX]].

Beyond these, it is possible to build PostgreSQL for an unsupported CPU by disabling [[spinlock]]s.<ref name=\"SupportedPlatforms\" />\n\n== Database administration ==\n{{See also|Comparison of database tools}}\n\nOpen source front-ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include:\n\n; {{anchor|psql}}psql: The primary [[Front and back ends|front-end]] for PostgreSQL is the {{code|psql}} [[command-line program]], which can be used to enter SQL queries directly, or execute them from a file. In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks; for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax.\n; {{anchor|pgAdmin}}pgAdmin: The pgAdmin package is a free and open-source [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) administration tool for PostgreSQL, which is supported on many computer platforms.<ref name=\"pgAdmin\" /> The program is available in more than a dozen languages. The first prototype, named pgManager, was written for PostgreSQL 6.3.2 from 1998, and rewritten and released as pgAdmin under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in later months. The second incarnation (named pgAdmin II) was a complete rewrite, first released on January 16, 2002. The third version, pgAdmin III, was originally released under the [[Artistic License]] and then released under the same license as PostgreSQL. Unlike prior versions that were written in [[Visual Basic]], pgAdmin III is written in C++, using the [[wxWidgets]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://packages.debian.org/jessie/pgadmin3 | title=Debian -- Details of package pgadmin3 in jessie | accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref> framework allowing it to run on most common operating systems.

They were the production destroyer of the US Navy when it entered [[World War II]].\n\nThe ''Gleaves'' class were initially specified as part of a 24-ship {{sclass-|Benson|destroyer|4}} authorized in [[fiscal year]]s 1938\u201340; however, [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding]] requested that the six ships designed by them use less complex machinery. Initially, ''Gleaves'' and {{USS|Niblack|DD-424|2}}, although designed by Gibbs & Cox and built by [[Bath Iron Works]], were to follow the ''Benson'' design. This temporarily made {{USS|Livermore|DD-429|2}} the lead ship with more complex machinery, so the class was initially called the ''Livermore'' class, and this name persisted through [[World War II]]. However, it soon proved possible for ''Gleaves'' and ''Niblack'' to be built to the ''Livermore'' design.<ref name=Friedman1/> Since ''Gleaves'' was completed before ''Livermore'' and had a lower hull number, the class is more correctly the ''Gleaves'' class. Eighteen of these were commissioned in 1940\u201341.<ref name=Register1>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 188\u2013191</ref> The remaining 48 \u201crepeat ''Gleaves''es\u201d were authorized in 1940\u201342. These plus the 16 \"repeat ''Benson''s\" were also known at the time as the ''Bristol'' class, after {{USS|Bristol|DD-453|6}}. During World War II the ''Benson''s were usually combined with the ''Livermore''s (more correctly the ''Gleaves'' class) as the ''Benson''-''Livermore'' class; this persisted in references until at least the 1960s.<ref name=\"Silverstone, pp. 126-135\">Silverstone, pp. 126\u2013135</ref> The classes are now called the ''Benson-Gleaves'' class.<ref name=BensonGleaves>[http://destroyerhistory.org/benson-gleavesclass/ ''Benson-Gleaves'' classes at DestroyerHistory.org]</ref> In some references both classes are combined and called the ''Benson'' class.<ref name=Friedman1/> The ''Benson''- and ''Gleaves''-class destroyers were the backbone of the pre-war [[Neutrality Patrol]]s and brought the action to the enemy by participating in every major naval campaign of the war.\n\n==Related classes==\nThe ''Benson''s were originally envisioned as a single class of 24 ships, the first eight of which were ordered in [[fiscal year]] 1938 (FY38). Six of these were designed by Bethlehem Shipbuilding, to be built at a Bethlehem yard and several naval shipyards, and two were designed by [[Gibbs & Cox]], to be built at [[Bath Iron Works]]. All were to have {{convert|600|psi|abbr=on}} steam (references vary) [[superheated steam|superheated]] to {{convert|750|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, with cruising turbines and double-reduction [[gear]]ing to maximize fuel efficiency.<ref name=Friedman1/> After contract award, Bethlehem requested that their design be modified to use less-complex single-reduction gears and no cruising turbines. Bethlehem claimed they could achieve comparable fuel efficiency with the simpler machinery. This request was granted, but FY39 and FY40 ships, beginning with ''Livermore'', would use the more complex machinery.<ref name=\"Register1\"/> So the class was known through World War II as the ''Benson''-''Livermore'' class, and this name persisted in many references until at least the 1960s.<ref name=\"Silverstone, pp. 126-135\"/> In the spring of 1938 the Navy's [[Bureau of Steam Engineering]] requested that the FY39 and FY40 ships be modified for {{convert|850|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} superheat.<ref name=Friedman1/> It proved possible for Bath to build their two FY38 ships, ''Gleaves'' and ''Niblack'', to the new design. ''Gleaves'' was completed prior to ''Livermore'' and had a lower hull number, thus the class name is more correctly the ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class.<ref name=Register1/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080118153104/http://www.destroyers.org/DD-Histories/DD-Classes/Intro-DD423.htm Archived notes on ''Gleaves'' class at Destroyers.org]</ref>\n\nAn external difference between the ''Benson'' and ''Gleaves'' classes was the shape of the stacks; the ''Benson''s' were flat-sided and the ''Gleaves'' were round. The ''Gleaves''-class [[porthole]]s on the [[forecastle]] were omitted in the ''Benson''-class.<ref name=jkp>{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Jackson K. |authorlink = |year=1986 |title=the Life of a Machinist's Mate |journal=Proceedings |volume=112 |issue=5 |pages=174\u2013176 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Fall of France]] in 1940 a rapid expansion of the Navy was envisioned. To fill the gap until the [[Fletcher-class destroyer|''Fletcher''-class destroyers]] would be ready for service, an additional 72 \"repeat\" ''Benson''- and ''Gleaves''-class ships were ordered in FY41 and FY42. 24 repeat ''Benson''s were built by several Bethlehem yards, while an additional 48 repeat ''Gleaves'' were built by various other builders.<ref name=Register1/> These were initially called the ''Bristol'' class after ''Bristol'', a repeat ''Gleaves'' and the first of these to be completed, although the machinery of the repeat ''Benson''s was different from the repeat ''Gleaves''es. The repeat ships were ordered with reduced torpedo and gun armament and increased [[anti-submarine]] and light [[anti-aircraft]] armament.<ref name=Conway1>Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 128\u2013129</ref>\n\nIn some references the ''Benson'' and ''Gleaves'' classes are combined as the ''Benson'' class.<ref name=Friedman1/>\n\n==Design==\nThe ''Gleaves'' class was designed as an improved version of the {{sclass-|Sims|destroyer|4}} with two stacks and a new \"echeloned\" machinery arrangement that featured alternating boiler and engine rooms, designed to give the ships a better chance at surviving torpedo damage. Loss of one compartment, or even two adjacent compartments, would no longer disable the entire propulsion system. This design was credited with the survival of {{USS|Kearny|DD-432|6}} after she was torpedoed by the {{ship|German submarine|U-568||2|up=yes}} near [[Iceland]] in October 1941, before the US entered the war. The ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class also introduced quintuple [[torpedo tube]] mounts. Their scantlings, or framing dimensions, were increased to carry the weight of the new machinery. This increased the ships' displacement by about seventy tons, to 1630 tons [[standard displacement]].<ref name=Friedman1/><ref name=Conway1/> Twenty ships (DD-493\u2013497, 618\u2013628, and 645\u2013648) had square-faced bridges in an attempt to speed production.<ref name=Register1/>\n\n===Engineering===\nThe ''Gleaves'' class were all completed with {{convert|600|psi|abbr=on}} steam (references vary) [[superheated steam|superheated]] to {{convert|850|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, double-reduction gearing, and cruising turbines.<ref name=Register1/> The main [[steam turbine]]s were designed and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]].<ref name=Friedman1/><ref name=Conway1/><ref>[http://destroyerhistory.org/assets/pdf/generalinformationbooks/423Gleaves_GIBook.pdf USS ''Gleaves'' (DD-423) and USS ''Niblack'' (DD-424) General Information Book with as-built data] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219202357/http://destroyerhistory.org/ |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Armament===\nThe class was completed with four or five {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[dual purpose gun]]s (anti-surface and [[anti-aircraft]] (AA)), controlled by a [[Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System]] as in the previous ''Sims'' class. The introduction of two centerline quintuple torpedo tube mounts in the ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class was a significant improvement and was continued in subsequent [[World War II]] classes. This allowed a broadside of ten tubes with savings in space and weight compared to previous classes, which had twelve or sixteen tubes and an eight-tube broadside.<ref name=Friedman1/> However, most of the ''Gleaves'' class spent most of the war with only five torpedo tubes equipped in favor of greater light [[anti-aircraft]] armament. This varied considerably in different ships as the war went on; for example, the specified pair of twin {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns were not widely available until mid-1942 and a quadruple [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} machine cannon]] mount and a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun were temporarily substituted.<ref name=Conway1/> In 1945 sixteen ships (DD-423, 424, 429\u2013432, 435, 437\u2013440, 443, 497, 623, 624, and 628) were modified for maximum light AA armament as an anti-''[[kamikaze]]'' measure, with four 5-inch guns, no torpedo tubes, twelve 40&nbsp;mm guns in two quad and two twin mounts and four 20&nbsp;mm guns in two twin mountings.<ref>Friedman, p. 107</ref><ref name=Register1/> Photographs indicate that, as with most pre-1942 destroyers, the initial [[anti-submarine]] armament of two [[depth charge]] tracks was augmented with four or six [[K-gun]] depth charge throwers in 1941\u201342 on most ships.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05idx.htm NavSource Destroyer Photo Index Page]</ref> In 1943 twelve ships (DD-493, 609, 620, 622, 623, 635, 637\u2013639, and 646\u2013648) were temporarily equipped with three [[Mousetrap (weapon)|Mousetrap]] ASW rocket launchers, but this was unsuccessful and the only such installation on post-1930 US destroyers. They were removed beginning in March 1944.<ref name=Conway1/><ref>Friedman, pp. 194\u2013195</ref>\n\n===Habitability===\n[[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief petty officers]] had quarters in the forecastle. All other enlisted sailors had a bunk in large open living [[compartment (ship)|compartments]] astern of the engineering spaces. Beneath each tier of bunks were individual lockers with a wooden grate floor. As seawater entered the compartment during rough weather, the wooden grate was intended to lift the locker contents above the deck and allow the seawater to drain out as it sloshed over the deck when the ship rolled. No laundry was included in the original design, but a single washing machine was later installed in a compartment the size of a closet. Clothing could be washed and spun damp to be hung to dry wherever space allowed.<ref name=jkp/>\n\n===DMS conversions===\nTwenty-four ''Gleaves''-class ships were converted to [[destroyer minesweeper]]s (DMS-19 through DMS-42) in 1944 and 1945.<ref name=Conway1/><ref name=\"Friedman, pp. 108-109\">Friedman, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> Twelve Atlantic Fleet ships (DD-454\u2013458, 461, 462, 464, 621, 625, 636, and 637) were converted in 1944, with the rest in the Pacific in 1945 (DD-489, 490, 493\u2013496, 618, 627, and 632\u2013635). Magnetic and acoustic [[minesweeping]] gear was fitted, with armament reduced to three 5 in guns, no torpedo tubes, two K-guns, four 40&nbsp;mm guns in two twin mounts, and seven 20&nbsp;mm guns on the Atlantic ships. The Pacific ships and ''Hobson'' had increased light AA armament, with eight 40&nbsp;mm guns in two quad mounts and six 20&nbsp;mm guns in two twin and two single mounts. Twelve DMS conversions were the only ''Benson''-''Gleaves''-class ships retained in service postwar. However, they were judged ineffective in the [[Korean War]] due to requiring a large crew compared with purpose-built [[minesweeper]]s, and were decommissioned in 1954\u201356.<ref name=\"Friedman, pp. 108-109\"/>\n\n==Service==\nTwenty-one were in commission when the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]]. Eleven were lost to enemy action during World War II, including ''Gwin'', ''Meredith'', ''Monssen'', ''Bristol'', ''Emmons'', ''Aaron Ward'', ''Duncan'', ''Beatty'', ''Glennon'', ''Corry'', and ''Maddox''. Six of these were in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], two were off [[D-Day|Normandy]], and three were in the [[Mediterranean]]. ''Ingraham'' was lost in a collision with an [[tanker (ship)|oiler]] in 1942, and ''Turner'' was lost to an internal explosion in 1944.\n\nMost were decommissioned and placed in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Reserve Fleet]] just following World War II. Twelve DMS conversions remained in commission into the 1950s, the last withdrawn from service in 1956.<ref name=\"Register1\"/> ''Hobson'' was sunk in a collision with the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|2}} in 1952. ''Baldwin'' grounded while under tow and was [[Scuttling|scuttled]] in 1961 while out of commission, thus is not counted as a loss.\n\nEleven ships of the class were transferred to foreign navies 1949\u20131959; two to Greece, four to Turkey, one to Italy, two to Taiwan, and two to Japan.<ref>Gardiner & Chumbley, pp. 160, 206, 222, 455, 469</ref> On 19 October 1954 {{USS|Ellyson|DD-454|2}} and {{USS|Macomb|DD-458|2}} were transferred to the [[Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force]] where they served as JDS ''Asakaze'' and JDS ''Hatakaze'', the latter was further transferred to Taiwan in 1970 as ''Hsien Yang'' to replace the ex-''Rodman'' of the same name.<ref>Gardiner & Chumbley, p. 222</ref>\n\nModernization was considered in the 1950s but not implemented except on the transferred ships.<ref>Friedman, pp. 107\u2013108</ref> Those ships not transferred to other countries were mostly sold for scrap in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=Register1/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ships in

They were the production destroyer of the US Navy when it entered [[World War II]].\n\nThe ''Gleaves'' class were initially specified as part of a 24-ship {{sclass-|Benson|destroyer|4}} authorized in [[fiscal year]]s 1938\u201340; however, [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding]] requested that the six ships designed by them use less complex machinery. Initially, ''Gleaves'' and {{USS|Niblack|DD-424|2}}, although designed by Gibbs & Cox and built by [[Bath Iron Works]], were to follow the ''Benson'' design. This temporarily made {{USS|Livermore|DD-429|2}} the lead ship with more complex machinery, so the class was initially called the ''Livermore'' class, and this name persisted through [[World War II]]. However, it soon proved possible for ''Gleaves'' and ''Niblack'' to be built to the ''Livermore'' design.<ref name=Friedman1/> Since ''Gleaves'' was completed before ''Livermore'' and had a lower hull number, the class is more correctly the ''Gleaves'' class. Eighteen of these were commissioned in 1940\u201341.<ref name=Register1>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 188\u2013191</ref> The remaining 48 \u201crepeat ''Gleaves''es\u201d were authorized in 1940\u201342. These plus the 16 \"repeat ''Benson''s\" were also known at the time as the ''Bristol'' class, after {{USS|Bristol|DD-453|6}}. During World War II the ''Benson''s were usually combined with the ''Livermore''s (more correctly the ''Gleaves'' class) as the ''Benson''-''Livermore'' class; this persisted in references until at least the 1960s.<ref name=\"Silverstone, pp. 126-135\">Silverstone, pp. 126\u2013135</ref> The classes are now called the ''Benson-Gleaves'' class.<ref name=BensonGleaves>[http://destroyerhistory.org/benson-gleavesclass/ ''Benson-Gleaves'' classes at DestroyerHistory.org]</ref> In some references both classes are combined and called the ''Benson'' class.<ref name=Friedman1/> The ''Benson''- and ''Gleaves''-class destroyers were the backbone of the pre-war [[Neutrality Patrol]]s and brought the action to the enemy by participating in every major naval campaign of the war.\n\n==Related classes==\nThe ''Benson''s were originally envisioned as a single class of 24 ships, the first eight of which were ordered in [[fiscal year]] 1938 (FY38). Six of these were designed by Bethlehem Shipbuilding, to be built at a Bethlehem yard and several naval shipyards, and two were designed by [[Gibbs & Cox]], to be built at [[Bath Iron Works]]. All were to have {{convert|600|psi|abbr=on}} steam (references vary) [[superheated steam|superheated]] to {{convert|750|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, with cruising turbines and double-reduction [[gear]]ing to maximize fuel efficiency.<ref name=Friedman1/> After contract award, Bethlehem requested that their design be modified to use less-complex single-reduction gears and no cruising turbines. Bethlehem claimed they could achieve comparable fuel efficiency with the simpler machinery. This request was granted, but FY39 and FY40 ships, beginning with ''Livermore'', would use the more complex machinery.<ref name=\"Register1\"/> So the class was known through World War II as the ''Benson''-''Livermore'' class, and this name persisted in many references until at least the 1960s.<ref name=\"Silverstone, pp. 126-135\"/> In the spring of 1938 the Navy's [[Bureau of Steam Engineering]] requested that the FY39 and FY40 ships be modified for {{convert|850|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} superheat.<ref name=Friedman1/> It proved possible for Bath to build their two FY38 ships, ''Gleaves'' and ''Niblack'', to the new design. ''Gleaves'' was completed prior to ''Livermore'' and had a lower hull number, thus the class name is more correctly the ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class.<ref name=Register1/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080118153104/http://www.destroyers.org/DD-Histories/DD-Classes/Intro-DD423.htm Archived notes on ''Gleaves'' class at Destroyers.org]</ref>\n\nAn external difference between the ''Benson'' and ''Gleaves'' classes was the shape of the stacks; the ''Benson''s' were flat-sided and the ''Gleaves'' were round. The ''Gleaves''-class [[porthole]]s on the [[forecastle]] were omitted in the ''Benson''-class.<ref name=jkp>{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Jackson K. |authorlink = |year=1986 |title=the Life of a Machinist's Mate |journal=Proceedings |volume=112 |issue=5 |pages=174\u2013176 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Fall of France]] in 1940 a rapid expansion of the Navy was envisioned. To fill the gap until the [[Fletcher-class destroyer|''Fletcher''-class destroyers]] would be ready for service, an additional 72 \"repeat\" ''Benson''- and ''Gleaves''-class ships were ordered in FY41 and FY42. 24 repeat ''Benson''s were built by several Bethlehem yards, while an additional 48 repeat ''Gleaves'' were built by various other builders.<ref name=Register1/> These were initially called the ''Bristol'' class after ''Bristol'', a repeat ''Gleaves'' and the first of these to be completed, although the machinery of the repeat ''Benson''s was different from the repeat ''Gleaves''es. The repeat ships were ordered with reduced torpedo and gun armament and increased [[anti-submarine]] and light [[anti-aircraft]] armament.<ref name=Conway1>Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 128\u2013129</ref>\n\nIn some references the ''Benson'' and ''Gleaves'' classes are combined as the ''Benson'' class.<ref name=Friedman1/>\n\n==Design==\nThe ''Gleaves'' class was designed as an improved version of the {{sclass-|Sims|destroyer|4}} with two stacks and a new \"echeloned\" machinery arrangement that featured alternating boiler and engine rooms, designed to give the ships a better chance at surviving torpedo damage. Loss of one compartment, or even two adjacent compartments, would no longer disable the entire propulsion system. This design was credited with the survival of {{USS|Kearny|DD-432|6}} after she was torpedoed by the {{ship|German submarine|U-568||2|up=yes}} near [[Iceland]] in October 1941, before the US entered the war. The ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class also introduced quintuple [[torpedo tube]] mounts. Their scantlings, or framing dimensions, were increased to carry the weight of the new machinery. This increased the ships' displacement by about seventy tons, to 1630 tons [[standard displacement]].<ref name=Friedman1/><ref name=Conway1/> Twenty ships (DD-493\u2013497, 618\u2013628, and 645\u2013648) had square-faced bridges in an attempt to speed production.<ref name=Register1/>\n\n===Engineering===\nThe ''Gleaves'' class were all completed with {{convert|600|psi|abbr=on}} steam (references vary) [[superheated steam|superheated]] to {{convert|850|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, double-reduction gearing, and cruising turbines.<ref name=Register1/> The main [[steam turbine]]s were designed and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]].<ref name=Friedman1/><ref name=Conway1/><ref>[http://destroyerhistory.org/assets/pdf/generalinformationbooks/423Gleaves_GIBook.pdf USS ''Gleaves'' (DD-423) and USS ''Niblack'' (DD-424) General Information Book with as-built data] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219202357/http://destroyerhistory.org/ |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Armament===\nThe class was completed with four or five {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[dual purpose gun]]s (anti-surface and [[anti-aircraft]] (AA)), controlled by a [[Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System]] as in the previous ''Sims'' class. The introduction of two centerline quintuple torpedo tube mounts in the ''Benson''-''Gleaves'' class was a significant improvement and was continued in subsequent [[World War II]] classes. This allowed a broadside of ten tubes with savings in space and weight compared to previous classes, which had twelve or sixteen tubes and an eight-tube broadside.<ref name=Friedman1/> However, most of the ''Gleaves'' class spent most of the war with only five torpedo tubes equipped in favor of greater light [[anti-aircraft]] armament. This varied considerably in different ships as the war went on; for example, the specified pair of twin {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns were not widely available until mid-1942 and a quadruple [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} machine cannon]] mount and a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun were temporarily substituted.<ref name=Conway1/> In 1945 sixteen ships (DD-423, 424, 429\u2013432, 435, 437\u2013440, 443, 497, 623, 624, and 628) were modified for maximum light AA armament as an anti-''[[kamikaze]]'' measure, with four 5-inch guns, no torpedo tubes, twelve 40&nbsp;mm guns in two quad and two twin mounts and four 20&nbsp;mm guns in two twin mountings.<ref>Friedman, p. 107</ref><ref name=Register1/> Photographs indicate that, as with most pre-1942 destroyers, the initial [[anti-submarine]] armament of two [[depth charge]] tracks was augmented with four or six [[K-gun]] depth charge throwers in 1941\u201342 on most ships.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05idx.htm NavSource Destroyer Photo Index Page]</ref> In 1943 twelve ships (DD-493, 609, 620, 622, 623, 635, 637\u2013639, and 646\u2013648) were temporarily equipped with three [[Mousetrap (weapon)|Mousetrap]] ASW rocket launchers, but this was unsuccessful and the only such installation on post-1930 US destroyers. They were removed beginning in March 1944.<ref name=Conway1/><ref>Friedman, pp. 194\u2013195</ref>\n\n===Habitability===\n[[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief petty officers]] had quarters in the forecastle. All other enlisted sailors had a bunk in large open living [[compartment (ship)|compartments]] astern of the engineering spaces. Beneath each tier of bunks were individual lockers with a wooden grate floor. As seawater entered the compartment during rough weather, the wooden grate was intended to lift the locker contents above the deck and allow the seawater to drain out as it sloshed over the deck when the ship rolled. No laundry was included in the original design, but a single washing machine was later installed in a compartment the size of a closet. Clothing could be washed and spun damp to be hung to dry wherever space allowed.<ref name=jkp/>\n\n===DMS conversions===\nTwenty-four ''Gleaves''-class ships were converted to [[destroyer minesweeper]]s (DMS-19 through DMS-42) in 1944 and 1945.<ref name=Conway1/><ref name=\"Friedman, pp. 108-109\">Friedman, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> Twelve Atlantic Fleet ships (DD-454\u2013458, 461, 462, 464, 621, 625, 636, and 637) were converted in 1944, with the rest in the Pacific in 1945 (DD-489, 490, 493\u2013496, 618, 627, and 632\u2013635). Magnetic and acoustic [[minesweeping]] gear was fitted, with armament reduced to three 5 in guns, no torpedo tubes, two K-guns, four 40&nbsp;mm guns in two twin mounts, and seven 20&nbsp;mm guns on the Atlantic ships. The Pacific ships and ''Hobson'' had increased light AA armament, with eight 40&nbsp;mm guns in two quad mounts and six 20&nbsp;mm guns in two twin and two single mounts. Twelve DMS conversions were the only ''Benson''-''Gleaves''-class ships retained in service postwar. However, they were judged ineffective in the [[Korean War]] due to requiring a large crew compared with purpose-built [[minesweeper]]s, and were decommissioned in 1954\u201356.<ref name=\"Friedman, pp. 108-109\"/>\n\n==Service==\nTwenty-one were in commission when the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]]. Eleven were lost to enemy action during World War II, including ''Gwin'', ''Meredith'', ''Monssen'', ''Bristol'', ''Emmons'', ''Aaron Ward'', ''Duncan'', ''Beatty'', ''Glennon'', ''Corry'', and ''Maddox''. Six of these were in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], two were off [[D-Day|Normandy]], and three were in the [[Mediterranean]]. ''Ingraham'' was lost in a collision with an [[tanker (ship)|oiler]] in 1942, and ''Turner'' was lost to an internal explosion in 1944.\n\nMost were decommissioned and placed in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Reserve Fleet]] just following World War II. Twelve DMS conversions remained in commission into the 1950s, the last withdrawn from service in 1956.<ref name=\"Register1\"/> ''Hobson'' was sunk in a collision with the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|2}} in 1952. ''Baldwin'' grounded while under tow and was [[Scuttling|scuttled]] in 1961 while out of commission, thus is not counted as a loss.\n\nEleven ships of the class were transferred to foreign navies 1949\u20131959; two to Greece, four to Turkey, one to Italy, two to Taiwan, and two to Japan.<ref>Gardiner & Chumbley, pp. 160, 206, 222, 455, 469</ref> On 19 October 1954 {{USS|Ellyson|DD-454|2}} and {{USS|Macomb|DD-458|2}} were transferred to the [[Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force]] where they served as JDS ''Asakaze'' and JDS ''Hatakaze'', the latter was further transferred to Taiwan in 1970 as ''Hsien Yang'' to replace the ex-''Rodman'' of the same name.<ref>Gardiner & Chumbley, p. 222</ref>\n\nModernization was considered in the 1950s but not implemented except on the transferred ships.<ref>Friedman, pp. 107\u2013108</ref> Those ships not transferred to other countries were mostly sold for scrap in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=Register1/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ships in
