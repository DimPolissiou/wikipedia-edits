Even after Kate broke up with him, Zeke and Mo remained close friends, despite their major age difference. Mo\u2019s parents, Reuben and Sherri, allow Mo to continue hanging out with Zeke despite their concern about what kind of influence Zeke is going to be on their young son. Zeke, now 23, is in a relationship with Holly, while Kate has just moved in with her boyfriend Doug. Zeke and Kate briefly continue to have an affair.\n\nNow 16, Mo struggles with the social aspects of high school, spending most of his time with Zeke and his friends rather than anyone his own age. Zeke helps Mo acquire drinks for a party held by some seniors after being invited by fellow sophomore Stacey and gives Mo some weed to sell to the other kids. At the party, Mo earns credibility among the seniors for having brought alcohol and drugs. Mo sees his classmate Sophia, they strike up a conversation and she gives him her number.\n\nMo later takes Sophia out on a dinner date before going back to Zeke\u2019s place to hang out. The boys tape forties to their hands in an effort to make Mo look impressive. Before Sophia leaves, she and Mo kiss. Mo goes back inside to brag to Zeke and Nick about it, earning him the nickname Tongue Daddy. Mo comes home accidentally stoned the next night before a family dinner and after his father finds out Mo is grounded and forbidden from hanging out with Zeke. \n\nMo begins to ignore Sophia, per Zeke's advice on how to get girls, which makes her mad. After realizing his mistake he tries to explain the reason for ignoring her but she refuses to listen and walks out on him. Mo gets a call from Holly and he goes over to her place. Holly tells him that she and Zeke have broken up because he was cheating and takes Mo's virginity to get back at Zeke. \n\nStacey gets into an accident in his car with a few seniors who are smoking and drinking. Not knowing what to do he ditches the car. The next day, a police officer comes to school and tells him he won\u2019t get in trouble if he tells who is supplying him with the drugs they found in the car.\n\nWhen the cops show up at a party looking for Mo, Zeke manages to get him out, evade the police, and bring Mo back to his place where Mo cries about how he has become a degenerate like Zeke, even though he never wanted to be. He also admits to Zeke that he slept with Holly and Zeke forgives him and the two reconcile. Zeke tells Mo that he should blame everything to do with the drugs on him, but Mo declines the offer, saying Zeke has done enough and he needs to handle this on his own. \n\nThe following day, Mo gets expelled from school and is sentenced to community service. Reuben drives to Zeke\u2019s house and orders him to stay away from Mo.\n\n3 months later, Mo attends another high school and only uses his car for completing his community service. Mo stops at a fast-food restaurant one day and is surprised to see Zeke working at the drive-thru window. Mo sits with Zeke and he asks Mo if he wants to hang out the next day and Mo says that maybe they can. But as Mo sits in his car, he texts Zeke to cancel. Zeke can be seen behind Mo\u2019s car, obviously devastated by the news.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Griffin Gluck]] as Monroe \"Mo\" Harris, Kate\u2019s brother and Reuben and Sherri\u2019s son\n* [[Pete Davidson]] as Isaac \"Zeke\" Presanti\n* [[Sydney Sweeney]] as Holly, Zeke's girlfriend \n* [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Colson Baker]] as Nick\n* [[Thomas Barbusca]] as Jon (Stacey) Epstein\n* Emily Arlook as Kate Harris, Mo\u2019s sister and Reuben and Sherri\u2019s daughter\n* [[Oona Laurence]] as Sophie\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Reuben Harris, Mo and Kate\u2019s father and Sherri\u2019s husband\n* [[Julia Murney]] as Sherri Harris, Mo and Kate\u2019s mother and Reuben\u2019s wife\n* Nick Ziobro as Chad\n* Michael Devine as Officer Peters\n* [[Andre Hyland]] as Tony\n\n==Production==\nIn June 2018, it was announced [[Griffin Gluck]], [[Pete Davidson]], [[Sydney Sweeney]], [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]], [[Thomas Barbusca]], Emily Arlook and [[Oona Laurence]] had joined the cast of the film, with Jason Orley directing from a screenplay he wrote.

Even after Kate broke up with him, Zeke and Mo remained close friends, despite their major age difference. Mo\u2019s parents, Reuben and Sherri, allow Mo to continue hanging out with Zeke despite their concern about what kind of influence Zeke is going to be on their young son. Zeke, now 23, is in a relationship with Holly, while Kate has just moved in with her boyfriend Doug. Zeke and Kate continue to have an affair.\n\nNow 16, Mo struggles with the social aspects of high school, spending most of his time with Zeke and his friends rather than anyone his own age. Zeke helps Mo acquire drinks for a party held by some seniors after being invited by fellow sophomore Stacey and gives Mo some weed to sell to the other kids. At the party, Mo earns credibility among the seniors for having brought alcohol and drugs. Mo sees his classmate Sophia, they strike up a conversation and she gives him her number.\n\nMo later takes Sophia out on a dinner date before going back to Zeke\u2019s place to hang out. The boys tape forties to their hands in an effort to make Mo look impressive. Before Sophia leaves, she and Mo kiss. Mo goes back inside to brag to Zeke and Nick about it, earning him the nickname Tongue Daddy. Mo comes home accidentally stoned the next night before a family dinner and after his father finds out Mo is grounded and forbidden from hanging out with Zeke. \n\nMo begins to ignore Sophia, per Zeke's advice on how to get girls, which makes her mad. After realizing his mistake he tries to explain the reason for ignoring her but she refuses to listen and walks out on him. Mo gets a call from Holly and he goes over to her place. Holly tells him that she and Zeke have broken up because he was cheating and takes Mo's virginity to get back at Zeke. \n\nStacey gets into an accident in his car with a few seniors who are smoking and drinking.Not knowing what to do he ditches the car. The next day, a cop comes to school and tells him he won\u2019t get in trouble if he tells who is supplying him with the drugs they found in the car.\n\nWhen the cops show up at a party looking for Mo, Zeke drags gets him out and brings Mo back to his place where Mo cries about how he has become a degenerate like Zeke, even though he never wanted to be. He also admits to Zeke that he slept with Holly and Zeke forgives him and the two reconcile. Zeke tells Mo that he should blame everything to do with the drugs on him, but Mo declines the offer, saying Zeke has done enough and he needs to handle this on his own. \n\nThe following day, Mo gets expelled from school and is sentenced to community service. Reuben drives to Zeke\u2019s house and orders him to stay away from Mo.\n\n3 months later, Mo attends another high school and only uses his car for completing his community service. Mo stops at a fast-food restaurant one day and is surprised to see Zeke working at the drive-thru window. Mo sits with Zeke and he asks Mo if he wants to hang out the next day and Mo says that maybe they can. But as Mo sits in his car, he texts Zeke to cancel. Zeke can be seen behind Mo\u2019s car, obviously devastated by the news.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Griffin Gluck]] as Monroe \"Mo\" Harris, Kate\u2019s brother and Reuben and Sherri\u2019s son\n* [[Pete Davidson]] as Isaac \"Zeke\" Presanti\n* [[Sydney Sweeney]] as Holly, Zeke's girlfriend \n* [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Colson Baker]] as Nick\n* [[Thomas Barbusca]] as Jon (Stacey) Epstein\n* Emily Arlook as Kate Harris, Mo\u2019s sister and Reuben and Sherri\u2019s daughter\n* [[Oona Laurence]] as Sophie\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Reuben Harris, Mo and Kate\u2019s father and Sherri\u2019s husband\n* [[Julia Murney]] as Sherri Harris, Mo and Kate\u2019s mother and Reuben\u2019s wife\n* Nick Ziobro as Chad\n* Michael Devine as Officer Peters\n* [[Andre Hyland]] as Tony\n\n==Production==\nIn June 2018, it was announced [[Griffin Gluck]], [[Pete Davidson]], [[Sydney Sweeney]], [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]], [[Thomas Barbusca]], Emily Arlook and [[Oona Laurence]] had joined the cast of the film, with Jason Orley directing from a screenplay he wrote.

The phrase \"passions of dishonor\" (KJV: \"vile affections\") translates {{lang|grc| \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7 \u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}},\n{{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1}} ''atimia'' meaning \"dishonour, ignominy, disgrace\".\nIn the expressions \"natural use\" and \"contrary to nature\", \"nature\" translates \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, i.e. ''[[Physis]]''. The term \"error\" translates {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} ''plan\u0113'' (lit. \"straying, wandering\").\n\nThe authenticity of the passage is in doubt; scholars and theologians have proposed its being part of a larger non-Pauline [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]].<ref>Percy Neale Harrison, ''Paulines and Pastorals'' (London: Villiers Publications, 1964), 80-85; Robert Martyr Hawkins, ''The Recovery of the Historical Paul'' (Nashville, TN: [[Vanderbilt University Press]], 1943), 79-86; Alfred Firmin Loisy, ''The Origins of the New Testament'' (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 250; ibid., ''The Birth of the Christian Religion'' (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 363 n.21; Winsome Munro, ''Authority in Paul and Peter: The Identification of a Pastoral Stratum in the Pauline Corpus and 1 Peter'', SNTSMS 45 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 113; John C.

A more conservative biblical interpretation contends \"the most authentic reading of Rom 1:26-7 is that which sees it prohibiting homosexual activity in the most general of terms, rather than in respect of more culturally and historically specific forms of such activity\".<ref name=\"hilborn\" /><ref>Howard, K.

Deerfield, Illinois.</ref>\n\nSeveral early church writers{{who|date=April 2019}} state that Rom 1:26b is a condemnation of men having unnatural sex with women. Underlying Paul's thinking is Genesis 2:22-24, \"The Lord God then built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman. When he brought her to the man, the man said: \u201cThis one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; ...That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body.\" For Paul, God's intended order is for male and female sexual relationships, united in marriage. That is what he saw as natural, and therefore same sex relationships were unnatural. In 1 Romans, Paul is giving examples of what happens when people abandon God's plan.<ref>[https://www.seminary.edu/abandoning-gods-way-for-human-relationships-romans-126-27/ \"Abandoning God's Way for Human Relationships -Romans 1: 26-27\", Northern (Baptist) Seminary]</ref>\n\nThe passage has been described by David Hilborn of the [[Evangelical Alliance]] as \"the most important biblical reference for the homosexuality debate\".<ref name=\"hilborn\">Hilborn, D.

The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st-century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses.

So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\" (Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)</blockquote>Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is \"obvious\" that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\" even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.<ref>Robert A. J. Gagnon, \"Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice?: A Response to David G.

Available online at http://www.robgagnon.net/articles/ReformedReviewArticleWhyTheDisagreement.pdf</ref>\n\nLeroy Huizenga, a Catholic theology professor, acknowledges the question's origin in a dispute between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for \"many\" reasons, or for \"any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'\", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is \"likely\" to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to \"Be fruitful and multiply\". Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage here does modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is \"more radical and less permissive\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr. Leroy Huizenga |url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2381/jesus_marriage_and_homosexuality.aspx#.UssPNvRDt8E |title=Jesus, Marriage, and Homosexuality \u2013 Catholic World Report |publisher=Catholicworldreport.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref>\n\nInterestingly, still in response to the question in Matthew 19:3, Jesus speaks further and discusses a class he calls 'eunuchs', which would seem to be a reference to something more than  simply those who have (had) removed their testicles or external genitalia or been born without such:<blockquote>But he said to them, \u201cNot everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

For example, Scobie states that \"there is no evidence that the term was restricted to pederasty; beyond doubt, the NT here repeats the Leviticus condemnation of all same-sex relations\".<ref name=\"scobie\">Scobie, C.H.H. (2003) ''The Ways of Our God: An approach to Biblical Theology''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

This is in keeping with the term's Old Testament background where lying with a 'male' (a very general term) is proscribed, relating to every kind of male-male intercourse.\" Campbell (quoting from Wenham) goes on to say that, \"in fact, the Old Testament bans every type of homosexual intercourse, not just male prostitution or intercourse with youths.\"<ref>Campbell, K.M.

For example, according to Hays, although the word ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' appears nowhere in Greek literature prior to Paul's use of it, it is evidently a rendering into Greek of the standard rabbinic term for \"one who lies with a male [as with a woman]\" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13). Moreover, despite recent challenges to this interpretation, the meaning is confirmed by the evidence of ''[[Sibylline oracles|Sybilline Oracles]]'' 2.73. Paul here repeats the standard Jewish condemnation of homosexual conduct.<ref>Hays, R.B. (2011)  Interpretation. A Bible Commentary for Teaching & Preaching. First Corinthians.

Olson argues that the \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af in Paul's time, \"almost always referred in a negative, pejorative way to a widely despised group of people who functioned as effeminate 'call boys'.\"\n\n====Arguments for a reference to homosexual behaviour====\nLexical evidence from Greek texts indicates the word was used to refer to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. For example, Malick (''op cit'') writes that a significant expression of this usage is found in a letter<ref group=\"note\">\u201cDemophon to Ptolemaeus, greeting.

(1983) ''The Bible and Homosexuality, Part 2: Homosexuality in the New Testament''. Bibliotheca Sacra 140 (October\u2013December 1983): 351.</ref> Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.<ref group=\"note\">In classical Greek, \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 was also used to refer to boys and men who allowed themselves to be used homosexually. It was also applied to a man taking the female or passive role in homosexuality. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who wrote Roman Antiquities around 7 B.C., described Aristodemus of Cumae as \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 because he had been \u201ceffeminate\u201d (\u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) as a child and had undergone the things associated with women. In classical literature the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 is sometimes applied to obviously gay persons. Lucian describes the blood of some priests he condemns for passive homosexual behavior as \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. This cannot be dismissed as not indicating anything about the sexuality of the individuals in question. These were priests who spent their time seeking group sexual encounters. While there is some ambiguity with regard to \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, it is not beyond reason to see the word representing the passive parties in homosexual intercourse. This is even more reasonable when it is in juxtaposition with \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 which does imply an active homosexual role. It is interesting that in Aristotle\u2019s Problems, a lengthy discussion of the origins of homosexual passivity, he employs the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. In its general sense the word does mean \u201cunrestrained,\u201d but not without any particularly homosexual context (Ukleja, ''op cit'').</ref>\n\nThe meaning of the word is not confined to male prostitutes. According to Malick (''op cit''), when ''malakos'' is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships.<ref name=\"malick\" /> Nor is the meaning of the word confined to sexually exploited males.<ref group=\"note\">\u2018The terms malakoi and molles could be used broadly to refer to effeminate or unmanly men. But in specific contexts it could be used in ways similar to the more specific terms [[cinaedus|cinaedi]]  (lit., \u201cbutt-shakers\u201d) and pathici (\u201cthose who undergo [penetration]\u201d) to denote effeminate adult males who are biologically and/or psychologically disposed to desire penetration by men. For example, in Soranus\u2019s work On Chronic Diseases (early 2nd century A.D.) the section on men who desire to be penetrated (4.9.131-37) is entitled \u201cOn the molles or subacti (subjugated or penetrated partners, pathics) whom the Greeks call malthakoi.\u201d An Aristotelian text similarly refers to those who are anatomically inclined toward the receptive role as malakoi (Pseudo-Aristotle, Problems 4.26). Astrological texts that speak of males desirous of playing the penetrated female role also use the term malakoi (Ptolemy, Four Books 3.14 \u00a7172; Vettius Valens, Anthologies 2.37.54; 2.38.82; cf. Brooten, 126 n. 41, 260 n. 132). The complaint about such figures in the ancient world generally, and certainly by Philo, centers around their attempted erasure of the masculine stamp given them by God/nature, not their exploitation of others, age difference, or acts of prostitution.\u2019, Gagnon, \u2018Dale Martin and the Myth of Total Textual Indeterminacy\u2019 (2007); http://www.robgagnon.net/DaleMartinResponse.htm.</ref>\n\nStandard Greek lexicons and dictionaries understand this word as a reference to the passive partner in a male homosexual act.<ref group=\"note\">\u2018pert. to being passive in a same-sex relationship, effeminate esp. of catamites, of men and boys who are sodomized by other males in such a relationship, opp. \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (Dionys.

For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual impurities, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.}}\n\nWhether these lists include homosexuality depends on the translation of ''porneia'' (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate ''porneia'' as fornication rather than sexual impurity (see [[Leviticus]]). Some{{who|date=September 2011}} interpret the translation of ''porneia'' more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation is supported by the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].\n\n===Pais===\n{{further|Healing the centurion's servant}}\n[[File:JesusHealingCenturionServant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Healing the Centurion's servant by [[Paolo Veronese]], 16th century.]]\nThis event is referred to in both Matthew 8:5-13 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:1-10 and tells of Jesus healing a [[centurion]]'s servant. Luke 7:2 (TNIV) says: \"There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.\" The term translated from the Greek as \"servant\" in this verse is ''doulos''. Elsewhere in the two accounts, the term used for the ill person is ''pais'', a term that can be translated in a number of different ways including \"child\" (e.g., Matthew 2:16; Lk 2:43, 8:51-54 where it refers to a girl), \"son\" (John 4:51) or \"servant\" (Lk 15:26, Acts 4:25); elsewhere it is unclear whether \"son\" or \"servant\" is meant (Acts 3:13, 3:26, 4:27, 4:30).\n\nHorner<ref>Horner, T.

Helminiak argues that this is implied by the broader context of the narrative suggesting an unusual level of concern about the servant, whereas Horner suggests that use of the term \"valued highly\" implies a sexual relationship. Horner goes on to argue that, as Jesus commended the centurion for his faith (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9), it shows that Jesus approved of their relationship, otherwise he would have condemned him.

That is what he saw as natural, and therefore same sex relationships were unnatural.

The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st-century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses.

So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\" (Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)</blockquote>Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is \"obvious\" that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\" even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.<ref>Robert A. J. Gagnon, \"Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice?: A Response to David G.

Available online at http://www.robgagnon.net/articles/ReformedReviewArticleWhyTheDisagreement.pdf</ref>\n\nLeroy Huizenga, a Catholic theology professor, acknowledges the question's origin in a dispute between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for \"many\" reasons, or for \"any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'\", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is \"likely\" to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to \"Be fruitful and multiply\". Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage here does modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is \"more radical and less permissive\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr. Leroy Huizenga |url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2381/jesus_marriage_and_homosexuality.aspx#.UssPNvRDt8E |title=Jesus, Marriage, and Homosexuality \u2013 Catholic World Report |publisher=Catholicworldreport.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref>\n\nInterestingly, still in response to the question in Matthew 19:3, Jesus speaks further and discusses a class he calls 'eunuchs', which would seem to be a reference to something more than  simply those who have (had) removed their testicles or external genitalia or been born without such:<blockquote>But he said to them, \u201cNot everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

For example, Scobie states that \"there is no evidence that the term was restricted to pederasty; beyond doubt, the NT here repeats the Leviticus condemnation of all same-sex relations\".<ref name=\"scobie\">Scobie, C.H.H. (2003) ''The Ways of Our God: An approach to Biblical Theology''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=rNZ_9huzTvIC Google eBook])</ref> Similarly, Campbell writes, \"it must be pointed out, first, that ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' is a broad term that cannot be confined to specific instances of homosexual activity such as male prostitution or pederasty. This is in keeping with the term's Old Testament background where lying with a 'male' (a very general term) is proscribed, relating to every kind of male-male intercourse.\" Campbell (quoting from Wenham) goes on to say that, \"in fact, the Old Testament bans every type of homosexual intercourse, not just male prostitution or intercourse with youths.\"<ref>Campbell, K.M.

([https://books.google.com/books?id=WcyqvWfJnyYC Google eBook])</ref>\n\nOthers have pointed out that the meaning of ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' is identified by its derivation from the [[Septuagint|Greek translation of the Old Testament]], where the component words \"with a man (''arsenos'') do not copulate coitus (''koites'') as with a woman\" refer to homosexual conduct. For example, according to Hays, although the word ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' appears nowhere in Greek literature prior to Paul's use of it, it is evidently a rendering into Greek of the standard rabbinic term for \"one who lies with a male [as with a woman]\" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13). Moreover, despite recent challenges to this interpretation, the meaning is confirmed by the evidence of ''[[Sibylline oracles|Sybilline Oracles]]'' 2.73. Paul here repeats the standard Jewish condemnation of homosexual conduct.<ref>Hays, R.B. (2011)  Interpretation. A Bible Commentary for Teaching & Preaching. First Corinthians.

Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B.

(1984) Untangling the Web: A Look at What Scripture Does and Does Not Say about Homosexual Behavior. ''The Other Side'', April, pp.24-29.</ref> based on previous and subsequent uses of the term, interprets ''malakos'' to mean an effeminate but not necessarily homosexual man. Olson argues that the \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af in Paul's time, \"almost always referred in a negative, pejorative way to a widely despised group of people who functioned as effeminate 'call boys'.\"\n\n====Arguments for a reference to homosexual behaviour====\nLexical evidence from Greek texts indicates the word was used to refer to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. For example, Malick (''op cit'') writes that a significant expression of this usage is found in a letter<ref group=\"note\">\u201cDemophon to Ptolemaeus, greeting. Make every effort to send me the flute-player Peto\u00fcs with both the Phrygian flutes and the rest; and if any expense is necessary, pay it, and you shall recover it from me.

(1983) ''The Bible and Homosexuality, Part 2: Homosexuality in the New Testament''. Bibliotheca Sacra 140 (October\u2013December 1983): 351.</ref> Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.<ref group=\"note\">In classical Greek, \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 was also used to refer to boys and men who allowed themselves to be used homosexually. It was also applied to a man taking the female or passive role in homosexuality. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who wrote Roman Antiquities around 7 B.C., described Aristodemus of Cumae as \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 because he had been \u201ceffeminate\u201d (\u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) as a child and had undergone the things associated with women. In classical literature the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 is sometimes applied to obviously gay persons. Lucian describes the blood of some priests he condemns for passive homosexual behavior as \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. This cannot be dismissed as not indicating anything about the sexuality of the individuals in question. These were priests who spent their time seeking group sexual encounters. While there is some ambiguity with regard to \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, it is not beyond reason to see the word representing the passive parties in homosexual intercourse. This is even more reasonable when it is in juxtaposition with \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 which does imply an active homosexual role. It is interesting that in Aristotle\u2019s Problems, a lengthy discussion of the origins of homosexual passivity, he employs the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. In its general sense the word does mean \u201cunrestrained,\u201d but not without any particularly homosexual context (Ukleja, ''op cit'').</ref>\n\nThe meaning of the word is not confined to male prostitutes. According to Malick (''op cit''), when ''malakos'' is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships.<ref name=\"malick\" /> Nor is the meaning of the word confined to sexually exploited males.<ref group=\"note\">\u2018The terms malakoi and molles could be used broadly to refer to effeminate or unmanly men. But in specific contexts it could be used in ways similar to the more specific terms [[cinaedus|cinaedi]]  (lit., \u201cbutt-shakers\u201d) and pathici (\u201cthose who undergo [penetration]\u201d) to denote effeminate adult males who are biologically and/or psychologically disposed to desire penetration by men. For example, in Soranus\u2019s work On Chronic Diseases (early 2nd century A.D.) the section on men who desire to be penetrated (4.9.131-37) is entitled \u201cOn the molles or subacti (subjugated or penetrated partners, pathics) whom the Greeks call malthakoi.\u201d An Aristotelian text similarly refers to those who are anatomically inclined toward the receptive role as malakoi (Pseudo-Aristotle, Problems 4.26). Astrological texts that speak of males desirous of playing the penetrated female role also use the term malakoi (Ptolemy, Four Books 3.14 \u00a7172; Vettius Valens, Anthologies 2.37.54; 2.38.82; cf. Brooten, 126 n. 41, 260 n. 132). The complaint about such figures in the ancient world generally, and certainly by Philo, centers around their attempted erasure of the masculine stamp given them by God/nature, not their exploitation of others, age difference, or acts of prostitution.\u2019, Gagnon, \u2018Dale Martin and the Myth of Total Textual Indeterminacy\u2019 (2007); http://www.robgagnon.net/DaleMartinResponse.htm.</ref>\n\nStandard Greek lexicons and dictionaries understand this word as a reference to the passive partner in a male homosexual act.<ref group=\"note\">\u2018pert. to being passive in a same-sex relationship, effeminate esp. of catamites, of men and boys who are sodomized by other males in such a relationship, opp. \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (Dionys.

For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual impurities, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.}}\n\nWhether these lists include homosexuality depends on the translation of ''porneia'' (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate ''porneia'' as fornication rather than sexual impurity (see [[Leviticus]]). Some{{who|date=September 2011}} interpret the translation of ''porneia'' more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation is supported by the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].\n\n===Pais===\n{{further|Healing the centurion's servant}}\n[[File:JesusHealingCenturionServant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Healing the Centurion's servant by [[Paolo Veronese]], 16th century.]]\nThis event is referred to in both Matthew 8:5-13 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:1-10 and tells of Jesus healing a [[centurion]]'s servant. Luke 7:2 (TNIV) says: \"There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.\" The term translated from the Greek as \"servant\" in this verse is ''doulos''. Elsewhere in the two accounts, the term used for the ill person is ''pais'', a term that can be translated in a number of different ways including \"child\" (e.g., Matthew 2:16; Lk 2:43, 8:51-54 where it refers to a girl), \"son\" (John 4:51) or \"servant\" (Lk 15:26, Acts 4:25); elsewhere it is unclear whether \"son\" or \"servant\" is meant (Acts 3:13, 3:26, 4:27, 4:30).\n\nHorner<ref>Horner, T.

Indeed, most interpreters come to the text with a preconceived notion of what the Bible has to say about normative sexual behaviors, influencing subsequent interpretations.<ref>Robert J. Myles, ''Dandy Discipleship: A Queering of Mark\u2019s Male Disciples'' JMMS 4:2 (2010), p. 66-81. {{cite web |url=http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume4/number2/pp66-81 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701040943/http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume4/number2/pp66-81 |archivedate=2013-07-01}}</ref> For example, William Walker says that the very notion of \"homosexuality\" (or even \"heterosexuality\", \"bisexuality\" and \"sexual orientation\") is essentially a modern concept that would simply have been unintelligible to the New Testament writers.<ref>[http://www.westarinstitute.org/resources/the-fourth-r/what-the-new-testament-says-about-homosexuality/ What the New Testament Says about Homosexuality] Westar Institute, 2008.</ref> The word \"homosexuality\" and the concept of sexual orientation as being separate from one's perceived masculinity or femininity (i.e. gender identity) did not take shape until the 19th century.<ref>Halperin, D. M. (1990) ''One Hundred Years of Homosexuality''. New York: Routledge.</ref> Moreover, although some ancient Romans (i.e. doctors, astrologers, etc.) discussed congenital inclinations to unconventional sexual activities such as homosexuality, this classification fails to correspond to a modern psychological, biological and genetic distinction between homosexual, heterosexual and bisexual orientations.<ref>Brooten, B. (1998) ''Love Between Women: Early Christian Responses to Female Homoeroticism'' (Chicago Series on Sexuality, History & Society). University of Chicago Press.</ref> However, according to Gagnon, the concept of homosexual orientation was not wholly unknown in the Greco-Roman milieu. Moreover, he asserts that there is absolutely no evidence that modern orientation theory would have had any impact on Paul changing his strong negative valuation of homosexual practice.<ref>Gagnon, R.B. (2008) [http://www.fulcrum-anglican.org.uk/page.cfm?ID=325 The Faulty Orientation Argument of Anglican Archbishop Harper of Ireland.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630101721/http://www.fulcrum-anglican.org.uk/page.cfm?ID=325 |date=2013-06-30}} Fulcrum.</ref>\n\nA statement by the Bishops of the Church of England (\"Issues in Human Sexuality\") in 1991 illustrates a categorization and understanding of homosexuality, claiming that in ancient times \"society recognized the existence of those, predominantly male, who appeared to be attracted entirely to members of their own sex.\" (\"Issues in Human Sexuality\" para 2.16, lines 8-9) which almost parallels that of modern ideation. The same study is careful to point out that \"the modern concept of orientation has been developed against a background of genetic and psychological theory which was not available to the ancient world.\"\n\nSarah Ruden, in her ''Paul Among the People'' (2010) argues that the only form of homosexual sex that was apparent to the public in Paul's time was exploitative pederasty, in which slave boys were raped by adult males, often very violently. Paul's condemnation of homosexuality, Ruden argues, can be interpreted most plausibly as a criticism of this kind of brutally exploitative behavior.<ref>Sarah Ruden, ''Paul Among the People'' (2010), p. 54-55, .</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Bible and homosexuality]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist | group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Homosexuality In The New Testament}}\n[[Category:LGBT topics and Christianity]]\n[[Category:Religious law]]\n[[Category:Bible-related controversies]]\n", "name_user": "70.27.158.156", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e1 Timothy 1:9-10)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_the_New_Testament"}
