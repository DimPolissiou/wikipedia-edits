{"title_page": "Hindu mythological wars", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n'''Ancient Hindu wars''' are the [[battle]]s described in the [[Hindu texts]] of ancient [[India]]. These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' \u2013 celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power \u2013 to aid them in battle.\n\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|375px|The Battle of Kurukshetra, fought between the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, recorded in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\n\n==In Vedic literature==\n\n===Indra and Vritra===\nThe central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and [[Vritra]], and the defeat of the demon Vritra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and ''[[Ushas]]'' ([[dawn]]/light). While this battle does reinforce the timeless good v/s evil theme, close examination of various hymns and verses in the [[Rigveda]] suggest this might have been an allegorical account of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system.<ref>[http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/vrtra-myth-the-bharadvaja-version/ A record of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system?]</ref>\n\nAnother important battle is the historic [[Battle of the Ten Kings]], alluded to in the [[Rigveda]], in which the [[Tritsu]] clan, led by [[Sudas]], defeat the [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]] confederation of ten [[Indo Aryan]] clans.<ref name=\"schmidt1980\">Schmidt, H.P.

Both races are technically equal, possessors of great religious and martial powers, but the Devas are committed to the worship of the [[Supreme Being]] and the practice of [[virtue]]. The Asuras have atheistic and devious tendencies that grow over time.

The king whose authority is contested must prove himself in battle or accept the imperial supremacy of the challenging king. When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse. In the [[Mahabharata|Mahabharat]] era, [[Arjuna]] alone had conquered the whole world for the sake of ''Ashwamedha Yagya'' of his brother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14085.htm|title=Digivijaya of Arjuna}}</ref>\n*''[[Rajasuya]]'': Considered the ultimate sacrifice, the king performing the sacrifice must openly challenge every king in the world to accept his supremacy or defeat him in battle. If and when the king returns successfully, having beaten all other known rulers, the performance of the sacrifice will send him to the abode of [[Indra]]. It was performed by king [[Yudhishthira]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic.

Rama was extremely powerful warrior and had knowledge of usage of many celestial astras. Rama single-handedly slayed the 14,000 demon hordes of [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] (in one hour, according to the ''Ramayana''), the demons [[Maricha]] and [[Subahu]], Ravana's chief commander [[Prahasta]] and is responsible for the ultimate killing of [[Ravana]] himself.\n*[[Lakshmana]] : He was also very powerful like his brother. He was incarnation of Sheshnag. He controlled his sleep for 14 continuous years and slayed extremely powerful demons including [[Atikaya]] and [[Indrajit]].\n*[[Hanuman]] : He was son of Kesari and Anjana. He was one of the [[Rudras]] of Shiva. He was first trained by Sun god Surya and later Shiva himself mentored him. Later he became [[Vanara]] minister of [[Sugriva]]. He is the greatest devotee of [[Rama]], famous for his unerring service, absolute loyalty and great feats of courage. Hanuman is responsible for killing many demons, as well as burning the city of Lanka. His strength is given by his father [[Vayu]], and by virtue of the boons bestowed on him by various Gods, no astra & weapon could harm him. He can transform into any size & shape as he desired. He was also well expert in using celestial astras. He also possessed Mohini astra, Raudra astra etc. \n*[[Ravana]]: blessed by his fearsome 10,000 year [[tapasya]] to be the most powerful being on earth, invulnerable to every God, demon and living being, save man. Although an expert on the [[Vedas]], a great king, and a great devotee of [[Shiva]], he is the Emperor of evil due to his patronage of demons, murder of kings and humiliation of the Gods headed by Indra.\n*[[Indrajit]] : He was first-born son of mighty [[Ravana]]. Originally his name was Meghanada. He was master of illusion war techniques. He became the possessor of several supreme celestial weapons. Through penance, he obtained a boon from Brahma : he could be killed by a common man who could control his sleep for 12 years continuously. He defeated [[Indra]] and arrested him. Then Brahma appeared and asked him to free Indra. Meghanada did as Brahma directed and was then granted boon : he would never be killed in any battle, until his Yagna (fire-worship) of his native goddess Nikumbala was disturbed and destroyed. On the completion of the Yagna, a supreme celestial chariot would appear, boarding which, Indrajit would become unkilled in any battle. But Brahma also cautioned him that whosoever would destroy this yagna, would also kill him. He was killed by [[Lakshmana]].\n*[[Kumbhakarna]]: the gigantic brother of Ravana is a fearsome monster-demon who sleeps for six months at a stretch, rising for only one day and then returning to his slumber.

He is a great warrior. [[Aswatthama|Ashwathama]] and [[Kripa]] are believed to be the lone survivors still living who actually fought in the Kurukshetra war.

In some instances, he loved Arjuna more than his own son Ashwatthama.\n*[[Karna]]: The son of [[Surya]] and first born of [[Kunti]] who shunned him due to her being the mother of the [[Pandavas]]. Karna was the greatest archer in Mahabharat. He was considered even better than Arjuna and in final war, he was unfairly defeated and killed by Arjuna on 17th day of Kuru war. Karna was taught by [[Parashurama]] in warfare. He was so powerful that people compared him to be as strong as Lord [[Krishna]] .\n*[[Nakul]]: the fourth brother of the Pandavas.

In the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]], he is called Paramatman or Parameshwara (the highest form of God), and is periodically reborn as an [[Avatar]] upon earth in order to destroy evil and bring deliverance to the pious. He is also the refuge of the Devas in their battles against Asuras. The most martial Avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Mohini]], [[Vamana]], [[Parshurama|Parshuram]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]]. He is also considered to be the first God, 'Adideva'. He is beyond birth, death, time. He is beyond all. In battle, the avatars of Vishnu are aided by a variety of ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' or celestial weapons. His two human avatars, Parashuram and Rama, were fearsome warriors and possessed many celestial weapons that accompany the past times of Vishnu. Krishna also used a few of these weapons in Mahabharata. These include:\n\n*''[[Kaumodaki]]'': The divine [[Gada (mace)|mace]] weapon of Vishnu; invincible and without parallel; Krishna slayed demon Dantavakra with it.\n*''Kodandam'': The bow of [[Rama]], 7th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Nandaka]]'': The sword of Vishnu\n*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Narayanastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Vaishnavastra. The personal missile weapon of Vishnu in his [[Narayana]] (Naraina) form, this ''astra'' lets loose a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower increases with resistance. The only solution is total submission before the missile; only then will it cease. The Narayanastra was first used by Rama in the ''Ramayana''. Then, thousands of years later, this astra was again used by [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]] against the [[Pandava]] army.\n*''[[Parashu]]'': The axe of [[Parashurama]], 6th avatar of [[Vishnu]], given by [[Shiva]].\n*''[[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]]'': The celestial bow of Vishnu. \n*''Sharkha'': The bow of [[Krishna]], 8th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'': The magical ''Chakra'', a spinning disc with sharp outer spears.

The Sudarshan flies at the command of Krishna, spinning away to tear off the heads of his opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu. It was most famously used by [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] himself.

These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' \u2013 celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power \u2013 to aid them in battle.\n\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|375px|The Battle of Kurukshetra, fought between the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, recorded in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\n\n==In Vedic literature==\n\n===Indra and Vritra===\nThe central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and [[Vritra]], and the defeat of the demon Vritra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and ''[[Ushas]]'' ([[dawn]]/light).

It has almost 72,000  inhabitants, making it the second-largest city in the region. Hav\u00ed\u0159ov lies in the historical region of [[Cieszyn Silesia]].\n\nHav\u00ed\u0159ov was founded after [[World War II]] (thus being the youngest city in today's Czech Republic) as a [[coal mining]] town. Hav\u00ed\u0159ov officially became a town in 1955. It was built on top of several villages with significant [[Polish minority in the Czech Republic|Polish populations]].

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based complexity. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

In particular,\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''', '''[[MA (complexity)|MA]]''', and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\nThese are explained in greater detail below.\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. \n\nA slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. \n\nLoosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient probabilistic algorithms that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. \n\nThe broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows for two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language, and a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument further demonstrates that no error is allowed for strings not in the language. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\n[[File:Three_input_Boolean_circuit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example Boolean circuit computing the Boolean function <math>f_C(x_1,x_2,x_3)</math>, where <math>x_1=0</math>, <math>x_2=1</math>, and <math>x_3=0</math>. The <math>\\wedge</math> nodes are [[AND gate]]s, the <math>\\vee</math> nodes are [[OR gate]]s, and the <math>\\neg</math> nodes are [[NOT gate]]s]]\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>x_1,x_2,...,x_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

In particular,\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''', '''[[MA (complexity)|MA]]''', and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\nThese are explained in greater detail below.\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. \n\nA slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. \n\nLoosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient probabilistic algorithms that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. \n\nThe broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows for two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language, and a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument further demonstrates that no error is allowed for strings not in the language. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\n[[File:Three_input_Boolean_circuit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example Boolean circuit computing the Boolean function <math>f_C(x_1,x_2,x_3)</math>, where <math>x_1=0</math>, <math>x_2=1</math>, and <math>x_3=0</math>. The <math>\\wedge</math> nodes are [[AND gate]]s, the <math>\\vee</math> nodes are [[OR gate]]s, and the <math>\\neg</math> nodes are [[NOT gate]]s]]\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease. At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).<ref name=strovel/>\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities.<ref name=fda-ddp/> These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/> It is a regulatory requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new vaccine is to be delivered by skin injection). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) or [[Biologics License Application]] application for a vaccine.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/><ref name=cdc-vacc/>  If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase,<ref name=fda-ddp/> and the progress of performance in humans &ndash; if a vaccine under development in the United States &ndash; is monitored by the FDA in a \"vaccine approval process.\"<ref name=\"fda-vacc\">{{cite web |title=Vaccine Product Approval Process |url=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-product-approval-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trial phases===\n{{Main|Clinical trial}}\n\n[[Clinical trial]] programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=\"aziz\">{{cite web |last=Kaiser J. |first=Aziz |title=FDA update (2018) \u2013 The FDA's new drug approval process: Development and premarket applications |url=https://drug-dev.com/fda-update-the-fdas-new-drug-approval-process-development-premarket-applications/ |publisher=Drug Development and Delivery |accessdate=25 March 2020 |date=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.\n* Phase II trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the NCE.\n* Phase III trials are [[Randomized controlled trial|large, pivotal trials]] to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the COVID-19 infection. If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the [[new drug application]] (NDA) stage to begin marketing.<ref name=fda-ddp/>\n* Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that may be a condition attached by the FDA, also called [[post-market surveillance]] studies. Until a vaccine is provided to the general population, all potential [[adverse event]]s remain unidentified, requiring that vaccines undergo Phase IV studies with regular reports by the manufacturer to the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS) to identify problems after use in the population begins.<ref name=fda-vacc/>\n\nThe process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE is advanced into human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel vaccine or antiviral drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others).<ref name=strovel/><ref name=fda-vacc/> If a vaccine candidate or antiviral compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the manufacturer can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be submitted for marketing approval in the various countries where the manufacturer plans to sell it.<ref name=fda-ddp/> In the United States, this process is called a \"[[new drug application]]\" or NDA.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/>\n\n====Adaptive designs for COVID-19 trials====\nA clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an \"adaptive design\" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.<ref name=\"fda-adaptive\">{{cite web |title=Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Guidance for Industry |url=https://www.fda.gov/media/78495/download |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"pallmann\">{{cite journal | last=Pallmann | first=Philip | last2=Bedding | first2=Alun W. | last3=Choodari-Oskooei | first3=Babak | last4=Dimairo | first4=Munyaradzi | last5=Flight | first5=Laura | last6=Hampson | first6=Lisa V. | last7=Holmes | first7=Jane | last8=Mander | first8=Adrian P. | last9=Odondi | first9=Lang\u2019o | last10=Sydes | first10=Matthew R. | last11=Villar | first11=Sof\u00eda S. | last12=Wason | first12=James M.

At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility.

Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) or [[Biologics License Application]] application for a vaccine.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/><ref name=cdc-vacc/>  If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase,<ref name=fda-ddp/> and the progress of performance in humans &ndash; if a vaccine under development in the United States &ndash; is monitored by the FDA in a \"vaccine approval process.\"<ref name=\"fda-vacc\">{{cite web |title=Vaccine Product Approval Process |url=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-product-approval-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trial phases===\n{{Main|Clinical trial}}\n\n[[Clinical trial]] programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=\"aziz\">{{cite web |last=Kaiser J. |first=Aziz |title=FDA update (2018) \u2013 The FDA's new drug approval process: Development and premarket applications |url=https://drug-dev.com/fda-update-the-fdas-new-drug-approval-process-development-premarket-applications/ |publisher=Drug Development and Delivery |accessdate=25 March 2020 |date=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.\n* Phase II trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the NCE.\n* Phase III trials are [[Randomized controlled trial|large, pivotal trials]] to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the COVID-19 infection. If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the [[new drug application]] (NDA) stage to begin marketing.<ref name=fda-ddp/>\n* Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that may be a condition attached by the FDA, also called [[post-market surveillance]] studies. Until a vaccine is provided to the general population, all potential [[adverse event]]s remain unidentified, requiring that vaccines undergo Phase IV studies with regular reports by the manufacturer to the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS) to identify problems after use in the population begins.<ref name=fda-vacc/>\n\nThe process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE is advanced into human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel vaccine or antiviral drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others).<ref name=strovel/><ref name=fda-vacc/> If a vaccine candidate or antiviral compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the manufacturer can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be submitted for marketing approval in the various countries where the manufacturer plans to sell it.<ref name=fda-ddp/> In the United States, this process is called a \"[[new drug application]]\" or NDA.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/>\n\n====Adaptive designs for COVID-19 trials====\nA clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an \"adaptive design\" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.<ref name=\"fda-adaptive\">{{cite web |title=Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Guidance for Industry |url=https://www.fda.gov/media/78495/download |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"pallmann\">{{cite journal | last=Pallmann | first=Philip | last2=Bedding | first2=Alun W. | last3=Choodari-Oskooei | first3=Babak | last4=Dimairo | first4=Munyaradzi | last5=Flight | first5=Laura | last6=Hampson | first6=Lisa V. | last7=Holmes | first7=Jane | last8=Mander | first8=Adrian P. | last9=Odondi | first9=Lang\u2019o | last10=Sydes | first10=Matthew R. | last11=Villar | first11=Sof\u00eda S. | last12=Wason | first12=James M.

overview: timelines in 2020===\nAccording to two organizations tracking clinical trial progress on potential therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 infections, 29 Phase II-IV efficacy trials were concluded in March or scheduled to provide results in April from hospitals in China &ndash; which experienced the first outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019.<ref name=\"milken\" /><ref name=\"koch\" /> Seven trials were evaluating repurposed drugs already approved to treat [[malaria]], including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate.<ref name=\"koch\" /> Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the Chinese research, with 9 Phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April.<ref name=\"milken\" /><ref name=\"koch\" /> Other potential therapeutic candidates under pivotal clinical trials concluding in March-April are [[vasodilator]]s, [[corticosteroid]]s, [[immunotherapy|immune therapies]], [[lipoic acid]], [[bevacizumab]], and [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[angiotensin-converting enzyme 2]], among others.<ref name=\"koch\" />\n\nThe COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition has goals to 1) facilitate rapid reviews of clinical trial proposals by [[ethics committee]]s and national regulatory agencies, 2) fast-track approvals for the candidate therapeutic compounds, 3) ensure standardised and rapid analysis of emerging efficacy and safety data, and 4) facilitate sharing of clinical trial outcomes before publication.<ref name=\"coalition\" /> A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was in place, as of April.<ref name=\"maguire\" />\n\n=== Efforts to streamline drug discovery ===\nOver 2018\u201320, new initiatives to stimulate vaccine and antiviral drug development included partnerships between governmental organizations and industry, such as the European [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]],<ref name=\"imi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imi.europa.eu/about-imi|title=About

the coordinated \"Solidarity trial\" in 10 countries to rapidly assess in thousands of COVID-19 infected people the potential efficacy of existing antiviral and [[anti-inflammatory]] agents not yet evaluated specifically for COVID-19 illness.<ref name=kai/><ref name=cheng/><ref name=\"stat3-18\">{{cite

about 15% of people infected by COVID-19 having severe illness, and hospitals being overwhelmed during the pandemic, WHO recognized a rapid clinical need to test and repurpose these drugs as agents already approved for other diseases and recognized as safe.<ref name=kai/>\n\nThe Solidarity project is designed to give rapid insights to key clinical questions:<ref name=kai/><ref name=stat3-18/>\n* Do any of the drugs reduce mortality? \n* Do any of the drugs reduce the time a patient is hospitalized? \n* Do the treatments affect the need for people with COVID-19-induced pneumonia to be ventilated or maintained in [[Intensive care medicine|intensive care]]?\n* Could such drugs be used to minimize the illness of COVID-19 infection in [[Health professional|healthcare staff]] and people at high risk of developing severe illness?\n\nEnrolling people with COVID-19 infection is simplified by using data entries, including [[informed consent]], on a WHO website.<ref name=kai/> After the trial staff determine the drugs available at the hospital, the WHO website [[Randomized controlled trial|randomizes]] the hospitalized subject to one of the trial drugs or to the hospital standard of care for treating COVID-19. The trial physician records and submits follow-up information about the subject status and treatment, completing data input via the WHO Solidarity website.<ref name=kai/> The design of the Solidarity trial is not [[Blinded experiment#Terminology|double-blind]] &ndash; which is normally the standard in a high-quality clinical trial &ndash; but WHO  needed speed with quality for the trial across many hospitals and countries.<ref name=kai/> A global [[Monitoring in clinical trials#Safety monitoring|safety monitoring board of WHO physicians]] examine [[Clinical trial#Types|interim results]] to assist decisions on safety and effectiveness of the trial drugs, and alter the trial design or recommend an effective therapy.<ref name=kai/><ref name=stat3-18/> A similar web-based study to Solidarity, called \"Discovery\", was initiated in March across seven countries by [[INSERM]] ([[Paris]], [[France]]).<ref name=kai/><ref name=inserm-disc/>\n\nDuring March, funding for the Solidarity trial reached {{US$|108}} million from 203,000 individuals, organizations and governments, with 45 countries involved in financing or trial management.<ref name=\"who3-27\">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---27-march-2020|title=WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19|date=27 March 2020|publisher=United Nations, World Health Organization|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cost of drug development]]\n{{Portal bar|Coronavirus disease 2019|Medicine|Viruses|border=no}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | last=McCreary | first=Erin K | last2=Pogue | first2=Jason M | title=COVID-19 Treatment: A Review of Early and Emerging Options | journal=Open Forum Infectious Diseases | date=23 March 2020 | issn=2328-8957 | doi=10.1093/ofid/ofaa105 | page= }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|voy=2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic|c=category:2019\u201320 COVID-19 pandemic|d=Q81068910|q=no|b=no|v=no|s=no|m=no|mw=no|wikt=COVID-19|species=Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|n=Category:COVID-19}}\n\n* [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 COVID-19] ([http://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses Questions & Answers]) by the [[World Health Organization]]\n* [https://www.coronavirus.gov/ COVID-19] ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html Q&A]) by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]]\n* [https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses Coronaviruses by US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases]\n* [https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china COVID-19] ([http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers Q&A]) by the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]]\n* [http://en.nhc.gov.cn/antivirusfight.html COVID-19] by the [[China National Health Commission]]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n[[Category:Anti-influenza agents]]\n[[Category:Clinical research]]\n[[Category:COVID-19|drug development]]\n[[Category:Drug discovery]]\n[[Category:Drugs]]\n[[Category:National agencies for drug regulation]]\n[[Category:Pharmaceutical industry]]\n[[Category:Regulators of biotechnology products]]\n[[Category:Vaccines]]\n", "name_user": "Zefr", "label": "safe", "comment": "repeat ref repair", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_drug_development"}

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide.

The brown enamel backing of the warrant officer insignia was based on the color of the sleeve insignia of rank for ship's officers of the AMPS.<ref name=\"WO-1\">{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/wocc/woprogram.asp#history|title=Warrant Officer History|publisher=U.S. Army Warrant Officer Career College|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"tioh_rank\">http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Insignia_Rank/warrant_officers.aspx |Insignia of Grade Warrant - Officers</ref><ref>[http://www.usawoa.org/stivers2announced.htm Ship's officers]</ref>\n\nOn 18 July 1942 {{USPL|77|658}}, the Flight Officer Act, was enacted, creating the rank of [[flight officer]], equivalent to warrant officer (junior grade) and assigned to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

The Warrant Officer Management Act {{USPL|102|190}} of 5 December 1991, created the paygrade of W5 and the separate rank of Master Warrant Officer (CW5), since renamed as Chief Warrant Officer Five.\n\nOn 9 July 2004 the Warrant Officer Branch insignia (also known as the \"Eagle Rising\" or \"Squashed Bug\") was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.cavhooah.com/info/index.php/join-the-cav/warrant-officers/warrant-insignia/ \"Warrant officers to sport branch insignia\"] by Sgt. 1st Class Marcia Triggs.

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

That warrant was considered a patent of trust and honor, but was not considered a commission to command. Since this first appointment, Navy warrant officers have held positions as surgeons, master mates, boatswains, carpenters, and chaplains.<ref name=\"WO-4\" /> Until 1912, a [[midshipman]] graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy]] was required to have two years of sea duty as a warrant officer before receiving a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>Commission of ensign to graduates of the Naval Academy at end of four years' course, Pub. Law No. 62-98. 37 Stat. 73 (1912).</ref> Although based on the British [[Royal Navy]] warrant officer ranks that were in place until 1949, the United States had never needed to address an issue of aristocracy, which resulted in warranted officers in the Royal Navy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Naval Officers Guide, 12th ed., L. McComas, US Naval Institute, Annapolis, MD, c2011</ref> However, the United States Navy experienced a similar issue of rank, where highly competent senior noncommissioned officers are required to report to inexperienced junior officers, giving rise to special status to the Navy's chief warrant officers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1975, the Navy ceased using the rank of warrant officer 1 (WO-1), also known as pay grade W-1, because chief petty officers in pay grades E-7 and above with many years in service would lose pay when appointed to the rank of warrant officer.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The Navy appoints their warrant officers directly to the rank of CWO2 (i.e., as chief warrant officers), and are \"commissioned\" officers, with the Navy Personnel Command/Bureau of Personnel (NAVPERSCOM/BUPERS) managing all grades (CWO-2 through CWO-5) by [[Billet#United States usage|billet]]s appropriate for each rank. In past years, some CWOs resigned their warrant commission prior to retirement to receive greater retirement pay at their former senior enlisted rank.<ref>MILPERSMAN 15560.D, OPNAV 1811.3, OPNAV 1820.1</ref> However, this pay disparity has effectively disappeared in recent years and all Navy CWOs now retire at the appropriate officer grade.\n\n====Flying chief warrant officer====\n[[File:US Navy 090910-N-6651N-007 Chief Warrant Officer Leighton DaCosta performs pre-flight set-up on a P-3 Orion during the platform-specific phase of his Chief Warrant Officer Flight Training program at Patrol Squadron (VP) 30.jpg|thumb|250px|CWO2 DaCosta performs pre-flight setup on a [[P-3 Orion|P-3]] during the platform phase of the CWO Flight Training Program, circa 2009]]\nThe Navy started a test program called the \"Flying Chief Warrant Officer Program\" in 2006 to acquire additional [[naval aviator]]s (pilots) and [[naval flight officer]]s (NFOs), who would fly naval aircraft, but who would not compete with traditional [[unrestricted line]] (URL) officers in [[naval aviation]] for eventual command of squadrons, air wings, air stations, etc., the numbers of such commands which had been greatly reduced in the post-[[Cold War]] era, thereby limiting the command opportunity for URL pilots and NFOs.\n\nEnlisted sailors in the grades E-5 through E-7 who had at least an associate degree and were not currently serving in the diver, master-at-arms, nuclear, SEAL, SWCC, or EOD communities were eligible to apply. Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]]. Those in the VP community would also eventually qualify to fly the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] once that aircraft began replacing the P-3 in 2012. The Navy re-evaluated the program in 2011, when the last of the \"flying\" chief warrant officers reported to their operational fleet squadrons and opted to subsequently terminate the program.<ref name=\"WO-5\"/><ref name=\"public.navy.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navytrng/a/navwarflight.htm |title=Flying CWO Program|accessdate=28 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Reestablishment of warrant officer one ===\n{{Annotated image\n| image = US Navy Cap Devices.png\n| image-width = 380\n| image-left = -29\n| image-top = -270\n| width = 180\n| height = 140\n| float = right\n| annotations =\n| caption = U.S. Navy Warrant Officer\u2013One combination cover device\n}}\nOn 4 June 2018, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] announced the reestablishment of the rank of warrant officer one (pay grade W-1), for cyber warrant officers, and solicited applications for the rank/grade.<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\">[https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2018/NAV18140.txt  MODIFICATION OF THE NAVY CYBER WARRANT OFFICER PROGRAM], [[Chief of Naval Operations]], 2018-06-04</ref> These warrant officers will receive their appointment via warrant and not via [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]].<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\"/> They will incur a six-year service obligation once promoted to W-1.

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level. This was not publicly acknowledged until years later. The Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\nThe last active-duty air force chief warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long, retired in 1980. The last [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] chief warrant officer, CWO4 Bob Barrow, retired in 1992. Upon his retirement, Barrow was honorarily promoted to CWO5, the only person in the Air Force ever to hold this grade.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\n==Coast Guard==\n[[File:US Coast Guard Warrant Officer Specialty Markings-Collar.png|thumb|475px|United States Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer specialty insignia (collar devices)]] Due to the small and decentralized nature of the service, Coast Guard Warrant Officers often fill command roles. Warrant Officers may serve as officers-in-charge of [[Coast Guard Stations]], or even as Command warrant officers. Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.  The Coast Guard does not use the rank of warrant officer (WO-1). Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.<ref>United States Coast Guard.

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide.

Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

This allows the Navy to capitalize on the experience of warrant officers without having to frequently transition them to other duty assignments for advancement.<ref name=\"WO-5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usawoa.org/woheritage//WO_Prog_Other_Svc.htm|title=Warrant Officer Programs of Other Services|publisher=United States Army Warrant Officer Association|accessdate=18 March 2007}}</ref> With the exception of the Navy's short-lived flying chief warrant officer program,<ref name=\"public.navy.mil\">{{cite web|author=&nbsp;|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/BUPERS-NPC/OFFICER/DETAILING/AVIATION/Pages/FLyingCWOProgram.aspx |title=Flying CWO Program |publisher=Public.navy.mil |accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> all Navy warrant officers are accessed from the [[Chief petty officer#United States|chief petty officer]] pay grades, E-7 through E-9, analogous to a senior noncommissioned officer in the other services, and must have a minimum 14 years time in service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2016/NAV16144.txt|title=ACTIVE DUTY LIMITED DUTY OFFICER AND CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER IN SERVICE PROCUREMENT BOARDS|work=[[US Navy]]|publisher=[[United States Government]]|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Background===\nThe Navy has had warrant officers among its ranks since 23 December 1775, when John Berriman received a warrant to act as [[purser]] aboard the [[brigantine]], [[Andrew Doria (1775 brig)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']]. That warrant was considered a patent of trust and honor, but was not considered a commission to command. Since this first appointment, Navy warrant officers have held positions as surgeons, master mates, boatswains, carpenters, and chaplains.<ref name=\"WO-4\" /> Until 1912, a [[midshipman]] graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy]] was required to have two years of sea duty as a warrant officer before receiving a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>Commission of ensign to graduates of the Naval Academy at end of four years' course, Pub. Law No. 62-98. 37 Stat. 73 (1912).</ref> Although based on the British [[Royal Navy]] warrant officer ranks that were in place until 1949, the United States had never needed to address an issue of aristocracy, which resulted in warranted officers in the Royal Navy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Naval Officers Guide, 12th ed., L. McComas, US Naval Institute, Annapolis, MD, c2011</ref> However, the United States Navy experienced a similar issue of rank, where highly competent senior noncommissioned officers are required to report to inexperienced junior officers, giving rise to special status to the Navy's chief warrant officers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1975, the Navy ceased using the rank of warrant officer 1 (WO-1), also known as pay grade W-1, because chief petty officers in pay grades E-7 and above with many years in service would lose pay when appointed to the rank of warrant officer.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The Navy appoints their warrant officers directly to the rank of CWO2 (i.e., as chief warrant officers), and are \"commissioned\" officers, with the Navy Personnel Command/Bureau of Personnel (NAVPERSCOM/BUPERS) managing all grades (CWO-2 through CWO-5) by [[Billet#United States usage|billet]]s appropriate for each rank. In past years, some CWOs resigned their warrant commission prior to retirement to receive greater retirement pay at their former senior enlisted rank.<ref>MILPERSMAN 15560.D, OPNAV 1811.3, OPNAV 1820.1</ref> However, this pay disparity has effectively disappeared in recent years and all Navy CWOs now retire at the appropriate officer grade.\n\n====Flying chief warrant officer====\n[[File:US Navy 090910-N-6651N-007 Chief Warrant Officer Leighton DaCosta performs pre-flight set-up on a P-3 Orion during the platform-specific phase of his Chief Warrant Officer Flight Training program at Patrol Squadron (VP) 30.jpg|thumb|350px|CWO2 DaCosta performs pre-flight setup on a [[P-3 Orion|P-3]] during the platform phase of the CWO Flight Training Program (2009)]]\nThe Navy started a test program called the \"Flying Chief Warrant Officer Program\" in 2006 to acquire additional [[naval aviator]]s (pilots) and [[naval flight officer]]s (NFOs), who would fly naval aircraft, but who would not compete with traditional [[unrestricted line]] (URL) officers in [[naval aviation]] for eventual command of squadrons, air wings, air stations, etc., the numbers of such commands which had been greatly reduced in the post-[[Cold War]] era, thereby limiting the command opportunity for URL pilots and NFOs.\n\nEnlisted sailors in the grades E-5 through E-7 who had at least an associate degree and were not currently serving in the diver, master-at-arms, nuclear, SEAL, SWCC, or EOD communities were eligible to apply. Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]]. Those in the VP community would also eventually qualify to fly the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] once that aircraft began replacing the P-3 in 2012. The Navy re-evaluated the program in 2011, when the last of the \"flying\" chief warrant officers reported to their operational fleet squadrons and opted to subsequently terminate the program.<ref name=\"WO-5\"/><ref name=\"public.navy.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navytrng/a/navwarflight.htm |title=Flying CWO Program|accessdate=28 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Reestablishment of warrant officer one ===\n{{Annotated image\n| image = US Navy Cap Devices.png\n| image-width = 390\n| image-left = -29\n| image-top = -277\n| width = 185\n| height = 145\n| float = right\n| annotations =\n| caption = U.S. Navy Warrant Officer\u2013One combination cover device\n}}\nOn 4 June 2018, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] announced the reestablishment of the rank of warrant officer one (pay grade W-1), for cyber warrant officers, and solicited applications for the rank/grade.<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\">[https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2018/NAV18140.txt  MODIFICATION OF THE NAVY CYBER WARRANT OFFICER PROGRAM], [[Chief of Naval Operations]], 2018-06-04</ref> These warrant officers will receive their appointment via warrant and not via [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]].<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\"/> They will incur a six-year service obligation once promoted to W-1.

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level. This was not publicly acknowledged until years later. The Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\nThe last active-duty air force chief warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long, retired in 1980. The last [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] chief warrant officer, CWO4 Bob Barrow, retired in 1992. Upon his retirement, Barrow was honorarily promoted to CWO5, the only person in the Air Force ever to hold this grade.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\n==Coast Guard==\n[[File:US Coast Guard Warrant Officer Specialty Markings-Collar.png|thumb|475px|United States Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer specialty insignia (collar devices)]] Due to the small and decentralized nature of the service, Coast Guard Warrant Officers often fill command roles. Warrant Officers may serve as officers-in-charge of [[Coast Guard Stations]], or even as Command warrant officers. Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.  The Coast Guard does not use the rank of warrant officer (WO-1). Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.<ref>United States Coast Guard.

Reed felt it was time to create a way to connect the parks in the City for cyclists and to provide safe commuter route options. After months of planning with Alderpersons, constituents, City Agencies, and local bike organizations, the first 20 miles of continuous on-street bicycle routes were unveiled in the Spring of 2005.

In-game visuals supplement this sort of specific militaristic theme and environment, portrayed by the flat and somewhat [[cubism|cubist]] character portraits and story sequence images. Blitzkampf is also a follow-up to a previous SUBTLE STYLE release from 2003 called ''Akatsuki Shisei Ichig\u014d'', involving many of the characters from the previous game.\n\nIn terms of Blitzkampf's play style, it is regarded as relatively \"[[old school gamer|old school]]\" in comparison to many other d\u014djin fighter releases such as [[Melty Blood]], [[Eternal Fighter Zero]], or [[Big Bang Beat]], as many of the systems and conventions in the game are rather similar to several late 1990s fighting games created by [[Capcom]]. For example, many players allude to the parry system, which resembles the one from the [[Street Fighter III]] installments. The gratuitous number of extra modes the game provides (such as Survival, Time Attack, or SUGOROKU) and the ways that they are unlocked is largely reminiscent of a console release of an arcade fighting game, further reinforcing the semi-retro feel. In other words, the game focus is upon space control and careful footwork instead of flashy combos and intense aerial combat.\n\nIn ''Ein-Eins'', when activating a burst-like move known as ''Perfekwelt'' via A+C+D, will grant the player increased boosts, such as health regeneration, but no longer be able to use EX or regular Super moves when entering this state. Once the gauge limit of ''Perfekwelt'' depletes, players cannot use EX or regular Supers, until the regular gauge return usable in the next rounds. While in ''Perfekwelt'' state before reaching the gauge limit, players can press A+C+D again to perform a Perfect Super attack while in close proximity. \"En-Eins\" also introduces a forward only air dash, double jump and dash attacks.\n\n==Characters==\n===Introduced in ''Akatsuki Shisei Ichigo''===\n* {{nihongo|'''{{vanchor|Akatsuki}}'''|\u30a2\u30ab\u30c4\u30ad}}: [[Technocracy|High class technical officer]] of the Imperial army.

It re-introduces a new character known as '''Perfecti''' ('''Kanzensha''' in Japan), who was originally a mere alternate version/palette swap of Mycale.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the subtitle is a misspelling of the German phrase \"Auf Achse,\" meaning \"on tour/on the road/on the move\". In fact, the term \"Ausf.\" is short for \"Ausf\u00fchrung\" and has been very common in [[German armoured fighting vehicles of World War II|historic German military nomenclature]], meaning \"option model\" or \"version\". Therefore, \"Ausf. Achse\" literally means \"option model with axle(s)\" or \"moveable/mobile/non-stationary version\". \"Achse\" also translates to \"axis\", and given the game's militaristic style, a very probable translation is \"Akatsuki Flash Fight Axis Edition\".\n\nThe PC version was announced at March 26, 2019. {{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===''En-Eins Perfektewelt''===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = En-Eins Perfektewelt\n| image =\n| caption =\n| developer = Subtle Style<br/>[[Rutubo Games|Rutubo Game Works]]\n| publisher = Subtle Style\n| designer = \n| engine = \n| series =\n| released = {{vgrelease|JP|June 25, 2010<ref name=\"SY2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/114/G011456/20100622071/ |title=\u300c\u30a2\u30ab\u30c4\u30ad\u96fb\u5149\u6226\u8a18\u300d\u306e\u7d9a\u7de8\u304c\u3064\u3044\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3002AC\u300c\u30a8\u30cc\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u5b8c\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u300d\uff0c\u660e\u65e56\u670825\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u7a3c\u50cd\u958b\u59cb |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2010-06-24 |website=[[4Gamer.net]] |access-date=2019-05-22 |language=Japanese}}</ref>}}{{vgrelease|JP|February 22, 2012<ref name=\"Nesica\">{{cite web |url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201202/22010366.html |title=\u904a\u3073\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\uff01\u3000NESiCAxLive\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u7a3c\u50cd\u958b\u59cb |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2012-02-22 |website=[[Famitsu]] |access-date=2019-05-22 |language=Japanese}}</ref>}}<small>(''NESiCAxLive'')</small>\n| genre = [[Versus fighting game|2D fighting game]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms = [[Arcade game|Arcade]]\n}}\n\nSubtle Style developed a sequel to the original game called '''''{{nihongo|En-Eins Perfektewelt|\u30a8\u30cc\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u5b8c\u5168\u4e16\u754c|En-Ain Kanzen Sekai}}''''' in conjunction with [[Rutubo Games|Rutubo Game Works]].

In-game visuals supplement this sort of specific militaristic theme and environment, portrayed by the flat and somewhat [[cubism|cubist]] character portraits and story sequence images. Blitzkampf is also a follow-up to a previous SUBTLE STYLE release from 2003 called ''Akatsuki Shisei Ichig\u014d'', involving many of the characters from the previous game.\n\nIn terms of Blitzkampf's play style, it is regarded as relatively \"[[old school gamer|old school]]\" in comparison to many other d\u014djin fighter releases such as [[Melty Blood]], [[Eternal Fighter Zero]], or [[Big Bang Beat]], as many of the systems and conventions in the game are rather similar to several late 90's fighting games created by [[Capcom]]. For example, many players allude to the parry system, which resembles the one from the [[Street Fighter III]] installments. The gratuitous number of extra modes the game provides (such as Survival, Time Attack, or SUGOROKU) and the ways that they are unlocked is largely reminiscent of a console release of an arcade fighting game, further reinforcing the semi-retro feel. In other words, the game focus is upon space control and careful footwork instead of flashy combos and intense aerial combat.\n\nIn ''Ein-Eins'', when activating a burst-like move known as ''Perfekwelt'' via A+C+D, will grant the player increased boosts, such as health regeneration, but no longer be able to use EX or regular Super moves when entering this state. Once the gauge limit of ''Perfekwelt'' depletes, players cannot use EX or regular Supers, until the regular gauge return usable in the next rounds. While in ''Perfekwelt'' state before reaching the gauge limit, players can press A+C+D again to perform a Perfect Super attack while in close proximity. \"En-Eins\" also introduces a forward only air dash, double jump and dash attacks.\n\n==Characters==\n===Introduced in ''Akatsuki Shisei Ichigo''===\n* {{nihongo|'''{{vanchor|Akatsuki}}'''|\u30a2\u30ab\u30c4\u30ad}}: [[Technocracy|High class technical officer]] of the Imperial army.

It re-introduces a new character known as '''Perfecti''' ('''Kanzensha''' in Japan), who was originally a mere alternate version/palette swap of Mycale.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the subtitle is a misspelling of the German phrase \"Auf Achse,\" meaning \"on tour/on the road/on the move\". In fact, the term \"Ausf.\" is short for \"Ausf\u00fchrung\" and has been very common in [[German armoured fighting vehicles of World War II|historic German military nomenclature]], meaning \"option model\" or \"version\". Therefore, \"Ausf. Achse\" literally means \"option model with axle(s)\" or \"moveable/mobile/non-stationary version\". \"Achse\" also translates to \"axis\", and given the game's militaristic style, a very probable translation is \"Akatsuki Flash Fight Axis Edition\".\n\nThe PC version was announced at March 26, 2019. {{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===''En-Eins Perfektewelt''===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = En-Eins Perfektewelt\n| image =\n| caption =\n| developer = Subtle Style<br/>[[Rutubo Games|Rutubo Game Works]]\n| publisher = Subtle Style\n| designer = \n| engine = \n| series =\n| released = {{vgrelease|JP|June 25, 2010<ref name=\"SY2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/114/G011456/20100622071/ |title=\u300c\u30a2\u30ab\u30c4\u30ad\u96fb\u5149\u6226\u8a18\u300d\u306e\u7d9a\u7de8\u304c\u3064\u3044\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3002AC\u300c\u30a8\u30cc\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u5b8c\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u300d\uff0c\u660e\u65e56\u670825\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u7a3c\u50cd\u958b\u59cb |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2010-06-24 |website=[[4Gamer.net]] |access-date=2019-05-22 |language=Japanese}}</ref>}}{{vgrelease|JP|February 22, 2012<ref name=\"Nesica\">{{cite web |url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201202/22010366.html |title=\u904a\u3073\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\uff01\u3000NESiCAxLive\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u7a3c\u50cd\u958b\u59cb |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2012-02-22 |website=[[Famitsu]] |access-date=2019-05-22 |language=Japanese}}</ref>}}<small>(''NESiCAxLive'')</small>\n| genre = [[Versus fighting game|2D fighting game]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms = [[Arcade game|Arcade]]\n}}\n\nSubtle Style developed a sequel to the original game called '''''{{nihongo|En-Eins Perfektewelt|\u30a8\u30cc\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u5b8c\u5168\u4e16\u754c|En-Ain Kanzen Sekai}}''''' in conjunction with [[Rutubo Games|Rutubo Game Works]].
