This measurement is much more common and more comparable between devices. It is usually measured by inputting a [[sine wave]], [[notch filter]]ing the output, and comparing the ratio between the output signal with and without the sine wave:<ref>[http://www.rane.com/note145.html Rane audio's definition of both THD and THD+N]</ref>\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD\\!\\!+\\!\\!N} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty{\\text{harmonics}} + \\text{noise}}{\\text{fundamental}}\n</math>\n\nLike the THD measurement, this is a ratio of RMS amplitudes,<ref name=\"MT-003\"/><ref>[http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-053.pdf Op Amp Distortion: HD, THD, THD + N, IMD, SFDR, MTPR]</ref> and can be measured as THD<sub>F</sub> (bandpassed or calculated fundamental as the denominator) or, more commonly, as THD<sub>R</sub> (total distorted signal as the denominator).  Audio Precision measurements are THD<sub>R</sub>, for instance.<ref>[http://www.ap.com/solutions/introtoaudiotest/thd+n Introduction to the Basic Six Audio Tests] \"Since the sum of the distortion products will always be less than the total signal, the THD+N Ratio will always be a negative decibel value, or a percent value less than 100%.\"</ref>\n\nA meaningful measurement must include the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of measurement. This measurement includes effects from [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] power line hum, high-frequency interference, [[intermodulation distortion]] between these tones and the fundamental, and so on, in addition to harmonic distortion. For psychoacoustic measurements, a weighting curve is applied such as [[A-weighting]] or [[ITU-R BS.468]], which is intended to accentuate what is most audible to the human ear, contributing to a more accurate measurement.\n\nFor a given input frequency and amplitude, THD+N is reciprocal to [[SINAD]], provided that both measurements are made over the same bandwidth.\n\n==Measurement==\nThe distortion of a [[waveform]] relative to a pure sinewave can be measured either by using a [[THD analyzer]] to [[Fourier analysis|analyse the output wave into its constituent harmonics]] and noting the amplitude of each relative to the fundamental; or by cancelling out the fundamental with a [[notch filter]] and measuring the remaining signal, which will be total aggregate harmonic distortion plus noise.\n\nGiven a sinewave generator of very low inherent distortion, it can be used as input to amplification equipment, whose distortion at different frequencies and signal levels can be measured by examining the output waveform.\n\nThere is electronic equipment both to generate sinewaves and to measure distortion; but a general-purpose [[digital computer]] equipped with a [[sound card]] can carry out harmonic analysis with suitable software. Different software can be used to generate sinewaves, but the inherent distortion may be too high for measurement of very low-distortion amplifiers.\n\n=== Interpretation ===\nFor many purposes different types of harmonics are not equivalent.  For instance, crossover distortion at a given THD is much more audible than clipping distortion at the same THD, since the harmonics produced are at higher frequencies, which are not as easily [[Auditory masking|masked]] by the fundamental.<ref>[http://sound.whsites.net/valves/valve-trans.html#s33 Distortion \u2013 Valves vs. Transistors]</ref>  A single THD number is inadequate to specify audibility, and must be interpreted with care.  Taking THD measurements at different output levels would expose whether the distortion is clipping (which increases with level) or crossover (which decreases with level).\n\nTHD is an average of a number of harmonics equally weighted, even though research performed decades ago identifies that lower order harmonics are harder to hear at the same level, compared with higher order ones. In addition, even order harmonics are said to be generally harder to hear than odd order.<ref>[https://www.gearslutz.com/board/so-much-gear-so-little-time/382595-odd-vs-even-harmonic-distortion.html]</ref> A number of formulas that attempt to correlate THD with actual audibility have been published, however none have gained mainstream use.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Examples==\nFor many standard signals, the above criterion may be calculated analytically in a closed form.<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" /> For example, a pure [[square wave]] has THD<sub>F</sub> equal to\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD_F} \\,= \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,\\pi^2}{8}-1\\,}\\approx \\, 0.483\\,=\\,48.3\\%\n</math>\nThe [[Sawtooth wave|sawtooth signal]] possesses\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD_F} \\,= \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,\\pi^2}{6}-1\\,}\\approx \\, 0.803\\,=\\,80.3\\%\n</math>\nThe pure symmetrical [[triangle wave]] has THD<sub>F</sub> of \n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD_F} \\,= \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,\\pi^4}{96}-1\\,}\\approx\\,0.121\\,= \\, 12.1\\%\n</math>\nFor the rectangular [[pulse train]] with the ''[[duty cycle]]'' ''\u03bc'' (called sometimes the ''cyclic ratio''),\nthe THD<sub>F</sub> has the form\n: <math> \n\\mathrm{THD_F}\\,(\\mu)=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu(1-\\mu)\\pi^2\\,}{2\\sin^2\\pi\\mu}-1\\;}\\,,\\qquad 0<\\mu<1\n</math>\nand logically, reaches the minimum (\u22480.483) when the signal becomes symmetrical ''\u03bc''=0.5, ''i.e.'' the pure [[square wave]].<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" /> Appropriate filtering of these signals may drastically reduce the resulting THD. For instance, the pure [[square wave]] filtered by the [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] of the second-order (with the [[cutoff frequency]] set equal to the fundamental frequency) has THD<sub>F</sub> of 5.3%, while the same signal filtered by the fourth-order filter has THD<sub>F</sub> of 0.6%.<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" /> However, analytic computation of the THD<sub>F</sub> for complicated waveforms and filters often represents a difficult task, and the resulting expressions may be quite laborious to obtain. For example, the closed-form expression for the THD<sub>F</sub> of the [[sawtooth wave]] filtered by the first-order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] is simply\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD_F}\\,= \\,\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,\\pi^2}{3} - \\pi\\coth\\pi\\,}\\,\\approx\\,0.370\\,= \\, 37.0\\%\n</math>\nwhile that for the same signal filtered by the second-order [[Butterworth filter]] is given by \na rather cumbersome formula<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" />\n: <math> \n\\mathrm{THD_F}\\,=\n\\sqrt{\\pi\\,\\frac{\\;\n\\cot\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\\cdot\\coth^{2\\!}\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\n-\\cot^{2\\!}\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\\cdot\\coth\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\n-\\cot\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}} - \\coth\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\\;}\n{\\sqrt{2\\,}\\left(\\!\\cot^{2\\!}\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\n+\\coth^{2\\!}\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\\!\\right)}\n\\,+\\,\\frac{\\,\\pi^2}{3} \\,-\\, 1\\;} \n\\;\\approx\\;0.181\\,= \\, 18.1\\%\n</math>\nYet, the closed-form expression for the THD<sub>F</sub> of the [[pulse train]] filtered by the ''p''th-order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] is even more complicated and has the following form\n: <math> \n\\mathrm{THD_F}\\,(\\mu, p)= \\csc\\pi\\mu\\,\\cdot \\!\\sqrt{\\mu(1-\\mu)\\pi^2-\\,\\sin^2\\!\\pi\\mu\\,\n-\\,\\frac{\\,\\pi}{2}\\sum_{s=1}^{2p} \\frac{\\cot \\pi z_s}{z_s^2} \n\\prod\\limits_{\\scriptstyle l=1\\atop\\scriptstyle l\\neq s}^{2p}\\!\\frac{1}{\\,z_s-z_l\\,}\\,\n+\\,\\frac{\\,\\pi}{2}\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\sum_{s=1}^{2p} \\frac{e^{i\\pi z_s(2\\mu-1)}}{z_s^2\\sin \\pi z_s} \n\\prod\\limits_{\\scriptstyle l=1\\atop\\scriptstyle l\\neq s}^{2p}\\!\\frac{1}{\\,z_s-z_l\\,}\\,}\n</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc'' is the [[duty cycle]], 0<''\u03bc''<1,  and \n: <math> \nz_l\\equiv \\exp{\\frac{i\\pi(2l-1)}{2p}}\\,, \\qquad l=1, 2,\\ldots, 2p \n</math>\nsee<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" /> for more details.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Audio system measurements]]\n* [[Signal-to-noise ratio]]\n* [[Timbre]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-thd.htm Conversion: Distortion attenuation in dB to distortion factor THD in %]\n* [http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/appnote/1GA56 Swept Harmonic Distortion Measurements]\n* [http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/appnote/1GA55 Harmonic Distortion Measurements in the Presence of Noise]\n\n[[Category:Electrical parameters]]\n[[Category:Audio amplifier specifications]]\n", "text_old": "The '''total harmonic distortion''' ('''THD''' or '''THDi''') is a measurement of the [[harmonic distortion]] present in a signal and is defined as the ratio of the sum of the powers of all harmonic components to the power of the [[fundamental frequency]].

It is usually measured by inputting a [[sine wave]], [[notch filter]]ing the output, and comparing the ratio between the output signal with and without the sine wave:<ref>[http://www.rane.com/note145.html Rane audio's definition of both THD and THD+N]</ref>\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD\\!\\!+\\!\\!N} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty{\\text{harmonics}} + \\text{noise}}{\\text{fundamental}}\n</math>\n\nLike the THD measurement, this is a ratio of RMS amplitudes,<ref name=\"MT-003\"/><ref>[http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-053.pdf Op Amp Distortion: HD, THD, THD + N, IMD, SFDR, MTPR]</ref> and can be measured as THD<sub>F</sub> (bandpassed or calculated fundamental as the denominator) or, more commonly, as THD<sub>R</sub> (total distorted signal as the denominator).  Audio Precision measurements are THD<sub>R</sub>, for instance.<ref>[http://www.ap.com/solutions/introtoaudiotest/thd+n Introduction to the Basic Six Audio Tests] \"Since the sum of the distortion products will always be less than the total signal, the THD+N Ratio will always be a negative decibel value, or a percent value less than 100%.\"</ref>\n\nA meaningful measurement must include the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of measurement. This measurement includes effects from [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] power line hum, high-frequency interference, [[intermodulation distortion]] between these tones and the fundamental, and so on, in addition to harmonic distortion. For psychoacoustic measurements, a weighting curve is applied such as [[A-weighting]] or [[ITU-R BS.468]], which is intended to accentuate what is most audible to the human ear, contributing to a more accurate measurement.\n\nFor a given input frequency and amplitude, THD+N is reciprocal to [[SINAD]], provided that both measurements are made over the same bandwidth.\n\n==Measurement==\nThe distortion of a [[waveform]] relative to a pure sinewave can be measured either by using a [[THD analyzer]] to [[Fourier analysis|analyse the output wave into its constituent harmonics]] and noting the amplitude of each relative to the fundamental; or by cancelling out the fundamental with a [[notch filter]] and measuring the remaining signal, which will be total aggregate harmonic distortion plus noise.\n\nGiven a sinewave generator of very low inherent distortion, it can be used as input to amplification equipment, whose distortion at different frequencies and signal levels can be measured by examining the output waveform.\n\nThere is electronic equipment both to generate sinewaves and to measure distortion; but a general-purpose [[digital computer]] equipped with a [[sound card]] can carry out harmonic analysis with suitable software. Different software can be used to generate sinewaves, but the inherent distortion may be too high for measurement of very low-distortion amplifiers.\n\n=== Interpretation ===\nFor many purposes different types of harmonics are not equivalent.  For instance, crossover distortion at a given THD is much more audible than clipping distortion at the same THD, since the harmonics produced are at higher frequencies, which are not as easily [[Auditory masking|masked]] by the fundamental.<ref>[http://sound.whsites.net/valves/valve-trans.html#s33 Distortion \u2013 Valves vs. Transistors]</ref>  A single THD number is inadequate to specify audibility, and must be interpreted with care.  Taking THD measurements at different output levels would expose whether the distortion is clipping (which increases with level) or crossover (which decreases with level).\n\nTHD is an average of a number of harmonics equally weighted, even though research performed decades ago identifies that lower order harmonics are harder to hear at the same level, compared with higher order ones. In addition, even order harmonics are said to be generally harder to hear than odd order.<ref>[https://www.gearslutz.com/board/so-much-gear-so-little-time/382595-odd-vs-even-harmonic-distortion.html]</ref> A number of formulas that attempt to correlate THD with actual audibility have been published, however none have gained mainstream use.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Examples==\nFor many standard signals, the above criterion may be calculated analytically in a closed form.<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" /> For example, a pure [[square wave]] has THD<sub>F</sub> equal to\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD_F} \\,= \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,\\pi^2}{8}-1\\,}\\approx \\, 0.483\\,=\\,48.3\\%\n</math>\nThe [[Sawtooth wave|sawtooth signal]] possesses\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD_F} \\,= \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,\\pi^2}{6}-1\\,}\\approx \\, 0.803\\,=\\,80.3\\%\n</math>\nThe pure symmetrical [[triangle wave]] has THD<sub>F</sub> of \n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD_F} \\,= \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,\\pi^4}{96}-1\\,}\\approx\\,0.121\\,= \\, 12.1\\%\n</math>\nFor the rectangular [[pulse train]] with the ''[[duty cycle]]'' ''\u03bc'' (called sometimes the ''cyclic ratio''),\nthe THD<sub>F</sub> has the form\n: <math> \n\\mathrm{THD_F}\\,(\\mu)=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu(1-\\mu)\\pi^2\\,}{2\\sin^2\\pi\\mu}-1\\;}\\,,\\qquad 0<\\mu<1\n</math>\nand logically, reaches the minimum (\u22480.483) when the signal becomes symmetrical ''\u03bc''=0.5, ''i.e.'' the pure [[square wave]].<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" /> Appropriate filtering of these signals may drastically reduce the resulting THD. For instance, the pure [[square wave]] filtered by the [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] of the second-order (with the [[cutoff frequency]] set equal to the fundamental frequency) has THD<sub>F</sub> of 5.3%, while the same signal filtered by the fourth-order filter has THD<sub>F</sub> of 0.6%.<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" /> However, analytic computation of the THD<sub>F</sub> for complicated waveforms and filters often represents a difficult task, and the resulting expressions may be quite laborious to obtain. For example, the closed-form expression for the THD<sub>F</sub> of the [[sawtooth wave]] filtered by the first-order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] is simply\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{THD_F}\\,= \\,\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\,\\pi^2}{3} - \\pi\\coth\\pi\\,}\\,\\approx\\,0.370\\,= \\, 37.0\\%\n</math>\nwhile that for the same signal filtered by the second-order [[Butterworth filter]] is given by \na rather cumbersome formula<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" />\n: <math> \n\\mathrm{THD_F}\\,=\n\\sqrt{\\pi\\,\\frac{\\;\n\\cot\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\\cdot\\coth^{2\\!}\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\n-\\cot^{2\\!}\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\\cdot\\coth\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\n-\\cot\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}} - \\coth\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\\;}\n{\\sqrt{2\\,}\\left(\\!\\cot^{2\\!}\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\n+\\coth^{2\\!}\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\,}}\\!\\right)}\n\\,+\\,\\frac{\\,\\pi^2}{3} \\,-\\, 1\\;} \n\\;\\approx\\;0.181\\,= \\, 18.1\\%\n</math>\nYet, the closed-form expression for the THD<sub>F</sub> of the [[pulse train]] filtered by the ''p''th-order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth low-pass filter]] is even more complicated and has the following form\n: <math> \n\\mathrm{THD_F}\\,(\\mu, p)= \\csc\\pi\\mu\\,\\cdot \\!\\sqrt{\\mu(1-\\mu)\\pi^2-\\,\\sin^2\\!\\pi\\mu\\,\n-\\,\\frac{\\,\\pi}{2}\\sum_{s=1}^{2p} \\frac{\\cot \\pi z_s}{z_s^2} \n\\prod\\limits_{\\scriptstyle l=1\\atop\\scriptstyle l\\neq s}^{2p}\\!\\frac{1}{\\,z_s-z_l\\,}\\,\n+\\,\\frac{\\,\\pi}{2}\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\sum_{s=1}^{2p} \\frac{e^{i\\pi z_s(2\\mu-1)}}{z_s^2\\sin \\pi z_s} \n\\prod\\limits_{\\scriptstyle l=1\\atop\\scriptstyle l\\neq s}^{2p}\\!\\frac{1}{\\,z_s-z_l\\,}\\,}\n</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc'' is the [[duty cycle]], 0<''\u03bc''<1,  and \n: <math> \nz_l\\equiv \\exp{\\frac{i\\pi(2l-1)}{2p}}\\,, \\qquad l=1, 2,\\ldots, 2p \n</math>\nsee<ref name=\"iaroslav_04\" /> for more details.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Audio system measurements]]\n* [[Signal-to-noise ratio]]\n* [[Timbre]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-thd.htm Conversion: Distortion attenuation in dB to distortion factor THD in %]\n* [http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/appnote/1GA56 Swept Harmonic Distortion Measurements]\n* [http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/appnote/1GA55 Harmonic Distortion Measurements in the Presence of Noise]\n\n[[Category:Electrical parameters]]\n[[Category:Audio amplifier specifications]]\n", "name_user": "Skvery", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDefinitions and examples", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion"}

Furthermore, Great Exuma wasn't a private or remote island, and the festival site was scheduled to take place in an abandoned resort development full of roads that led nowhere. McFarland never announced the change; he just simply renamed the island \"Fyre Cay\". With no infrastructure and no villas, the team had just under two months to turn Roker Point into Fyre Cay.\n\nOn December 12, 2016, [[Kendall Jenner]], [[Emily Ratajkowski]] and other [[influencer marketing|influencers]] paid by Fyre simultaneously posted to their [[Instagram]] feeds a video with a thumbnail consisting of an orange square and a logo made of stylized flames. Clicking the thumbnail played the video, showing [[Bella Hadid]] and other models represented by her agency running around a tropical beach. Text with the video promised \"an immersive music festival ... two transformative weekends ... on the boundaries of the impossible\". This was the beginning of the Fyre Festival's promotional campaign.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nAn investor, fashion executive Carola Jain, reportedly arranged for Fyre to receive a $4 million loan, which the company used most of to rent luxurious offices in Manhattan's [[Tribeca]] neighborhood. With no experience staging an event of the proposed festival's scale, McFarland began approaching companies that did, and was reportedly taken aback when informed the event would cost at least $50 million to stage in the time available as he had promised. Furthermore, the more experienced consultants told them that in addition to the cost, an event of this magnitude would have needed an extra year to plan. He and his associates at Fyre believed it would cost far less and continued with their plans under that assumption. The organizers tried to do things themselves where possible; McFarland supposedly learned how to rent the stage by doing a [[Google Search]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nIn the days leading up to the festival, they cut expenses extensively, having learned that the luxury villas were going to cost $10 million alone, and targeted deposits for the bands, food, infrastructure and staff.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBPg5ftCMv8&t=453s</ref>\n\nScheduled for two weekends in April and May 2017, the event sold day tickets from {{usd|500}} to {{usd|1,500}}, and [[Very important person|VIP]] packages including airfare and luxury tent accommodation for {{usd|12,000}}.

However, when Fyre told him they would stage the event in the spring anyway, Lavi told them to abandon plans for temporary villas and instead erect tents, the only accommodation that could be delivered in the time remaining.

When they were kicked off of Norman's Cay, they only had four months before their inaugural festival on April 28-30th. \nAfter several small islands that seemed like likely venues were turned down, and with only two months to go before the Fyre Festival, the Bahamian government gave McFarland a permit to use a site set aside for development at [[Roker Point]] ({{coord|23.6350|N|75.9188|W|display=inline,title}}) on [[Great Exuma]], just north of the [[Sandals Resorts|Sandals Resort]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\">{{cite news|last=Burrough|first=Bryan|authorlink=Bryan Burrough|title=Fyre Festival: Anatomy of a Millennial Marketing Fiasco Waiting To Happen|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/fyre-festival-billy-mcfarland-millennial-marketing-fiasco|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=June 2017|accessdate=August 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223221555/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/fyre-festival-billy-mcfarland-millennial-marketing-fiasco|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Material released on social media continued to promote the falsehood that the Festival was being hosted on Pablo Escobar's private island, with maps of the site altered to make it appear as if Roker Point was an island unto itself.<ref name=\"Netflix\" /> \n\nIn reality, the Festival was in a remote parking lot north of a Sandals Resort and a nearby marina where locals store their boats. Furthermore, Great Exuma wasn't a private or remote island, and the festival site was scheduled to take place in an abandoned resort development full of roads that led nowhere. McFarland never announced the change; he just simply renamed the island \"Fyre Cay\". With no infrastructure and no villas, the team had just under two months to turn Roker Point into Fyre Cay.\n\nOn December 12, 2016, [[Kendall Jenner]], [[Emily Ratajkowski]] and other [[influencer marketing|influencers]] paid by Fyre simultaneously posted to their [[Instagram]] feeds a video with a thumbnail consisting of an orange square and a logo made of stylized flames. Clicking the thumbnail played the video, showing [[Bella Hadid]] and other models represented by her agency running around a tropical beach. Text with the video promised \"an immersive music festival ... two transformative weekends ... on the boundaries of the impossible\". This was the beginning of the Fyre Festival's promotional campaign.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nAn investor, fashion executive Carola Jain, reportedly arranged for Fyre to receive a $4 million loan, which the company used most of to rent luxurious offices in Manhattan's [[Tribeca]] neighborhood. With no experience staging an event of the proposed festival's scale, McFarland began approaching companies that did, and was reportedly taken aback when informed the event would cost at least $50 million to stage in the time available as he had promised. Furthermore, the more experienced consultants told them that in addition to the cost, an event of this magnitude would have needed an extra year to plan. He and his associates at Fyre believed it would cost far less and continued with their plans under that assumption. The organizers tried to do things themselves where possible; McFarland supposedly learned how to rent the stage by doing a [[Google Search]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nIn the days leading up to the festival, they cut expenses extensively, having learned that the luxury villas were going to cost $10 million alone, and targeted deposits for the bands, food, infrastructure and staff.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBPg5ftCMv8&t=453s</ref>\n\nScheduled for two weekends in April and May 2017, the event sold day tickets from {{usd|500}} to {{usd|1,500}}, and [[Very important person|VIP]] packages including airfare and luxury tent accommodation for {{usd|12,000}}.

To make matters worse, organizers of the Fyre Festival planned their first event for April 28-30th, the same weekend as the [[Exuma Regatta]], a Bahamian sailing race series that utilized all of the island\u2019s hotels, vacation rentals and resources.\n\nWhile the festival's promotional material kept claiming that the festival would be held on a remote private island that once belonged to drug trafficker [[Pablo Escobar]], workers were busy preparing Roker Point for the festival, scattering sand over its rocks and improving a road to a nearby beach, where they built some [[cabana (structure)|cabanas]] and installed [[swing set]]s.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\"/>\n\nOn the mainland, 5,000 tickets had been sold, and an air service was hired to charter festival-goers from Miami.

He assumed they would postpone the event to November as they had been discussing since they were not ready. However, when Fyre told him they would stage the event in the spring anyway, Lavi told them to abandon plans for temporary villas and instead erect tents, the only accommodation that could be delivered in the time remaining. Lavi advised Fyre to make this clear to those who had already bought tickets, as otherwise it would be damaging to their brand. He says the company assured him that an email was being prepared, but he was not sure if it was sent.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\n[[Comcast Ventures]] considered investing $25 million in the Fyre app, which McFarland apparently hoped would allow him to finance the festival, but declined days beforehand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-04/comcast-rejected-funding-days-before-fyre-festival|title=Comcast Rejected Funding Days Before Doomed Fyre Festival|first=Polly|last=Mosendz|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=May 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122044146/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-04/comcast-rejected-funding-days-before-fyre-festival|archive-date=January 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Reportedly, McFarland had valued Fyre Media at $90 million but was unable to provide sufficient proof of that when Comcast requested it.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, one of the event organizers later noted that since at least mid-March there were significant problems with the planning, and at one point it was suggested they reschedule the 2017 festival until 2018.<ref name=\"The Cut\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/04/fyre-festival-exumas-bahamas-disaster.html|title=I Worked at Fyre Festival.

Cumulus clouds may appear by themselves, in lines, or in clusters.\n\nCumulus clouds are often precursors of other types of clouds, such as [[Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]], when influenced by weather factors such as [[atmospheric instability|instability]], moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapour, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as [[List of cloud types|cumulonimbiform]] due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top.<ref name=\"LANDSAT identification\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ntis.gov/search/product.aspx?ABBR=E7610277 | title=The identification of cloud types in LANDSAT MSS images |author1=Barrett, E.C. |author2=Grant, C.K. | year=1976 | accessdate=2012-08-22 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}</ref> There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise [[stratocumulus]] (low-[[wikt:\u00e9tage|\u00e9tage]]), [[altocumulus]] (middle-\u00e9tage) and [[cirrocumulus]] (high-\u00e9tage).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap08/cumuliform.html|title=Cumuliform Clouds: Some Examples|last=Geerts|first=B|date=April 2000|work=Resources in Atmospheric Sciences|publisher=University of Wyoming College of Atmospheric Sciences|accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.<ref name=\"LANDSAT identification\"/>\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:Bubbles in the Sky.ogv|thumb|right|Cumulus clouds forming over the [[Congo River basin]]]]\nCumulus clouds form via [[atmospheric convection]] as air warmed by the surface begins to rise. As the air rises, the temperature drops (following the [[lapse rate]]), causing the [[relative humidity]] (RH) to rise. If convection reaches a certain level the RH reaches one hundred percent, and the \"wet-adiabatic\" phase begins. At this point a positive feedback ensues: since the RH is above 100%, water vapor condenses, releasing [[latent heat]], warming the air and spurring further convection.\n\nIn this phase, water vapor condenses on various nuclei present in the air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds.<ref name=\"USA Today\">{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/wcumulus.htm|work=Weather|title=Cumulus clouds|accessdate=16 October 2012|date=16 October 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"Stommel91\">{{harvnb|Stommel|1947|p=91}}</ref> The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere and the presence of any [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversions]].<ref name=\"Mossop632-634\">{{harvnb|Mossop|Hallett|1974|pp=632&ndash;634}}</ref> During the convection, surrounding air is [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrained]] (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.<ref name=\"Langmuir175\" />\nRain forms in a cumulus cloud via a [[Cloud physics|process]] involving two non-discrete stages. The first stage occurs after the droplets coalesce onto the various nuclei. Langmuir writes that surface tension in the water droplets provides a slightly higher pressure on the droplet, raising the [[vapor pressure]] by a small amount. The increased pressure results in those droplets evaporating and the resulting water vapor condensing on the larger droplets. Due to the extremely small size of the evaporating water droplets, this process becomes largely meaningless after the larger droplets have grown to around 20&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s, and the second stage takes over.<ref name=\"Langmuir175\">{{harvnb|Langmuir|1948|p=175}}</ref> In the accretion phase, the raindrop begins to fall, and other droplets collide and combine with it to increase the size of the raindrop.

These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after [[cold front]]s. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect a large amount of the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect.<ref name=\"Wood2374\">{{harvnb|Wood|2012|p=2374}}</ref> Stratocumulus clouds can produce [[drizzle]], which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing.<ref name=\"Wood2398\">{{harvnb|Wood|2012|p=2398}}</ref> Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.\n\n=== Cumulonimbus clouds ===\n{{main article|Cumulonimbus cloud}}\nCumulonimbus clouds are the final form of growing cumulus clouds. They form when ''cumulus congestus'' clouds develop a strong [[updraft]] that propels their tops higher and higher into the atmosphere until they reach the [[tropopause]] at {{convert|18000|m|ft}} in altitude. Cumulonimbus clouds, commonly called thunderheads, can produce high winds, torrential rain, lightning, gust fronts, [[waterspout]]s, [[funnel cloud]]s, and tornadoes.

Their name derives from the [[Latin]] ''cumulo-'', meaning ''heap'' or ''pile''.<ref name=\"CRH-NOAA\" /> Cumulus clouds are low-level clouds, generally less than {{cvt|2000|m}} in altitude unless they are the more vertical [[cumulus congestus]] form. Cumulus clouds may appear by themselves, in lines, or in clusters.\n\nCumulus clouds are often precursors of other types of clouds, such as [[Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]], when influenced by weather factors such as [[atmospheric instability|instability]], moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapour, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature.

As the air rises, the temperature drops (following the [[lapse rate]]), causing the [[relative humidity]] (RH) to rise. If convection reaches a certain level the RH reaches one hundred percent, and the \"wet-adiabatic\" phase begins. At this point a positive feedback ensues: since the RH is above 100%, water vapor condenses, releasing [[latent heat]], warming the air and spurring further convection.\n\nIn this phase, water vapor condenses on various nuclei present in the air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds.<ref name=\"USA Today\">{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/wcumulus.htm|work=Weather|title=Cumulus clouds|accessdate=16 October 2012|date=16 October 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"Stommel91\">{{harvnb|Stommel|1947|p=91}}</ref> The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere and the presence of any [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversions]].<ref name=\"Mossop632-634\">{{harvnb|Mossop|Hallett|1974|pp=632&ndash;634}}</ref> During the convection, surrounding air is [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrained]] (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.<ref name=\"Langmuir175\" />\nRain forms in a cumulus cloud via a [[Cloud physics|process]] involving two non-discrete stages.

This [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV adaptation is \"inspired by\" the 1971 [[William Peter Blatty]] best-selling novel. In this update, the demon that tortured Regan/Angela as a girl did not die as it did at the end of the feature film, and it now inhabits one of Angela and Henry's daughters. Once again, they must turn to exorcism-practicing priests ([[Alfonso Herrera]] and [[Ben Daniels]]) for help. Regan/Angela's mother, Chris MacNeil (played by recurring guest star [[Sharon Gless]] and [[Ellen Burstyn]] in the feature film), is welcomed by the rest of the family but utterly scorned by her own daughter.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2015}}\nRuck married Claudia Stefany in 1984, and they had two children: a daughter, Emma, and a son, Sam.

Since [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexing Crimea]] in 2014, the [[Russian Federation]] has administered Sevastopol as a [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]]. Nevertheless, [[Ukraine]] and most of the UN member countries continue to regard Sevastopol as a [[city with special status]] within Ukraine. The population is made up of mostly Russians with small numbers of Ukrainians and Tatars.\n\nSevastopol has a population of {{Crimea-census2014|393,304|punct=,}} concentrated mostly near the [[Sevastopol Bay]] and surrounding areas. The location and navigability of the city's harbours have made Sevastopol a strategically important [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and [[Sevastopol Naval Base|naval base]] throughout history. The city has been a home to the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]], which is why it was considered as a separate city in Crimea of significant military importance and was once operated by the Soviet Union as a [[closed city]].\n\nAlthough relatively small at {{convert|864|km2}}, Sevastopol's unique naval and maritime features have been the basis for a robust economy. The city enjoys mild winters and moderate warm summers, characteristics that help make it a popular [[seaside resort]] and [[tourism|tourist]] destination, mainly for visitors [[Commonwealth of Independent States|from the former Soviet republics]]. The city is also an important centre for [[marine biology]] research. In particular, [[dolphin]]s have been studied and trained in the city by the military since the end of [[World War II]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of Sevastopolis was originally chosen in the same [[etymology|etymological]] trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula; it was intended to express its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of the Greek adjective, {{lang |grc|\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} (''[[sebastos]]'', 'venerable') and the noun {{lang |grc|\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}} (''p\u00f3lis'') ('city'). {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} is the traditional Greek equivalent ([[Sebastian (name)|Sebastian]]) of the Roman honorific ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, [[Augustus]] and later awarded as a title to his successors.\n\nDespite its Greek origin, the name is not from Ancient Greek times. The city was probably named after Empress (\"[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]\") [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of the [[Russian Empire]] who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787, accompanied by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.\n\nIn the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], founded in the 5th{{citation needed| date= December 2012}} (or 4th) century BC by settlers from [[Heraclea Pontica]]. This name means \"peninsula\", reflecting its immediate location. It is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: ''Cherson\u0113sos [[Taurica|Taurik\u0113]]'' (\"the [[Tauri]]an Peninsula\").\n\nThe name of the city is spelled as:\n* In English, the current prevalent spelling of the name is ''Sevastopol''; the previously common spelling ''Sebastopol'' is still used by some publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''.

The Greek city of [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesus]] existed for almost two thousand years, first as an independent democracy and later as part of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was sacked by the [[Golden Horde]] several times and was finally totally abandoned.

The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain [[Fyodor Ushakov]] who in 1788 was named commander of the [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and of the Black Sea squadron.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sevastopol.info/history/hist_first.htm|title=\u041e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f (Osnovaniye i razvitiye Sevastopolya) |trans-title=Foundation and development of Sevastopol | publisher = Sevastopol.info|date=28 May 2007| accessdate=26 April 2010|language=Russian}}</ref> It became an important [[naval base]] and later a commercial [[seaport]]. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], the military stronghold was again renamed to Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.\n\nOne of the most notable events involving the city is the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)]] carried out by the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Piedmont|Piedmontese]], and [[Ottoman Turkey|Turkish]] troops during the [[Crimean War]], which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians chose to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nA [[panorama]] of the siege originally was created by [[Franz Roubaud]]. After its destruction in 1942 during World War II, it was restored and is currently housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation at the height of the siege, on 18 June 1855.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941\u201342, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the [[Battle of Sevastopol]]. German forces used [[railway artillery]]\u2014including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre ''[[Schwerer Gustav]]''\u2014and [[Karl-Ger\u00e4t|specialised mobile heavy mortars]] to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the [[Maxim Gorky Fortresses]]. After fierce fighting, which lasted for 250 days, the supposedly untakable{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} fortress city finally fell to Axis forces in July 1942. It was intended to be renamed to \"''Theoderichshafen''\" (in reference to [[Theoderic the Great]] and the fact that the Crimea had been home to Germanic [[Goths]] until the 18th or 19th century) in the event of a German victory against the Soviet Union, and like the rest of the Crimea was designated for future colonisation by the Third Reich. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the [[Hero City]] title a year later.\n\n===Sevastopol as part of Ukrainian SSR===\nDuring the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, Sevastopol became a so-called \"[[closed city]]\".

The city is designated a special city-region of Ukraine which besides the city itself includes several of its outlying settlements. The city itself is concentrated mostly at the western portion of the region and around the long [[Bay of Sevastopol]]. This bay is a [[ria]], a river canyon drowned by [[Holocene]] sea-level rise, and the outlet of [[Chorna River (Crimea)|Chorna River]]. Away in a remote location southeast of Sevastopol is located the former city of [[Balaklava]] (since 1957 incorporated within Sevastopol), the bay of which in Soviet times served as a main port for the Soviet diesel-powered submarines.\n\nThe coastline of the region is mostly rocky, in a series of smaller bays, a great number of which are located within the Bay of Sevastopol. The biggest of them are the Southern Bay (within Bay of Sevastopol), the Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consists of the Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, the Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.\n\nThrough the region flow three rivers: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha. All three mountain chains of [[Crimean mountains]] are represented in Sevastopol, the southern chain by the Balaklava Highlands, the inner chain by the Mekenziev Mountains, and the outer chain by the Kara-Tau Upland (Black Mountain).\n\n===Climate===\nSevastopol has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa''),<ref name=\"koppen\">{{cite journal| last=Kottek | first=M.|author2=J.

Many top architects and civil engineers from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other cities and thousands of workers from all parts of the USSR took part in the rebuilding process which was mostly finished by the mid-1950s. The downtown core situated on a peninsula between two narrow inlets, South Bay and Artillery Bay, features mostly Mediterranean-style, three-story residential buildings with columned balconies and Venetian-style arches, with retail and commercial spaces occupying the ground level. Some carefully restored landmarks date back to the early 20th century (e.g., the Art Nouveau Main Post Office on Bolshaya Morskaya St and the Art Museum on Nakhimovsky Prospect). It has been a long-time tradition for the residents of surrounding suburbs to spend summer evenings by coming to the downtown area for a leisurely stroll with their families along the avenues and boulevards encircling the Central Hill, under the Sevastopol chestnut trees, and usually ending up on the waterfront with its Marine Boulevard.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nDue to its military history, most streets in the city are named after Russian and Soviet military heroes.

[[Crimean Peninsula]] and a major [[Black Sea]] port. Since [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexing Crimea]] in 2014, the [[Russian Federation]] has administered Sevastopol as a [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]]. Nevertheless, [[Ukraine]] and most of the UN member countries continue to regard Sevastopol as a [[city with special status]] within Ukraine. The population is made up of mostly Russians with small numbers of Ukrainians and Tatars.\n\nSevastopol has a population of {{Crimea-census2014|393,304|punct=,}} concentrated mostly near the [[Sevastopol Bay]] and surrounding areas. The location and navigability of the city's harbours have made Sevastopol a strategically important [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and [[Sevastopol Naval Base|naval base]] throughout history. The city has been a home to the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]], which is why it was considered as a separate city in Crimea of significant military importance and was once operated by the Soviet Union as a [[closed city]].\n\nAlthough relatively small at {{convert|864|km2}}, Sevastopol's unique naval and maritime features have been the basis for a robust economy. The city enjoys mild winters and moderate warm summers, characteristics that help make it a popular [[seaside resort]] and [[tourism|tourist]] destination, mainly for visitors [[Commonwealth of Independent States|from the former Soviet republics]]. The city is also an important centre for [[marine biology]] research. In particular, [[dolphin]]s have been studied and trained in the city by the military since the end of [[World War II]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of Sevastopolis was originally chosen in the same [[etymology|etymological]] trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula; it was intended to express its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of the Greek adjective, {{lang |grc|\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} (''[[sebastos]]'', 'venerable') and the noun {{lang |grc|\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}} (''p\u00f3lis'') ('city'). {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}} is the traditional Greek equivalent ([[Sebastian (name)|Sebastian]]) of the Roman honorific ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, [[Augustus]] and later awarded as a title to his successors.\n\nDespite its Greek origin, the name is not from Ancient Greek times. The city was probably named after Empress (\"[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]\") [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of the [[Russian Empire]] who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787, accompanied by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.\n\nIn the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], founded in the 5th{{citation needed| date= December 2012}} (or 4th) century BC by settlers from [[Heraclea Pontica]]. This name means \"peninsula\", reflecting its immediate location. It is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: ''Cherson\u0113sos [[Taurica|Taurik\u0113]]'' (\"the [[Tauri]]an Peninsula\").\n\nThe name of the city is spelled as:\n* In English, the current prevalent spelling of the name is ''Sevastopol''; the previously common spelling ''Sebastopol'' is still used by some publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''. In English, the current spelling also has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|s|\u0259|\u02c8|v|\u00e6|s|t|\u0259|p|o\u028a|l}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|s|\u025b|v|\u0259|\u02c8|s|t|o\u028a|p|\u0259l}},<ref name=OED-US>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Sevastopol|title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word |work = Oxford Dictionary  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref> whilst the former spelling has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|s|\u1d7b|\u02c8|b|\u00e6|s|t|\u0259|p|\u0259l|,_|-|p|\u0252|l}}<ref name=OED-b>{{cite web |url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Sebastopol | title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word | work = Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref> or {{IPAc-en|s|\u0259|\u02c8|b|\u00e6|s|t|\u0259|p|o\u028a|l|,_|-|p|\u0252|l}}.<ref name=OED-US-b>{{cite web |url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Sebastopol | title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word | work = Oxford Dictionary  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref>\n* {{Lang-uk|\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c}}; {{Lang-ru|\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0301\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c}}, pronounced {{IPA-uk|sew\u0250\u02c8st\u0254pol\u02b2|}} in Ukrainian and {{IPA-ru |s\u02b2\u026av\u0250\u02c8stop\u0259l\u02b2|}}<ref name=OED>{{cite web |url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Sevastopol | title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word | work = Oxford Dictionary  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref> in Russian.\n* {{lang-crh|Aqyar}}, pronounced {{IPA-tt|aq\u02c8jar|}}.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Crimea}}\n\n[[File:Sevastopol 04-14 img36 Chersonesus.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the ancient Greek theatre in [[Chersonesos Taurica]]]]\n\n{{Quote box |width=23em |align=left |bgcolor=#B0D4DE\n|title=Historical affiliations\n|fontsize=85% |quote=<poem>\nChersonesus founded in 6th century BC\nHellenic Colonies 6th century BC \u2013 480 BC\n[[Bosporan Kingdom]] 480 BC \u2013 107 BC\n[[Kingdom of Pontus]] 107 BC \u2013 63 BC\n[[Roman Republic]] 63 BC\u201327 BC\n[[Roman Empire]] 27 BC \u2013 330\n[[Byzantine Empire]] 330\u20131204\n[[Empire of Trebizond]] 1204\u20131461\n[[Principality of Theodoro]] 1461\u20131475\n[[Crimean Khanate]] 1475\u20131783 (Ottoman vassal from 1478 to 1774)\n[[Russian Empire]] 1783\u20131917\nFounded as Sevastopol in 1783\n[[Russian Republic]] 1917\n[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] ([[Soviet Union]]) 1917\u20131942\n[[Nazi Germany]] 1942\u20131944\n[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] ([[Soviet Union]]) 1944\u20131954\n[[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] ([[Soviet Union]]) 1954\u20131991\n[[Ukraine]] 1991\u20132014 (''de jure'' \u2013 present)\n[[Russia|Russian Federation]] 2014\u2013present\n</poem>\n}}\n\nIn the 6th century BC, a Greek colony was established in the area of the modern-day city.

In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was sacked by the [[Golden Horde]] several times and was finally totally abandoned.

Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.\n\nOne of the most notable events involving the city is the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)]] carried out by the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Piedmont|Piedmontese]], and [[Ottoman Turkey|Turkish]] troops during the [[Crimean War]], which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians chose to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nA [[panorama]] of the siege originally was created by [[Franz Roubaud]]. After its destruction in 1942 during World War II, it was restored and is currently housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation at the height of the siege, on 18 June 1855.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941\u201342, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the [[Battle of Sevastopol]]. German forces used [[railway artillery]]\u2014including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre ''[[Schwerer Gustav]]''\u2014and [[Karl-Ger\u00e4t|specialised mobile heavy mortars]] to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the [[Maxim Gorky Fortresses]]. After fierce fighting, which lasted for 250 days, the supposedly untakable{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} fortress city finally fell to Axis forces in July 1942. It was intended to be renamed to \"''Theoderichshafen''\" (in reference to [[Theoderic the Great]] and the fact that the Crimea had been home to Germanic [[Goths]] until the 18th or 19th century) in the event of a German victory against the Soviet Union, and like the rest of the Crimea was designated for future colonisation by the Third Reich. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the [[Hero City]] title a year later.\n\n===Sevastopol as part of Ukrainian SSR===\nDuring the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, Sevastopol became a so-called \"[[closed city]]\".

The city is designated a special city-region of Ukraine which besides the city itself includes several of its outlying settlements. The city itself is concentrated mostly at the western portion of the region and around the long [[Bay of Sevastopol]]. This bay is a [[ria]], a river canyon drowned by [[Holocene]] sea-level rise, and the outlet of [[Chorna River (Crimea)|Chorna River]]. Away in a remote location southeast of Sevastopol is located the former city of [[Balaklava]] (since 1957 incorporated within Sevastopol), the bay of which in Soviet times served as a main port for the Soviet diesel-powered submarines.\n\nThe coastline of the region is mostly rocky, in a series of smaller bays, a great number of which are located within the Bay of Sevastopol. The biggest of them are the Southern Bay (within Bay of Sevastopol), the Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consists of the Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, the Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.\n\nThrough the region flow three rivers: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha. All three mountain chains of [[Crimean mountains]] are represented in Sevastopol, the southern chain by the Balaklava Highlands, the inner chain by the Mekenziev Mountains, and the outer chain by the Kara-Tau Upland (Black Mountain).\n\n===Climate===\nSevastopol has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa''),<ref name=\"koppen\">{{cite journal| last=Kottek | first=M.|author2=J.

Some carefully restored landmarks date back to the early 20th century (e.g., the Art Nouveau Main Post Office on Bolshaya Morskaya St and the Art Museum on Nakhimovsky Prospect). It has been a long-time tradition for the residents of surrounding suburbs to spend summer evenings by coming to the downtown area for a leisurely stroll with their families along the avenues and boulevards encircling the Central Hill, under the Sevastopol chestnut trees, and usually ending up on the waterfront with its Marine Boulevard.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nDue to its military history, most streets in the city are named after Russian and Soviet military heroes.
