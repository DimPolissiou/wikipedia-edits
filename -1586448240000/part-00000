[[Chymosin]], its key component, is a [[protease|protease enzyme]] that [[curdling|curdles]] the [[casein]] in [[milk]].  In addition to chymosin, rennet contains other enzymes, such as [[pepsin]] and a [[lipase]].\n\nRennet is used to separate milk into solid [[curds]] (for [[cheesemaking]]) and liquid [[whey]], and so it or its substitutes is used in the production of most [[cheese]]s.\n\n==Molecular action of rennet enzymes==\nOne of the main actions of rennet is its [[protease]] [[chymosin]] cleaving the kappa [[casein]] chain.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thecourtyarddairy.co.uk/blog/cheese-musings-and-tips/rennet-in-cheese-the-science-how-rennet-works/ | title=Rennet in cheese - the science: How rennet works| date=2013-06-12}}</ref> Casein is the main protein of [[Milk#Proteins|milk]]. Cleavage causes casein to stick to other cleaved casein molecules and form a network. It can cluster better in the presence of calcium and phosphate, which is why it is occasionally added in cheese making especially from calcium phosphate-poor goat milk. The solid truncated casein protein network traps other components of milk, such as fats and minerals, to create cheese.\n\n==Extraction of calf rennet==\n[[calf (animal)|Calf]] rennet is extracted from the inner [[mucosa]] of the fourth stomach chamber (the [[abomasum]]) of young, nursing calves as part of livestock butchering. These stomachs are a [[byproduct]] of [[veal]] production.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Traditional Cheesemaking Manual |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mCBrre1_7I4C&dq=traditional+extraction+of+calf+rennet |last=O'Connor. |first=C. |publisher=ILRI|isbn=9789290532736 |date=1993-01-01 }}</ref> If rennet is extracted from older calves ([[grass]]-fed or [[grain]]-fed), the rennet contains less or no [[chymosin]], but a high level of [[pepsin]] and can only be used for special types of milk and cheeses. As each ruminant produces a special kind of rennet to digest the milk of its own [[species]], milk-specific rennets are available, such as kid goat rennet for [[goat]]'s milk and [[domestic sheep|lamb]] rennet for [[sheep]]'s milk.\n\n=== Traditional method ===\nDried and cleaned stomachs of young calves are sliced into small pieces and then put into salt water or [[whey]], together with some [[vinegar]] or [[wine]] to lower the [[pH]] of the solution. After some time (overnight or several days), the solution is filtered. The crude rennet that remains in the filtered solution can then be used to coagulate milk.  About 1&nbsp;g of this solution can normally coagulate 2 to 4 [[litre|L]] of milk.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Brined_Cheeses.html?id=lM-mtPn9WwoC|title=Brined Cheeses|last=Tamime|first=Adnan Y.|date=2008-04-15|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7164-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern method ===\nDeep-frozen stomachs are milled and put into an enzyme-extracting solution. The crude rennet extract is then activated by adding acid; the enzymes in the stomach are produced in an [[Zymogen|inactive form]] and are activated by the [[stomach acid]]. The acid is then [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] and the rennet extract is filtered in several stages and concentrated until reaching a typical potency of about 1:15,000; meaning 1&nbsp;g of extract can coagulate 15&nbsp;kg of milk.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOne kg of rennet extract has about 0.7 g of active enzymes \u2013 the rest is water and salt and sometimes [[sodium benzoate]] ([[E211]]),\n0.5% - 1.0% for preservation. Typically, 1&nbsp;kg of cheese contains about 0.0003 g of rennet enzymes.\n\n==Alternative sources==\nBecause of the limited availability of mammalian stomachs for rennet production, cheese makers have sought other ways to coagulate milk since at least [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.

These molds are produced in a [[fermenter]] and then specially concentrated and purified to avoid contamination with unpleasant byproducts of the mold growth.\n\nThe traditional view is that these coagulants result in bitterness and low yield in cheese, especially when aged for a long time. Over the years{{when|date=September 2019}}, microbial coagulants have improved a lot, largely due to the characterization and purification of secondary enzymes responsible for bitter peptide formation/non-specific proteolytic breakdown in cheese aged for long periods. Consequently, it has become possible to produce several high-quality cheeses with microbial rennet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmbtrade.it/img/1421845498_MarzymeTM.pdf|title=Marzyme Microbial Coagulant|website=BMBtrade.it|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nIt is also suitable for the elaboration of [[vegan]] cheese, provided no animal-based ingredients are used in its production.\n\n=== Fermentation-produced chymosin===\n\nBecause of the above imperfections of microbial and animal rennets, many producers sought other replacements of rennet. With genetic engineering it became possible to isolate rennet genes from animals and introduce them into certain [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], or [[yeasts]] to make them produce chymosin during fermentation. The genetically modified microorganism is killed after fermentation and chymosin isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers does not contain a GMO or any GMO DNA. FPC is identical to chymosin made by an animal, but is produced in a more efficient way. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and, because the quantity needed per unit of milk can be standardized, are commercially viable alternatives to crude animal or plant rennets, as well as generally preferred to them.<ref name=\"Law 2010 100\u2013101\">{{cite book|last=Law|first=Barry A.|title=Technology of Cheesemaking|year=2010|publisher=WILEY-BLACKWELL|location=UK|isbn=978-1-4051-8298-0|pages=100\u2013101|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405182989.html}}</ref>\n\nOriginally created by biotechnology company [[Pfizer]], FPC was the first artificially-produced enzyme to be registered and allowed by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]].<ref>{{cite news|title=FDA Approves 1st Genetically Engineered Product for Food|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-24/news/mn-681_1_genetically-engineered-product-for-food|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=24 March 1990}}</ref><ref name=chymosinCase>Staff, National Centre for Biotechnology Education, 2006.

[[Chymosin]], its key component, is a [[protease|protease enzyme]] that [[curdling|curdles]] the [[casein]] in [[milk]].  In addition to chymosin, rennet contains other enzymes, such as [[pepsin]] and a [[lipase]].\n\nRennet is used to separate milk into solid [[curds]] (for [[cheesemaking]]) and liquid [[whey]], and so it or its substitutes is used in the production of most [[cheese]]s.\n\n==Molecular action of rennet enzymes==\nOne of the main actions of rennet is its [[protease]] [[chymosin]] cleaving the kappa [[casein]] chain.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thecourtyarddairy.co.uk/blog/cheese-musings-and-tips/rennet-in-cheese-the-science-how-rennet-works/ | title=Rennet in cheese - the science: How rennet works| date=2013-06-12}}</ref> Casein is the main protein of [[Milk#Proteins|milk]]. Cleavage causes casein to stick to other cleaved casein molecules and form a network. It can cluster better in the presence of calcium and phosphate, which is why it is occasionally added in cheese making especially from calcium phosphate-poor goat milk. The solid truncated casein protein network traps other components of milk, such as fats and minerals, to create cheese.\n\n==Extraction of calf rennet==\n[[calf (animal)|Calf]] rennet is extracted from the inner [[mucosa]] of the fourth stomach chamber (the [[abomasum]]) of young, nursing calves as part of livestock butchering. These stomachs are a [[byproduct]] of [[veal]] production.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Traditional Cheesemaking Manual |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mCBrre1_7I4C&dq=traditional+extraction+of+calf+rennet |last=O'Connor. |first=C. |publisher=ILRI|isbn=9789290532736 |date=1993-01-01 }}</ref> If rennet is extracted from older calves ([[grass]]-fed or [[grain]]-fed), the rennet contains less or no [[chymosin]], but a high level of [[pepsin]] and can only be used for special types of milk and cheeses. As each ruminant produces a special kind of rennet to digest the milk of its own [[species]], milk-specific rennets are available, such as kid goat rennet for [[goat]]'s milk and [[domestic sheep|lamb]] rennet for [[sheep]]'s milk.\n\n=== Traditional method ===\nDried and cleaned stomachs of young calves are sliced into small pieces and then put into salt water or [[whey]], together with some [[vinegar]] or [[wine]] to lower the [[pH]] of the solution. After some time (overnight or several days), the solution is filtered. The crude rennet that remains in the filtered solution can then be used to coagulate milk.  About 1&nbsp;g of this solution can normally coagulate 2 to 4 [[litre|L]] of milk.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Brined_Cheeses.html?id=lM-mtPn9WwoC|title=Brined Cheeses|last=Tamime|first=Adnan Y.|date=2008-04-15|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7164-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern method ===\nDeep-frozen stomachs are milled and put into an enzyme-extracting solution. The crude rennet extract is then activated by adding acid; the enzymes in the stomach are produced in an [[Zymogen|inactive form]] and are activated by the [[stomach acid]]. The acid is then [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] and the rennet extract is filtered in several stages and concentrated until reaching a typical potency of about 1:15,000; meaning 1&nbsp;g of extract can coagulate 15&nbsp;kg of milk.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOne kg of rennet extract has about 0.7 g of active enzymes \u2013 the rest is water and salt and sometimes [[sodium benzoate]] ([[E211]]),\n0.5% - 1.0% for preservation. Typically, 1&nbsp;kg of cheese contains about 0.0003 g of rennet enzymes.\n\n==Alternative sources==\nBecause of the limited availability of mammalian stomachs for rennet production, cheese makers have sought other ways to coagulate milk since at least [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.

Over the years{{when|date=September 2019}}, microbial coagulants have improved a lot, largely due to the characterization and purification of secondary enzymes responsible for bitter peptide formation/non-specific proteolytic breakdown in cheese aged for long periods. Consequently, it has become possible to produce several high-quality cheeses with microbial rennet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmbtrade.it/img/1421845498_MarzymeTM.pdf|title=Marzyme Microbial Coagulant|website=BMBtrade.it|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nIt is also suitable for the elaboration of [[vegan]] cheese, provided no animal-based ingredients are used in its production.\n\n=== Fermentation-produced chymosin===\n\nBecause of the above imperfections of microbial and animal rennets, many producers sought other replacements of rennet. With genetic engineering it became possible to isolate rennet genes from animals and introduce them into certain [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], or [[yeasts]] to make them produce chymosin during fermentation. The genetically modified microorganism is killed after fermentation and chymosin isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers does not contain a GMO or any GMO DNA. FPC is identical to chymosin made by an animal, but is produced in a more efficient way. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and, because the quantity needed per unit of milk can be standardized, are commercially viable alternatives to crude animal or plant rennets, as well as generally preferred to them.<ref name=\"Law 2010 100\u2013101\">{{cite book|last=Law|first=Barry A.|title=Technology of Cheesemaking|year=2010|publisher=WILEY-BLACKWELL|location=UK|isbn=978-1-4051-8298-0|pages=100\u2013101|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405182989.html}}</ref>\n\nOriginally created by biotechnology company [[Pfizer]], FPC was the first artificially-produced enzyme to be registered and allowed by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]].<ref>{{cite news|title=FDA Approves 1st Genetically Engineered Product for Food|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-24/news/mn-681_1_genetically-engineered-product-for-food|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=24 March 1990}}</ref><ref name=chymosinCase>Staff, National Centre for Biotechnology Education, 2006.

His father, M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4t\u011f\u00e4rif M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4t\u011f\u00e4lim ul\u0131 Tuqay\u0131v, had been a village ''mandative mullah'' since 1864. In 1885 his wife died, leaving him a son and a daughter, and M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4t\u011f\u00e4rif married second wife, M\u00e4md\u00fcd\u00e4, daughter of [[\u00d6\u00e7ile]] village mullah Zinn\u00e4tulla Z\u00e4ynepb\u00e4\u015fir ul\u0131. On 29 August O.S. M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4t\u011f\u00e4rif died when \u011eabdulla was five months old. Soon \u011eabdulla's grandfather also died and M\u00e4md\u00fcd\u00e4 was forced to return to her father and then to marry the mullah of the village of Sasna. Little \u011eabdulla lived for some time with an old woman in his native village, before his new stepfather agreed to take Tuqay into his family. Tuqay's relatively happy childhood did not last long: on O.S. 18 January 1890 \u011eabdulla's mother M\u00e4md\u00fcd\u00e4 also died, and Tuqay was removed to his poor grandfather Zinn\u00e4tulla. Lacking enough food even for his own children, his grandfather sent \u011eabdulla to Kazan with a coachman. There the coachman took Tuqay to a market-place, Pe\u00e7\u00e4n Bazaar, hoping to find someone willing to adopt the child. A tanner named M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4tw\u00e4li and his wife \u011e\u00e4ziz\u00e4 from the Ya\u00f1a-Bist\u00e4 area of [[Kazan]] decided to take care of him. While living in [[Kazan]], Tuqay was taken ill with [[walleye]]. When 1892, when both of \u011eabdulla's adoptive parents became sick they had to send him back to his grandfather. This time, \u011eabdulla's grandfather sent the child for further adoption to the village of [[Q\u0131rlay]], where \u011eabdulla stayed with the family of a peasant S\u00e4\u011fdi. During his stay with this family, \u011eabdulla was sent to the local [[madrassah]] (religious school), for the first time in his life, where, in his own words, his enlightenment began.\n\nIn the fall of 1895, the \u011eosmanovs, Tatar merchants living in [[Uralsk]], decided to adopt their distant relatives, because their own children had died. \u011e\u00e4li\u00e4s\u011far \u011eosmanov and his wife \u011e\u00e4ziz\u00e4, \u011eabdulla's aunt, asked a peasant from Qu\u015flaw\u0131\u00e7 to bring them \u011eabdulla. The peasant took ten-year-old Tuqay away from S\u00e4\u011fdi, threatening him with Russian papers and the village constable. Living in Uralsk, \u011eabdulla attended to ''Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00eda'' madrassah. Simultaneously, in 1896, he started to attend a Russian school. There, for the first time in his life, he became acquainted with the world of Russian literature and started to write poetry. In 1899 the anniversary of [[Alexander Pushkin]] was widely celebrated in Uralsk, an event which inspired Tuqay's interest in Russian poetry, especially works by Pushkin.\n\n\u011eosmanov tried to interest \u011eabdulla in his work, but Tuqay stayed indifferent to the merchant's lot, preferring to develop his education. On 30 July 1900 \u011e\u00e4li\u00e4s\u011far \u011eosmanov died of \"stomach diseases\", so Tuqay moved into the madrassah itself, living first in common room, and two years later in a ''khujra'', an individual cell. In the madrassah Tuqay proved himself a diligent student, completing in ten years a program intended for fifteen. However, he continued to live in poverty.\n\nBy 1902, \u011eabdulla, age 16, had changed his nature. He lost interest in studying the [[Qur'an]], and showed criticism to all that was taught in madrassah. He didn't shave his hair, he drank beer and even smoked. At the same time, he became more interested in poetry.<ref name=\"nurullin\">{{in lang|ru}} \u0422\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0439. \u0418. \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d.

In the madrassah itself he became familiar with Arabic, Persian and Turkish poetry, as well as poetry in the [[Old Tatar language]] of the earlier centuries. In 1900 ''Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00eda'' graduate, a Tatar poet [[Mirx\u00e4yd\u00e4r \u00c7ulpan\u00ed]] visited the madrassah. \u011eabdulla met him and \u00c7ulpan\u00ed became the first living poet to impress Tuqay. \u00c7ulpan\u00ed wrote in \"elevated style\", using ''[[aruz]]'', an Oriental poetic system, and mostly in [[Old Tatar language]], full of Arab, Persian and Turkish words, and rather distant from the [[Tatar language]] itself. In 1902-1903 he met a Turkish poet [[Abd\u00fclveli]], concealed himself there from [[Abdul Hamid II]] pursuits. Thus, Tuqay adopted Oriental poetic tradition.\n\nYoung teacher, the son of headmaster, [[Kamil Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed|Kamil \"Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed\" T\u00f6xf\u00e4tullin]], organized wallpaper ''M\u00e4\u011f\u00e4rif'' (''The Education'') and hand-written journals. The first odes of Tuqay were published there, and he was referred as \"the first poet of the madrassah\".\n\nIn 1904 Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed founded his own publishing company, and Tuqay became clerk there. He combined this job with teaching younger shakirds in the madrassah. He introduced [[Jadid|new methods]], typical for the Russian school.\n\nAfter the [[October Manifesto]] of 1905 it became possible to publish [[newspaper]]s in the Tatar language, which was strictly forbidden earlier. However, Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed wasn't enough solvent to open his own newspaper, so he bought the Russian language newspaper ''Uralets'' with typography, to print also a Tatar newspaper there. Tuqay became a typesetter. The newspaper was named ''Fiker'' (''The Thought''). Then Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed started to issue ''\u00c4l\u011fasr\u00e4lcadid'' (''The New Century'') magazine. Tuqay sent his first verses there to be published. At the same time he started writing for a newspaper and began participating in the publishing of several Tatar magazines. At day Tuqay worked in typography (he was already a proofreader), but by nights he wrote verses, so every issue of ''Fiker'', ''Nur'' and ''\u00c4l\u011fasr\u00e4lcadid'' contains his writing. More over, he wrote articles, novels and feuilletons for those periodicals, he translated [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]] fables for the magazine. It is also known that Tuqay spread social-democratic leaflets and translated social-democratic brochure to the Tatar language.\n\nDespite social-democrats' negative attitude towards the Manifesto, in his verses Tuqay admired with Manifesto, believing in the progressive changes of the Tatar lifestyle. During that period he shared his views with liberals, as the long-standing tradition of the Tatar enlightenment didn't distinguished national-liberation movement from the class struggle and negated the class struggle within Tatar nation. The most prominent writings of that period are ''Mill\u00e4t\u00e4'' (''To the Nation'') poem and ''Bezne\u00f1 mill\u00e4t, \u00fclg\u00e4nme, \u00e4ll\u00e4 yoqla\u011fan \u011f\u0131nam\u0131?'' (''Has our nation dead, or just sleeps?'') article. Since the satirical magazine ''Uqlar'' (''The Arrows'') appeared in Uralsk, Tuqay renowned himself as satirist. The main target of his jeers was Muslim clergy, who stayed opposed to progress and Europeanization. As for the language of the most of his verses, it still stayed the Old Tatar language and continued the Oriental traditions, such as in ''Pu\u015fkin\u00e4'' (''To Pushkin''). However, in some of them, directed to the Tatar peasantry a pure Tatar was used, what was newly for the Tatar poetry.\n\nIn January 1906 police conducted a search of the typography, as rebellious articles were published in the newspaper. The [[First State Duma]] was dismissed, the revolution came to naught. The ultra-right Russian nationalists from the [[Black Hundred]] proposed that Tatars [[emigration|emigrate]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. That period his most prominent verses devoted to the social themes and patriotism were composed: ''Gosudarstvennaya Duma\u011fa'' (''To the State Duma''), ''Sor\u0131qortlar\u011fa'' (''To the Parasites'') and ''Kitmibez!'' (''We don\u2019t leave!''). Tuqay was disappointed in liberalism and sympathized with socialists, especially [[Esers]]. In ''Kitmibez!'' he answered to the [[Black Hundred]] that the Tatars are a brother people of the Russians and immigration to Turkey is impossible.\n\nOn 6 January 1907 Tuqay left madrassah, as his fee permitted him to live independently, and settled in a hotel room. He became an actual editor of ''Uqlar'', being the lead poet and publicist of all Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed's periodicals. That time liberal ''Fiker'' and Tuqay himself was in confrontation with Qadimist, i.e. ultraconservative ''Bayan al-Xaq'', which even called for [[pogrom]] of liberal press activists. However, that year he was surprisingly discharged, as the result of the conflict with Kamil Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed and instigation of the typography workers for a strike to raise a salary. On 22 February 1907 Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed was deprived of publishing rights and his publishers was sold to merchant, who attracted Tuqay to the work again, but sonly dismissed the periodicals.\n\nThat time Tuqay departed from the social-democrats and politics generally, preferring to devote himself to poetry. Since mid-1906 to autumn 1907 more than 50 verses were written, as well as 40 articles and feuilletons. That time he turned to a pure Tatar, using a spoken language. Impressed by Pushkin's fairy-tale poem ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'', Tuqay wrote his first poem, ''[[\u015e\u00fcr\u00e4le]]''.\n\nIt is known, that Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed tried to establish another newspaper, ''Ya\u00f1a Torm\u0131\u015f'' (''The New Life'') in Uralsk, with Tuqay as one of constitutors, but that time \u011eabdulla was already so popular in the Tatar society, that chief editors from Kazan, the Tatar cultural capital, offered him job. Moreover, Tuqay should be examined by a draft board in his native [[uyezd]], and he left Uralsk anyway. The admiration with the future trends of his life in Kazan is expressed in ''Par at'' (''The Pair of Horses''), which consequently became the most associated with Kazan Tatar verse.<ref name=\"nurullin\"/>\n\n===Kazan period===\n[[Image:Tuqay portrait.jpg|200px|thumb|\u011eabdulla Tuqay]][[Image:Yalt-yolt.jpg|thumb|''Yalt-Yolt'' cover]][[Image:Tuqay in hospital.jpg|200px|thumb|\u011eabdulla Tuqay in hospital, 1913.]]\n\nJust after the arrival to Kazan, Tuqay stayed at ''Bol\u011far'' hotel and met Tatar literature intelligentsia, such as playwright and ''Yold\u0131z'' newspaper secretary [[\u011e\u00e4li\u00e4s\u011far Kamal]] and prominent Tatar poet and ''Ta\u00f1 yold\u0131z\u0131'' newspaper chief editor [[S\u00e4\u011fit R\u00e4miev]]. Several days after he left Kazan to be examined by a draft board, assembly point being in [[Bolshaya Atnya|\u00c4tn\u00e4]] village. There he was discarded due his poor health and walleye and freed up of serving in the [[Russian Imperial Army]]. He returned to Kazan and renowned his literature and publishing activity.\n\nHe was adopted to the editorial staff of democratically oriented ''\u00c4l-\u0130slax'' gazette, led by [[Fatix \u00c4mirxan]] and [[Wafa B\u00e4xti\u00e4rev]]. However, the newspaper had a little budget. Tuqay had got fixed up as a [[forwarding agent (philately)|forwarding agent]] in ''Kitap'' publishers, to provide guaranteed wage. Moreover, he refused offer from ''\u00c4xbar'', an organ of [[Ittifaq al-Muslimin]], a political party, close to [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]], as well as other offers from rich, but right newspapers. He also continued self-education: read Russian classics, critiques, and studied German language. He was interested in studying the life of common people by visiting bazaars and pubs.\n\nTuqay's room in ''Bol\u011far'' hotel was frequently visited by admirers from \"[[gilded youth]]\". As he wrote, their boozing-up impeded him and his creation. Nevertheless, in the end of 1907-1908 he wrote nearby sixty verses and twenty articles in ''\u00c4l-\u0130slax'' and satirical journal ''Y\u00e4\u015fen'' (''The Illumination''), and also published two books of verses. The most prominent satire of that period was ''Pe\u00e7\u00e4n Bazar\u0131 yaxud Ya\u00f1a Kisekba\u015f'' (''The Hay Bazaar or New Ki\u015fekba\u015f''), deriding problems of the Tatar society of the period, clergy and merchant class.\n\nAs for Tuqay's personal life, there is known little about it. As usual he avoided women in his circle. It is known that he was enamored of Z\u00e4yt\u00fcn\u00e4 M\u00e4wl\u00fcdova, his 15-year-old admirer. Several verses were devoted to Z\u00e4yt\u00fcn\u00e4 and their feelings, such as ''A Strange Love''. However, later Tuqay did not develop their relations, and the possible reason was inferiority complex, attributed to his health and financial position.\n\nIn May 1908 an article, comparing Tuqay's, R\u00e4miev's and [[Majit Ghafuri]]'s  poetries was published in Russian-language ''Volzhsko-Kamsky Vestnik''. In August 1908 Kamal founded satirical journal ''Y\u00e4\u015fen'' under Tuqay's pressure. The most of published works were written by Tuqay, of course. In August 1908 Kamal and Tuqay visit the [[Makaryev Fair]], placed in [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. There Tuqay temporarily joined the first Tatar theatre troupe, ''[[S\u00e4yyar]]'', singing national songs and declaiming his verses from scene. On 14 October \u011eabdulla Tuqay presented his new satirical poem ''The Hay Bazaar or New Kisekba\u015f'', based on classical Old Tatar poem ''Kisekba\u015f''. In own poem he derided nationalism among Tatars, as well as [[W\u00e4isi movement|W\u00e4isi sect's]] fanatics, associating sect's leader, [[\u011eaynan W\u00e4isev]] with [[Di\u00fc]], an evil spirit from ''Kisekba\u015f''.<ref name=\"nurullin\"/>\n\n===1909-1910 crisis===\n\nIn 1909-1910 all freedoms, gained by 1905 revolution came to naught under [[Pyotr Stolypin|Stolypin]]'s policy. As a result, leftist sympathized \u011eabdulla Tuqay was nearly disappointed in his activity and was in depression. Another reason was in his friends, moved to rightist newspapers, like Kamal and R\u00e4miev. The most of his verses were depressive, however, Tuqay stayed productive, he published nearby hundred verses, two fairy tale poems, autobiography, and an article about Tatar folklore (''Xal\u0131q \u00e4d\u00e4bi\u00e4te'', i.e. ''Folk Literature''), wrote thirty feuilletons and printed twenty books, not only with own poems, but also compiled of folk songs.\n\nIn those years Tuqay became staunch leftist, despite of his staying with one bourgeois family for some time: ''\u00c4l-\u0130slax'' became a leftist political newspaper only, Tuqay criticized all his former friends, turned to the right or liberal newspapers: Zarif B\u00e4\u015firi from Oremburgean ''\u00c7\u00fcke\u00e7'' and S\u00e4\u011fit R\u00e4miev from ''B\u00e4y\u00e4nelxaq''. He called them bourgeoisie's stooges, in response their stigmatized Tuqay [[Russophilia|Russophile]]. The same time [[Okhrana]] reported his poems as [[Russophobia|Russophobic]]. Also Tuqay became closer to the first Tatar Marxist, [[X\u00f6s\u00e4yen Yama\u015fev]].\n\nIn June 1909 ''Y\u00e4\u015fen'', was closed due to financial problems as well as censorship requirement, as well as ''\u00c4l-\u0130slax''. Being at the top of his crisis, he thinks about suicide, but since March 1910 a new satirical magazine, ''Yal-Yolt'' (''The Lightning'') was published in Kazan under \u00c4xm\u00e4t Urman\u00e7iev.\n\nBeing interested in [[Leo Tolstoy]] ideas and legacy, Tuqay felt keenly the death of the Russian genius. Pointing out a high role of children's education, he prepared two books for children, and two schoolbooks of Tatar literature. In total, he composed more than fifty verses and seven poems for children.<ref name=\"nurullin\"/>\n\n=== Ufa - Saint-Petersburg - Troitsk ===\n\nIn 1911 Qadimist forces allied with Okhrana fulminated ''\u0130j-Bub\u00ed'', the most progressive Tatar madrassah. This fact filled with indignation all Tatar intelligentsia. But it was only a beginning of campaign drive against Tatar democracy, which became Tuqay's tragedy again. However, as it known from Tuqay's letters to his friend [[S\u00e4\u011fit S\u00f6n\u00e7\u00e4l\u00e4y]], he decided to write the Tatar [[Eugene Onegin]], but he had to recover his health. He planned a trip to the southern regions to receive [[kumiss]] therapy there.\n\nIn April he left Kazan and had a voyage by the [[Volga]] to [[Astrakhan]]. There he met R\u00e4miev and became reconciled with him. Three weeks later he moved to Kalmyk Bazary village and stayed with schoolteacher \u015eahit \u011e\u00e4yfi there. As \u011e\u00e4yfi was interested in photography, they shot a series of cards, devoted to Tuqay's poems and the Tatar theatre. Returning to Kazan, he published, ''Mi\u00e4wbik\u00e4'' (''Pussycat''), his prominent poem for children. There he applied new poetic methods, and was criticized therefore. He also was interested to publish his prohibited verses in the newspaper of the Russian Muslims, published in Paris, but later he refused of this idea, as the newspaper propagated pan-Islamist ideas.\n\nIn autumn 1911 a famine stroke [[Idel-Ural]]. ''The Autumn Wind'' was devoted to the famine and hard lot of peasantry. Tuqay felt ill with malaria and unfortunately moved to cold hotel number. So, he abandoned all and moved to [[\u00d6\u00e7ile]], to his relatives. There he passed winter, writing o recomposing his verses, sometimes sending new feuilletons to the editors. Possible, another reason of his departure was a trial of his book, published as early as in 1907. He returned in February 1912. In March 1912 his friend, Yama\u015fev dead of infarction and Tuqay devoted a feeling poem (''X\u00f6rm\u00e4tle X\u00f6s\u00e4yen y\u00e4dk\u00e2re'', i.e. ''Of Blessed Memory of X\u00f6s\u00e4yen'') to the first Tatar Marxist.\n\nIn April \u011eabdulla Tuqay went on a tour again. First he arrived to [[Ufa]], where he met [[Majit Ghafuri]]. Then he left Ufa and moved to [[Saint-Petersburg]]. He stayed with [[Musa Bigiev]]. In Saint Petersburg he met with local Tatar diaspora's youth, many of whom were students and leftist activists. The impression of them is expressed in ''The Tatar Youth'' (''Tatar y\u00e4\u015fl\u00e4re'') verse, full of optimism. However, he didn't know that he has the last stage of tuberculosis: a doctor, examined him in Saint Petersburg, preferred to keep diagnosis back. He was advised to take a course in Switzerland, but he refused and after farewell party moved to Ufa again, and then to [[Troitsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Troitsk]]. There he lived till July 1912 among the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nomads in the steppe, receiving [[kumiss]] therapy.<ref name=\"nurullin\"/>\n\n===Death===\n\nHis last year he began full of optimism: the revolutionary tendencies rose, and social theme appeared in his poetry again. In ''A\u00f1'' (''The Consciousness'') and ''Dahig\u00e4'' (''To the Genius'') he wrote that his struggle was not vain, as well as 1905 revolution. Many verses were devoted to the peasantry's problems, resembling [[Nekrasov]]'s poetry. More and more verses were banned; some of them were published only after the [[October Revolution]]. However, Tuqay was criticized by [[\u011e\u00e4limcan \u0130brahimov]], that now his poetry became poor.\n\nIn summer 1912 he published his last book, ''The Mental Food'', where 43 verses and one poem were collected. But then his health has become worse. In spite of this, he found energy to write for the new literature magazine ''A\u00f1'' and democratic newspaper ''Qoya\u015f'' (''The Sun''), edited by [[Fatix \u00c4mirxan]]. As \u00c4mirxan was paralyzed, they both stayed in neighboring numbers of ''Amur'' hotel, where the editorial board was situated. In first days of 1913 he wrote ''The Frost'', a witty poem depicting how Kazaners of different social classes behave during frost. The next notable poem was devoted to the [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty]]. The poem was rather panegyrical, so the vulgar-sociological critique of the early 1920s, based on this poem, proclaimed Tuqay to be a pan-Islamist and Tsarist. However, the end of the verse is written not about Tsar's dynasty, but about internationalism within Russian and eternal friendship of Tatars and Russians.\n\nOn 26 February 1913, \u011eabdulla Tuqay was hospitalized due to a severe case of tuberculosis. Even in the Klyachkinskaya hospital he never stopped writing poems for Tatar newspapers and magazines. Those poems were both social and philosophical. In March he wrote his literature testament, ''The First Deed after the Awakening''. In hospital Tuqay became interested in Tolstoy's legacy again, devoting to him two verses. He read more about [[Volga Bulgaria]]\u2019s history as well as all Kazan periodic.\nOn 15 April of the same year, \u011eabdulla Tuqay died at the age of 27<ref name=\"nurullin\"/> and was buried in Tatar cemetery. {{coord|55.760223|49.106168}}\n\n==Legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Metro Tukay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mosaic]] with image of \u011eabdulla Tuqay on [[Kazan Metro]] station \"[[Ploshchad Tukaya (Kazan Metro)|Ploshchad Tukaya]]\"]] -->\nDespite of denial of Tuqay's genius during the early Soviet years, he soon became renowned as the greatest Tatar poet. His name transcended across the arts, with the [[Tatar State Symphony Orchestra]] dedicated to Tuqay's name. During the Soviet rule his most cited were his social poems, whereas now the most popular are poems about [[Tatarstan]] nature, Tatar national culture, music, history and, of course,  the [[Tatar language]]. 26 April, his birthday, is celebrated as ''The Day of Tatar Language'', and his poem ''\u0130, Tu\u011fan tel'' (''Oh My Mother Tongue!'') is the unofficial hymn of the Tatar language.\n\n===Excerpt, \"Oh My Mother Tongue!\"<ref>Tuqay, \u011eabdulla, and Sab\u0131rcan Badretdin, trans. http://kitapxane.noka.ru/authors/tuqay/oh_my_mothir_tongui {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322144930/http://kitapxane.noka.ru/authors/tuqay/oh_my_mothir_tongui |date=22 March 2007 }}</ref>===\n\n:\n:Oh, beloved native language\n:Oh, enchanting mother tongue!\n:You enabled my search for knowledge\n:Of the world, since I was young\n\n:As a child, when I was sleepless\n:Mother sung me lullabies\n:And my grandma told me stories\n:Through the night, to shut my eyes\n\n:Oh, my tongue!

In 1885 his wife died, leaving him a son and a daughter, and M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4t\u011f\u00e4rif married second wife, M\u00e4md\u00fcd\u00e4, daughter of [[\u00d6\u00e7ile]] village mullah Zinn\u00e4tulla Z\u00e4ynepb\u00e4\u015fir ul\u0131. On 29 August O.S. M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4t\u011f\u00e4rif died when \u011eabdulla was 5 months old. Soon \u011eabdulla's grandfather also died and M\u00e4md\u00fcd\u00e4 was forced to return to her father and then to get married to the mullah of the village of Sasna. Little \u011eabdulla lived for some time with an old woman in his native village, before his new stepfather agreed to take Tuqay into his family. Tuqay's relatively happy childhood did not last long: on O.S. 18 January 1890 \u011eabdulla's mother M\u00e4md\u00fcd\u00e4 also died, and Tuqay was removed to his poor grandfather Zinn\u00e4tulla. Lacking enough food even for his own children, his grandfather sent \u011eabdulla to Kazan with a coachman. There the coachman took Tuqay to a market-place, Pe\u00e7\u00e4n Bazaar, hoping to find someone willing to adopt the child. A tanner named M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4tw\u00e4li and his wife \u011e\u00e4ziz\u00e4 from the Ya\u00f1a-Bist\u00e4 area of [[Kazan]] decided to take care of him. While living in [[Kazan]], Tuqay was taken ill with [[walleye]]. When 1892, when both of \u011eabdulla's adoptive parents became sick they had to send him back to his grandfather. This time, \u011eabdulla's grandfather sent the child for further adoption to the village of [[Q\u0131rlay]], where \u011eabdulla stayed with the family of a peasant S\u00e4\u011fdi. During his stay with this family, \u011eabdulla was sent to the local [[madrassah]] (religious school), for the first time in his life, where, in his own words, his enlightenment began.\n\nIn the fall of 1895, the \u011eosmanovs, Tatar merchants living in [[Uralsk]], decided to adopt their distant relatives, because their own children had died. \u011e\u00e4li\u00e4s\u011far \u011eosmanov and his wife \u011e\u00e4ziz\u00e4, \u011eabdulla's aunt, asked a peasant from Qu\u015flaw\u0131\u00e7 to bring them \u011eabdulla. The peasant took ten-year-old Tuqay away from S\u00e4\u011fdi, threatening him with Russian papers and the village constable. Living in Uralsk, \u011eabdulla attended to ''Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00eda'' madrassah. Simultaneously, in 1896, he started to attend a Russian school. There, for the first time in his life, he became acquainted with the world of Russian literature and started to write poetry. In 1899 the anniversary of [[Alexander Pushkin]] was widely celebrated in Uralsk, an event which inspired Tuqay's interest in Russian poetry, especially works by Pushkin.\n\n\u011eosmanov tried to interest \u011eabdulla in his work, but Tuqay stayed indifferent to the merchant's lot, preferring to develop his education. On 30 July 1900 \u011e\u00e4li\u00e4s\u011far \u011eosmanov died of \"stomach diseases\", so Tuqay moved into the madrassah itself, living first in common room, and two years later in a ''khujra'', an individual cell. In the madrassah Tuqay proved himself a diligent student, completing in ten years a program intended for fifteen. However, he continued to live in poverty.\n\nBy 1902, \u011eabdulla, age 16, had changed his nature. He lost interest in studying the [[Qur'an]], and showed criticism to all that was taught in madrassah. He didn't shave his hair, he drank beer and even smoked. At the same time, he became more interested in poetry.<ref name=\"nurullin\">{{in lang|ru}} \u0422\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0439. \u0418. \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d.

In madrassah itself he became familiar with Arabic, Persian and Turkish poetry, as well as poetry in the [[Old Tatar language]] of the earlier centuries. In 1900 ''Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00eda'' graduate, a Tatar poet [[Mirx\u00e4yd\u00e4r \u00c7ulpan\u00ed]] visited the madrassah. \u011eabdulla met him and \u00c7ulpan\u00ed became the first living poet to impress Tuqay. \u00c7ulpan\u00ed wrote in \"elevated style\", using ''[[aruz]]'', an Oriental poetic system, and mostly in [[Old Tatar language]], full of Arab, Persian and Turkish words, and rather distant from the [[Tatar language]] itself. In 1902-1903 he met a Turkish poet [[Abd\u00fclveli]], concealed himself there from [[Abdul Hamid II]] pursuits. Thus, Tuqay adopted Oriental poetic tradition.\n\nYoung teacher, the son of headmaster, [[Kamil Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed|Kamil \"Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed\" T\u00f6xf\u00e4tullin]], organized wallpaper ''M\u00e4\u011f\u00e4rif'' (''The Education'') and hand-written journals. The first odes of Tuqay were published there, and he was referred as \"the first poet of the madrassah\".\n\nIn 1904 Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed founded his own publishing company, and Tuqay became clerk there. He combined this job with teaching younger shakirds in the madrassah. He introduce [[Jadid|new methods]], typical for the Russian school.\n\nAfter the [[October Manifesto]] of 1905 it became possible to publish [[newspaper]]s in the Tatar language, which was strictly forbidden earlier. However, Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed wasn't enough solvent to open his own newspaper, so he bought the Russian language newspaper ''Uralets'' with typography, to print also a Tatar newspaper there. Tuqay became a typesetter. The newspaper was named ''Fiker'' (''The Thought''). Then Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed started to issue ''\u00c4l\u011fasr\u00e4lcadid'' (''The New Century'') magazine. Tuqay sent his first verses there to be published. At the same time he started writing for a newspaper and began participating in the publishing of several Tatar magazines. At day Tuqay worked in typography (he was already a proofreader), but by nights he wrote verses, so every issue of ''Fiker'', ''Nur'' and ''\u00c4l\u011fasr\u00e4lcadid'' contains his writing. More over, he wrote articles, novels and feuilletons for those periodicals, he translated [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]] fables for the magazine. It is also known that Tuqay spread social-democratic leaflets and translated social-democratic brochure to the Tatar language.\n\nDespite social-democrats' negative attitude towards the Manifesto, in his verses Tuqay admired with Manifesto, believing in the progressive changes of the Tatar lifestyle. During that period he shared his views with liberals, as the long-standing tradition of the Tatar enlightenment didn't distinguished national-liberation movement from the class struggle and negated the class struggle within Tatar nation. The most prominent writings of that period are ''Mill\u00e4t\u00e4'' (''To the Nation'') poem and ''Bezne\u00f1 mill\u00e4t, \u00fclg\u00e4nme, \u00e4ll\u00e4 yoqla\u011fan \u011f\u0131nam\u0131?'' (''Has our nation dead, or just sleeps?'') article. Since the satirical magazine ''Uqlar'' (''The Arrows'') appeared in Uralsk, Tuqay renowned himself as satirist. The main target of his jeers was Muslim clergy, who stayed opposed to progress and Europeanization. As for the language of the most of his verses, it still stayed the Old Tatar language and continued the Oriental traditions, such as in ''Pu\u015fkin\u00e4'' (''To Pushkin''). However, in some of them, directed to the Tatar peasantry a pure Tatar was used, what was newly for the Tatar poetry.\n\nIn January 1906 police conducted a search of the typography, as rebellious articles were published in the newspaper. The [[First State Duma]] was dismissed, the revolution came to naught. The ultra-right Russian nationalists from the [[Black Hundred]] proposed that Tatars [[emigration|emigrate]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. That period his most prominent verses devoted to the social themes and patriotism were composed: ''Gosudarstvennaya Duma\u011fa'' (''To the State Duma''), ''Sor\u0131qortlar\u011fa'' (''To the Parasites'') and ''Kitmibez!'' (''We don\u2019t leave!''). Tuqay was disappointed in liberalism and sympathized with socialists, especially [[Esers]]. In ''Kitmibez!'' he answered to the [[Black Hundred]] that the Tatars are a brother people of the Russians and immigration to Turkey is impossible.\n\nOn 6 January 1907 Tuqay left madrassah, as his fee permitted him to live independently, and settled in a hotel room. He became an actual editor of ''Uqlar'', being the lead poet and publicist of all Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed's periodicals. That time liberal ''Fiker'' and Tuqay himself was in confrontation with Qadimist, i.e. ultraconservative  ''Bayan al-Xaq'', which even called for [[pogrom]] of liberal press activists. However, that year he was surprisingly discharged, as the result of the conflict with Kamil Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed and instigation of the typography workers for a strike to raise a salary. On 22 February 1907 Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed was deprived of publishing rights and his publishers was sold to merchant, who attracted Tuqay to the work again, but sonly dismissed the periodicals.\n\nThat time Tuqay departed from the social-democrats and politics generally, preferring to devote himself to poetry. Since mid-1906 to autumn 1907 more than 50 verses were written, as well as 40 articles and feuilletons. That time he turned to a pure Tatar, using a spoken language. Impressed by Pushkin's fairy-tale poem ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'', Tuqay wrote his first poem, ''[[\u015e\u00fcr\u00e4le]]''.\n\nIt is known, that Mot\u00ed\u011f\u00ed tried to establish another newspaper, ''Ya\u00f1a Torm\u0131\u015f'' (''The New Life'') in Uralsk, with Tuqay as one of constitutors, but that time \u011eabdulla was already so popular in the Tatar society, that chief editors from Kazan, the Tatar cultural capital, offered him job. Moreover, Tuqay should be examined by a draft board in his native [[uyezd]], and he left Uralsk anyway. The admiration with the future trends of his life in Kazan is expressed in ''Par at'' (''The Pair of Horses''), which consequently became the most associated with Kazan Tatar verse.<ref name=\"nurullin\"/>\n\n===Kazan period===\n[[Image:Tuqay portrait.jpg|200px|thumb|\u011eabdulla Tuqay]][[Image:Yalt-yolt.jpg|thumb|''Yalt-Yolt'' cover]][[Image:Tuqay in hospital.jpg|200px|thumb|\u011eabdulla Tuqay in hospital, 1913.]]\n\nJust after the arrival to Kazan, Tuqay stayed at ''Bol\u011far'' hotel and met Tatar literature intelligentsia, such as playwright and ''Yold\u0131z'' newspaper secretary [[\u011e\u00e4li\u00e4s\u011far Kamal]] and prominent Tatar poet and ''Ta\u00f1 yold\u0131z\u0131'' newspaper chief editor [[S\u00e4\u011fit R\u00e4miev]]. Several days after he left Kazan to be examined by a draft board, assembly point being in [[Bolshaya Atnya|\u00c4tn\u00e4]] village. There he was discarded due his poor health and walleye and freed up of serving in the [[Russian Imperial Army]]. He returned to Kazan and renowned his literature and publishing activity.\n\nHe was adopted to the editorial staff of democratically oriented ''\u00c4l-\u0130slax'' gazette, led by [[Fatix \u00c4mirxan]] and [[Wafa B\u00e4xti\u00e4rev]]. However, the newspaper had a little budget. Tuqay had got fixed up as a [[forwarding agent (philately)|forwarding agent]] in ''Kitap'' publishers, to provide guaranteed wage. Moreover, he refused offer from ''\u00c4xbar'', an organ of [[Ittifaq al-Muslimin]], a political party, close to [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]], as well as other offers from rich, but right newspapers. He also continued self-education: read Russian classics, critiques, and studied German language. He was interested in studying the life of common people by visiting bazaars and pubs.\n\nTuqay's room in ''Bol\u011far'' hotel was frequently visited by admirers from \"[[gilded youth]]\". As he wrote, their boozing-up impeded him and his creation. Nevertheless, in the end of 1907-1908 he wrote nearby sixty verses and twenty articles in ''\u00c4l-\u0130slax'' and satirical journal ''Y\u00e4\u015fen'' (''The Illumination''), and also published two books of verses. The most prominent satire of that period was ''Pe\u00e7\u00e4n Bazar\u0131 yaxud Ya\u00f1a Kisekba\u015f'' (''The Hay Bazaar or New Ki\u015fekba\u015f''), deriding problems of the Tatar society of the period, clergy and merchant class.\n\nAs for Tuqay's personal life, there is known little about it. As usual he avoided women in his circle. It is known that he was enamored of Z\u00e4yt\u00fcn\u00e4 M\u00e4wl\u00fcdova, his 15-year-old admirer. Several verses were devoted to Z\u00e4yt\u00fcn\u00e4 and their feelings, such as ''A Strange Love''. However, later Tuqay did not develop their relations, and the possible reason was inferiority complex, attributed to his health and financial position.\n\nIn May 1908 an article, comparing Tuqay's, R\u00e4miev's and [[Majit Ghafuri]]'s  poetries was published in Russian-language ''Volzhsko-Kamsky Vestnik''. In August 1908 Kamal founded satirical journal ''Y\u00e4\u015fen'' under Tuqay's pressure. The most of published works were written by Tuqay, of course. In August 1908 Kamal and Tuqay visit the [[Makaryev Fair]], placed in [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. There Tuqay temporarily joined the first Tatar theatre troupe, ''[[S\u00e4yyar]]'', singing national songs and declaiming his verses from scene. On 14 October \u011eabdulla Tuqay presented his new satirical poem ''The Hay Bazaar or New Kisekba\u015f'', based on classical Old Tatar poem ''Kisekba\u015f''. In own poem he derided nationalism among Tatars, as well as [[W\u00e4isi movement|W\u00e4isi sect's]] fanatics, associating sect's leader, [[\u011eaynan W\u00e4isev]] with [[Di\u00fc]], an evil spirit from ''Kisekba\u015f''.<ref name=\"nurullin\"/>\n\n===1909-1910 crisis===\n\nIn 1909-1910 all freedoms, gained by 1905 revolution came to naught under [[Pyotr Stolypin|Stolypin]]'s policy. As a result, leftist sympathized \u011eabdulla Tuqay was nearly disappointed in his activity and was in depression. Another reason was in his friends, moved to rightist newspapers, like Kamal and R\u00e4miev. The most of his verses were depressive, however, Tuqay stayed productive, he published nearby hundred verses, two fairy tale poems, autobiography, and an article about Tatar folklore (''Xal\u0131q \u00e4d\u00e4bi\u00e4te'', i.e. ''Folk Literature''), wrote thirty feuilletons and printed twenty books, not only with own poems, but also compiled of folk songs.\n\nIn those years Tuqay became staunch leftist, despite of his staying with one bourgeois family for some time: ''\u00c4l-\u0130slax'' became a leftist political newspaper only, Tuqay criticized all his former friends, turned to the right or liberal newspapers: Zarif B\u00e4\u015firi from Oremburgean ''\u00c7\u00fcke\u00e7'' and S\u00e4\u011fit R\u00e4miev from ''B\u00e4y\u00e4nelxaq''. He called them bourgeoisie's stooges, in response their stigmatized Tuqay [[Russophilia|Russophile]]. The same time [[Okhrana]] reported his poems as [[Russophobia|Russophobic]]. Also Tuqay became closer to the first Tatar Marxist, [[X\u00f6s\u00e4yen Yama\u015fev]].\n\nIn June 1909 ''Y\u00e4\u015fen'', was closed due to financial problems as well as censorship requirement, as well as ''\u00c4l-\u0130slax''. Being at the top of his crisis, he thinks about suicide, but since March 1910  new satirical magazine, ''Yal-Yolt'' (''The Lightning'') was published in Kazan under \u00c4xm\u00e4t Urman\u00e7iev.\n\nBeing interested in [[Leo Tolstoy]] ideas and legacy, Tuqay felt keenly the death of the Russian genius. Pointing out a high role of children's education, he prepared two books for children, and two schoolbooks of Tatar literature. In total, he composed more than fifty verses and seven poems for children.<ref name=\"nurullin\"/>\n\n=== Ufa - Saint-Petersburg - Troitsk ===\n\nIn 1911 Qadimist forces allied with Okhrana fulminated ''\u0130j-Bub\u00ed'', the most progressive Tatar madrassah. This fact filled with indignation all Tatar intelligentsia. But it was only a beginning of campaign drive against Tatar democracy, which became Tuqay's tragedy again. However, as it known from Tuqay's letters to his friend [[S\u00e4\u011fit S\u00f6n\u00e7\u00e4l\u00e4y]], he decided to write the Tatar [[Eugene Onegin]], but he had to recover his health. He planned a trip to the southern regions to receive [[kumiss]] therapy there.\n\nIn April he left Kazan and had a voyage by the [[Volga]] to [[Astrakhan]]. There he met R\u00e4miev and became reconciled with him. Three weeks later he moved to Kalmyk Bazary village and stayed with schoolteacher \u015eahit \u011e\u00e4yfi there. As \u011e\u00e4yfi was interested in photography, they shot a series of cards, devoted to Tuqay's poems and the Tatar theatre. Returning to Kazan, he published, ''Mi\u00e4wbik\u00e4'' (''Pussycat''), his prominent poem for children. There he applied new poetic methods, and was criticized therefore. He also was interested to publish his prohibited verses in the newspaper of the Russian Muslims, published in Paris, but later he refused of this idea, as the newspaper propagated pan-Islamist ideas.\n\nIn autumn 1911 a famine stroke [[Idel-Ural]]. ''The Autumn Wind'' was devoted to the famine and hard lot of peasantry. Tuqay felt ill with malaria and unfortunately moved to cold hotel number. So, he abandoned all and moved to [[\u00d6\u00e7ile]], to his relatives. There he passed winter, writing o recomposing his verses, sometimes sending new feuilletons to the editors. Possible, another reason of his departure was a trial of his book, published as early as in 1907. He returned in February 1912. In March 1912 his friend, Yama\u015fev dead of infarction and Tuqay devoted a feeling poem (''X\u00f6rm\u00e4tle X\u00f6s\u00e4yen y\u00e4dk\u00e2re'', i.e. ''Of Blessed Memory of X\u00f6s\u00e4yen'') to the first Tatar Marxist.\n\nIn April \u011eabdulla Tuqay went on a tour again. First he arrived to [[Ufa]], where he met [[Majit Ghafuri]]. Then he left Ufa and moved to [[Saint-Petersburg]]. He stayed with [[Musa Bigiev]]. In Petersburg he met with local Tatar diaspora's youth, many of whom were students and left activists. The impression of them is expressed in ''The Tatar Youth'' (''Tatar y\u00e4\u015fl\u00e4re'') verse, full of optimism. However, he didn't know that he has the last stage of tuberculosis: a doctor, examined him in Petersburg, preferred to keep diagnosis back. He was advised to take a course in Switzerland, but he refused and after farewell party moved to Ufa again, and then to [[Troitsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Troitsk]]. There he lived till July 1912 among the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nomads in the steppe, receiving [[kumiss]] therapy.<ref name=\"nurullin\"/>\n\n===Death===\n\nHis last year he began full of optimism: the revolutionary tendencies rose, and social theme appeared in his poetry again. In ''A\u00f1'' (''The Consciousness'') and ''Dahig\u00e4'' (''To the Genius'') he wrote that his struggle was not vain, as well as 1905 revolution. Many verses were devoted to the peasantry's problems, resembling [[Nekrasov]]'s poetry. More and more verses were banned; some of them were published only after the [[October Revolution]]. However, Tuqay was criticized by [[\u011e\u00e4limcan \u0130brahimov]], that now his poetry became poor.\n\nIn summer 1912 he published his last book, ''The Mental Food'', where 43 verses and one poem were collected. But then his health has become worse. In spite of this, he found energy to write for the new literature magazine  ''A\u00f1'' and democratic newspaper ''Qoya\u015f'' (''The Sun''), edited by [[Fatix \u00c4mirxan]]. As \u00c4mirxan was paralyzed, they both stayed in neighboring numbers of ''Amur'' hotel, where the editorial board was situated. In first days of 1913 he wrote ''The Frost'', a witty poem depicting how Kazaners of different social classes behave during frost. The next notable poem was devoted to the [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty]]. The poem was rather panegyrical, so the vulgar-sociological critique of the early 1920s, based on this poem, proclaimed Tuqay to be a pan-Islamist and Tsarist. However, the end of the verse is written not about Tsar's dynasty, but about internationalism within Russian and eternal friendship of Tatars and Russians.\n\nOn 26 February 1913, \u011eabdulla Tuqay was hospitalized due to a severe case of tuberculosis. Even in the Klyachkinskaya hospital he never stopped writing poems for Tatar newspapers and magazines. Those poems were both social and philosophical. In March he wrote his literature testament, ''The First Deed after the Awakening''. In hospital Tuqay became interested in Tolstoy's legacy again, devoting to him two verses. He read more about [[Volga Bulgaria]]\u2019s history as well as all Kazan periodic.\nOn 15 April of the same year, \u011eabdulla Tuqay died at the age of 27<ref name=\"nurullin\"/> and was buried in Tatar cemetery. {{coord|55.760223|49.106168}}\n\n==Legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Metro Tukay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mosaic]] with image of \u011eabdulla Tuqay on [[Kazan Metro]] station \"[[Ploshchad Tukaya (Kazan Metro)|Ploshchad Tukaya]]\"]] -->\nDespite of denial of Tuqay's genius during the early Soviet years, he soon became renowned as the greatest Tatar poet. His name transcended across the arts, with the [[Tatar State Symphony Orchestra]] dedicated to Tuqay's name.

Ivermectin kills by interfering with [[nervous system]] and [[muscle]] function, in particular by enhancing inhibitory [[neurotransmission]].\n\nThe drug binds to glutamate-gated [[chloride channels]] (GluCls) in the membranes of [[invertebrate]] nerve and muscle cells, causing increased permeability to chloride ions, resulting in cellular hyper-polarization, followed by paralysis and death.<ref name=AHFS2016 /><ref name=\"pmid15313134\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yates DM, Wolstenholme AJ | title = An ivermectin-sensitive glutamate-gated chloride channel subunit from Dirofilaria immitis | journal = International Journal for Parasitology | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 1075\u201381 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15313134 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpara.2004.04.010 }}</ref> GluCls are invertebrate-specific members of the [[Cys-loop]] family of [[ligand-gated ion channel]]s present in [[neuron]]s and [[myocyte]]s.\n\n=== Pharmacokinetics ===\n\nIvermectin can be given by mouth, topically, or via injection.
