It now lies somewhere between Western Emilian, which includes Piancentino, and Central Emilian, which includes Reggiano and Modenese.

The [[lexicon]] was therefore a type of [[Latin]] influenced by [[Gaulish]]. The Gauls, or [[Celts]], left their mark on modern Parmigiano in some words today, such as ''goz\u00e8n'' \"pig\", ''scrana'' \"chair\" and ''s\u00f4ga'' \"rope\". As a result of Spanish and especially French invasions, Parmigiani began to use words which came from a French language that had Latin roots. That is seen in ''tirabus\u00f2n'' \"corkscrew\" (similar to [[Modern French]]'s ''tire-bouchon'') ''vert'' \"open\" (French: ''ouvert''), ''p\u00f2mm da t\u00e9ra'' \"potato\" (French: ''pomme de terre'') and many other words.\n\n==Geographic distribution==\nParmigiano is mainly spoken in the [[Parma (province)|province of Parma]].

The dialect spoken in [[Casalmaggiore]] in the [[Province of Cremona]] to the north of Parma is closely related to Parmigiano. Parmigiano subdialects have three forms: \n*'''Low Parmigiano''', which is native to a northern part of the province that lies between the [[Po (river)|Po]] and the [[Via Aemilia]] and whose largest town is [[Colorno]]. \n*'''Western Parmigiano''', which is heard around [[Fidenza]] and [[Salsomaggiore Terme]] and has been strongly influenced by Piacentino, another [[Emilian language]].\n*'''High Parmigiano''', which has been affected by [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] and is spoken in the [[Apennines|Apennine]] region to the south.\n\nAn example of the variation is the word ''bomb\u00e8n'' \"very well\". In 1861, the popular forms were ''moltbein'' and ''monb\u00e9n'', but it has also taken these forms: ''montben'', ''mondb\u00e9n'', ''moltb\u00e9n'', ''moltbein'', ''monb\u00e9n'', and ''momb\u00e9n''.<ref name=\"Repubblica\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cortedeirossi.it/libro/libri/malaspina.htm|title=VOCABOLARIO PARMIGIANO-ITALIANO|trans-title=Parmigiano-Italian Vocabulary|language=Italian}}</ref> In the \"Western Parmigiano\" it's used a variety of loctions with the same meaning instead of ''bomb\u00e8n'', like ''b\u00e8n a bota'' o ''b\u00e8n da b\u00f2n''.\n\n===Official status===\nParmigiano is not recognised as a minority dialect in the [[European Union]] or in [[Italy]]; the same is true for [[Emilian language|Emilian]] or [[Emilian-Romagnol]].

The degree-awarding authorities approved by the [[Government of Ireland]], which can grant awards at all academic levels, are [[University of Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland]] ([[University College Cork|Cork]], [[University College Dublin|Dublin]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]]), [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], [[Dublin City University]], [[Technological University Dublin]], [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]], [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]] (Pontifical University),<ref>''Final report on alignment of St. Patrick\u2019s College, Maynooth awards made in Ireland to the National Framework of Qualifications'' www.nqai.ie, September 2011.</ref>  and [[University of Limerick]].

The latter include the [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], Colleges of Education, and other independent colleges. Some colleges have \"delegated authority\" from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name.\n\nSome institutions such as the [[University of Limerick]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] (DIT), and [[Dublin City University]] (DCU) have completed a process of modularising their courses (others are still in a transition phase), mostly using the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]. The [[Bologna process]] and [[applied research]] are the current concerns of national educational policy, additional concerns include the structures of the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Since the mid-2000s, a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation, including DIT, Cork, and Waterford.\n\nThe ''Marks & Standards'' document, offered by most institutions, can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards, while programme specifications offer additional information. In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system, entry tends to be highly competitive for [[High school graduate|school leavers]]; the so-called \"Points Race\" administered by the [[Central Applications Office]] (CAO). In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50% for the first time, as of 2005 it is in excess of 55% and expected to grow at approximately 1% per annum for the next decade.\n\nThere are over 25 third-level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language. ''[[Acadamh na hOllscola\u00edochta Gaeilge]]'' is the Irish language Department of the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] (NUI Galway) and it has different off-campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions. Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar. [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), DIT, and [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]] (GMIT) also offer similar courses.\n\nAll but two of the seven universities in the [[Republic of Ireland]] offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study. The two universities that do not offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) arts degrees, Trinity College Dublin and DCU, do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as [[Drama|Drama Studies]], [[Journalism]], [[Latin]], [[History]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[International Relations]].\n\nIn one, Trinity College Dublin, the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects, such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one. DCU's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by [[St. Patrick's College of Education (Drumcondra)|St. Patrick's College of Education]] (a college of DCU) and is titled \"[[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Humanities\". [[All Hallows College]] (a college of DCU) offer BA in Humanities, Theology Pastoral Care, and English.\n\nEntry into higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO. In this way, students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university. Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent. Each university has a minimum entry requirement, usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish, as well as maths. Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language (French, German, Spanish or Italian). Each individual course has further entry requirements, for example, science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences. The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system. However, universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students, and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course.\n\nEntry into third-level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland (as it also is in [[Northern Ireland]]), and among young adults (those aged 25 to 34), 41.6% of them have attained third-level degrees\u2014the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus, and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1%.<ref name=\"Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007\">[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2007/progress2007/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007]</ref> Broken down by gender, approximately 43% of women and 40% of men Ireland attend third level education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 \u2013 Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Fees===\n\nUnder the \"Free Fees Initiative\" the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Government]] will pay the [[tuition]] fees of students who meet relevant course, nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative.

Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies, both ad-hoc and statutory. Typical areas included [[apprenticeship]]s, childcare, farming, retail, and tourism.

At the same time, the proportion of graduates with first-class honours has reached record levels, particularly in institutes of technology. It is unclear whether this increase is due to [[grade inflation]] or increased motivation of students. Whatever the reason, employers increasingly examine graduates' extracurricular activities and work experiences as they search for the most able applicants.<ref>{{cite web\n | url

The latter include the [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], Colleges of Education, and other independent colleges. Some colleges have \"delegated authority\" from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name.\n\nSome institutions such as the [[University of Limerick]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] (DIT), and [[Dublin City University]] (DCU) have completed a process of modularising their courses (others are still in a transition phase), mostly using the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]. The [[Bologna process]] and [[applied research]] are the current concerns of national educational policy, additional concerns include the structures of the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Since the mid-2000s, a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation, including DIT, Cork, and Waterford.\n\nThe ''Marks & Standards'' document, offered by most institutions, can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards, while programme specifications offer additional information. In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system, entry tends to be highly competitive for [[High school graduate|school leavers]]; the so-called \"Points Race\" administered by the [[Central Applications Office]] (CAO). In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50% for the first time, as of 2005 it is in excess of 55% and expected to grow at approximately 1% per annum for the next decade.\n\nThere are over 25 third-level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language. ''[[Acadamh na hOllscola\u00edochta Gaeilge]]'' is the Irish language Department of the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] (NUI Galway) and it has different off-campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions. Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar. [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), DIT, and [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]] (GMIT) also offer similar courses.\n\nAll but two of the seven universities in the [[Republic of Ireland]] offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study. The two universities that do not offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) arts degrees, Trinity College Dublin and DCU, do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as [[Drama|Drama Studies]], [[Journalism]], [[Latin]], [[History]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[International Relations]].\n\nIn one, Trinity College Dublin, the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects, such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one. DCU's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by [[St. Patrick's College of Education (Drumcondra)|St. Patrick's College of Education]] (a college of DCU) and is titled \"[[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Humanities\". [[All Hallows College]] (a college of DCU) offer BA in Humanities, Theology Pastoral Care, and English.\n\nEntry into higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO. In this way, students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university. Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent. Each university has a minimum entry requirement, usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish, as well as maths. Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language (French, German, Spanish or Italian). Each individual course has further entry requirements, for example, science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences. The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system. However, universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students, and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course.\n\nEntry into third-level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland (as it also is in [[Northern Ireland]]), and among young adults (those aged 25 to 34), 41.6% of them have attained third-level degrees\u2014the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus, and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1%.<ref name=\"Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007\">[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2007/progress2007/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007]</ref> Broken down by gender, approximately 43% of women and 40% of men Ireland attend third level education. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 \u2013 Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n===Fees===\n\nUnder the \"Free Fees Initiative\" the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Government]] will pay the [[tuition]] fees of students who meet relevant course, nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative.

Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies, both ad-hoc and statutory. Typical areas included [[apprenticeship]]s, childcare, farming, retail, and tourism.

FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on 6 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web| title=Minister Quinn merges educational agencies to establish QQI | url=http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2012-Press-Releases/PR2012-11-06.html|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Increase in third-level degrees==\nIreland has a higher proportion of third-level graduates than any other EU country, although many third-level students are better suited to further education and training. At the same time, the proportion of graduates with first-class honours has reached record levels, particularly in institutes of technology. It is unclear whether this increase is due to [[grade inflation]] or increased motivation of students. Whatever the reason, employers increasingly examine graduates' extracurricular activities and work experiences as they search for the most able applicants.<ref>{{cite web\n | url

It was released on April 13, 2015, by [[Odd Future Records]]. On April 9, 2015, the album was informally announced on [[iTunes]], along with the release of two tracks. Production was handled primarily by Tyler himself, with additional contributions by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] guitarist [[Mike Einziger]]. The album features [[guest appearance]]s from [[Schoolboy Q]], [[Charlie Wilson (singer)|Charlie Wilson]], [[Kali Uchis]], [[Kanye West]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Pharrell Williams]] and Austin Feinstein among others. The album was supported by two [[Single (music)|singles]]: \"Deathcamp\" and \"Fucking Young / Perfect\". The snippet of a music video for \"Deathcamp\" was sharing with a music video for \"Fucking Young\".\n\n''Cherry Bomb'' received generally positive reviews from critics. It debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 51,000 copies in its first week.\n\n==Background==\nIn November 2014, Larry Fitzmaurice wrote a piece for ''[[The Fader]]'' magazine, giving details about a follow-up to Tyler, the Creator's second studio album, ''[[Wolf (Tyler, the Creator album)|Wolf]]'' (2013). Fitzmaurice wrote the album features a multitude of guests, but likely no features from other [[Odd Future]] members, the rap group of which Tyler is the face, stating: \"Everyone's on their own island.\" Tyler cited artist [[Stevie Wonder]] as his inspiration for the album. Associate editor of ''The Fader'', Matthew Trammel, reported that the album would feature Tyler lyrically tackling many current social issues. Trammel noted that \"[Tyler] offers up heavy-handed indictments of gang culture and rapper consumerism, calling them detrimental not just to the progress of his race, but to humanity as a whole.\"<ref name=\"The Fader\">{{cite web|last1=Fitzmaurice|first1=Larry|title=Here's What We Know About Tyler, The Creator's New Album|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/11/10/heres-what-we-know-about-tyler-the-creators-new-album|work=The Fader|accessdate=April 9, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419112624/http://www.thefader.com/2014/11/10/heres-what-we-know-about-tyler-the-creators-new-album|archivedate=April 19, 2015}}</ref> Guests that were rumored to appear included [[Jay-Z]], [[Keyshia Cole]], [[Cherry Glazerr]], and [[Leon Ware]].<ref name=\"The Fader\"/>\n\n==Recording and production==\n''Cherry Bomb'' was recorded in Tyler's home studio as well as other studios in California.<ref name=\"Documentary\"/> The sample for \"Deathcamp\" was rejected shortly before the album was due to be turned in, so some elements of the song were re-recorded.<ref name=\"Documentary\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/73875-watch-tyler-the-creators-cherry-bomb-documentary-in-full/|title=Watch Tyler, The Creator's Cherry Bomb Documentary in Full|work=Pitchfork|last=Wicks|first=Amamda|date=May 30, 2017|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The string section featured on the song \"2Seater\" was composed by Tyler and recorded at German composer [[Hans Zimmer]]'s studio; it marked Tyler's first time overseeing a live orchestra.<ref name=\"Documentary\"/> \"Run\" was recorded in Tyler's living room and features harmonic vocals from [[Toro y Moi|Chaz Bundick]] who also provided guitar chords to the song \"Fucking Young\".<ref name=\"Documentary\"/> \"Find Your Wings\" initially featured vocals from singers Samantha Nelson, [[Onitsha (musician)|Onitsha Shaw]] and Tiffany Palmer.

It was released on April 13, 2015, by [[Odd Future Records]]. On April 9, 2015, the album was informally announced on [[iTunes]], along with the release of two tracks. Production was handled primarily by Tyler himself, with additional contributions by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] guitarist [[Mike Einziger]]. The album features [[guest appearance]]s from [[Schoolboy Q]], [[Charlie Wilson (singer)|Charlie Wilson]], [[Kali Uchis]], [[Kanye West]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Pharrell Williams]] and Austin Feinstein among others. The album was supported by two [[Single (music)|singles]]: \"Deathcamp\" and \"Fucking Young / Perfect\". The snippet of a music video for \"Deathcamp\" was sharing with a music video for \"Fucking Young\".\n\n''Cherry Bomb'' received generally positive reviews from critics. It debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 51,000 copies in its first week.\n\n==Background==\nIn November 2014, Larry Fitzmaurice wrote a piece for ''[[The Fader]]'' magazine, giving details about a follow-up to Tyler, the Creator's second studio album, ''[[Wolf (Tyler, the Creator album)|Wolf]]'' (2013). Fitzmaurice wrote the album features a multitude of guests, but likely no features from other [[Odd Future]] members, the rap group of which Tyler is the face, stating: \"Everyone's on their own island.\" Tyler cited artist [[Stevie Wonder]] as his inspiration for the album. Associate editor of ''The Fader'', Matthew Trammel, reported that the album would feature Tyler lyrically tackling many current social issues. Trammel noted that \"[Tyler] offers up heavy-handed indictments of gang culture and rapper consumerism, calling them detrimental not just to the progress of his race, but to humanity as a whole.\"<ref name=\"The Fader\">{{cite web|last1=Fitzmaurice|first1=Larry|title=Here's What We Know About Tyler, The Creator's New Album|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/11/10/heres-what-we-know-about-tyler-the-creators-new-album|work=The Fader|accessdate=April 9, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419112624/http://www.thefader.com/2014/11/10/heres-what-we-know-about-tyler-the-creators-new-album|archivedate=April 19, 2015}}</ref> Guests that were rumored to appear included [[Jay-Z]], [[Keyshia Cole]], [[Cherry Glazerr]], and [[Leon Ware]].<ref name=\"The Fader\"/>\n\n==Recording and production==\n''Cherry Bomb'' was recorded in Tyler's home studio as well as other studios in California.<ref name=\"Documentary\"/> The sample for \"Deathcamp\" was rejected shortly before the album was due to be turned in, so some elements of the song were re-recorded.<ref name=\"Documentary\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/73875-watch-tyler-the-creators-cherry-bomb-documentary-in-full/|title=Watch Tyler, The Creator's Cherry Bomb Documentary in Full|work=Pitchfork|last=Wicks|first=Amamda|date=May 30, 2017|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The string section featured on the song \"2Seater\" was composed by Tyler and recorded at German composer [[Hans Zimmer]]'s studio; it marked Tyler's first time overseeing a live orchestra.<ref name=\"Documentary\"/> \"Run\" was recorded in Tyler's living room and features harmonic vocals from [[Toro y Moi|Chaz Bundick]] who also provided guitar chords to the song \"Fucking Young\".<ref name=\"Documentary\"/> \"Find Your Wings\" initially featured vocals from singers Samantha Nelson, [[Onitsha (musician)|Onitsha Shaw]] and Tiffany Palmer.

\"Buffalo\".<ref name=\"Spin.com\"/> David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] described the track \"Find Your Wings\" as \"smooth and jazzy\", and the title track \"Cherry Bomb\" as \"drill 'n' bass [...] as

hop group [[Death Grips]].<ref name=\"Complex.com\"/> A portion of the song \"The Brown Stains of Darkeese Latifah Part 6-12 (Remix)\" has a cadence similar to N.E.R.D member [[Pharrell

Its elevation allows views back on to the city and [[Wait\u0101kere Ranges]]. Situated on the Te Atat\u016b Peninsula, it has coasts backing on to water on its eastern and western sides with walkways and cycleways on both sides.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Te Atat\u016b#History|l1=History of the Te Atat\u016b Area}}\n\nThe area prior to suburban settlement was used largely for vineyards, poultry farms, fruit trees, apples, lemons orchards and flower farms. Vineyards were located along Te Atatu, McLeod and Edmonton Rd's. There were brickworks under what is now the Whau River bridge and a timber mill at the end of Roberts Rd.<ref>Wait\u0101kere Central Library files. \"Overhauling surburbia 1990\". A report prepared by the Auckland Heritage Trust. Source Peter Buffett W.C.C Historian by A.G. Flude</ref>\n\nThe name \"Te Atatu South\" was attributed to the area in 1961 when the area of [[Te Atat\u016b]] was divided by the [[Northwestern Motorway]] (State Highway 16). With the new motorway, the area rapidly changed in 10 years from rural to suburban. While new homes in [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula]] were dominated by one builder, \"Neil Homes\", Te Atat\u016b South had more diversity in new homes and a large quantity of larger quality family homes. These homes reflected Te Atat\u016b South being one of the more affluent areas in West Auckland during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nToday the suburb is redeveloping its roads and town centre to accommodate more modern needs to build a more walkable and vibrant community.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://at.govt.nz/projects-roadworks/te-Atatu-corridor-improvement |title=Te Atatu corridor improvement |work=Auckland Transport |accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Schools==\nPrimary schools in this area include Flanshaw Road School, Tirimoana Primary, Freyberg Community School and Edmonton Primary School. The area has one Intermediate school, Rangeview Intermediate. The local state secondary school that services the area is [[Rutherford College, Auckland|Rutherford College]] which is just north of the boundary between the suburb and Te Atat\u016b Peninsula. It is also home to Arohanui Special School which caters to students 5 to 21 years of age.\n\n==Sport==\n\nTe Atat\u016b South is home to [[Waitemata AFC]], West City Baseball Club (NZ's longest running baseball club) and fields for Waitakere Rugby club. The Te Atatu Boating Club was founded in 1959.<ref>http://www.teatatuboatclub.co.nz/</ref>\n\n==Main centres==\nIts main centre is the Te Atat\u016b Town Centre where Edmonton Road and Te Atatu Road intersect. The Te Atat\u016b South Community Centre is located here.\n\nA small light industrial area is located on McLeod Road.\n\nTwo large parks in the area are Te Atat\u016b South Park and McLeod Park.\n\n==Transport==\nTe Atatu Road: the main road that runs through the whole suburb. Bus services run along here and Edmonton Road.\n\nEdmonton Road: links to [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]] with close proximity to the [[Henderson Railway Station]].\n\nMcLeod Road: a main road linking the southern part of the suburb to Henderson.\n\n[[New Zealand State Highway 16|State Highway 16]] (SH 16) / Northwestern Cycleway: the northern tip of the suburb links to the city and to the north.

Its elevation allows views back on to the city and [[Wait\u0101kere Ranges]]. Situated on the Te Atat\u016b Peninsula, it has coasts backing on to water on its eastern and western sides with walkways and cycleways on both sides.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Te Atat\u016b#History|l1=History of the Te Atat\u016b Area}}\n\nThe area prior to suburban settlement was used largely for vineyards, poultry farms, fruit trees, apples, lemons orchards and flower farms. Vineyards were located along Te Atatu, McLeod and Edmonton Rd's. There were brickworks under what is now the Whau River bridge and a timber mill at the end of Roberts Rd.<ref>Wait\u0101kere Central Library files. \"Overhauling surburbia 1990\".

With the new motorway, the area rapidly changed in 10 years from rural to suburban. While new homes in [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula]] were dominated by one builder, \"Neil Homes\", Te Atat\u016b South had more diversity in new homes and a large quantity of larger quality family homes. These homes reflected Te Atat\u016b South being one of the more affluent areas in West Auckland during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nToday the suburb is redeveloping its roads and town centre to accommodate more modern needs to build a more walkable and vibrant community.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://at.govt.nz/projects-roadworks/te-Atatu-corridor-improvement |title=Te Atatu corridor improvement |work=Auckland Transport |accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Schools==\nPrimary schools in this area include Flanshaw Road School, Tirimoana Primary, Freyberg Community School and Edmonton Primary School. The area has one Intermediate school, Rangeview Intermediate. The local state secondary school that services the area is [[Rutherford College, Auckland|Rutherford College]] which is just north of the boundary between the suburb and Te Atat\u016b Peninsula. It is also home to Arohanui Special School which caters to students 5 to 21 years of age.\n\n==Sport==\n\nTe Atat\u016b South is home to [[Waitemata AFC]], West City Baseball Club (NZ's longest running baseball club) and fields for Waitakere Rugby club. The Te Atatu Boating Club was founded in 1959.<ref>http://www.teatatuboatclub.co.nz/</ref>\n\n==Main centres==\nIts main centre is the Te Atat\u016b Town Centre where Edmonton Road and Te Atatu Road intersect.
