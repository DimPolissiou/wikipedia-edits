It also provides flight support services and training. ABX Air is owned by [[Air Transport Services Group]].\n\nABX Air's main customer is [[DHL Aviation|DHL]], and the majority of the freight it carries is for that company. Many of ABX Air's aircraft are painted with DHL's yellow and red [[livery]].\n\nABX also operated cargo flights on behalf of [[Air Jamaica]] between [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] and the two Jamaican cities of [[Montego Bay]] ([[Sangster International Airport|Donald Sangster International Airport]]) and [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] ([[Norman Manley International Airport]]). One of their [[Boeing 767]]-200s routinely handled the flights, replacing the [[Douglas DC-8]] types that flew previously. The aircraft flew with an Air Jamaica [[Callsign#Aviation|callsign]] of \"Jamaica\".\n\n== History ==\nThe airline was established in {{start date|1980|4}} when '''Airborne Freight Corporation''' acquired [[Midwest Air Charter]]; operations started later that year. '''Airborne Express''', as the airline was initially named, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Airborne Freight Corporation of [[Seattle]]. Apart from its core activity of cargo transportation, Airborne Express also performed airframe maintenance services to a number of aircraft types.<ref name=\"FI1997-50\" /> At {{start date|1995|3}} the company had 5,500 employees.<ref name=\"FI1995-44\" /> In {{start date|1996|1}}, the company acquired {{cardinal|12}} [[Boeing 767]] aircraft for conversion to freighters.<ref name=\"FI1997-50\" />\n\nABX became a public company on 16 August 2003 as part of the merger of [[DHL Aviation|DHL]] and Airborne, in which DHL kept Airborne's ground operations and spun off its air operations as ABX Air Inc. ABX Air's common shares were traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol ABXA.

Under plans developed by [[Martin Bormann]] and architectural designs by Speer, a series of F\u00fchrer complexes were built. The best known were: the [[F\u00fchrerbunker]] in Berlin; the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] complex in [[Berchtesgaden]], [[Bavaria]]; and the [[Wolfsschanze]] near [[K\u0119trzyn]] in modern-day [[Poland]].\n\n[[Austrian nobility|Austrian noble]] Emma von Scheitlein acquired [[Kransberg Castle]] in the village of [[Kransberg]] in 1926, and used it for society events. Chosen due to its central location as the proposed main military command headquarters of Hitler, it was appropriated by the [[Nazi]] government in 1939. Speer immediately began adapting it, designing military-grade infrastructure which was well disguised and adapted to fit-in with its surroundings.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe main complex was a collection of seven cottages, in a heavily wooded compound beyond the castle's main entrance.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Although each building was designed as an air raid bunker with {{convert|3|ft}} thick concrete walls, each had the appearance of a traditional locally built [[Fachwerk]] (half-timbered) style wooden cottage, complete with second storey dormer windows and flower baskets under a sloped tiled roof. Internally, each was furnished in traditional German style with oak floors, pine wall panelling, utilitarian leather upholstered furniture, and decorated with fringed shade wall lamps, wall hangings depicting hunting scenes or [[Teutons|Teutonic]] battles, and a set of deer antlers.\n\nThe cottages were numbered and allocated as follows:<ref name=MilHist>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/adlerhorst.aspx|title=Hitler's Ultra-Secret Adlerhorst|author=Irwin J.

To blend in with the pine-forested hilltop and to defy air detection, most of the cottages were further disguised with fake evergreen trees. From October 1944, Adlerhorst had also become the headquarters of the Commander in Chief of [[OB West]], [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].\n\nHitler arrived at [[Giessen]] [[Gie\u00dfen station|station]] on his personal [[F\u00fchrersonderzug|''F\u00fchrersonderzug'' (train)]] on 11 December 1944, taking up residence in Haus 1 until 16 January 1945.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}} Rundstedt who was to command [[Ardennes Offensive|Operation ''Wacht am Rhein'']] set up his headquarters near [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], [[Belgium]], close enough for the generals and Panzer Corps commanders who were planning the attack, to travel to Adlerhorst in an SS-operated bus convoy that evening. With the castle used to provide for overflow accommodation, the main party settled into Haus 2/the casino. \nThose present included generals Jodl, Keitel, [[G\u00fcnther Blumentritt|Blumentritt]], Manteuffel and [[SS-Oberst-Gruppenf\u00fchrer|S.S. colonel general]] [[Sepp Dietrich]]. Joined by Hitler, Rundstedt ran through the plans at 05:00 on December 15; the plan that envisaged the attack of three German armies consisting of over 250,000 men. Believing in omens and the successes of his early war campaigns that had been planned at Adlerhorst, Hitler rejoiced in the battles' early successes, taking long walks in the pine forest, regaling his team with his postwar plans and aspirations.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\nShortly after Christmas, G\u00f6ring arrived and took up residence in the castle. After an extremely downbeat briefing in the casino, G\u00f6ring privately suggested to Hitler that a truce be sought via his [[Sweden|Swedish]] contacts. Hitler flew into a rage, and after threatening to have G\u00f6ring put before a firing squad, mentally dismissed him as deputy Fuehrer.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Operation Nordwind===\n{{main|Operation Nordwind}}\nAfter giving his 1945 New Year's speech from the Pressehaus, Hitler returned to Haus 1 to welcome in the New Year with his close friends and secretarial support team. At 04:00 he walked to the casino to watch the development of [[Operation Nordwind|Operation ''Nordwind'']], his counter-offensive on New Year's Day.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\nAt midnight, nine Panzer divisions of [[Army Group G|Heeresgruppe G]] commanded by [[Colonel general|Generaloberst]] [[Johannes Blaskowitz]] had mounted an all-out attack on [[Bastogne]]. Then a faked diversionary attack was mounted by eight German divisions of  [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Upper Rhine ''(Heeresgruppe Oberrhein)'']] commanded by [[Heinrich Himmler]], against the [[U.S. Seventh Army|U.S. 7th Army]] and [[First Army (France)|French 1st Army]] position, which was the thinly stretched line of 110 kilometres (68&nbsp;mi) long, near [[Lembach]] in the Upper [[Vosges]] mountains in [[Alsace]]; {{convert|120|mi}} to the southeast.\n\nThis defence line had been weakened by U.S. general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who had ordered troops, equipment and supplies north to reinforce the American armies involved in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in the [[Ardennes]]. If successful, the German operation would have opened the way for [[Operation Zahnarzt]], a planned major thrust into the rear of the U.S. 3rd Army.\n\nHowever, having cracked the [[Enigma machine|Enigma code machines]], each German manoeuvre was either prepared for, or out-flanked by an allied counter-move. This resulted in a bitter attritional campaign that was lost from the 25th January onwards, with the Germans running out of replacement man power, machinery and supplies.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Abandonment and attempted demolition===\nOn 6 January 1945, a [[blockbuster bomb]] was jettisoned on Ziegenberg by a returning Allied bomber, damaging the church and several houses, killing four residents. With the Ardennes Offensive failed, and no new military plans or the resources with which to carry them out, the German military high command accepted that the western front was lost. Hitler left Adlerhorst on January 16, 1945, for Berlin.\n\nHaving been made commander of OB West on March 11, on March 17, Kesselring ordered all classified documents and sensitive equipment removed from the castle, moving himself and the command centre to the [[OKW]] house. On March 19, the Allies, once alerted of the original purpose of the complex, and not knowing if Hitler was still in residence, subjected the castle and surrounding area to a 45-minute fire bombing air raid by a squadron of [[P-51 Mustang]]s. This resulted in the loss of 10 civilian lives, and the castle and many of the surrounding buildings were damaged, destroyed or set on fire.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\nOn March 28, with the American army only {{convert|12|mi}} away, using all available motor pool equipment, Kesselring ordered all civilian employees and families of military personnel to evacuate. German troops were instructed to dynamite the Fuehrer's compound.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Adlerhorst & Ziegenberg.jpg|thumb|Adlerhorst & Ziegenberg 1956]]\n<br />\n\n==Capture by Allied forces==\nThe castle and village were captured by units of the [[U.S. Army]] on March 30, 1945. They found the compound as a burned-out jumbled mass of concrete bunkers bearing no resemblance to the original \"wooden country house\" design. But for some reason both the Wachhaus and the Pressehaus escaped demolition, both well preserved and with access to the remaining Adlerhorst bunker complex.\n\nSoon afterwards a British-American detention center or [[Operation Paperclip#Related operations|Operation ''Dustbin'']], was moved from [[Paris]]  and re-established in parts of the complex for high-ranking German non-military prisoners of war.  It focused on key industrialists, scientists and economists; among those interrogated here were [[Hjalmar Schacht]], [[Wernher von Braun]], [[Ferdinand Porsche]], and the leaders of the [[IG Farben]] chemical conglomerate. The highest-ranking of these persons of interest was the complex's original designer Albert Speer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Speer|first=Albert|editor=Schlie, Ulrich|year=2001|title=Alles, was ich wei\u00df|publisher=F.A.

It was later followed by V Corps (United States) which operated an NCO academy, and by U.S. intelligence units which directed large parts of its espionage network in communist [[East Germany]] from the castle. After a failed restoration attempt in the 1960s, in 1987 with US Army assistance the castle structure was rebuilt, with the stone walls clad in [[stucco]].

Under plans developed by [[Martin Bormann]] and architectural designs by Speer, a series of F\u00fchrer complexes were built. The best known were: the [[F\u00fchrerbunker]] in Berlin; the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] complex in [[Berchtesgaden]], [[Bavaria]]; and the [[Wolfsschanze]] near [[K\u0119trzyn]] in modern-day [[Poland]].\n\n[[Austrian nobility|Austrian noble]] Emma von Scheitlein acquired [[Kransberg Castle]] in the village of [[Kransberg]] in 1926, and used it for society events. Chosen due to its central location as the proposed main military command headquarters of Hitler, it was appropriated by the [[Nazi]] government in 1939. Speer immediately began adapting it, designing military-grade infrastructure which was well disguised and adapted to fit-in with its surroundings.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe main complex was a collection of seven cottages, in a heavily wooded compound beyond the castle's main entrance.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Although each building was designed as an air raid bunker with {{convert|3|ft}} thick concrete walls, each had the appearance of a traditional locally built [[Fachwerk]] (half-timbered) style wooden cottage, complete with second storey dormer windows and flower baskets under a sloped tiled roof. Internally, each was furnished in traditional German style with oak floors, pine wall panelling, utilitarian leather upholstered furniture, and decorated with fringed shade wall lamps, wall hangings depicting hunting scenes or [[Teutons|Teutonic]] battles, and a set of deer antlers.\n\nThe cottages were numbered and allocated as follows:<ref name=MilHist>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/adlerhorst.aspx|title=Hitler's Ultra-Secret Adlerhorst|author=Irwin J.

Joined by Hitler, Rundstedt ran through the plans at 05:00 on December 15; the plan that envisaged the attack of three German armies consisting of over 250,000 men. Believing in omens and the successes of his early war campaigns that had been planned at Adlerhorst, Hitler rejoiced in the battles' early successes, taking long walks in the pine forest, regaling his team with his postwar plans and aspirations.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\nShortly after Christmas, G\u00f6ring arrived and took up residence in the castle. After an extremely downbeat briefing in the casino, G\u00f6ring privately suggested to Hitler that a truce be sought via his [[Sweden|Swedish]] contacts. Hitler flew into a rage, and after threatening to have G\u00f6ring put before a firing squad, mentally dismissed him as deputy Fuehrer.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Operation Nordwind===\n{{main|Operation Nordwind}}\nAfter giving his 1945 New Year's speech from the Pressehaus, Hitler returned to Haus 1 to welcome in the New Year with his close friends and secretarial support team. At 04:00 he walked to the casino to watch the development of [[Operation Nordwind|Operation ''Nordwind'']], his counter-offensive on New Year's Day.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\nAt midnight, nine Panzer divisions of [[Army Group G|Heeresgruppe G]] commanded by [[Colonel general|Generaloberst]] [[Johannes Blaskowitz]] had mounted an all-out attack on [[Bastogne]]. Then a faked diversionary attack was mounted by eight German divisions of  [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Upper Rhine ''(Heeresgruppe Oberrhein)'']] commanded by [[Heinrich Himmler]], against the [[U.S. Seventh Army|U.S. 7th Army]] and [[First Army (France)|French 1st Army]] position, which was the thinly stretched line of 110 kilometres (68&nbsp;mi) long, near [[Lembach]] in the Upper [[Vosges]] mountains in [[Alsace]]; {{convert|120|mi}} to the southeast.\n\nThis defence line had been weakened by U.S. general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who had ordered troops, equipment and supplies north to reinforce the American armies involved in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in the [[Ardennes]]. If successful, the German operation would have opened the way for [[Operation Zahnarzt]], a planned major thrust into the rear of the U.S. 3rd Army.\n\nHowever, having cracked the [[Enigma machine|Enigma code machines]], each German manoeuvre was either prepared for, or out-flanked by an allied counter-move. This resulted in a bitter attritional campaign that was lost from the 25th January onwards, with the Germans running out of replacement man power, machinery and supplies.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Abandonment and attempted demolition===\nOn 6 January 1945, a [[blockbuster bomb]] was jettisoned on Ziegenberg by a returning Allied bomber, damaging the church and several houses, killing four residents. With the Ardennes Offensive failed, and no new military plans or the resources with which to carry them out, the German military high command accepted that the western front was lost. Hitler left Adlerhorst on January 16, 1945, for Berlin.\n\nHaving been made commander of OB West on March 11, on March 17, Kesselring ordered all classified documents and sensitive equipment removed from the castle, moving himself and the command centre to the [[OKW]] house. On March 19, the Allies, once alerted of the original purpose of the complex, and not knowing if Hitler was still in residence, subjected the castle and surrounding area to a 45-minute fire bombing air raid by a squadron of [[P-51 Mustang]]s. This resulted in the loss of 10 civilian lives, and the castle and many of the surrounding buildings were damaged, destroyed or set on fire.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\nOn March 28, with the American army only {{convert|12|mi}} away, using all available motor pool equipment, Kesselring ordered all civilian employees and families of military personnel to evacuate. German troops were instructed to dynamite the Fuehrer's compound.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Adlerhorst & Ziegenberg.jpg|thumb|Adlerhorst & Ziegenberg 1956]]\n<br />\n\n==Capture by Allied forces==\nThe castle and village were captured by units of the [[U.S. Army]] on March 30, 1945. They found the compound as a burned-out jumbled mass of concrete bunkers bearing no resemblance to the original \"wooden country house\" design. But for some reason both the Wachhaus and the Pressehaus escaped demolition, both well preserved and with access to the remaining Adlerhorst bunker complex.\n\nSoon afterwards a British-American detention center or [[Operation Paperclip#Related operations|Operation ''Dustbin'']], was moved from [[Paris]]  and re-established in parts of the complex for high-ranking German non-military prisoners of war.  It focused on key industrialists, scientists and economists; among those interrogated here were [[Hjalmar Schacht]], [[Wernher von Braun]], [[Ferdinand Porsche]], and the leaders of the [[IG Farben]] chemical conglomerate. The highest-ranking of these persons of interest was the complex's original designer Albert Speer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Speer|first=Albert|editor=Schlie, Ulrich|year=2001|title=Alles, was ich wei\u00df|publisher=F.A.

It was later followed by V Corps (United States) which operated an NCO academy, and by U.S. intelligence units which directed large parts of its espionage network in communist [[East Germany]] from the castle. After a failed restoration attempt in the 1960s, in 1987 with US Army assistance the castle structure was rebuilt, with the stone walls clad in [[stucco]]. Returned to the reunified [[German government]] in 1990, it was subsequently sold to members of the family of the pre-war owner, and converted into luxury apartments from 1991.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe ''Wachhaus'' and the ''Pressehaus'' are both preserved, with the ''Pressehaus'' an almost exact replica of the ''F\u00fchrerhaus''.\n\nThe ''Kraftfahrzeughalle'' motor pool building was not demolished. It was occupied for two years post war by a [[battalion]] of U.S. Army [[Combat Engineer]]s. Converted into a US military hospital in 1977, it was returned to the [[West Germany|West German Government]] in the same year. The half-timbered main hall still stands, and is presently occupied by offices and small businesses.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe foundations of several of the compounds houses have been recycled for modern home and business construction, with the foundation of the OKW house now the basement for a hotel and bar named the Gasthaus Adlerhorst.<ref name=MilHist/>{{better source|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Adlerhorst- Charles Carroll.jpg|thumb|Adlerhorst Bunker 1961]]\n[[File:Adlerhorst 1957.jpg|thumb|Adlerhorst Bunker 12956]]\n[[File:Adlerhorst Bunker Sign 1.jpg|thumb|Sign Removed From Adlerhorst Bunker In 1957. ]]\n<br />\n\n==References==\n* Raiber, Richard, ''Guide to Hitler's Headquarters, After The Battle, No.19'',1977\n* Seidler, Franz W.; Zeigert, Dieter: ''Die F\u00fchrerhauptquartiere.

The [[power supply]] is on the right.]]\nThe signal source might be an [[Ethernet]] cable, a [[satellite dish]], a [[coaxial cable]] (see [[cable television]]), a [[telephone]] line (including [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] connections), [[broadband over power lines]] (BPL), or even an ordinary [[Very high frequency|VHF]] or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. Content, in this context, could mean any or all of [[video]], [[Sound|audio]], [[Internet]] [[web page]]s, [[interactive]] [[video game]]s, or other possibilities. Satellite and microwave-based services also require specific external receiver hardware, so the use of set-top boxes of various formats has never completely disappeared. Set-top boxes can also enhance source signal quality.\n\n===UHF converter===\nBefore the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]] of 1962 required US [[television receiver]]s to be able to tune the entire [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] range (which in [[North America]] was [[NTSC-M]] channels [[North American broadcast television frequencies|2 through 83]] on 54 to 890 [[MHz]]), a set-top box known as a UHF converter would be installed  at the receiver to shift a portion of the UHF-TV spectrum onto low-VHF channels for viewing. As some 1960s-era 12-channel TV sets remained in use for many years, and [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] were slower than the US to require UHF tuners to be factory-installed in new TVs, a market for these converters continued to exist for much of the 1970s.\n\n===Cable converter===\n{{main|Cable converter box}}\n[[Cable television]] represented a possible alternative to deployment of UHF converters as broadcasts could be frequency-shifted to VHF channels at the cable head-end instead of the final viewing location. However, most cable systems could not accommodate the full 54-890&nbsp;MHz VHF/UHF frequency range and the twelve channels of VHF space were quickly exhausted on most systems. Adding any additional channels therefore needed to be done by inserting the extra signals into cable systems on nonstandard frequencies, typically either below VHF [[North American broadcast television frequencies|channel 7]] (midband) or directly above VHF channel 13 (superband).\n\nThese frequencies corresponded to non-television services (such as two-way radio) over-the-air and were therefore not on standard TV receivers. Before cable-ready TV sets became common in the late 1980s, an electronic tuning device called a [[cable converter box]] was needed to receive the additional [[analog (signal)|analog]] [[Cable television|cable]] [[television channel|TV channels]] and transpose or convert the selected channel to [[analog video|analog]] [[radio frequency]] (RF) for viewing on a regular TV set on a single channel, usually [[VHF]] channel 3 or 4. The box allowed an analog non-cable-ready [[television]] set to receive analog encrypted cable channels and was a prototype topology for later date digital encryption devices. Newer televisions were then converted to be analog cypher cable-ready, with the standard converter built-in for selling [[premium television]] (aka [[pay per view]]). Several years later and slowly marketed, the advent of [[digital cable]] continued and increased the need for various forms of these devices. [[Block converter|Block conversion]] of the entire affected frequency band onto [[UHF]], while less common, was used by some models to provide full [[VCR]] compatibility and the ability to drive multiple TV sets, albeit with a somewhat nonstandard channel numbering scheme.\n\nNewer television receivers greatly reduced the need for external set-top boxes, although [[cable converter box]]es continue to be used to [[Decryption|descramble]] premium cable channels according to carrier-controlled access restrictions, and to receive digital cable channels, along with using interactive services like [[video on demand]], pay per view, and [[home shopping]] through television.\n\n===Closed captioning box===\nSet-top boxes were also made to enable [[closed captioning]] on older sets in North America, before this became a mandated inclusion in new [[TV set]]s. Some have also been produced to mute the [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] (or replace it with noise) when [[profanity]] is detected in the captioning, where the offensive word is also blocked. Some also include a [[V-chip]] that allows only programs of some [[television content rating]]s. A function that limits children's time watching TV or playing [[video game]]s may also be built in, though some of these work on main electricity rather than the video signal.\n\n===Digital television adapter===\n{{main|Digital television adapter}}\nThe [[digital television transition|transition]] to [[digital terrestrial television]] after the turn of the millennium left many existing [[television receiver]]s unable to tune and display the new signal directly. In the United States, where [[analog shutdown]] was completed in 2009 for full-service broadcasters, a federal subsidy was offered for [[coupon-eligible converter box]]es with deliberately limited capability which would restore signals lost to digital transition.\n\n===Professional set-top box===\n{{main|Integrated receiver/decoder}}\nProfessional set-top boxes are referred to as IRDs or [[integrated receiver/decoder]]s in the professional broadcast audio/video industry. They are designed for more robust field handling and [[19-inch rack|rack mounting]] environments. IRDs are capable of outputting uncompressed [[serial digital interface]] signals, unlike consumer STBs which usually don't, mostly because of copyright reasons.\n\n===Hybrid box===\n[[File:Lenovo A30 Internet TV Set Top Box - Front with Remote (6639767915).jpg|thumbnail|Lenovo A30 set-top box]]\nHybrid set-top boxes, such as those used for [[Smart TV]] programming, enable viewers to access multiple TV delivery methods (including terrestrial, cable, internet, and satellite); like IPTV boxes, they include [[video on demand]], [[time-shifting]] TV, Internet applications, [[video telephony]], surveillance, gaming, shopping, TV-centric [[electronic program guide]]s, and e-government.

IP set-top boxes have a built-in [[home network]] interface that can be [[Ethernet]], Wireless (802.11 g,n,ac), or one of the existing wire home networking technologies such as [[HomePNA]] or the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1Gbit/s) [[local area network]] using existing home wiring ([[power line communication|power lines]], phone lines, and [[ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]).<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx New global standard for fully networked home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |date=2009-02-21 }}, ITU-T Press Release</ref>\n\nIn the US and Europe, telephone companies use IPTV (often on [[ADSL]] or [[optical fiber]] networks) as a means to compete with traditional local [[cable television]] monopolies.\n\nThis type of service is distinct from [[Internet television]], which involves third-party content over the public Internet not controlled by the local system operator.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Programming features===\n====Electronic program guide====\n[[Electronic program guide]]s and interactive program guides provide users of television, radio, and other media applications with continuously updated menus displaying [[broadcast programming]] or scheduling information for current and upcoming programming.

The concept of favourite channels is superficially similar to that of the \"[[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|bookmark]]\" function offered in many Web browsers.\n\n====Timer====\nThe [[Timer#Electronic timers|timer]] allows the user to program and enable the box to switch between channels at certain times: this is handy to record from more than one channel while the user is out. The user still needs to program the VCR or DVD recorder.\n\n===Convenience features===\n\n====Controls on the box====\nSome models have controls on the box, as well as on the [[remote control]]. This is useful should the user lose the remote or if the batteries age.\n\n====Remote controls that work with other TVs====\nSome [[remote control]]s can also control some basic functions of various brands of TVs. This allows the user to use just one remote to turn the TV on and off, adjust volume, or switch between digital and analog TV channels or between [[Digital terrestrial television|terrestrial]] and [[Internet television|internet]] channels.\n\n====Parental locks====\nThe [[parental controls|parental lock]] or [[content-control software|content filters]] allow users over 18 years old to block access to channels that are not appropriate for children, using a [[personal identification number]]. Some boxes simply block all channels, while others allow the user to restrict access to chosen channels not suitable for children below certain ages.\n\n===Software alternatives===\nAs complexity and potential programming faults of the set-top box increase,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chimera of Software Quality|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/site/computer/menuitem.eb7d70008ce52e4b0ef1bd108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=computer_level1&path=computer/homepage/Aug07&file=profession.xml&xsl=article.xsl&;jsessionid=HlLtV9yJh01bCLb3GTQCZJL2VxGNxZPZLvJWXJpJwsjg2711JmW9|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428025525/https://www.computer.org/portal/site/computer/menuitem.eb7d70008ce52e4b0ef1bd108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=computer_level1&path=computer%2Fhomepage%2FAug07&file=profession.xml&xsl=article.xsl&%3Bjsessionid=HlLtV9yJh01bCLb3GTQCZJL2VxGNxZPZLvJWXJpJwsjg2711JmW9|archivedate=2018-04-28}} 080322 computer.org</ref> software such as [[MythTV]], [[Select-TV]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Media Center|Media Center]] have developed features comparable to those of set-top boxes, ranging from basic DVR-like functionality to [[DVD]] copying, [[home automation]], and housewide music or video playback.\n\n===Firmware update features===\n[[File:Set-top box firmware being updated.jpg|thumbnail|Set-top box firmware being updated]]\nAlmost all modern set-top boxes feature automatic [[patch (computing)|firmware update]] processes. The firmware update is typically provided by the service provider.\n\n==Ambiguities in the definition==\n\nWith the advent of [[flat-panel display|flat-panel televisions]], set-top boxes are now deeper in profile than the tops of most modern TV sets. Because of this, set-top boxes are often placed beneath televisions, and the term set-top box has become something of a [[misnomer]], possibly helping the adoption of the term ''digibox''. Additionally, newer set-top boxes that sit at the edge of IP-based distribution networks are often called net-top boxes or NTBs, to differentiate between IP and RF inputs. The Roku LT is around the size of a pack of cards and delivers Smart TV to conventional sets.<ref>Which? Consumer's Guide; October 2012; page 41</ref>\n\nThe distinction between external tuner or [[demodulator]] boxes (traditionally considered to be \"set-top boxes\") and storage devices (such as VCR, DVD, or disc-based PVR units) is also blurred by the increasing deployment of satellite and cable tuner boxes with [[hard disk drive|hard disk]], [[local-area network|network]] or [[USB]] interfaces built-in.\n\nDevices with the capabilities of [[computer terminal]]s, such as the [[WebTV]] [[thin client]], also fall into the grey area that could invite the term \"NTB\".\n\n===Europe===\nIn Europe, a set-top box does not necessarily contain a [[tuner (electronics)|tuner]] of its own. A box connected to a television (or VCR) [[SCART]] connector is fed with the [[baseband]] television signal from the set's tuner, and can have the television display the returned processed signal instead.\n\n[[File:Pace DC757X cable box mod.jpg|thumb|[[Pace Micro Technology]] DC757X Set top box]]\nThis SCART feature had been used for connection to analogue decoding equipment by [[pay TV]] operators in Europe, and in the past was used for connection to teletext equipment before the decoders became built-in. The outgoing signal could be of the same nature as the incoming signal, or [[YPbPr|RGB]] [[component video]], or even an \"[[local insertion|insert]]\" over the original signal, due to the \"fast switching\" feature of SCART.\n\nIn case of analogue pay-TV, this approach avoided the need for a second [[remote control]]. The use of [[digital television]] signals in more modern pay-TV schemes requires that decoding take place before the digital-to-analogue conversion step, rendering the video outputs of an analogue SCART connector no longer suitable for interconnection to decryption hardware. Standards such as [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB's]] [[Common Interface]] and [[ATSC|ATSC's]] [[CableCARD]] therefore use a [[PCMCIA]]-like card inserted as part of the digital signal path as their alternative to a tuner-equipped set-top box.\n\n==Energy use==\nIn June 2011 a report from the American National Resources Defense Council brought attention to the energy efficiency of set-top boxes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/settopboxes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225090851/http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/settopboxes.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-25 }} Natural Resources Defense Council.</ref> and the [[US Department of Energy]] announced plans to consider the adoption of energy efficiency standards for set-top boxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/cable-boxes-and-dvrs-can-appliance-standards-help-tame-these-hidden-energy-hogs-30-jun-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129235500/http://www.eesi.org/cable-boxes-and-dvrs-can-appliance-standards-help-tame-these-hidden-energy-hogs-30-jun-2011 |archivedate=2012-01-29 }} Environmental and Energy Study Institute</ref> In November 2011, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association announced a new energy efficiency initiative that commits the largest American cable operators to the purchase of set-top boxes that meet [[Energy Star]] standards and the development of [[Sleep mode|sleep modes]] that will use less energy when the set-top box is not being used to watch or record video.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncta.com/ReleaseType/MediaRelease/US-Cable-Industry-Launches-New-Energy-Efficiency-Initiative.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512100206/http://www.ncta.com/ReleaseType/MediaRelease/US-Cable-Industry-Launches-New-Energy-Efficiency-Initiative.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-12 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[AllVid]]\n* [[CableCARD]]\n* [[Comparison of digital media players]]\n* [[Digital media player]]\n* [[Over-the-top media services]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category inline|Set-top boxes}}\n\n{{Home theater PC (application software)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Set-Top Box}}\n[[Category:Set-top box| ]]\n[[Category:Cable television technology]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n[[Category:Satellite broadcasting]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Information appliance device (cable box)}}\n[[File:Set-top Box, 2013.png|260px|thumb|An [[Inview Technology|Inview]] Neelix set-top box manufactured in 2012.

As some 1960s-era 12-channel TV sets remained in use for many years, and [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] were slower than the US to require UHF tuners to be factory-installed in new TVs, a market for these converters continued to exist for much of the 1970s.\n\n===Cable converter===\n{{main|Cable converter box}}\n[[Cable television]] represented a possible alternative to deployment of UHF converters as broadcasts could be frequency-shifted to VHF channels at the cable head-end instead of the final viewing location. However, most cable systems could not accommodate the full 54-890&nbsp;MHz VHF/UHF frequency range and the twelve channels of VHF space were quickly exhausted on most systems. Adding any additional channels therefore needed to be done by inserting the extra signals into cable systems on nonstandard frequencies, typically either below VHF [[North American broadcast television frequencies|channel 7]] (midband) or directly above VHF channel 13 (superband).\n\nThese frequencies corresponded to non-television services (such as two-way radio) over-the-air and were therefore not on standard TV receivers. Before cable-ready TV sets became common in the late 1980s, an electronic tuning device called a [[cable converter box]] was needed to receive the additional [[analog (signal)|analog]] [[Cable television|cable]] [[television channel|TV channels]] and transpose or convert the selected channel to [[analog video|analog]] [[radio frequency]] (RF) for viewing on a regular TV set on a single channel, usually [[VHF]] channel 3 or 4. The box allowed an analog non-cable-ready [[television]] set to receive analog encrypted cable channels and was a prototype topology for later date digital encryption devices. Newer televisions were then converted to be analog cypher cable-ready, with the standard converter built-in for selling [[premium television]] (aka [[pay per view]]). Several years later and slowly marketed, the advent of [[digital cable]] continued and increased the need for various forms of these devices. [[Block converter|Block conversion]] of the entire affected frequency band onto [[UHF]], while less common, was used by some models to provide full [[VCR]] compatibility and the ability to drive multiple TV sets, albeit with a somewhat nonstandard channel numbering scheme.\n\nNewer television receivers greatly reduced the need for external set-top boxes, although [[cable converter box]]es continue to be used to [[Decryption|descramble]] premium cable channels according to carrier-controlled access restrictions, and to receive digital cable channels, along with using interactive services like [[video on demand]], pay per view, and [[home shopping]] through television.\n\n===Closed captioning box===\nSet-top boxes were also made to enable [[closed captioning]] on older sets in North America, before this became a mandated inclusion in new [[TV set]]s. Some have also been produced to mute the [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] (or replace it with noise) when [[profanity]] is detected in the captioning, where the offensive word is also blocked. Some also include a [[V-chip]] that allows only programs of some [[television content rating]]s. A function that limits children's time watching TV or playing [[video game]]s may also be built in, though some of these work on main electricity rather than the video signal.\n\n===Digital television adapter===\n{{main|Digital television adapter}}\nThe [[digital television transition|transition]] to [[digital terrestrial television]] after the turn of the millennium left many existing [[television receiver]]s unable to tune and display the new signal directly. In the United States, where [[analog shutdown]] was completed in 2009 for full-service broadcasters, a federal subsidy was offered for [[coupon-eligible converter box]]es with deliberately limited capability which would restore signals lost to digital transition.\n\n===Professional set-top box===\n{{main|Integrated receiver/decoder}}\nProfessional set-top boxes are referred to as IRDs or [[integrated receiver/decoder]]s in the professional broadcast audio/video industry. They are designed for more robust field handling and [[19-inch rack|rack mounting]] environments. IRDs are capable of outputting uncompressed [[serial digital interface]] signals, unlike consumer STBs which usually don't, mostly because of copyright reasons.\n\n===Hybrid box===\n[[File:Lenovo A30 Internet TV Set Top Box - Front with Remote (6639767915).jpg|thumbnail|Lenovo A30 set-top box]]\nHybrid set-top boxes, such as those used for [[Smart TV]] programming, enable viewers to access multiple TV delivery methods (including terrestrial, cable, internet, and satellite); like IPTV boxes, they include [[video on demand]], [[time-shifting]] TV, Internet applications, [[video telephony]], surveillance, gaming, shopping, TV-centric [[electronic program guide]]s, and e-government.

IP set-top boxes have a built-in [[home network]] interface that can be [[Ethernet]], Wireless (802.11 g,n,ac), or one of the existing wire home networking technologies such as [[HomePNA]] or the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1Gbit/s) [[local area network]] using existing home wiring ([[power line communication|power lines]], phone lines, and [[ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]).<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx New global standard for fully networked home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |date=2009-02-21 }}, ITU-T Press Release</ref>\n\nIn the US and Europe, telephone companies use IPTV (often on [[ADSL]] or [[optical fiber]] networks) as a means to compete with traditional local [[cable television]] monopolies.\n\nThis type of service is distinct from [[Internet television]], which involves third-party content over the public Internet not controlled by the local system operator.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Programming features===\n====Electronic program guide====\n[[Electronic program guide]]s and interactive program guides provide users of television, radio, and other media applications with continuously updated menus displaying [[broadcast programming]] or scheduling information for current and upcoming programming.

The concept of favourite channels is superficially similar to that of the \"[[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|bookmark]]\" function offered in many Web browsers.\n\n====Timer====\nThe [[Timer#Electronic timers|timer]] allows the user to program and enable the box to switch between channels at certain times: this is handy to record from more than one channel while the user is out. The user still needs to program the VCR or DVD recorder.\n\n===Convenience features===\n\n====Controls on the box====\nSome models have controls on the box, as well as on the [[remote control]]. This is useful should the user lose the remote or if the batteries age.\n\n====Remote controls that work with other TVs====\nSome [[remote control]]s can also control some basic functions of various brands of TVs. This allows the user to use just one remote to turn the TV on and off, adjust volume, or switch between digital and analog TV channels or between [[Digital terrestrial television|terrestrial]] and [[Internet television|internet]] channels.\n\n====Parental locks====\nThe [[parental controls|parental lock]] or [[content-control software|content filters]] allow users over 18 years old to block access to channels that are not appropriate for children, using a [[personal identification number]]. Some boxes simply block all channels, while others allow the user to restrict access to chosen channels not suitable for children below certain ages.\n\n===Software alternatives===\nAs complexity and potential programming faults of the set-top box increase,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chimera of Software Quality|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/site/computer/menuitem.eb7d70008ce52e4b0ef1bd108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=computer_level1&path=computer/homepage/Aug07&file=profession.xml&xsl=article.xsl&;jsessionid=HlLtV9yJh01bCLb3GTQCZJL2VxGNxZPZLvJWXJpJwsjg2711JmW9|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428025525/https://www.computer.org/portal/site/computer/menuitem.eb7d70008ce52e4b0ef1bd108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=computer_level1&path=computer%2Fhomepage%2FAug07&file=profession.xml&xsl=article.xsl&%3Bjsessionid=HlLtV9yJh01bCLb3GTQCZJL2VxGNxZPZLvJWXJpJwsjg2711JmW9|archivedate=2018-04-28}} 080322 computer.org</ref> software such as [[MythTV]], [[Select-TV]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Media Center|Media Center]] have developed features comparable to those of set-top boxes, ranging from basic DVR-like functionality to [[DVD]] copying, [[home automation]], and housewide music or video playback.\n\n===Firmware update features===\n[[File:Set-top box firmware being updated.jpg|thumbnail|Set-top box firmware being updated]]\nAlmost all modern set-top boxes feature automatic [[patch (computing)|firmware update]] processes. The firmware update is typically provided by the service provider.\n\n==Ambiguities in the definition==\n\nWith the advent of [[flat-panel display|flat-panel televisions]], set-top boxes are now deeper in profile than the tops of most modern TV sets. Because of this, set-top boxes are often placed beneath televisions, and the term set-top box has become something of a [[misnomer]], possibly helping the adoption of the term ''digibox''. Additionally, newer set-top boxes that sit at the edge of IP-based distribution networks are often called net-top boxes or NTBs, to differentiate between IP and RF inputs. The Roku LT is around the size of a pack of cards and delivers Smart TV to conventional sets.<ref>Which? Consumer's Guide; October 2012; page 41</ref>\n\nThe distinction between external tuner or [[demodulator]] boxes (traditionally considered to be \"set-top boxes\") and storage devices (such as VCR, DVD, or disc-based PVR units) is also blurred by the increasing deployment of satellite and cable tuner boxes with [[hard disk drive|hard disk]], [[local-area network|network]] or [[USB]] interfaces built-in.\n\nDevices with the capabilities of [[computer terminal]]s, such as the [[WebTV]] [[thin client]], also fall into the grey area that could invite the term \"NTB\".\n\n===Europe===\nIn Europe, a set-top box does not necessarily contain a [[tuner (electronics)|tuner]] of its own. A box connected to a television (or VCR) [[SCART]] connector is fed with the [[baseband]] television signal from the set's tuner, and can have the television display the returned processed signal instead.\n\n[[File:Pace DC757X cable box mod.jpg|thumb|[[Pace Micro Technology]] DC757X Set top box]]\nThis SCART feature had been used for connection to analogue decoding equipment by [[pay TV]] operators in Europe, and in the past was used for connection to teletext equipment before the decoders became built-in. The outgoing signal could be of the same nature as the incoming signal, or [[YPbPr|RGB]] [[component video]], or even an \"[[local insertion|insert]]\" over the original signal, due to the \"fast switching\" feature of SCART.\n\nIn case of analogue pay-TV, this approach avoided the need for a second [[remote control]]. The use of [[digital television]] signals in more modern pay-TV schemes requires that decoding take place before the digital-to-analogue conversion step, rendering the video outputs of an analogue SCART connector no longer suitable for interconnection to decryption hardware. Standards such as [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB's]] [[Common Interface]] and [[ATSC|ATSC's]] [[CableCARD]] therefore use a [[PCMCIA]]-like card inserted as part of the digital signal path as their alternative to a tuner-equipped set-top box.\n\n==Energy use==\nIn June 2011 a report from the American National Resources Defense Council brought attention to the energy efficiency of set-top boxes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/settopboxes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225090851/http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/settopboxes.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-25 }} Natural Resources Defense Council.</ref> and the [[US Department of Energy]] announced plans to consider the adoption of energy efficiency standards for set-top boxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/cable-boxes-and-dvrs-can-appliance-standards-help-tame-these-hidden-energy-hogs-30-jun-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129235500/http://www.eesi.org/cable-boxes-and-dvrs-can-appliance-standards-help-tame-these-hidden-energy-hogs-30-jun-2011 |archivedate=2012-01-29 }} Environmental and Energy Study Institute</ref> In November 2011, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association announced a new energy efficiency initiative that commits the largest American cable operators to the purchase of set-top boxes that meet [[Energy Star]] standards and the development of [[Sleep mode|sleep modes]] that will use less energy when the set-top box is not being used to watch or record video.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncta.com/ReleaseType/MediaRelease/US-Cable-Industry-Launches-New-Energy-Efficiency-Initiative.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512100206/http://www.ncta.com/ReleaseType/MediaRelease/US-Cable-Industry-Launches-New-Energy-Efficiency-Initiative.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-12 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[AllVid]]\n* [[CableCARD]]\n* [[Comparison of digital media players]]\n* [[Digital media player]]\n* [[Over-the-top media services]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category inline|Set-top boxes}}\n\n{{Home theater PC (application software)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Set-Top Box}}\n[[Category:Set-top box| ]]\n[[Category:Cable television technology]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n[[Category:Satellite broadcasting]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n", "name_user": "SUM1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammar and links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box"}
