Ford used ''Sequoia'' less than Nixon. In May 1975, Ford was the first known president to host a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting aboard the vessel. Lasting four hours, the President and his cabinet discussed wide-ranging issues facing the United States, including a discussion regarding Congressional relations, confronting the issue of Vietnamese refugees, and the status of the U.S. Energy program in light of the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref>Box C20, folder \u201cPresidential Handwriting, 5/5/1975 (3)\u201d of the Presidential Handwriting File at the Gerald R.

Carter would later recall selling the yacht as a mistake. In a conversation with broadcaster Ray Suarez, Carter said: \u201cPeople thought I was not being reverent enough to the office I was holding, that I was too much of a peanut farmer, not enough of an aristocrat, or something like that. So I think that shows that the American people want something of, an element of, image of monarchy in the White House.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/events-and-awards/forums/past-forums/transcripts/a-conversation-with-president-jimmy-carter-0|title=Link to Oral History Interview with Jimmy Carter}}</ref> In his 2015 [[autobiography]] \"''A Full Life: Reflections at 90\"'' Presidential Carter wrote of selling ''Sequoia, \"''I was determined to be strict on expenditures for the nation, and to set an example in my personal life. I decided to sell the presidential yacht ''Sequoia'', and to minimize the playing of \u201cRuffles and Flourishes\u201d when I arrived at public meetings. I was surprised when some of these changes proved to be quite unpopular, and to learn how much the public cherished the pomp and ceremony of the presidency.\" \n\n=== Winston Churchill and the ''Sequoia'' ===\n''Sequoia'' served as refuge for presidents to relax with friends and conduct business outside of the public spotlight. As a result, no official documentary evidence exists for many events which took place aboard the yacht, and certain lore has developed, particularly regarding British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]'s activities aboard ''Sequoia''. This includes, but is not limited to, Churchill and Roosevelt planning [[Normandy landings|D-day]] together on the large table in ''Sequoia''{{'}}s main salon, Churchill gifting deck chairs from the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] for ''Sequoia''{{'}}s upper deck and Churchill being the impetus behind Roosevelt decommissioning the USS ''Sequoia'' so that the two leaders could drink on board \u2013 alcoholic beverages were prohibited aboard commissioned naval vessels. Despite these persistent legends, Churchill was never documented as being aboard the yacht.\n\n==Private Ownership==\n''Sequoia'' has had 7 owners since being sold by the U.S. government in 1977. Certain of the past owners sought to offset the costs of maintaining and operating the vessel by offering ''Sequoia'' for private charter, and others were non-profit groups seeking to maintain her for historical reasons and/or return her to Presidential service. \n\nIt was Thomas Malloy who purchased ''Sequoia'' from the U.S government in May 1977 for $286,000.<ref>Box 57, folder \u201cSequoia \u2013 Presidential Yacht\u201d of the Elizabeth Lumpkin Press Office Files at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/archives.html|title=Link to Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref> Three months later, Malloy resold ''Sequoia'' to a partnership led by Norman Pulliam for $355,000. Mr. Pulliam maintained ''Sequoia'' in Myrtal Beach SC and then sold her to The Ocean Learning Institute of Palm Beach, FL during March 1980 for $750,000. The institute used ''Sequoia'' to entertain potential donors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/06/17/the-sequoia-sales-home/a9de04ea-b079-4581-93ed-65524d4e06ce/|title=The Washington Post|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpg|thumb|left|Vice President George Bush and future Chinese President Shangkun Yang aboard ''Sequoia'' May 1987]][[File:Sequoia World Trade Centers 1985.jpg|thumb|right|''Sequoia'' in front of the World Trade Centers July 4, 1986]]The Presidential Yacht Trust, a non-profit organization, acquired ''Sequoia'' from the Institute for approximately $1.1 million in 1980 and brought ''Sequoia'' back to D.C for use by the President and his cabinet.

''Sequoia'' underwent a $2 million restoration in 1986 before participating in the flotilla of vessels celebrating the centennial of the Statue of Liberty on July 4, 1986.

Ford used ''Sequoia'' less than Nixon. In May 1975, Ford was the first known president to host a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting aboard the vessel. Lasting four hours, the President and his cabinet discussed wide-ranging issues facing the United States, including a discussion regarding Congressional relations, confronting the issue of Vietnamese refugees, and the status of the U.S. Energy program in light of the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref>Box C20, folder \u201cPresidential Handwriting, 5/5/1975 (3)\u201d of the Presidential Handwriting File at the Gerald R.

Carter would later recall selling the yacht as a mistake. In a conversation with broadcaster Ray Suarez, Carter said: \u201cPeople thought I was not being reverent enough to the office I was holding, that I was too much of a peanut farmer, not enough of an aristocrat, or something like that.

I decided to sell the presidential yacht ''Sequoia'', and to minimize the playing of \u201cRuffles and Flourishes\u201d when I arrived at public meetings. I was surprised when some of these changes proved to be quite unpopular, and to learn how much the public cherished the pomp and ceremony of the presidency.\" \n\n=== Winston Churchill and the ''Sequoia'' ===\n''Sequoia'' served as refuge for presidents to relax with friends and conduct business outside of the public spotlight. As a result, no official documentary evidence exists for many events which took place aboard the yacht, and certain lore has developed, particularly regarding British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]'s activities aboard ''Sequoia''. This includes, but is not limited to, Churchill and Roosevelt planning [[Normandy landings|D-day]] together on the large table in ''Sequoia''{{'}}s main salon, Churchill gifting deck chairs from the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] for ''Sequoia''{{'}}s upper deck and Churchill being the impetus behind Roosevelt decommissioning the USS ''Sequoia'' so that the two leaders could drink on board \u2013 alcoholic beverages were prohibited aboard commissioned naval vessels. Despite these persistent legends, Churchill was never documented as being aboard the yacht.\n\n==Private Ownership==\n''Sequoia'' has had 7 owners since being sold by the U.S. government in 1977. Certain of the past owners sought to offset the costs of maintaining and operating the vessel by offering ''Sequoia'' for private charter, and others were non-profit groups seeking to maintain her for historical reasons and/or return her to Presidential service. \n\nIt was Thomas Malloy who purchased ''Sequoia'' from the U.S government in May 1977 for $286,000.<ref>Box 57, folder \u201cSequoia \u2013 Presidential Yacht\u201d of the Elizabeth Lumpkin Press Office Files at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/archives.html|title=Link to Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref> Three months later, Malloy resold ''Sequoia'' to a partnership led by Norman Pulliam for $355,000. Mr. Pulliam maintained ''Sequoia'' in Myrtal Beach SC and then sold her to The Ocean Learning Institute of Palm Beach, FL during March 1980 for $750,000. The institute used ''Sequoia'' to entertain potential donors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/06/17/the-sequoia-sales-home/a9de04ea-b079-4581-93ed-65524d4e06ce/|title=The Washington Post|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpg|thumb|left|Vice President George Bush and future Chinese President Shangkun Yang aboard ''Sequoia'' May 1987]][[File:Sequoia World Trade Centers 1985.jpg|thumb|right|''Sequoia'' in front of the World Trade Centers July 4, 1986]]The Presidential Yacht Trust, a non-profit organization, acquired ''Sequoia'' from the Institute for approximately $1.1 million in 1980 and brought ''Sequoia'' back to D.C for use by the President and his cabinet.

''Sequoia'' underwent a $2 million restoration in 1986 before participating in the flotilla of vessels celebrating the centennial of the Statue of Liberty on July 4, 1986.

(2017\u2013present)''' is an ongoing [[insurgency]] that began in late 2017 after the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) lost territorial control in the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u201317)|Iraqi Civil War]] of 2014 to 2017. Several rebel groups, including ISIL, [[White Flags]] and the [[Iraqi Baath Party]] fight the [[Military of Iraq|Iraqi military]] (largely backed by the [[United States]] and [[International military intervention against ISIL|other countries]] conducting [[airstrike]]s against ISIL) and [[Private militias in Iraq|allied]] paramilitary forces (largely backed by [[Iran]]).\n\n== Context ==\nThe insurgency is a direct continuation of the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|Iraqi Civil War]] from 2014 to 2017, with mostly Sunni rebel groups continuing armed opposition against the Shia-led [[Iraqi Government]]. Along with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), other insurgents fighting the government include a group known as the [[White Flags]] which is reportedly composed of former ISIL members and Kurdish rebels and is believed by the government of Iraq to be part of [[Ansar al-Islam]] and possibly affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]].<ref name=\"businessinsider.com\" /> The group operates mostly in the [[Kirkuk Governorate]] and has used an assortment of [[guerilla]] tactics against government forces. Other factions opposed to the Iraqi government include the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Iraqi Baath Party]] currently led by [[Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri]] a former official to [[Saddam Hussein]] during his rule in Iraq and has been active in Iraq's conflict since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-led invasion]] in 2003 leading multiple factions including the [[Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order|Naqshbandi Army]] and [[Supreme Command for Jihad and Liberation]]. In September 2017, [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], the leader of ISIL, called on ISIL supporters around the world to launch attacks on Western news media and continued in his message the ISIL must focus on combating the two-pronged attack on the Muslim [[Ummah]]; these statements marked a departure from previous rhetoric which was focused on the state building of ISIL and heralded a shift in ISIL's strategy toward a classical insurgency.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Bilal|first1=Giath|title=Defeating ISISl|journal=zenith|date=22 December 2017|url=https://magazine.zenith.me/en/politics/islamic-state-flux}}</ref>\n\n== Course of the insurgency ==\nSince ISIL's [[Battle of Mosul (2016\u20132017)|loss]] of [[Mosul]] in late 2017 which was declared as Iraq's victory over ISIL and widely seen as an end to the Civil War, and declared as such by Iraq's Prime Minister [[Haidar al-Abadi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate/iraq-declares-final-victory-over-islamic-state-idUSKBN1E30B9|title=Iraq declares final victory over Islamic State|first=Maher|last=Chmaytelli|publisher=Reuters|date=9 December 2017|access-date=3 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820043821/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate/iraq-declares-final-victory-over-islamic-state-idUSKBN1E30B9|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> multiple incidents of violence have occurred being carried out by the conflicting sides, in spite of Iraq's declaration of victory over ISIL the group is widely seen as far from gone and continues to retain a presence throughout Iraq, and still capable of carrying out attacks and skirmishes with pro-government forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/isis-returns-iraq-terror-hawija|title=ISIS returns to Iraq, and a town confronts a new wave of terror|website=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2018-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004010311/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/isis-returns-iraq-terror-hawija|archive-date=2018-10-04|url-status=live}}</ref> ISIL has been waging a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] with a strong presence in the governorates of [[Kirkuk Governorate|Kirkuk]], [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]], [[Saladin Governorate|Saladin]], and [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Sulaymaniyah]], with local forces largely ill-equipped and inexperienced, ISIL has also taken advantage of the areas rough terrain to carry out operations.

That claim of strength was simultaneously tempered though, with the Pentagon saying that ISIL had lost all of its territory and fighters were scattered, making them much less of a threat.

Several rebel groups, including ISIL, [[White Flags]] and the [[Iraqi Baath Party]] fight the [[Military of Iraq|Iraqi military]] (largely backed by the [[United States]] and [[International military intervention against ISIL|other countries]] conducting [[airstrike]]s against ISIL) and [[Private militias in Iraq|allied]] paramilitary forces (largely backed by [[Iran]]).\n\n== Context ==\nThe insurgency is a direct continuation of the [[Iraqi Civil War]] from 2014 to 2017, with mostly Sunni rebel groups continuing armed opposition against the Shia-led [[Iraqi Government]]. Along with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), other insurgents fighting the government include a group known as the [[White Flags]] which is reportedly composed of former ISIL members and Kurdish rebels and is believed by the government of Iraq to be part of [[Ansar al-Islam]] and possibly affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]].<ref name=\"businessinsider.com\" /> The group operates mostly in the [[Kirkuk Governorate]] and has used an assortment of [[guerilla]] tactics against government forces. Other factions opposed to the Iraqi government include the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Iraqi Baath Party]] currently led by [[Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri]] a former official to [[Saddam Hussein]] during his rule in Iraq and has been active in Iraq's conflict since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-led invasion]] in 2003 leading multiple factions including the [[Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order|Naqshbandi Army]] and [[Supreme Command for Jihad and Liberation]]. In September 2017, [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], the leader of ISIL, called on ISIL supporters around the world to launch attacks on Western news media and continued in his message the ISIL must focus on combating the two-pronged attack on the Muslim [[Ummah]]; these statements marked a departure from previous rhetoric which was focused on the state building of ISIL and heralded a shift in ISIL's strategy toward a classical insurgency.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Bilal|first1=Giath|title=Defeating ISISl|journal=zenith|date=22 December 2017|url=https://magazine.zenith.me/en/politics/islamic-state-flux}}</ref>\n\n== Course of the insurgency ==\nSince ISIL's [[Battle of Mosul (2016\u20132017)|loss]] of [[Mosul]] in late 2017 which was declared as Iraq's victory over ISIL and widely seen as an end to the Civil War, and declared as such by Iraq's Prime Minister [[Haidar al-Abadi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate/iraq-declares-final-victory-over-islamic-state-idUSKBN1E30B9|title=Iraq declares final victory over Islamic State|first=Maher|last=Chmaytelli|publisher=Reuters|date=9 December 2017|access-date=3 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820043821/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate/iraq-declares-final-victory-over-islamic-state-idUSKBN1E30B9|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> multiple incidents of violence have occurred being carried out by the conflicting sides, in spite of Iraq's declaration of victory over ISIL the group is widely seen as far from gone and continues to retain a presence throughout Iraq, and still capable of carrying out attacks and skirmishes with pro-government forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/isis-returns-iraq-terror-hawija|title=ISIS returns to Iraq, and a town confronts a new wave of terror|website=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2018-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004010311/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/isis-returns-iraq-terror-hawija|archive-date=2018-10-04|url-status=live}}</ref> ISIL has been waging a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] with a strong presence in the governorates of [[Kirkuk Governorate|Kirkuk]], [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]], [[Saladin Governorate|Saladin]], and [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Sulaymaniyah]], with local forces largely ill-equipped and inexperienced, ISIL has also taken advantage of the areas rough terrain to carry out operations.

{"title_page": "Historic bridges of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n[[Image:BridgeRoadway7 1 32.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Sydney Harbour Bridge]]\nThis list documents historical [[bridge]]s located in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Road, rail and pedestrian bridges are listed.\nGenerally bridges built before WWII (1939) have been included in this list.\n\n==Historical context==\nBridge construction in New South Wales starts with the needs of the first settlers and continues through to the present day with advanced bridge design. The infant colony had limited expertise and limited materials. As time passed, techniques and materials were developed that allowed greater spans to be crossed and therefore expansion of the colony into otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\nThe [[Office of Public Works and Services, New South Wales|NSW Public Works Department]] was under pressure from a cash strapped government to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible.<ref name=rta/> The cheapest bridge was the [[Truss bridge|timber truss]] which could be built with local timber.\n\nAll bridges are unique in the sense that the bridges were built using various technology, expertise, or materials or how they gained access to an area.\n\nFor example, at the time of early settlement, (1788 onwards) NSW was very isolated from the technological advances being developed in Europe and North America. Materials such as [[cast iron]] were unavailable to early colonial NSW bridge builders. NSW bridge builders had to rely on their own resourcefulness, bred of isolation, distance and the unique environment to make these bridges.\n\nNew South Wales's unusual environment, in general, results in unusual, and extreme river flows. This resulted in almost no water flow for most of the year with some flow each year and extreme floods around once a decade. Inland, the environment causes a low pressure system coming over the continent, due to a large high pressure of the Indian Ocean. This often occurs at summer, at which time it causes cyclone season, although it can occur at any time of year (but not inducing cyclones). At the coast, the cause is the \"east coast low\", which occurs at similar places at  the eastern edge of a number continents, and sees the continent's  normal high pressure  systems becomes  one large and stationary system, perhaps due to doldrums over the west coast's ocean.    This phenomenon causes the global trade winds deviate, - inducing the  low pressures  at polar and tropical latitudes to connect along the east coast - producing a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] situation that mimics a tropical [[monsoon]]. An east coast low rain event can occur at any time of the year.  Early settlers often  replaced washed out bridges with a similarly rudimentary structure, only to see it also washed away in a heavy rain event.  The government came to see that this was a major problem holding back economic development in New South Wales.\n\nIn solving these problems, colonial NSW embraced the innovations produced by others and adapted them successfully to the unique situations presented. There are examples of some fine 19th-century bridge engineering provided for the railway expansion, conceived mainly by British engineers working in the then isolation of the Australian inland. One examples of many of the newer European techniques that were used was the idea of the [[cable-stayed bridge]]s.\n\nAustralia developed around coastal communities with rudimentary road systems to inland settlements. The early years saw early bridge technology limited very much to the 18th-century European technology of [[Arch bridge|masonry arch]]es and cast iron, the latter still in its infancy and not produced to any great extent in New South Wales.\n\nNSW at the time of early settlement had an abundance of [[Convicts in Australia|convict labour]] and had a need for rapid construction. In a country heavily timbered this led to basic timber structure bridges but as the colony gained stability, the government looked towards more permanent structures. Furthermore, as the skills for quarrying and stone dressing became available, masonry bridges began to be designed and built. As all metal materials had to be imported, iron bridges were rarely appropriate and were in any case still too novel for colonial application. Iron bridges were only used for major crossings on important corridors.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/358.html|title=Technology in Australia 1788-1988|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=23 Feb 2011}}</ref>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=rta>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4300159|title=Heritage & Conservation Register|publisher=NSW Government-Roads and Traffic Authority|accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe following list illustrates the development of New South Wales bridge construction techniques.

His design consisted of vertical and diagonal arrangements comprising a combination of timber and iron elements. The timber elements were designed to be in compression and the iron elements in tension. Allen's design followed extensive testing of Australian hardwoods by Prof. Warren and his early engineering students at Sydney University. The timber used was mostly ironbark because of its high strength. Other features of Allan's truss design included design to minimize later maintenance and/or replacement of elements. For this reason the trusses were built in pairs to facilitate work on a particular element without requiring the whole bridge to be supported, as was the case with previous timber designs. Allan's design was very cost-effective.\n\nThe [[Hampden Bridge (Wagga Wagga)|Hampden Bridge]] in New South Wales Australia was the first of a larger style bridge to be built on Percy Allan\u2019s design<ref name=allantruss>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/truss-bridge-types.html|title=Types Of Truss Bridges|publisher=Bozzle Website|accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}</ref> with the [[Tharwa Bridge]]  pre-dating it.\n\n==Dare type truss==\nHarvey Dare was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. He was a designer of bridges and he developed the Dare Truss which was similar to the Allan truss but contained improvements which made them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Dare Trusses were the fifth of the five stages of evolution of timber truss road bridges in NSW.<ref name=rta/>\n\nIn 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=rta/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Engineering|Transport|Australian roads|Railways}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Bridges in New South Wales| ]]\n[[Category:New South Wales-related lists]]\n[[Category:History of transport in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Lists of bridges|New South Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n[[Image:BridgeRoadway7 1 32.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Sydney Harbour Bridge]]\nThis list documents historical [[bridge]]s located in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Road, rail and pedestrian bridges are listed.\nGenerally bridges built before WWII (1939) have been included in this list.\n\n==Historical context==\nBridge construction in New South Wales starts with the needs of the first settlers and continues through to the present day with advanced bridge design. The infant colony had limited expertise and limited materials. As time passed, techniques and materials were developed that allowed greater spans to be crossed and therefore expansion of the colony into otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\nThe [[Office of Public Works and Services, New South Wales|NSW Public Works Department]] was under pressure from a cash strapped government to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible.<ref name=rta/> The cheapest bridge was the [[Truss bridge|timber truss]] which could be built with local timber.\n\nAll bridges are unique in the sense that the bridges were built using various technology, expertise, or materials or how they gained access to an area.\n\nFor example, at the time of early settlement, (1788 onwards) NSW was very isolated from the technological advances being developed in Europe and North America. Materials such as [[cast iron]] were unavailable to early colonial NSW bridge builders. NSW bridge builders had to rely on their own resourcefulness, bred of isolation, distance and the unique environment to make these bridges.\n\nNew South Wales's unusual environment, in general, results in unusual, and extreme river flows. This resulted in almost no water flow for most of the year with some flow each year and extreme floods around once a decade. Inland, the environment causes a low pressure system coming over the continent, due to a large high pressure of the Indian Ocean. This often occurs at summer, at which time it causes cyclone season, although it can occur at any time of year (but not inducing cyclones). At the coast, the cause is the \"east coast low\", which occurs at similar places at  the eastern edge of a number continents, and sees the continent's  normal high pressure  systems becomes  one large and stationary system, perhaps due to doldrums over the west coast's ocean.    This phenomenon causes the global trade winds deviate, - inducing the  low pressures  at polar and tropical latitudes to connect along the east coast - producing a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] situation that mimics a tropical [[monsoon]]. An east coast low rain event can occur at any time of the year.  Early settlers often  replaced washed out bridges with a similarly rudimentary structure, only to see it also washed away in a heavy rain event.  The government came to see that this was a major problem holding back economic development in New South Wales.\n\nIn solving these problems, colonial NSW embraced the innovations produced by others and adapted them successfully to the unique situations presented. There are examples of some fine 19th-century bridge engineering provided for the railway expansion, conceived mainly by British engineers working in the then isolation of the Australian inland. One examples of many of the newer European techniques that were used was the idea of the [[cable-stayed bridge]]s.\n\nAustralia developed around coastal communities with rudimentary road systems to inland settlements. The early years saw early bridge technology limited very much to the 18th-century European technology of [[Arch bridge|masonry arch]]es and cast iron, the latter still in its infancy and not produced to any great extent in New South Wales.\n\nNSW at the time of early settlement had an abundance of [[Convicts in Australia|convict labour]] and had a need for rapid construction. In a country heavily timbered this led to basic timber structure bridges but as the colony gained stability, the government looked towards more permanent structures. Furthermore, as the skills for quarrying and stone dressing became available, masonry bridges began to be designed and built. As all metal materials had to be imported, iron bridges were rarely appropriate and were in any case still too novel for colonial application. Iron bridges were only used for major crossings on important corridors.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/358.html|title=Technology in Australia 1788-1988|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=23 Feb 2011}}</ref>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=rta>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4300159|title=Heritage & Conservation Register|publisher=NSW Government-Roads and Traffic Authority|accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe following list illustrates the development of New South Wales bridge construction techniques.

His design consisted of vertical and diagonal arrangements comprising a combination of timber and iron elements. The timber elements were designed to be in compression and the iron elements in tension. Allen's design followed extensive testing of Australian hardwoods by Prof. Warren and his early engineering students at Sydney University. The timber used was mostly ironbark because of its high strength. Other features of Allan's truss design included design to minimize later maintenance and/or replacement of elements. For this reason the trusses were built in pairs to facilitate work on a particular element without requiring the whole bridge to be supported, as was the case with previous timber designs. Allan's design was very cost-effective.\n\nThe [[Hampden Bridge (Wagga Wagga)|Hampden Bridge]] in New South Wales Australia was the first of a larger style bridge to be built on Percy Allan\u2019s design<ref name=allantruss>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/truss-bridge-types.html|title=Types Of Truss Bridges|publisher=Bozzle Website|accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}</ref> with the [[Tharwa Bridge]]  pre-dating it.\n\n==Dare type truss==\nHarvey Dare was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. He was a designer of bridges and he developed the Dare Truss which was similar to the Allan truss but contained improvements which made them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Dare Trusses were the fifth of the five stages of evolution of timber truss road bridges in NSW.<ref name=rta/>\n\nIn 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=rta/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Engineering|Transport|Australian roads|Railways}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Bridges in New South Wales| ]]\n[[Category:New South Wales-related lists]]\n[[Category:History of transport in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Lists of bridges|New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Jonesey95", "label": "safe", "comment": "FixLintererrors usingAutoEd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_bridges_of_New_South_Wales"}

After 1976 he worked in the [[cinema of Germany]] and was an important component of the film [[diaspora]] working in the German industry.\n\n==Biography==\nSohrab Shaheed Salles was born in [[Tehran]] in 1944 to a middle-class family and lived in [[Tehran]]. Shahid Saless was a storyteller as a child, with a passion for visualizing his narrations. During his teenage years, he showed an imaginative talent, writing and acting in plays with friends. In 1963, Shahid Saless left Iran for Vienna, where he attended a film school and an acting school at the same time, but his studies were discontinued there in 1967 due to a sudden diagnosis of tuberculosis. In the midst of treatment, he left for Paris to continue his film studies at the prestigious Independent Conservatory of French Cinema, and shortly thereafter, in 1968, he returned to Iran. Upon his return to Tehran, Shahid Saless began work with the Iranian Ministry of Culture as a documentary filmmaker, where he produced multiple short films and documentaries, partly on the topic of traditional dance amongst different Iranian ethnic groups.\n\nIn the course of his stay in Iran (1968\u201374), he produced two major feature films, Yek ettef\u0101q-e s\u0101da (A simple event, 1973) and \u1e6cabi\u02bfat-e bij\u0101n (Still life, 1974), both of which won major international awards for their social realist depiction of life in Iran and for their innovative cinematographic and experimental style. In Yek ettef\u0101q-e s\u0101da Shahid Saless entered the film scene with a distinctive style, reporting on the daily life of a ten-year-old villager, showing his struggles to meet ends through smuggling fish. In \u1e6cabi\u02bfat-e bij\u0101n the life of a meagerly paid railroad guard worker who is forced to retire for a younger guard is portrayed. In the course of this film, the distressful life of working class is depicted in a critical light. Shahid Saless also made several short films for the Ministry of Culture and Arts. He made many commissioned films on the local folkloric dances of various ethnic groups. He also started making short documentaries depicting the unnerving condition of life among the working class. Unsurprisingly, the political subversive message of these films was disliked by the government, and Shahid Saless was forced to leave the country.\n\nSettled in Germany in 1974, Shahid Saless started producing documentaries for the German media. The movies he made gained him further international recognition, and he continued making documentary and feature films for major German television programs. At this time, Ramin Molai (1939-2009) worked as a cameraman for many of his German movies produced in Berlin. In Germany, his television productions always had a distinguishing artistic quality. He made his last movie, Rosen f\u00fcr Afrika, in 1991 for German television. In 1992, he left Germany for the United States to join his family. He died from a chronic illness related to his liver from which he suffered throughout his life.\n\nShahid Saless is known to be a pioneer of the new wave of Iranian cinema. In his own words, his cinema intends to document the \u201cantagonism between man and society\u201d (Shahid Saless et al.). In the course of his oeuvre, he viewed the role of cinema as \u201cto make conscious of indignity and inhumanity of life\u201d (ibid.).\n\n'''Bibliography:'''\n\n''\u02bfAli Dehb\u0101\u0161i, ed., Yad-n\u0101ma-ye Sohr\u0101b-e \u0160ahid-\u1e6e\u0101le\u1e6f, Tehran, 1999.\n\nSohrab Shahid Saless, Mamad Haghighat, Rahgozar, and Timothy S. Murphy, \u201cThis Isn\u2019t Pessimism: Interview with Sohrab Shahid Saless,\u201d Discourse 21/1, 1999, pp. 175-80.''\n\n==Film career==\nIn his first feature, the milestone film ''A Simple Event'' (1973), he describes the everyday life of a ten-year-old boy living in a small town with an ill mother and a father struggling to make a living smuggling [[fish]]. In contrast, ''Still Life'' (1974) explores the monotony in the life of an old railway [[switchman]] \u2013 a film that won many prizes, including one at the 1974 Berlinale. In 1975 Sohrab directed ''Far from Home'' (1975).\n\nIn 1976 on moving to Germany Sohrab released ''Diary of a Lover'' (1976), ''Coming of Age'' (1976), and ''[[Utopia (1983 film)|Utopia]]'' (1983). Utopia is a 186-minute film regarded by critics as a \"hard ghetto film\" and is the tale of a pimp and his five girls. The film was entered into the [[33rd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1983/02_programm_1983/02_Programm_1983.html |title=Berlinale: 1983 Programme |accessdate=2010-11-20 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nTowards his later career he mostly directed films for television. Between 1991 and 1992 he directed ''Rosen f\u00fcr Afrika'', a Psychodrama about how injustice is turned into oblivion about an opportunity worker and a woman from the civil house of a marriage for 30 years . Soon the relationship fails due to the aggressive, also destructive tendencies of the man who enters a deep personal crisis. When the marriage coined/shaped of force and Psychoterror goes finally into the breaks, the man looks for comfort in the [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and becomes criminal. It was released on German television in 1991.\n\n==Cinematic style==\nWith ''A Simple Event'' Sohrab Shaheed Salles emerged on the Iranian film scene as a filmmaker with a distinctive style. Adopting an almost documentary style, Shaheed Salles records uneventful moments in the lives of ordinary people. He has said, \"A Simple Event has no plot. It is only a report on the daily life of a boy\". Working with a cast of non-professional local players, Sohrab constructed his film with [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] images that almost corresponded with the temporal flow of rural life. The film is so simple and unadorned that it creates the illusion of having been made with no prepared overall design.\n\nFor all its lyrical charm, ''A Simple Event'' must be considered as a prelude or a preparation for Sohrab's acclaimed film ''Still Life'' which was awarded the [[Silver Bear]] for best direction and the critics\u2019 prize at the [[24th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1974.<ref name=\"berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1974/03_preistr_ger_1974/03_Preistraeger_1974.html |title=Berlinale 1974: Prize Winners |accessdate=2010-07-04 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> ''Still Life'' is the monotonous, uneventful life of a switchman living in a remote, desolate spot. For the old man and his wife everything ends on the day he receives his retirement papers. A young switchman arrives and the old man has to move... to nowhere.\n\nThis poetical and elegiac picture is regarded as one of the best works produced in Iranian cinema. Salles defends basic human values, and at the same time exposes the horrible cruelty upon which the [[bureaucratic]] system is based. All his life the old man repeats a simple job: lowering the fence on the [[road]] intersecting the [[railway]] whenever a train passes. And Sohrab presents the dull monotony of this life with an appropriate rhythm.\n\n==Awards and accolades==\nSohrab Shaheed Salles won 12 professional film awards and 3 nominations during his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0758137/awards|title=Awards for Sohrab Shahid Saless|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>\n\n1972 Ob? , Best Documentary, National Tehran Film Festival.\n1972 black and white, Golden Plaque, Tehran International Children's Film Festival\n1973 A simple event, Golden Ibex for Best Director at the International Film Festival in Tehran\n1974 Price of the Catholic and Protestant Film Jury as part of the Young Forum at the International Film Festival Berlin\n1974 Still Life, Silver Bear Award of the International Film Critics Prize of the Protestant jury, International Film Festival [3 ]In 1975 the stranger, Prize of the International Film Critics, International Film Festival Berlin\n1976 ripening period, Bronze Hugo, Chicago International Film Festival\n1977 Diary of a lover Special Film Award of the British Film Institute, London Film Festival1977 Documenta 6 in Kassel\n1980 order, Silver Hugo, Chicago International Film Festival Participation in the Cannes Film Festival Week of directors .\n1981 Grabbes Last Summer, three Grimme prices with Gold: Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Male Actor.

Shahid Saless was a storyteller as a child, with a passion for visualizing his narrations. During his teenage years, he showed an imaginative talent, writing and acting in plays with friends. In 1963, Shahid Saless left Iran for Vienna, where he attended a film school and an acting school at the same time, but his studies were discontinued there in 1967 due to a sudden diagnosis of tuberculosis. In the midst of treatment, he left for Paris to continue his film studies at the prestigious Independent Conservatory of French Cinema, and shortly thereafter, in 1968, he returned to Iran. Upon his return to Tehran, Shahid Saless began work with the Iranian Ministry of Culture as a documentary filmmaker, where he produced multiple short films and documentaries, partly on the topic of traditional dance amongst different Iranian ethnic groups.\n\nIn the course of his stay in Iran (1968\u201374), he produced two major feature films, Yek ettef\u0101q-e s\u0101da (A simple event, 1973) and \u1e6cabi\u02bfat-e bij\u0101n (Still life, 1974), both of which won major international awards for their social realist depiction of life in Iran and for their innovative cinematographic and experimental style. In Yek ettef\u0101q-e s\u0101da Shahid Saless entered the film scene with a distinctive style, reporting on the daily life of a ten-year-old villager, showing his struggles to meet ends through smuggling fish. In \u1e6cabi\u02bfat-e bij\u0101n the life of a meagerly paid railroad guard worker who is forced to retire for a younger guard is portrayed. In the course of this film, the distressful life of working class is depicted in a critical light. Shahid Saless also made several short films for the Ministry of Culture and Arts. He made many commissioned films on the local folkloric dances of various ethnic groups. He also started making short documentaries depicting the unnerving condition of life among the working class. Unsurprisingly, the political subversive message of these films was disliked by the government, and Shahid Saless was forced to leave the country.\n\nSettled in Germany in 1974, Shahid Saless started producing documentaries for the German media. The movies he made gained him further international recognition, and he continued making documentary and feature films for major German television programs. At this time, Ramin Molai (1939-2009) worked as a cameraman for many of his German movies produced in Berlin. In Germany, his television productions always had a distinguishing artistic quality. He made his last movie, Rosen f\u00fcr Afrika, in 1991 for German television. In 1992, he left Germany for the United States to join his family. He died from a chronic illness related to his liver from which he suffered throughout his life.\n\nShahid Saless is known to be a pioneer of the new wave of Iranian cinema. In his own words, his cinema intends to document the \u201cantagonism between man and society\u201d (Shahid Saless et al.). In the course of his oeuvre, he viewed the role of cinema as \u201cto make conscious of indignity and inhumanity of life\u201d (ibid.).\n\n'''Bibliography:'''\n\n''\u02bfAli Dehb\u0101\u0161i, ed., Yad-n\u0101ma-ye Sohr\u0101b-e \u0160ahid-\u1e6e\u0101le\u1e6f, Tehran, 1999.\n\nSohrab Shahid Saless, Mamad Haghighat, Rahgozar, and Timothy S. Murphy, \u201cThis Isn\u2019t Pessimism: Interview with Sohrab Shahid Saless,\u201d Discourse 21/1, 1999, pp. 175-80.''\n\n==Film career==\nIn his first feature, the milestone film ''A Simple Event'' (1973), he describes the everyday life of a ten-year-old boy living in a small town with an ill mother and a father struggling to make a living smuggling [[fish]]. In contrast, ''Still Life'' (1974) explores the monotony in the life of an old railway [[switchman]] \u2013 a film that won many prizes, including one at the 1974 Berlinale. In 1975 Sohrab directed ''Far from Home'' (1975).\n\nIn 1976 on moving to Germany Sohrab released ''Diary of a Lover'' (1976), ''Coming of Age'' (1976), and ''[[Utopia (1983 film)|Utopia]]'' (1983). Utopia is a 186-minute film regarded by critics as a \"hard ghetto film\" and is the tale of a pimp and his five girls. The film was entered into the [[33rd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1983/02_programm_1983/02_Programm_1983.html |title=Berlinale: 1983 Programme |accessdate=2010-11-20 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nTowards his later career he mostly directed films for television. Between 1991 and 1992 he directed ''Rosen f\u00fcr Afrika'', a Psychodrama about how injustice is turned into oblivion about an opportunity worker and a woman from the civil house of a marriage for 30 years . Soon the relationship fails due to the aggressive, also destructive tendencies of the man who enters a deep personal crisis. When the marriage coined/shaped of force and Psychoterror goes finally into the breaks, the man looks for comfort in the [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and becomes criminal. It was released on German television in 1991.\n\n==Cinematic style==\nWith ''A Simple Event'' Sohrab Shaheed Salles emerged on the Iranian film scene as a filmmaker with a distinctive style. Adopting an almost documentary style, Shaheed Salles records uneventful moments in the lives of ordinary people. He has said, \"A Simple Event has no plot. It is only a report on the daily life of a boy\". Working with a cast of non-professional local players, Sohrab constructed his film with [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] images that almost corresponded with the temporal flow of rural life. The film is so simple and unadorned that it creates the illusion of having been made with no prepared overall design.\n\nFor all its lyrical charm, ''A Simple Event'' must be considered as a prelude or a preparation for Sohrab's acclaimed film ''Still Life'' which was awarded the [[Silver Bear]] for best direction and the critics\u2019 prize at the [[24th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1974.<ref name=\"berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1974/03_preistr_ger_1974/03_Preistraeger_1974.html |title=Berlinale 1974: Prize Winners |accessdate=2010-07-04 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> ''Still Life'' is the monotonous, uneventful life of a switchman living in a remote, desolate spot. For the old man and his wife everything ends on the day he receives his retirement papers. A young switchman arrives and the old man has to move... to nowhere.\n\nThis poetical and elegiac picture is regarded as one of the best works produced in Iranian cinema. Salles defends basic human values, and at the same time exposes the horrible cruelty upon which the [[bureaucratic]] system is based. All his life the old man repeats a simple job: lowering the fence on the [[road]] intersecting the [[railway]] whenever a train passes. And Sohrab presents the dull monotony of this life with an appropriate rhythm.\n\n==Awards and accolades==\nSohrab Shaheed Salles won 12 professional film awards and 3 nominations during his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0758137/awards|title=Awards for Sohrab Shahid Saless|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>\n\n1972 Ob? , Best Documentary, National Tehran Film Festival.\n1972 black and white, Golden Plaque, Tehran International Children's Film Festival\n1973 A simple event, Golden Ibex for Best Director at the International Film Festival in Tehran\n1974 Price of the Catholic and Protestant Film Jury as part of the Young Forum at the International Film Festival Berlin\n1974 Still Life, Silver Bear Award of the International Film Critics Prize of the Protestant jury, International Film Festival [3 ]In 1975 the stranger, Prize of the International Film Critics, International Film Festival Berlin\n1976 ripening period, Bronze Hugo, Chicago International Film Festival\n1977 Diary of a lover Special Film Award of the British Film Institute, London Film Festival1977 Documenta 6 in Kassel\n1980 order, Silver Hugo, Chicago International Film Festival Participation in the Cannes Film Festival Week of directors .\n1981 Grabbes Last Summer, three Grimme prices with Gold: Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Male Actor.
