Codenamed \"SEAHORSE\" and \"SHELLEY\" in the SOE, Yeo-Thomas was known by the Gestapo as \"The White Rabbit\". His particular sphere of operations was [[Occupied France|Occupied]] and [[Vichy France]]. He was one of the most highly decorated agents in the Second World War.\n\n==Early life==\nForest Frederick Edward Yeo-Thomas was born in London to John Yeo Thomas, a coal merchant, and Daisy Ethel Thomas (born Burrows). Early in his life, his family moved to [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], France. He spoke both English and French fluently. He saw action in the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131920, fighting alongside the Poles. He was captured by the Soviet Russian forces, and avoided execution by escaping, in the process strangling a Soviet guard.\n\n==Life as an agent==\nBetween the wars, Yeo-Thomas worked for [[Edward Molyneux|Molyneux]], a successful fashion-house in Paris. After the [[fall of France]] and the chaotic [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation at Dunkirk]] in 1940, he escaped back to England, where he initially worked as an interpreter for [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle's]] [[Free French]] forces. He was quickly prised away from de Gaulle by the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), a newly formed intelligence and subversion organization. He had enlisted in the RAF but was soon made an officer.\n\nAt first Yeo-Thomas worked in an administrative capacity, but SOE soon used him as a liaison officer with the ''[[Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action]]'' (BCRA), the Free French intelligence agency. He was parachuted into occupied France for the first time on 25 February 1943.<ref name=Time>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817907,00.html?promoid=googlep |title=Alias Shelley |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine |date=2 February 1953 |accessdate=13 March 2009}} ''The White Rabbit'' book review</ref> Both within France and back in England, Yeo-Thomas forged links with Major [[Pierre Brossolette]] and [[Andre Dewavrin]] (who went under the codename \"Colonel Passy\"), and between them they created a strategy for obstructing the German occupation of France.

Churchill, reluctant at first, but fascinated by what Yeo-Thomas told him, agreed to help him obtain resources for the resistance.\n\nIn February 1944, Yeo-Thomas was parachuted into France after flying from [[RAF Tempsford]]. However, he was betrayed and captured at the [[Passy (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Passy metro station]] in Paris. In endeavouring to hide his true identity, Yeo-Thomas claimed he was a British pilot named Kenneth Dodkin. He was then taken by the [[Gestapo]] to their headquarters at [[Avenue Foch]] and subjected to brutal [[torture]], including repeated submersion in ice-cold water (each time to the point that artificial respiration was required to bring him back to consciousness), innumerable physical beatings, and electric shocks applied to the genitals.  Held in [[Fresnes prison]], he made two failed attempts to escape and was transferred first to [[Compi\u00e8gne]] prison and then to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. Within the camp, he began to organize resistance, and again made a brief escape. On his recapture, he passed himself off as a French national and was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp, [[Stalag XX-B]],<ref>[http://www.wartimememories.co.uk/pow/stalag20b.html \"STALAG 20b POW Camp\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919103733/http://www.wartimememories.co.uk/pow/stalag20b.html |date=19 September 2011 }} Wartime Memories Project.

At great risk, Yeo-Thomas assisted Lamason in getting word out of camp to the German [[Luftwaffe]] of the airmen's captivity, knowing that RAF prisoners of war were the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not of the Gestapo.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9303440/Squadron-Leader-Phil-Lamason.html</ref> He had to don many disguises, as well as shooting an enemy agent point blank with a pistol to escape.

He was a key prosecution witness at the [[Buchenwald Trial]] held at [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] between April and August 1947. At this trial, 31 members of the Buchenwald staff were convicted of war crimes. He was also a surprise defence witness in the war crimes trial of [[Otto Skorzeny]], particularly on the charge of Skorzeny's [[Operation Greif|use of American uniforms in infiltrating American lines]].

(89215), Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.\n\n:This officer was parachuted into France on 25th February, 1943. He showed much courage and initiative during his mission, particularly when he enabled a French officer who was being followed by a [[Gestapo]] agent in Paris to reach safety and resume clandestine work in another area. He also took charge of a [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer who had been shot down and, speaking no French, was in danger of capture. This officer returned to England on the 15th April, 1943, in the aircraft which picked up Wing Commander Yeo-Thomas.\n\n:Wing Commander Yeo-Thomas undertook a second mission on the 17th September 1943. Soon after his arrival in France, many patriots were arrested. Undeterred, he continued his enquires and obtained information which enabled the desperate situation to be rectified. On six occasions, he narrowly escaped arrest. He returned to England on the 15th November, 1943, bringing British intelligence archives which he had secured from a house watched by the Gestapo.\n\n:This officer was again parachuted into France in February, 1944. Despite every security precaution, he was betrayed to the Gestapo in Paris on the 21st March. While being taken by car to Gestapo Headquarters he was badly \"beaten up\". He then underwent 4 days continuous interrogation, interspersed with beatings and torture, including immersions, head downwards, in ice-cold water, with legs and arms chained. Interrogations later continued for 2 months and Wing Commander Yeo-Thomas was offered his freedom in return for information concerning the Head of a Resistance Secretariat. Owing to his wrist being cut by chains, he contracted [[blood-poisoning]] and nearly lost his left arm. He made two daring but unsuccessful attempts to escape. He was then confined in solitude in [[Fresnes Prison|Fresnes]] prison for 4 months, including 3 weeks in a darkened cell with very little food. Throughout these months of almost continuous torture, he steadfastly refused to disclose any information.\n\n:On the 17th July, Wing Commander Yeo-Thomas was sent with a party to Compi\u00e8gne prison, from which he twice attempted to escape. He and 36 others were transferred to Buchenwald. On the way, they stopped at [[Saarbr\u00fccken]], where they were beaten and kept in a tiny hut. They arrived at [[Buchenwald]] on the 16th August and 16 of them were executed and cremated on the 10th September. Wing Commander Yeo-Thomas had already commenced to organise resistance within the camp and remained undaunted by the prospect of a similar fate. He accepted an opportunity of changing his identity with that of a dead French prisoner, on condition that other officers would also be enabled to do so. In this way, he was instrumental in saving the lives of two officers.\n\n:Wing Commander Yeo-Thomas was later transferred to a work [[kommando]] for Jews. In attempting to escape, he was picked up by a German patrol and, claiming French nationality, was transferred to a camp near Marienburg for French [[prisoners of war]]. On the 16th April, 1945, he led a party of 20 in a most gallant attempt to escape in broad daylight. 10 of them were killed by gunfire from the guards. Those who reached cover split up into small groups. Wing Commander Yeo-Thomas became separated from his companions after 3 days without food. He continued alone for a week and was recaptured when only 800 yards from the American lines. A few days later, he escaped with a party of 10 French prisoners of war, whom he led through German patrols to the American lines.\n\n:Wing Commander Yeo-Thomas thus turned his final mission into a success by his determined opposition to the enemy, his strenuous efforts to maintain the morale of his fellow prisoners and his brilliant escape activities. He endured brutal treatment and torture without flinching and showed the most amazing fortitude and devotion to duty throughout his service abroad, during which he was under the constant threat of death.}}\n\n\n==In popular culture==\n* [[Ian Fleming]] wrote in his memoirs of his fascination with the military career by Forest Thomas, becoming one of the inspirations behind the fictional character [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]].<ref name=\"Daily\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/9560403/Historian-reveals-the-Second-World-War-hero-who-inspired-the-creation-of-James-Bond.html|title=Second World War hero who inspired the creation of James Bond|last=Coping|first=Jasper |publisher=[[Telegraph.co.uk|Telegraph]] |date=23 September 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Caine]] in the 1958 film ''[[Carve Her Name with Pride]]'' (minor uncredited appearance)\n* [[Kenneth More]] in the [[BBC]] 1967 television mini-series '' The White Rabbit'' (1967).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222651/ The White Rabbit (TV mini-series 1967\u2013 ) \u2013 IMDb]</ref>\n* Peter Hudson in the 2008 French television mini-series ''La R\u00e9sistance''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1087885/ La r\u00e9sistance (TV mini-series 2008\u2013 ) \u2013 IMDb]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* [[Bruce Marshall]], ''[[The White Rabbit (book)|The White Rabbit]]'' (1952)\n* Mark Seaman, ''Bravest of the Brave: True Story of Wing Commander Tommy Yeo-Thomas \u2013 SOE Secret Agent Codename, the White Rabbit'' (1997)\n* [[Brigitte Friang]], ''Parachutes and Petticoats'' (1958)\n* [[Leo Marks]], ''[[Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker's Story 1941-1945]]'' (1998)\n* Sophie Jackson, ''Churchill's White Rabbit'' (2012)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://nigelperrin.com/yeo-thomas.htm Biography of Forest Yeo-Thomas] at Nigel Perrin's site\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216193441/http://www.gc-database.co.uk/recipients/Yeo-ThomasFFE.htm |date=16 February 2005 |title=GC and background material }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yeo-Thomas, Edward}}\n[[Category:1902 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British recipients of the George Cross]]\n[[Category:Royal Air Force recipients of the George Cross]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)]]\n[[Category:British Special Operations Executive personnel]]\n[[Category:Royal Air Force officers]]\n[[Category:Burials at Brookwood Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Commandeurs of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]\n[[Category:Buchenwald concentration camp survivors]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Military Cross]]\n[[Category:British prisoners of war]]\n[[Category:British World War II prisoners of war]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{Infobox military person\n| name          = Tommy Yeo-Thomas\n| image         = Yeo Thomas.jpg\n| image_size    = 225\n| caption       = Photograph of Yeo-Thomas taken eight hours before he parachuted into occupied France in September 1943\n| birth_date    = {{Birth date|df=y|1902|6|17}}\n| death_date    = {{Death date and age|df=y|1964|2|26|1902|6|17}}\n| placeofburial_label = \n| placeofburial = \n| birth_place   = [[London]], England\n| death_place   = [[Paris]], France\n| placeofburial_coordinates = <!-- {{Coord|LAT|LONG|display=inline,title}} -->\n| nickname      = Tommy\n| birth_name    = Forest Frederick Edward Yeo-Thomas\n| allegiance    = {{UK}}\n| branch        = {{air force|United Kingdom}}\n| serviceyears  =\n| rank          = [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]]\n| servicenumber = 39215\n| unit          = [[Special Operations Executive]]\n| commands      =\n| battles       = [[Polish-Soviet War]]<br/>[[Second World War]]\n| battles_label =\n| awards        = [[George Cross]]<br/>[[Military Cross]] & [[Medal bar|Bar]]<br/>[[Legion of Honour]] (France)<br/>[[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)|Croix de guerre]] (France)<br/>[[Cross of Merit (Poland)|Cross of Merit]] (Poland)\n| relations     =\n| laterwork     =\n}}\n\n[[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] '''Forest Frederick Edward \"Tommy\"<ref>James Hutchison, '[[Thomas, Forest Frederic Edward Yeo-]](1902\u20131964)', rev.

Codenamed \"SEAHORSE\" and \"SHELLEY\" in the SOE, Yeo-Thomas was known by the Gestapo as \"The White Rabbit\". His particular sphere of operations was [[Occupied France|Occupied]] and [[Vichy France]]. He was one of the most highly decorated agents in the Second World War.\n\n==Early life==\nForest Frederick Edward Yeo-Thomas was born in London to John Yeo Thomas, a coal merchant, and Daisy Ethel Thomas (born Burrows). Early in his life, his family moved to [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], France. He spoke both English and French fluently. He saw action in the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131920, fighting alongside the Poles. He was captured by the Soviet Russian forces, and avoided execution by escaping, in the process strangling a Soviet guard.\n\n==Life as an agent==\nBetween the wars, Yeo-Thomas worked for [[Edward Molyneux|Molyneux]], a successful fashion-house in Paris. After the [[fall of France]] and the chaotic [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation at Dunkirk]] in 1940, he escaped back to England, where he initially worked as an interpreter for [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle's]] [[Free French]] forces. He was quickly prised away from de Gaulle by the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), a newly formed intelligence and subversion organization. He had enlisted in the RAF but was soon made an officer.\n\nAt first Yeo-Thomas worked in an administrative capacity, but SOE soon used him as a liaison officer with the ''[[Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action]]'' (BCRA), the Free French intelligence agency. He was parachuted into occupied France for the first time on 25 February 1943.<ref name=Time>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817907,00.html?promoid=googlep |title=Alias Shelley |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine |date=2 February 1953 |accessdate=13 March 2009}} ''The White Rabbit'' book review</ref> Both within France and back in England, Yeo-Thomas forged links with Major [[Pierre Brossolette]] and [[Andre Dewavrin]] (who went under the codename \"Colonel Passy\"), and between them they created a strategy for obstructing the German occupation of France. During his missions in France, he dined with prolific and infamous Nazis, such as [[Klaus Barbie]] who was known as the 'Butcher of [[Lyon]]', to gather vital information, returning again to France on 17 September 1943.<ref name=\"Daily\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2207357/Revealed-The-Second-World-War-spy-inspired-007-author-Ian-Fleming-create-James-Bond.html|title=The Second World War spy whose ruthlessness with enemies and charming way with women inspired author to create James Bond|last=Preece|first=Rob |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=23 September 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}} He was appalled by the lack of logistical and material support which the French resistance movements such as the [[Maquis (World War II)|''maquis'']] were receiving, to the extent that he begged five minutes with [[Winston Churchill]], the British Prime Minister. Churchill, reluctant at first, but fascinated by what Yeo-Thomas told him, agreed to help him obtain resources for the resistance.\n\nIn February 1944, Yeo-Thomas was parachuted into France after flying from [[RAF Tempsford]]. However, he was betrayed and captured at the [[Passy (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Passy metro station]] in Paris. In endeavouring to hide his true identity, Yeo-Thomas claimed he was a British pilot named Kenneth Dodkin. He was then taken by the [[Gestapo]] to their headquarters at [[Avenue Foch]] and subjected to brutal [[torture]], including repeated submersion in ice-cold water (each time to the point that artificial respiration was required to bring him back to consciousness), innumerable physical beatings, and electric shocks applied to the genitals.  Held in [[Fresnes prison]], he made two failed attempts to escape and was transferred first to [[Compi\u00e8gne]] prison and then to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. Within the camp, he began to organize resistance, and again made a brief escape. On his recapture, he passed himself off as a French national and was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp, [[Stalag XX-B]],<ref>[http://www.wartimememories.co.uk/pow/stalag20b.html \"STALAG 20b POW Camp\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919103733/http://www.wartimememories.co.uk/pow/stalag20b.html |date=19 September 2011 }} Wartime Memories Project.

At great risk, Yeo-Thomas assisted Lamason in getting word out of camp to the German [[Luftwaffe]] of the airmen's captivity, knowing that RAF prisoners of war were the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not of the Gestapo<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9303440/Squadron-Leader-Phil-Lamason.html</ref>. He had to don many disguises, as well as shooting an enemy agent point blank with a pistol to escape.

He was a key prosecution witness at the [[Buchenwald Trial]] held at [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] between April and August 1947.
