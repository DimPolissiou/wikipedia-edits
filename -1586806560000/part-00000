The character's [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|age was accelerated]] from a toddler between seasons for plotting purposes. By the time she was 12, Johnson had been in the casts of eight TV series. She later reprised her role as Chrissy in ''[[The Growing Pains Movie]]'' and ''[[Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers]]''. In the one season series ''[[Phenom (TV series)|Phenom]]'' (1993\u201394), she played the mischievous younger sister of a rising teenage tennis star. Johnson appeared in the 1994 sitcom ''[[All-American Girl (1994 TV series)|All-American Girl]]'', which also lasted for only one season. She played DJ's overbearing girlfriend Lisa in the 1995 ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' episode \"The Blaming of the Shrew\".  During the 1995\u20131996 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] lineup, she played Gracie Wallace in the sitcom ''[[Maybe This Time (TV series)|Maybe This Time]]'' as the daughter of [[Marie Osmond]] and granddaughter of [[Betty White]] and love interest of [[Dane Cook]].

She was intended to appear in future films as his newest love interest (as implied in a brief scene in the film), but that plan was shelved and instead actress [[Emily VanCamp]]'s [[Sharon Carter]] character became involved with Rogers. Although her role was minor, the [[Blu-ray]] edition of ''The Avengers'' contains some deleted scenes that expand her role in the movie and further her interactions with Rogers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2012/08/the-avengers-deleted-scene-sees-captain.html|website=Flickeringmyth.com|title=The Avengers deleted scene sees Captain America as a man out of time|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/former-growing-pains-child-star-small-important-avengers-172437386.html|website=Movies.yahoo.com|title=Former 'Growing Pains' child star has small-but-important 'Avengers' role|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs a voice actress, she played Sean on the cartoon movie ''[[The First Snow of Winter]]'' in the US version in 1998, Gretchen Grundler on the [[Walt Disney Television|Walt Disney TV]] animated series ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series during the show's second and fifth season, Jinmay Rayfield in ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]'' and [[List of characters in Ben 10#Gwen Tennyson|Gwen Tennyson]] on ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]'' and in future variations of the ''[[Ben 10]]'' franchise.

She later reprised her role as Chrissy in ''[[The Growing Pains Movie]]'' and ''[[Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers]]''.

The show concentrates on the adventures of Rudy, his sidekick Snap, and classmate, Penny Sanchez, within the ChalkZone.\n\n''ChalkZone'' originally aired as part of [[Fred Seibert]]'s ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' animated shorts showcase in 1998. The series ran on Nickelodeon from March 22, 2002, through August 23, 2008, with 40 episodes in total. It was produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]].\n\n==Premise==\nRudy Tabootie (voiced by [[E. G. Daily]]) is a 10-year-old fifth-grader who loves to draw, but Reggie Bullnerd ([[Candi Milo]]), the school bully, is always teasing him or getting him into trouble with Mr. Wilter (Robert Cait), Rudy's grumpy school teacher who strongly dislikes cartoons especially Rudy's passion for art. One day while in detention, Rudy discovers a piece of \"White Lightning\" chalk, which allows access to the ChalkZone, a place where everything and everyone that has ever been drawn in chalk and erased takes form as living or is tangible. He soon makes friends with Snap (Candi Milo), a small, blue, [[humanoid]] drawing made by Rudy when he was only eight. Snap wears a superhero uniform and is very adventurous and witty. Rudy only lets one other person know about ChalkZone, his best friend and crush Penny Sanchez (speaking voice, [[Hynden Walch]]; singing voice, [[Robbyn Kirmss\u00e8]]), who acts as the [[genius]] of the group.\n\nWhile in ChalkZone, the trio are introduced to Cyclops ([[Rodger Bumpass]]), the kilt-wearing guardian of the magic chalk mines where Rudy obtains his magic chalk (Rudy later draws a second eye for him and renames him \"Biclops\"); Queen Rapsheeba (Rosslynn Taylor), ChalkZone's song artist whom Snap has a crush on; and Blocky (Candi Milo; Robert Cait), a light green block friend of Snap's and Rudy's first-ever drawing. They are also faced with villains such as Skrawl ([[Jim Cummings]]), a drawing who blames Rudy for being ugly and wants to destroy him; and the Craniacs ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a series of robot drawings obsessed with collecting futuristic devices.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of ChalkZone episodes}}\n{{:List of ChalkZone episodes}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[E.G.

Daily]]): Rudy is the main protagonist. He is in fifth grade. He travels to ChalkZone with his best friends Penny and Snap. He has magic chalk that he can use to draw portals into ChalkZone and draw things out of thin air. He\u2019s 10 years old.\n* Snap (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]): is a small blue, humanoid drawing made by Rudy, and his best friend. Created by Rudy when he was 8 years old, Snap speaks with a [[New Jersey]] accent, and is adventurous and witty. Snap wears a superhero uniform.\n* Penelope Victoria \"Penny\" Sanchez (voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]): Penelope is Rudy's best friend and crush, a genius who helps him, and is the only other human besides Rudy who knows about ChalkZone. She is also in fifth grade just like Rudy. It has been shown that she has a crush on Rudy. She\u2019s the same age as Rudy.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Reginald  \"Reggie\" Bullnerd (voiced by Candi Milo): Reggie is the school bully. Gets stuck in a lot of things and his full name is shown in the unaired episode \"Teachers' Lounge\". He gets into trouble all the time and even has a school record with its own file drawer.\n* Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Tabootie (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]): Joe is Rudy's father, who runs a meat shop. His voice resembles that of [[Ned Flanders]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', but in a high-disorted pitch.\n* Mildred Trish \"Millie\" Tabootie (voiced by [[Miriam Flynn]]): Millie is Rudy's mother, who calls Rudy down in an opera singing-esque voice.\n* Horace T. Wilter (voiced by Robert Cait): Horace is Rudy's cartoon-hating school teacher. He comes close to learning about ChalkZone in the episode \"Secret Passages.\"\n* Dr. Sanchez (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]): Dr. Sanchez is Penny's mother, who is a doctor and scientist.\n* Biclops (voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]]): Rodger is the guardian of the Magic Chalk Mines. He was originally named \"Cyclops\" until Rudy gave him a second eye. He wears a Scottish attire, including a kilt around his legs. His two eyes are drawn on top of each other. He speaks in a slight Scottish accent.\n* Queen Rapsheeba (voiced by Rosslynn Taylor): Rapsheeba is ChalkZone's song artist. Snap has had a crush on her forever and Rapsheeba is pretty fond of him as well.\n* Blocky (voiced by Robert Cait and Candi Milo in his earlier appearances): Blocky is one of Snap's closest friends. He is a light green block and is claimed to be Rudy's first-ever drawing.\n* Skrawl (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]): Skrawl was a drawing that was messed up by a bunch of kids at a birthday party Rudy had gone to. Skrawl blames Rudy for being ugly and wants to destroy him. Besides Reggie, Skrawl is one of the villains in the show. His most recent appearances are in \"The Skrawl\" and \"Double Trouble.\"\n* Granny in the Bathtub (voiced by [[Miriam Flynn]]): A drawing Rudy made, intended for humor.\n* The Craniacs (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): The Craniacs are a series of robot drawings obsessed with collecting futuristic devices.  The current version is Craniac 4, drawn by Rudy to get rid of Craniac 3.  The Craniacs are based on [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] from the [[Superman|Superman comics]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* Bruno Bullnerd (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is Reggie's father\n\n==Production==\n''ChalkZone'' was the creation of Bill Burnett and Larry Huber, with Huber's idea of a boy with magic chalk and Burnett's idea of a world behind the chalkboard. The concept's origin dated back during the production of [[Hanna Barbera]]'s ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' where Seibert initially wanted Huber to develop a cartoon for the showcase and assigned him with Burnett, who was writing for ''[[Cow & Chicken]]'' at the time, to develop a pilot for a potential series.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyfMOLKS5Wk Keep on Chalkin' with Bill Burnett - Chatterbox 1/13/20 - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Development fell through at the last minute from the result of [[Warner Bros. Animation]] acquiring Hanna Barbera Cartoons. The concept came back when Seibert developed Frederator Studios and was pitched as a short on Nickelodeon's ''[[Oh Yeah!

The show concentrates on the adventures of Rudy, his sidekick Snap, and classmate, Penny Sanchez, within the Chalkzone.\n\n''ChalkZone'' originally aired as part of [[Fred Seibert]]'s ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' animated shorts showcase in 1998. The series ran on Nickelodeon from March 22, 2002, through August 23, 2008, with 40 episodes in total. It was produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]].\n\n==Premise==\nRudy Tabootie (voiced by [[E. G. Daily]]) is a 10-year-old fifth-grader who loves to draw, but Reggie Bullnerd ([[Candi Milo]]), the school bully, is always teasing him or getting him into trouble with Mr. Wilter (Robert Cait), Rudy's grumpy school teacher who strongly dislikes cartoons especially Rudy's passion for art. One day while in detention, Rudy discovers a piece of \"White Lightning\" chalk, which allows access to the ChalkZone, a place where everything and everyone that has ever been drawn in chalk and erased takes form as living or is tangible. He soon makes friends with Snap (Candi Milo), a small, blue, [[humanoid]] drawing made by Rudy when he was only eight. Snap wears a superhero uniform and is very adventurous and witty. Rudy only lets one other person know about ChalkZone, his best friend and crush Penny Sanchez (speaking voice, [[Hynden Walch]]; singing voice, [[Robbyn Kirmss\u00e8]]), who acts as the [[genius]] of the group.\n\nWhile in ChalkZone, the trio are introduced to Cyclops ([[Rodger Bumpass]]), the kilt-wearing guardian of the magic chalk mines where Rudy obtains his magic chalk (Rudy later draws a second eye for him and renames him \"Biclops\"); Queen Rapsheeba (Rosslynn Taylor), ChalkZone's song artist whom Snap has a crush on; and Blocky (Candi Milo; Robert Cait), a light green block friend of Snap's and Rudy's first-ever drawing. They are also faced with villains such as Skrawl ([[Jim Cummings]]), a drawing who blames Rudy for being ugly and wants to destroy him; and the Craniacs ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a series of robot drawings obsessed with collecting futuristic devices.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of ChalkZone episodes}}\n{{:List of ChalkZone episodes}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[E.G.

The concept's origin dated back during the production of [[Hanna Barbera]]'s ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' where Seibert initially wanted Huber to develop a cartoon for the showcase and assigned him with Burnett, who was writing for ''[[Cow & Chicken]]'' at the time, to develop a pilot for a potential series.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyfMOLKS5Wk Keep on Chalkin' with Bill Burnett - Chatterbox 1/13/20 - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Development fell through at the last minute from the result of [[Warner Bros. Animation]] acquiring Hanna Barbera Cartoons. The concept came back when Seibert developed Frederator Studios and was pitched as a short on Nickelodeon's ''[[Oh Yeah!

Steve Rucker was brought into the music composition team and some of his compositions were later re-written upon request by Burnett and Moon to fit the series better, much to his discourage.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe pilot for the series first aired on December 31, 1999, as part of Nickelodeon's annual New Year's Eve block,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=19 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010202151100/http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|archivedate=February 2, 2001}}</ref> but due to being delayed by Nickelodeon for undisclosed reasons, the series made its official premiere on March 22, 2002, as the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-ChalkZone/|title=Nickelodeon Chalks Up More ChalkZone|first=Ryan|last=Ball|date=May 8, 2003|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215093427/http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-chalkzone/|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817185332/http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 17, 2002|title=Nickelodeon Draws Best Kid Ratings in Four Years, Ranks as Number-One Net for First Quarter '02, SpongeBob SquarePants and ChalkZone Etch Out Top-Rated Territory, Kids Find The Fairly OddParents Fairly Fascinating|date=April 2, 2002|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>\n\nThe show aired in reruns on \"[[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]]\" for more than a year from February 1, 2003, to September 11, 2004.

Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]] (seasons 1\u20132), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony).

Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" /> while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful{{nbsp}}...

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling.

At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids.

Each warning voice over is read by a different cast member at the end of the episode, with Katherine Langford reading in her native Australian accent in her voice-overs. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |title=13 Reasons Why: Headspace issues warning over new Netflix show |date=April 18, 2017 |publisher=[[Community Newspaper Group]] |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419101534/http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |title=Netflix series 13 Reasons Why under fire from mental health experts |work=news.com.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418233845/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |archivedate=April 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |title=headspace: dangerous content in 13 Reasons Why |work=headspace.org.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419104903/https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the graphic nature of the series and New Zealand's high youth suicide rate, which was the highest among the 34{{efn|name=OECD note|The 2009\u20132012 data exclude Latvia, which became the 35th OECD member country on July 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0,3746,en_2649_201185_1889402_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=List of OECD Member countries \u2013 Ratification of the Convention on the OECD |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031730/http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0%2C3746%2Cen_2649_201185_1889402_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=November 23, 2015}}</ref>}} [[OECD]] countries during 2009 to 2012,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Social Report 2016 \u2013 Te p\u016brongo oranga tangata |url=http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/suicide.html |publisher=Ministry of Social Development \u2013 New Zealand Government |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406215234/http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/suicide.html |archivedate=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mconnell |first1=Glenn |title=The highest rate of teen suicide in the developed world |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/85305366/the-highest-rate-of-teen-suicide-in-the-developed-world |website=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref> the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|Office of Film & Literature Classification]] in the country created a new rating, \"RP18\", allowing individuals aged 18 and over to watch the series alone and those below having to watch it with supervision from a parent or guardian.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand teens can only watch Netflix show 13 Reasons Why with their parents |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39732715/new-zealand-teens-can-only-watch-netflix-show-13-reasons-why-with-their-parents |website=BBC |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427212208/http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39732715/new-zealand-teens-can-only-watch-netflix-show-13-reasons-why-with-their-parents |archivedate=April 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=13 Reasons Why: Censors make new RP18 rating for controversial Netflix show |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/91956245/13-reasons-why-censors-make-new-rp18-rating-for-controversial-netflix-show |website=stuff.co.nz |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] [[Jay Asher]] created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do{{nbsp}}...

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

for [[Netflix]] as limited series by [[Brian Yorkey]], based on the 2007 novel ''[[Thirteen Reasons Why]]'' by [[Jay Asher]]. The series revolves around seventeen-year-old high school student [[Clay Jensen]] and his deceased friend [[Hannah Baker]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/13-reasons-why/1032508|title=13 Reasons Why |website=TVGuide.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> who takes her own life after having to face a culture of gossip, bullying and sexual assault at her high school and a lack of support from her friends, her family and her school. A box of [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] recorded by Hannah in the weeks preceding her suicide detail why she chose to end her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, [[Anonymous Content]] and [[Paramount Television]], with Yorkey and [[Diana Son]] serving as [[showrunners]].\n\n[[Dylan Minnette]] stars as Clay Jensen, while [[Katherine Langford]] plays [[Hannah Baker]].

A film from [[Universal Pictures]] based on ''Thirteen Reasons Why'' began development in February 2011, with [[Selena Gomez]] set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering an adaptation as a limited series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/selena-gomez-13-reasons-why-netflix-1201620194/ |title=Netflix Adapting '13 Reasons Why' Into Selena Gomez Series (Exclusive) |last=Wagmeister |first=Elizabeth |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.

Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]] (seasons 1\u20132), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony).

Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" /> while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful{{nbsp}}... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer.\"<ref name=\"BGresponse\" />\n\nConversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note \u2013 and that note is horrifying.

He praised Langford's \"stunning performance\" but noted, \"There are times when we simply don't believe the characters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led to believe they are{{nbsp}}...

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

{"title_page": "Constitution of Argentina", "text_new": "{{Politics of Argentina}}\nThe '''Constitution of Argentina''' is the basic governing document of [[Argentina]], and the primary source of existing [[Law of Argentina|law in Argentina]]. [[Argentine Constitution of 1853|Its first version]] was written in 1853 by a Constitutional Assembly gathered in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and the doctrinal basis was taken in part from the [[United States Constitution]]. It was then reformed in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957 (which mainly repealed the 1949 reform), and the current version is the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|reformed text of 1994]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:JuanBaustistaAlberdi.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], the legal scholar who drafted the 1853 Constitution.]] \nThe first attempt to divide political power in [[Argentina]] was during the government created after the [[May Revolution]] (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo): the [[Primera Junta]] could not create new taxes without the ''Cabildo'''s authorization.\n\nMany revolutionary leaders, led by [[Mariano Moreno]], wanted to declare independence immediately and to make a constitution in order to build an independent state. In October 1811, the [[Junta Grande]], which succeeded the Primera Junta, enacted the Regulation for the Division of Power, but it was not accepted by the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|executive power]]. Nevertheless, the [[freedom of press]] and the Decree on Individual Security were accepted by November.\nIn 1813, the [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|General Constitutional Assembly]] was intended to declare a constitution but it could only declare the freedom for slaves' sons.\n\nIn [[Argentine Constitution of 1819|1819]] and [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826]] were declared two constitutions that eventually failed because of the disagreement between [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]].\nMany other ''constitutional'' pacts existed between 1820 and 1853 (when the current Argentine Constitution was enacted). The most important of them are: the [[Treaty of Pilar]] (1820), the [[Quadrilateral Treaty|Treaty of the ''Cuadril\u00e1tero'']] (1822), the [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] (1831), the Palermo Protocol (1852), and the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] (1852).\n\nThe [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] urged all the provinces to call a General Federal Congress, however this would have limited [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s power who was the most powerful province governor, so the Congress was never called.\nWhen Rosas was defeated, in 1852, the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] finally called the Constitutional Congress that, in Santa Fe, on May 1, 1853, sworn to make effective the federal Constitution. Consequently, the [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]] left the [[Argentine Confederation]] until 1859.\n\n===Reforms to the 1853 Constitution===\nThe first constitutional amendment to the original 1853 text was performed in 1860 after Buenos Aires rejoined the Argentine Confederation. It consisted of several changes to many of the original articles. One of the major changes was the renaming of the state: according to the reform, the country would be officially named ''Rep\u00fablica Argentina'' (\"Argentine Republic\") and, for legal purposes, ''Naci\u00f3n Argentina'' (\"Argentine Nation\"), replacing the older Argentine Confederation denomination in all articles of the constitution. Another important inclusion was the constitutional recognizing of Buenos Aires' exclusive rights guaranteed by the Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s.\n\nThe following reform was done in 1866 and established that exportation and importation taxes would be destined to the National Treasury indefinitely, no longer until 1866 as the 1860 reform did.\n\nIn 1898, another minor constitutional amendment was approved. It allowed a more flexible ratio for proportional apportionment in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and set the number of ministries to eight.\n\nDuring [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]]'s government the [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]] was successfully passed, a major revision of the constitution. Its goal was to modernize and adapt the text to the twentieth century's concepts of democracy, as for example, including a list of ''social rights'' including better working conditions for the working class, right to good education, etc. This also was included into the principles stated on the Preamble. Also, it permitted the indefinite reelection of the president.\n\nDuring the military regime known as the ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' that had deposed Per\u00f3n's government in 1955, in 1957 and before the elections that had to be held in 1958, a Constitutional Convention was elected to reform the constitution. This reform does not include 1949's, implicitly annulling it so the text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include a summary of Per\u00f3n's social articles known as ''article 14 bis'' (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social Security Code.\n\nIn 1972, a \"Constitutional Amendment\" done by the military government led by general [[Alejandro A. Lanusse]] reformed the 1957 text. This had to last until 1977 but its application could be extended until 1981 if no Constitutional Convention in 1976 decided either to accept it or reject it definitively. This amendment was not fully applied by the democratic government of Per\u00f3n in his third term nor by his wife [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] acting as President after his death. Some changes were related to the size of Senate and one-term reelection of president and vice-president. Also reduced presidential, senatorial and deputies' terms all to four years.\n\nThe last (and current) version of the Argentine Constitution was done by [[Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem]] in 1994. It included many of the modifications from the 1972 \"amendment\" as the growth of the Senate size (three per Province), one-term presidential reelection and reduction of its term to four years. It also made [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires City]] an [[Autonomous city|autonomous entity]] with its own authorities. Other changes were done to ensure a softer presidentialist regime, the inclusion of a new chapter into the Bill of Rights related to politics, health and environment, and also the adoption of a much faster legislative procedure for creating laws. In addition with the 1994 constitutional reform, the requirement of belonging to the Roman Catholic faith in order to be President or Vice President of the Republic, was also abolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Argentina 1853 (reinst. 1983, rev. 1994)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Argentina_1994?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\nThe Argentine Constitution has four major division types; Parts, Titles, Divisions and Chapters, though these need not be present all the time. For example, the First Part is divided into Chapters but not into Titles nor Sections. The scheme of the Constitution is the following:\n*Preamble\n*First Part (43 sections)\n**First Chapter ''Declarations, rights and guarantees'' (35 sections)\n**Second Chapter ''New rights and guarantees'' (8 sections)\n*Second Part ''Authorities of the Nation'' (86 sections)\n**First Title ''Federal Government'' (77 sections)\n***First Division ''Of the Legislative Power'' (43 sections, 42 + 1 separated)\n****First Chapter ''Of the Chamber of Deputies'''(9 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Of the Senate'' (9 sections)\n****Third Chapter ''Common dispositions to both Chambers'' (12 sections)\n****Fourth Chapter ''Powers of the Congress'' (2 sections, of which one is sub-divided 32 times)\n****Fifth Chapter ''Of the formation of Laws'' (8 sections)\n****Sixth Chapter ''Of the [[Auditor\u00eda General de la Nacion]]'' (1 section)\n****Seventh Chapter ''Of the Ombudsman'' (1 section)\n***Second Division ''Of the Executive Power'' (21 sections)\n****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (7 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Of the way and time of the election of the President and \n****Third Chapter ''Powers of the Executive Branch'' (1 section sub-divided 20 times)\n****Fourth Chapter ''Of the ministers'' (8 sections, of which one is sub-divided 13 times)\n***Third Division ''Of the Judicial Power'' (12 sections)\n****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (8 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Powers of the Judicial Branch'' (4 sections)\n***Fourth Section ''Of the Office of the Public Prosecution'' (1 section)\n**Second Title ''Provincial Governments'' (9 sections)\n*Transitorial Provisions\n\n==Preamble==\n[[Image:Constituci\u00f3n Nacional Argentina 1853 - p\u00e1gina 1.jpeg|thumb|240px|left|''\"Nos los Representantes del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina &hellip;\"'']]\nThe Preamble of the Argentine Constitution states or implies, in short terms, a number of starting points for the conception of the nation, such as a representative government. It acknowledges previous agreements to create a constitution (in order to legitimize the gathering of the Assembly). Finally, it lays the foundations for the policy of support of [[immigration in Argentina|immigration]], by asking \"for the protection of [[God]], source of all reason and justice\" for all people who desire to inhabit Argentina.\n\n==Declarations, rights and guarantees ==\nThe Constitution establishes a Bill of Rights and Guarantees for all individuals, Argentine or foreign; the inviolability of the right of life, liberty, equality, security and property. The second chapter, added in 1994, deals with public ethics, political rights, environmental protection and consumer rights.\n\nCivil rights are recognized to all inhabitants with no distinction of nationality. This is a consequence of the traditional interest of Argentina in the affluence of foreigners and foreign investment. Labor rights are also acknowledged (this is part of the legacy of [[Peronism]], resulting in the 1949 and 1957 reforms). These include limited labor day, just salary, right of organization, social security benefits, etc.\n\nThe constitution declares that no one can be deprived of property, except in case of judicial sentence based on previously enacted legislation, or through expropriation for reasons of public utility, dully qualified by law and previously indemnified. The person, its judicial defense, its domicile and correspondence are inviolable.\n\nWhat the law does not forbid is permitted. Individuals have complete freedom to do or refuse to do anything in private, except if that interferes with public order or morality, or causes damage to third parties.\n\nThe 1994 reform introduces several new legal figures: ''amparo judicial'' (an [[injunction]]), ''habeas corpus'' and ''habeas data''. Injunctions are destined to protect citizens from actual or imminent damage; ''[[habeas corpus (Argentine law)|habeas corpus]]'' (known for a long time to Argentine jurisprudence, and related to the [[habeas corpus]] of [[Common Law]]) is to protect the citizen's physical freedom; and ''[[habeas data (Argentine law)|habeas data]]'' is a person's right to access information about himself or herself, and request its confidentiality, a change or a suppression.\n\nThe Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n===Declarations===\nDeclarations state the basis that hold the nation's politics and define it as an independent entity, for example, Article 1 states that the government is representative, republican and federal and Article 35 lists the Country's official names.\n\n===Guarantees===\nThey are institutional methods to protect the exercise of fundamental rights. They are so important that it is possible to say that a right can be held as long as it has a guarantee to protect it.\nMost of Guarantees are in the sections 18 and 43, between these are: habeas corpus, the abolition of death penalty and torture.\n\n===Rights===\nThe Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n* '''Civil''' rights are related to the people as individuals. Some examples are: right to live, have honor, have a name, make associations and to express opinions.\n* '''Patrimonial''' rights protect men in relation to their goods. Some examples are: to own, to sell, to hire, and to build legal industries.\n* '''Politic''' rights allow people to take part in the government, by themselves or by electing representatives: this category includes the right to choose and be chosen for the government and to make or join a political party.\n* '''Social''' rights are related to people as part of society: these are (among many others) the rights to work, to have fair wages, to know, to learn, to teach.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], Freedom is one of the most important rights. Section 19 says that private actions of men that don't harm the public order or another man can not be judged by authorities. Moreover, it holds the \"principle of legality\": ''No inhabitant of the Nation will be forced to do what the law doesn't order nor forbidden to do what the law doesn't forbid''.\nEquality is as important as freedom. Section 16 states that in the country there are no noble titles and \"all its inhabitants are equal before the law\"\n\n==Form of government==\nAccording to the Constitution, Argentina is a representative [[federalism|federal]] [[republic]], divided in [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[municipality|municipalities]], and the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]]. Each province has the right and duty to dictate its own constitution, respecting the same principles as the national constitution.\n\n==Divisions of government powers==\n[[Image:Edificio del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]\nThe Constitution mandates a strict separation of government powers, into three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) and the Public Ministry.\n\n===Executive===\nThe Executive Branch is formed by the [[President of Argentina|President]], who is both head of state, as well as chief executive and head of government. (Art. 87). The Vice-President replaces the President in case of illness, absence from the capital, death, resignation, or removal.\n\nThe Vice-President doesn't belong to the executive branch. Curiously, it belongs to the legislative branch since he is also the President of the Senate. (Art. 57)\n\nThe President promulgates the laws sanctioned by Congress, and has veto power over them. The President directs international relations and is the Commander in Chief of the Army. In some cases, the President can issue [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]].\n\nIn the 1994 amendments to the 1853 Constitution, the post of the Chief of the Cabinet Ministers was created who would serve as chief operating officer and would run the day-to-day operations of the government and will be at the same time, be politically responsible to the both Houses of the National Congress, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and they can remove him or her via censure. The creation of the post was intended to reduce the presidentialist character of the country's presidential form of government.\n\n===Legislative===\nThe Legislative Branch is composed of the Vice-President, a bicameral Congress, the General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman. Congress is divided in two Houses: ''C\u00e1mara de Diputados'' ([[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], the Lower House) and ''C\u00e1mara de Senadores'' ([[Argentine Senate|Senate]], the Upper House).\n\nThe Vice-President belongs in the Legislative Branch since he (or she) is also the President of the Senate Chamber.\n\nThe General Auditing Office of the Nation is a technical advisory body of Congress with functional autonomy.\n\nThe Ombudsman is an independent body which works without receiving instructions from any authority. The mission of the Ombudsman is the defense and protection of human rights, civil rights and guarantees, and the control of the Administration.\n\n===Judicial===\nThe Judicial Branch is formed by the Supreme Court, and lower courts throughout the country. The Supreme Justices and all judges hold their offices as long as they are not deposed for misbehavior.\n\n===Public Ministry===\nThe Public Ministry is an independent body with functional autonomy and financial autarchy, with the function of promoting justice for the defense of legality, of the general interests of society, in coordination with the other authorities of the Republic.\n\nIt is composed of an Attorney General of the Nation and an Ombudsman General of the Nation, and such other members as the law may establish.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Argentine Constitution of 1853]]\n* [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]]\n* [[Politics of Argentina]]\n* [[Law of Argentina]]\n* [[Constitution]]\n* [[Constitutional law]]\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[Constitutionalism]]\n* [[Rule according to higher law]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikisourcepar|Constitution of Argentina}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book | title = Formaci\u00f3n \u00c9tica y ciudadana, los derechos humanos, la vida en democracia y la sociedad justa | author= Casullo, Funes, Hirschmann, Rasnosky, and Schuster | isbn = 950-46-0582-6 | publisher =  Santillana | location = Bs.

[[Argentine Constitution of 1853|Its first version]] was written in 1853 by a Constitutional Assembly gathered in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and the doctrinal basis was taken in part from the [[United States Constitution]]. It was then reformed in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957 (which mainly repealed the 1949 reform), and the current version is the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|reformed text of 1994]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:JuanBaustistaAlberdi.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], the legal scholar who drafted the 1853 Constitution.]] \nThe first attempt to divide political power in [[Argentina]] was during the government created after the [[May Revolution]] (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo): the [[Primera Junta]] could not create new taxes without the ''Cabildo'''s authorization.\n\nMany revolutionary leaders, led by [[Mariano Moreno]], wanted to declare independence immediately and to make a constitution in order to build an independent state. In October 1811, the [[Junta Grande]], which succeeded the Primera Junta, enacted the Regulation for the Division of Power, but it was not accepted by the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|executive power]]. Nevertheless, the [[freedom of press]] and the Decree on Individual Security were accepted by November.\nIn 1813, the [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|General Constitutional Assembly]] was intended to declare a constitution but it could only declare the freedom for slaves' sons.\n\nIn [[Argentine Constitution of 1819|1819]] and [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826]] were declared two constitutions that eventually failed because of the disagreement between [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]].\nMany other ''constitutional'' pacts existed between 1820 and 1853 (when the current Argentine Constitution was enacted). The most important of them are: the [[Treaty of Pilar]] (1820), the [[Quadrilateral Treaty|Treaty of the ''Cuadril\u00e1tero'']] (1822), the [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] (1831), the Palermo Protocol (1852), and the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] (1852).\n\nThe [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] urged all the provinces to call a General Federal Congress, however this would have limited [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s power who was the most powerful province governor, so the Congress was never called.\nWhen Rosas was defeated, in 1852, the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] finally called the Constitutional Congress that, in Santa Fe, on May 1, 1853, sworn to make effective the federal Constitution. Consequently, the [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]] left the [[Argentine Confederation]] until 1859.\n\n===Reforms to the 1853 Constitution===\nThe first constitutional amendment to the original 1853 text was performed in 1860 after Buenos Aires rejoined the Argentine Confederation. It consisted of several changes to many of the original articles. One of the major changes was the renaming of the state: according to the reform, the country would be officially named ''Rep\u00fablica Argentina'' (\"Argentine Republic\") and, for legal purposes, ''Naci\u00f3n Argentina'' (\"Argentine Nation\"), replacing the older Argentine Confederation denomination in all articles of the constitution. Another important inclusion was the constitutional recognizing of Buenos Aires' exclusive rights guaranteed by the Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s.\n\nThe following reform was done in 1866 and established that exportation and importation taxes would be destined to the National Treasury indefinitely, no longer until 1866 as the 1860 reform did.\n\nIn 1898, another minor constitutional amendment was approved. It allowed a more flexible ratio for proportional apportionment in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and set the number of ministries to eight.\n\nDuring [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]]'s government the [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]] was successfully passed, a major revision of the constitution. Its goal was to modernize and adapt the text to the twentieth century's concepts of democracy, as for example, including a list of ''social rights'' including better working conditions for the working class, right to good education, etc. This also was included into the principles stated on the Preamble. Also, it permitted the indefinite reelection of the president.\n\nDuring the military regime known as the ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' that had deposed Per\u00f3n's government in 1955, in 1957 and before the elections that had to be held in 1958, a Constitutional Convention was elected to reform the constitution. This reform does not include 1949's, implicitly annulling it so the text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include a summary of Per\u00f3n's social articles known as ''article 14 bis'' (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social Security Code.\n\nIn 1972, a \"Constitutional Amendment\" done by the military government led by general [[Alejandro A. Lanusse]] reformed the 1957 text. This had to last until 1977 but its application could be extended until 1981 if no Constitutional Convention in 1976 decided either to accept it or reject it definitively. This amendment was not fully applied by the democratic government of Per\u00f3n in his third term nor by his wife [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] acting as President after his death. Some changes were related to the size of Senate and one-term reelection of president and vice-president. Also reduced presidential, senatorial and deputies' terms all to four years.\n\nThe last (and current) version of the Argentine Constitution was done by [[Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem]] in 1994. It included many of the modifications from the 1972 \"amendment\" as the growth of the Senate size (three per Province), one-term presidential reelection and reduction of its term to four years. It also made [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires City]] an [[Autonomous city|autonomous entity]] with its own authorities. Other changes were done to ensure a softer presidentialist regime, the inclusion of a new chapter into the Bill of Rights related to politics, health and environment, and also the adoption of a much faster legislative procedure for creating laws. In addition with the 1994 constitutional reform, the requirement of belonging to the Roman Catholic faith in order to be President or Vice President of the Republic, was also abolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Argentina 1853 (reinst. 1983, rev. 1994)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Argentina_1994?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\nThe Argentine Constitution has four major division types; Parts, Titles, Divisions and Chapters, though these need not be present all the time. For example, the First Part is divided into Chapters but not into Titles nor Sections. The scheme of the Constitution is the following:\n*Preamble\n*First Part (43 sections)\n**First Chapter ''Declarations, rights and guarantees'' (35 sections)\n**Second Chapter ''New rights and guarantees'' (8 sections)\n*Second Part ''Authorities of the Nation'' (86 sections)\n**First Title ''Federal Government'' (77 sections)\n***First Division ''Of the Legislative Power'' (43 sections, 42 + 1 separated)\n****First Chapter ''Of the Chamber of Deputies'''(9 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Of the Senate'' (9 sections)\n****Third Chapter ''Common dispositions to both Chambers'' (12 sections)\n****Fourth Chapter ''Powers of the Congress'' (2 sections, of which one is sub-divided 32 times)\n****Fifth Chapter ''Of the formation of Laws'' (8 sections)\n****Sixth Chapter ''Of the [[Auditor\u00eda General de la Nacion]]'' (1 section)\n****Seventh Chapter ''Of the Ombudsman'' (1 section)\n***Second Division ''Of the Executive Power'' (21 sections)\n****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (7 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Of the way and time of the election of the President and \n****Third Chapter ''Powers of the Executive Branch'' (1 section sub-divided 20 times)\n****Fourth Chapter ''Of the ministers'' (8 sections, of which one is sub-divided 13 times)\n***Third Division ''Of the Judicial Power'' (12 sections)\n****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (8 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Powers of the Judicial Branch'' (4 sections)\n***Fourth Section ''Of the Office of the Public Prosecution'' (1 section)\n**Second Title ''Provincial Governments'' (9 sections)\n*Transitorial Provisions\n\n==Preamble==\n[[Image:Constituci\u00f3n Nacional Argentina 1853 - p\u00e1gina 1.jpeg|thumb|240px|left|''\"Nos los Representantes del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina &hellip;\"'']]\nThe Preamble of the Argentine Constitution states or implies, in short terms, a number of starting points for the conception of the nation, such as a representative government. It acknowledges previous agreements to create a constitution (in order to legitimize the gathering of the Assembly). Finally, it lays the foundations for the policy of support of [[immigration in Argentina|immigration]], by asking \"for the protection of [[God]], source of all reason and justice\" for all people who desire to inhabit Argentina.\n\n==Declarations, rights and guarantees ==\nThe Constitution establishes a Bill of Rights and Guarantees for all individuals, Argentine or foreign; the inviolability of the right of life, liberty, equality, security and property. The second chapter, added in 1994, deals with public ethics, political rights, environmental protection and consumer rights.\n\nCivil rights are recognized to all inhabitants with no distinction of nationality. This is a consequence of the traditional interest of Argentina in the affluence of foreigners and foreign investment. Labor rights are also acknowledged (this is part of the legacy of [[Peronism]], resulting in the 1949 and 1957 reforms). These include limited labor day, just salary, right of organization, social security benefits, etc.\n\nThe constitution declares that no one can be deprived of property, except in case of judicial sentence based on previously enacted legislation, or through expropriation for reasons of public utility, dully qualified by law and previously indemnified. The person, its judicial defense, its domicile and correspondence are inviolable.\n\nWhat the law does not forbid is permitted. Individuals have complete freedom to do or refuse to do anything in private, except if that interferes with public order or morality, or causes damage to third parties.\n\nThe 1994 reform introduces several new legal figures: ''amparo judicial'' (an [[injunction]]), ''habeas corpus'' and ''habeas data''. Injunctions are destined to protect citizens from actual or imminent damage; ''[[habeas corpus (Argentine law)|habeas corpus]]'' (known for a long time to Argentine jurisprudence, and related to the [[habeas corpus]] of [[Common Law]]) is to protect the citizen's physical freedom; and ''[[habeas data (Argentine law)|habeas data]]'' is a person's right to access information about himself or herself, and request its confidentiality, a change or a suppression.\n\nThe Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n===Declarations===\nDeclarations state the basis that hold the nation's politics and define it as an independent entity, for example, Article 1 states that the government is representative, republican and federal and Article 35 lists the Country's official names.\n\n===Guarantees===\nThey are institutional methods to protect the exercise of fundamental rights. They are so important that it is possible to say that a right can be held as long as it has a guarantee to protect it.\nMost of Guarantees are in the sections 18 and 43, between these are: habeas corpus, the abolition of death penalty and torture.\n\n===Rights===\nThe Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n* '''Civil''' rights are related to the people as individuals. Some examples are: right to live, have honor, have a name, make associations and to express opinions.\n* '''Patrimonial''' rights protect men in relation to their goods. Some examples are: to own, to sell and to hire and build legal industries.\n* '''Politic''' rights allow people to take part in the government, by themselves or by electing representatives: this category includes the right to choose and be chosen for the government and to make or join a political party.\n* '''Social''' rights are related to people as part of society: these are (among many others) the rights to work, to have fair wages, to know, to learn, to teach.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], Freedom is one of the most important rights. Section 19 says that private actions of men that don't harm the public order or another man can not be judged by authorities. Moreover, it holds the \"principle of legality\": ''No inhabitant of the Nation will be forced to do what the law doesn't order nor forbidden to do what the law doesn't forbid''.\nEquality is as important as freedom. Section 16 states that in the country there are no noble titles and \"all its inhabitants are equal before the law\"\n\n==Form of government==\nAccording to the Constitution, Argentina is a representative [[federalism|federal]] [[republic]], divided in [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[municipality|municipalities]], and the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]]. Each province has the right and duty to dictate its own constitution, respecting the same principles as the national constitution.\n\n==Divisions of government powers==\n[[Image:Edificio del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]\nThe Constitution mandates a strict separation of government powers, into three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) and the Public Ministry.\n\n===Executive===\nThe Executive Branch is formed by the [[President of Argentina|President]], who is both head of state, as well as chief executive and head of government. (Art. 87). The Vice-President replaces the President in case of illness, absence from the capital, death, resignation, or removal.\n\nThe Vice-President doesn't belong to the executive branch. Curiously, it belongs to the legislative branch since he is also the President of the Senate. (Art. 57)\n\nThe President promulgates the laws sanctioned by Congress, and has veto power over them. The President directs international relations and is the Commander in Chief of the Army. In some cases, the President can issue [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]].\n\nIn the 1994 amendments to the 1853 Constitution, the post of the Chief of the Cabinet Ministers was created who would serve as chief operating officer and would run the day-to-day operations of the government and will be at the same time, be politically responsible to the both Houses of the National Congress, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and they can remove him or her via censure. The creation of the post was intended to reduce the presidentialist character of the country's presidential form of government.\n\n===Legislative===\nThe Legislative Branch is composed of the Vice-President, a bicameral Congress, the General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman. Congress is divided in two Houses: ''C\u00e1mara de Diputados'' ([[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], the Lower House) and ''C\u00e1mara de Senadores'' ([[Argentine Senate|Senate]], the Upper House).\n\nThe Vice-President belongs in the Legislative Branch since he (or she) is also the President of the Senate Chamber.\n\nThe General Auditing Office of the Nation is a technical advisory body of Congress with functional autonomy.\n\nThe Ombudsman is an independent body which works without receiving instructions from any authority. The mission of the Ombudsman is the defense and protection of human rights, civil rights and guarantees, and the control of the Administration.\n\n===Judicial===\nThe Judicial Branch is formed by the Supreme Court, and lower courts throughout the country. The Supreme Justices and all judges hold their offices as long as they are not deposed for misbehavior.\n\n===Public Ministry===\nThe Public Ministry is an independent body with functional autonomy and financial autarchy, with the function of promoting justice for the defense of legality, of the general interests of society, in coordination with the other authorities of the Republic.\n\nIt is composed of an Attorney General of the Nation and an Ombudsman General of the Nation, and such other members as the law may establish.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Argentine Constitution of 1853]]\n* [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]]\n* [[Politics of Argentina]]\n* [[Law of Argentina]]\n* [[Constitution]]\n* [[Constitutional law]]\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[Constitutionalism]]\n* [[Rule according to higher law]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikisourcepar|Constitution of Argentina}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book | title = Formaci\u00f3n \u00c9tica y ciudadana, los derechos humanos, la vida en democracia y la sociedad justa | author= Casullo, Funes, Hirschmann, Rasnosky, and Schuster | isbn = 950-46-0582-6 | publisher =  Santillana | location = Bs.

His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended.

Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for US-American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required since they originally aired in Japan as a weekly series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why were the names from the original shows changed?|work=Robotech.com|url=http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=11|accessdate=2008-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421173202/http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=11|archivedate=2008-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Production history==\nHarmony Gold hired American writers to adapt the scripts of the three Japanese series.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|title= The Past, Present and Future of Macross|accessdate= 2010-04-20|work= [[IGN]]|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725224848/http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|archivedate= 2010-07-25}}</ref> This complicated process was supervised by producer [[Carl Macek]], a pioneer of the anime industry in the United States.<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite news|title= The 'Robotech' master|work= San Francisco Chronicle|date=2010-05-06|url= http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-06/entertainment/20888023_1_carl-macek-animation-stop-motion|accessdate=2010-10-25|first=Jeff|last=Yang}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=What is Robotech?|work=Robotech.com|url=http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=8|accessdate=2008-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421173332/http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=8|archivedate=2008-04-21}}</ref>\n\nThis combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations as mankind must fight three destructive Robotech Wars in succession over a powerful energy source called \"Protoculture\":\n* The First Robotech War (''The Macross Saga'') concerns humanity's discovery of a crashed alien ship and subsequent battle against a race of giant warriors called the Zentraedi, who have been sent to retrieve the ship for reasons unknown.  In the course of this chapter, Earth is nearly annihilated, the Zentraedi are defeated, and humans gain knowledge of the energy source called protoculture.  Humanity also learns of the Robotech Masters whose galactic empire the Zentraedi protected and patrolled.\n* The Second Robotech War (''The Masters'') focuses on the arrival in Earth orbit of the Robotech Masters, who have come seeking what turns out to be the sole means in the universe of producing protoculture.  Through a combination of mistrust and arrogance, their attempts at retrieving this meet with opposition from the humans and unleash a war that leaves the Masters defeated and Earth awash in the spores of a plant called the Flower of Life\u2014the source of protoculture and a beacon to the mysterious Invid who scour the galaxy for its presence.\n* The Third Robotech War (''The New Generation'') begins with the arrival on Earth of the Invid, who are lured by the Flower of Life and rapidly conquer the planet.  References in the previous two chapters explain to viewers that many of the heroes of the First Robotech War had left Earth to seek out the Robotech Masters on a preemptive mission, and it is this Robotech Expeditionary Force that sends missions back from across the galaxy to attempt a liberation of their homeworld.  The storyline follows one group of freedom fighters as they work their way towards the final battle with the Invid.\n\n===''Codename: Robotech''===\n''Codename: Robotech'' is a 73-minute animated [[television pilot|pilot]] that preceded the series. It is set within the events of the First Robotech War. It was a greatly extended version of ''Gloval's Report'', the fourteenth television episode that summarizes the beginning of the series. It was aired on some television stations before the broadcast of the series in 1985. It was included on [[DVD]] as an extra with the first volume of the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'' and the complete ''Protoculture Collection'', from [[ADV Films]].<ref name=\"EX\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ex.org/articles/2001/2001.07.22-rev_anime-us-robotech.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011119205153/http://www.ex.org/articles/2001/2001.07.22-rev_anime-us-robotech.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2001-11-19 | title=Robotech: The Macross Saga Legacy Collection 1 | author=Darius Washington | publisher=EX: The Online World of Anime & Manga | date=2001-07-22 }}</ref> The disc includes the option of [[audio commentary]] by producer [[Carl Macek]] and was also released in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]].\n\n==Television broadcast==\n* '''North American television debut:''' ''Robotech'' originally aired in [[1985 in television|1985]] in first-run syndication, meaning it was sold directly to local television stations without having been run on a network first\u2014this was part of a trend in animation in the 1980s. Previously, local stations would rerun theatrical cartoons like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' or shows that had previously aired on network TV on Saturday mornings. This changed after ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' introduced a new economic model: shows sold directly for first-run to stations, driving and funded by sales of related toys.<ref name=\"Macek Training\"/> Though the original ''Robotech'' series did well in ratings, the attempt to cash in on toys may have doomed ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' as the original series attracted older viewers, not necessarily the children targeted by the toy line. The failure of the Matchbox toy line is cited as a primary reason for the cancellation of the ''Sentinels'' series.\n* '''International broadcast:''' In Australia, ''Robotech'' was aired from 1986 to and throughout 1988 and in the late 1990s by both the Seven and Ten networks and various regional stations in different states. Ten cut the series at episode 52, while Seven broadcast all 85 episodes. In 2018, also in Australia, Network Ten multichannel [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]] started airing the Macross Saga. In France, ''Robotech'' was originally broadcast by [[La Cinq]] during the summer of 1987; the show moved to [[TF1]] in 1991. The Philippine network [[GMA-7]] aired the Masters and New Generation episodes in the late 1980s (as [[RPN-9]] aired Macross in the early 1980s), as part of the late-afternoon weekday animation block (together with [[Captain Harlock]]). The Hong Kong cable television channel Star Plus (now [[Star World]]) aired all 85 episodes, from May 1994 to January 1995, with changes in time-slots (May-early October 1994, 11:00&nbsp;a.m. Sundays; October 1994-January 1995, 5:30&nbsp;p.m. Weekdays). The series was broadcast in a number of European countries by the then [[NBC Europe|Super Channel]] during the 1980s. In the UK, Robotech aired on [[The Children's Channel]] in the mid to late 1980s, and it was transmitted on [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716201338/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/otherchannels/premiere.html Prem1ere], the satellite movie channel, in the same period. In Spain, all Robotech episodes were aired using the Latin American Dubbing, from August 1990 to April 1991, with changes in time slots, in [[Telecinco]] channel. The series was aired again in the same channel from October 1993 to May 1994. At that time only The Macross Saga and The Robotech Masters Saga were aired, leaving the third part of the show unaired. In Russia, the entire series was shown in the beginning of 1990's on [[2\u00d72 (TV channel)|2x2]] - the first commercial Russian channel. The Dubai-based channel [[MBC 3 (Middle East)|MBC 3]] began broadcasting an [[Arabic|Arabic-language]] dubbed version in early 2010.\n* '''Subsequent airings:''' ''Robotech'' appeared on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 1993, and on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] in 1998. Toonami aired only episodes 1 through 60, finishing the run at the end of the ''Robotech Masters'' story-line.  [[Toonami]] reran 3 selected episodes of ''Robotech'' as part of the [[Giant Robot Week]] in 2003. [[KQEH|Superstation KTEH]], a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] public television station in [[San Jose, California]], as part of its Sunday Late-Prime (9pm-after 12) Sci-Fi programming line-up aired the \"Macross\" and \"New Generation\" storylines, as well as the ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' feature. ''Robotech'' formerly aired daily on [[The Anime Network]]. As of January 7, 2007, the show also airs in Canada on [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] and [[Retro (TV channel)|Retro]]. As of 2017, all three storyline sagas of Robotech are currently available for streaming on [[Netflix]].  Internet based Pluto TV, a Viacom subsidiary, began showing all three Robotech stories Summer of 2019 on the Anime All Day channel.  They appeared in their original Japanese format as Macross, Southern Cross and Genesis Climber Mospeada.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nThe series has attained a significant cult-following over the years along with critical appraisal; in 2009, ''[[IGN]]'' ranked ''Robotech'' as the 34th greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.<ref name=\"ign100\">{{cite web |title=34, Robotech |url=http://www.ign.com/top/animated-tv-series/34.html|publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-01-24 |date=2009-01-23}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==<!-- This section is linked from [[Robotech]] -->\n* '''[[Family Home Entertainment]]''' (FHE) first attempted to release one episode per [[VHS]] tape, but only got through a handful of early episodes before abandoning this approach.  In 1987, the company then heavily edited the 36-episode ''Macross Saga'' portion into six feature-length tapes, cutting out episode introductions and slower scenes, and ignoring the ''Southern Cross'' and ''New Generation'' series entirely.  A third VHS run finally succeeded at releasing the entire series with two uncut episodes per tape, over a total of 42 volumes. ''The Macross Saga'' and ''The Masters'' were also released on [[Laserdisc]] in 1993 and 1994, respectively.  Each Laserdisc contained four uncut episodes.\n* '''[[Palladium Books]]''', past and current publishers of the ''Robotech'' [[role-playing game]], was the first company to release ''Southern Cross'', ''New Generation'', and ''[[Robotech#Sequels and Spinoffs|Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' on VHS home video.  These VHS videos were available via mail-order, as well as some direct-market game and hobby shops.\n* '''[[Streamline Pictures]]''', founded by Macek after the end of ''Robotech'', released ''[[Robotech#Sequels and Spinoffs|Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' on VHS and [[Laserdisc]] after the Palladium Books releases went out of print.  In 1994, Streamline Pictures also released an incomplete series of \"Perfect Collection\" VHS videos. Each volume included two episodes of ''Robotech'' after their corresponding episodes of ''Macross'', ''Southern Cross'', or ''Mospeada'', completely uncut but  [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.anime/browse_frm/thread/5c51a7bdff5bb20b/18c60182f4fd52ed?lnk=st&rnum=4#18c60182f4fd52ed inaccurately subtitled]. This series allowed English-speaking viewers to see many of the changes made.\n* '''GameTek Cinema''' released the first episode of ''Robotech'' on [[CD-ROM]] in 1994.  This uncut episode was encoded in [[QuickTime]] 2.0 format at a video resolution of 320x226.  The episode contained a marginally different arrangement of background music.\n* '''[[AnimEigo]]''', a specialty anime company, released the original Japanese ''[[Macross|Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' TV series on DVD in 2001 with subtitles and unedited in its pre-''Robotech'' form. The footage was extensively restored from the original film stock by Shin Kurokawa, making this the most pristine release of ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' outside Japan. The final DVD of the series also contains commentary by chief director Noburo Ishiguro.\n* '''[[ADV Films]]''', an American distributor of anime, began releasing the entire series on [[DVD]] in 2001, typically with six episodes per disc. The first box sets of the series (dubbed the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'') included extra discs with special features ranging from ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' to pre-''Robotech'' dubs of the first ''Macross'' and ''Mospeada'' episodes. Complete collection box-sets were also released, containing all the episodes of each of the three ''Robotech'' sagas, minus the extras discs.\n** The restoration of the original ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' TV series led to speculation among fans that the remastered footage could also be used to create a similarly-remastered version of ''Robotech''. However, [http://robotech.com/news/viewarticle.php?id=191 Carl Macek stated that a remaster would be impossible] at the time because they lacked the necessary source materials, including edit-decision lists, unmixed audio elements, and restored video elements for ''Southern Cross'' and ''Mospeada'', as well as for ''Macross''. Some of this (the audio elements and edit-lists) had been destroyed in a flood in the early 1990s; some of it (remastered footage for the other two series) had never been available to begin with. But in 2002, a set of off-site audio backup tapes was discovered to include the missing audio elements, and in 2003 ADV delayed its release of the subtitled ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross|Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' series by several months in order to remaster them, as well. With the remastered footage and audio elements available, ADV were able to forego needing the edit-decision lists by commissioning the same video production company that had originally edited ''Robotech'' to [http://robotech.com/news/viewarticle.php?id=192 create a new edit of the show]. ''Robotech: Remastered'' included the restoration of some scenes previously cut from the original ''Robotech'' release to conform to broadcast standards and broadcast length requirements, new opening/ending sequences, 5.1 Dolby surround sound with rerecorded sound effects, and new eyecatch sequences.\n** ''Robotech: Remastered'' is not without its share of controversy. Some fans were upset by the reversal of ADV's position on a remastered ''Robotech'', feeling betrayed because they purchased the expensive ''Legacy Collection'' during the time ADV was insisting that there would be no remaster, and that this would be the best way ''Robotech'' would ever be seen on DVD. Other fans feel that the new 5.1 mix is overly loud and lacks subtlety; they prefer the unremastered version of the series, because it represents the ''Robotech'' that they love and remember as it first aired on television without the distraction of new sound effects. Also, the extent of the new footage is limited to sequences that did not require newly recorded dialogue (though other cut scenes are included, in the original Japanese, on one of the ''Legacy Collection'' extras discs). The video quality suffers slightly by comparison to AnimEigo's ''Macross'' DVDs: ADV includes six episodes per ''Robotech'' disc to AnimEigo's four per disc of ''Macross'', meaning that more compression is necessary, and therefore more compression artifacts appear. However, there is little question that the audio and video quality are substantially improved over the prior ''Robotech'' DVD release, and ''Robotech'' fans would likely prefer having had two different DVD versions released than none at all.\n** In 2003, the original ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross|Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' series were released subtitled on DVD in their original Japanese language by ADV Films.\n** Finally, in 2005, ADV released yet another box set, ''Robotech: The Protoculture Collection'', containing all the ''Robotech: Remastered'' DVDs plus the seven extras discs from the ''Legacy Collection'' in one thin-pack box. Detractors criticize these DVD re-releases as part of an industry trend to entice buyers to \"double-dip\", or buy more than one edition of the same DVD.\n** Nevertheless, ADV Films announced at [[Anime Expo]] 2005 that they would be creating an uncut dub for ''Macross'', with the original Japanese voice actress [[Mari Iijima]] reprising her role as Minmei. This six-volume release has been completed, with the first volume being released on January 10, 2006, and the final volume being released on December 19, 2006. However, this dub did not utilize the same voice actors used in ''[[Robotech]]''.\n* '''[[Manga Entertainment]]''' started to release ''Robotech'' on DVD as two-disc sets in the UK in late 2005. These sets are essentially the same as the ''Robotech: Remastered'' release from the US, but in different packaging.\n* '''[[Madman Entertainment]]''' released an Australian Region 4 version of the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'' boxed sets starting in November 2002 with Volume One, and ending with Volume Seven in May 2003; the Australian version almost identical to the original US release, except for not repeating the \"gold box\" mistake.\n** Claiming for a long time there wasn't enough demand for subtitled-only DVD releases, Madman eventually chose to test the waters with the release of the Japanese ''Macross'' series in March 2004. It was successful enough to secure the release of ''Southern Cross'' in July and ''Genesis Climber Mospeada'' in October of the same year. All three series are released in their own Madman-designed box, and bear little resemblance to the US releases; many fans preferring the Madman ''Macross'' box design over the various US versions.\n** When initially asked about the possibility of an Australian release of ''Robotech: Remastered'', Madman claimed that it would not be cost-effective or profitable with the ''Legacy Collection'' already in the market, only to change their tune and release the ''Robotech 20th Anniversary Remastered Extended Edition'', a single box with all 14 discs, in June 2005. The recommended retail price for this box was only a little more than that of two of Madman ''Legacy Collection'' boxes.\n** Continuing to follow the ADV Films trend, Madman announced the release of an Australian version of ''Robotech: The Protoculture Collection'' in November 2007, again with an RRP only a little more than the preceding 20th Anniversary set.\n* '''[[A&E Television Networks|A&E Networks Home Entertainment]]''' picked up the video distribution rights to ''Robotech'' following ADV's closure in 2009 and re-released the series on DVD in 2011, based on ADV's remastered version of the series. Their release includes many of the special features of ADV's Legacy and Protoculture collections as well as new features, including a documentary, ''Carl Macek's Robotech Universe'', an edited version of ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' (which omits the ''Macross'' flashback scenes) and a 29-minute version of ''Robotech: The Movie'' (which does not include the ''[[Megazone 23]]'' footage, as Harmony Gold USA no longer has the rights to that series). This release was duplicated by '''Go Entertainment''' for a Region 2 release in the UK and '''[[Beyond Home Entertainment]]''' for a Region 4 release in Australia, after Manga Entertainment and Madman Entertainment respectively lost the distribution rights. An advantage that the Beyond Home version presents over A&E and Go Entertainment's versions is that it also includes ''[[Robotech: Love Live Alive|Love Live Alive]]''.\n* '''[[Funimation]]''' announced in October 2019 that they have licensed the ''Robotech'' series, ''Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles'' and ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'', with a home video release planned later on.\n\n==Original series episodes==\n{{Main article|List of Robotech episodes}}\n\n==Original series cast and crew==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n{| width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n\n===English-language cast===\n* [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]] (as \"Axel Roberts\") - Rico\n* [[Arlene Banas]] (as \"Celena Banas\") - Azonia, The Invid Regess\n* [[Robert V.

Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for US-American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week).

In the course of this chapter, Earth is nearly annihilated, the Zentraedi are defeated, and humans gain knowledge of the energy source called protoculture.  Humanity also learns of the Robotech Masters whose galactic empire the Zentraedi protected and patrolled.\n* The Second Robotech War (''The Masters'') focuses on the arrival in Earth orbit of the Robotech Masters, who have come seeking what turns out to be the sole means in the universe of producing protoculture.  Through a combination of mistrust and arrogance, their attempts at retrieving this meet with opposition from the humans and unleash a war that leaves the Masters defeated and Earth awash in the spores of a plant called the Flower of Life\u2014the source of protoculture and a beacon to the mysterious Invid who scour the galaxy for its presence.\n* The Third Robotech War (''The New Generation'') begins with the arrival on Earth of the Invid, who are lured by the Flower of Life and rapidly conquer the planet.  References in the previous two chapters explain to viewers that many of the heroes of the First Robotech War had left Earth to seek out the Robotech Masters on a preemptive mission, and it is this Robotech Expeditionary Force that sends missions back from across the galaxy to attempt a liberation of their homeworld.  The storyline follows one group of freedom fighters as they work their way towards the final battle with the Invid.\n\n===''Codename: Robotech''===\n''Codename: Robotech'' is a 73-minute animated [[television pilot|pilot]] that preceded the series.

Previously, local stations would rerun theatrical cartoons like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' or shows that had previously aired on network TV on Saturday mornings. This changed after ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' introduced a new economic model: shows sold directly for first-run to stations, driving and funded by sales of related toys.<ref name=\"Macek Training\"/> Though the original ''Robotech'' series did well in ratings, the attempt to cash in on toys may have doomed ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' as the original series attracted older viewers, not necessarily the children targeted by the toy line. The failure of the Matchbox toy line is cited as a primary reason for the cancellation of the ''Sentinels'' series.\n* '''International broadcast:''' In Australia, ''Robotech'' was aired from 1986 to and throughout 1988 and in the late 1990s by both the Seven and Ten networks and various regional stations in different states. Ten cut the series at episode 52, while Seven broadcast all 85 episodes. In 2018, also in Australia, Network Ten multichannel [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]] started airing the Macross Saga. In France, ''Robotech'' was originally broadcast by [[La Cinq]] during the summer of 1987; the show moved to [[TF1]] in 1991. The Philippine network [[GMA-7]] aired the Masters and New Generation episodes in the late 1980s (as [[RPN-9]] aired Macross in the early 1980s), as part of the late-afternoon weekday animation block (together with [[Captain Harlock]]). The Hong Kong cable television channel Star Plus (now [[Star World]]) aired all 85 episodes, from May 1994 to January 1995, with changes in time-slots (May-early October 1994, 11:00&nbsp;a.m. Sundays; October 1994-January 1995, 5:30&nbsp;p.m. Weekdays). The series was broadcast in a number of European countries by the then [[NBC Europe|Super Channel]] during the 1980s. In the UK, Robotech aired on [[The Children's Channel]] in the mid to late 1980s, and it was transmitted on [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716201338/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/otherchannels/premiere.html Prem1ere], the satellite movie channel, in the same period. In Spain, all Robotech episodes were aired using the Latin American Dubbing, from August 1990 to April 1991, with changes in time slots, in [[Telecinco]] channel. The series was aired again in the same channel from October 1993 to May 1994. At that time only The Macross Saga and The Robotech Masters Saga were aired, leaving the third part of the show unaired. In Russia, the entire series was shown in the beginning of 1990's on [[2\u00d72 (TV channel)|2x2]] - the first commercial Russian channel. The Dubai-based channel [[MBC 3 (Middle East)|MBC 3]] began broadcasting an [[Arabic|Arabic-language]] dubbed version in early 2010.\n* '''Subsequent airings:''' ''Robotech'' appeared on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 1993, and on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] in 1998. Toonami aired only episodes 1 through 60, finishing the run at the end of the ''Robotech Masters'' story-line.  [[Toonami]] reran 3 selected episodes of ''Robotech'' as part of the [[Giant Robot Week]] in 2003. [[KQEH|Superstation KTEH]], a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] public television station in [[San Jose, California]], as part of its Sunday Late-Prime (9pm-after 12) Sci-Fi programming line-up aired the \"Macross\" and \"New Generation\" storylines, as well as the ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' feature. ''Robotech'' formerly aired daily on [[The Anime Network]]. As of January 7, 2007, the show also airs in Canada on [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] and [[Retro (TV channel)|Retro]]. As of 2017, all three storyline sagas of Robotech are currently available for streaming on [[Netflix]].  Internet based Pluto TV, a Viacom subsidiary, began showing all three Robotech stories Summer of 2019 on the Anime All Day channel.  They appeared in their original Japanese format as Macross, Southern Cross and Genesis Climber Mospeada.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nThe series has attained a significant cult-following over the years along with critical appraisal; in 2009, ''[[IGN]]'' ranked ''Robotech'' as the 34th greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.<ref name=\"ign100\">{{cite web |title=34, Robotech |url=http://www.ign.com/top/animated-tv-series/34.html|publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-01-24 |date=2009-01-23}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==<!-- This section is linked from [[Robotech]] -->\n* '''[[Family Home Entertainment]]''' (FHE) first attempted to release one episode per [[VHS]] tape, but only got through a handful of early episodes before abandoning this approach.  In 1987, the company then heavily edited the 36-episode ''Macross Saga'' portion into six feature-length tapes, cutting out episode introductions and slower scenes, and ignoring the ''Southern Cross'' and ''New Generation'' series entirely.  A third VHS run finally succeeded at releasing the entire series with two uncut episodes per tape, over a total of 42 volumes. ''The Macross Saga'' and ''The Masters'' were also released on [[Laserdisc]] in 1993 and 1994, respectively.  Each Laserdisc contained four uncut episodes.\n* '''[[Palladium Books]]''', past and current publishers of the ''Robotech'' [[role-playing game]], was the first company to release ''Southern Cross'', ''New Generation'', and ''[[Robotech#Sequels and Spinoffs|Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' on VHS home video.

In 1994, Streamline Pictures also released an incomplete series of \"Perfect Collection\" VHS videos. Each volume included two episodes of ''Robotech'' after their corresponding episodes of ''Macross'', ''Southern Cross'', or ''Mospeada'', completely uncut but  [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.anime/browse_frm/thread/5c51a7bdff5bb20b/18c60182f4fd52ed?lnk=st&rnum=4#18c60182f4fd52ed inaccurately subtitled]. This series allowed English-speaking viewers to see many of the changes made.\n* '''GameTek Cinema''' released the first episode of ''Robotech'' on [[CD-ROM]] in 1994.  This uncut episode was encoded in [[QuickTime]] 2.0 format at a video resolution of 320x226.  The episode contained a marginally different arrangement of background music.\n* '''[[AnimEigo]]''', a specialty anime company, released the original Japanese ''[[Macross|Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' TV series on DVD in 2001 with subtitles and unedited in its pre-''Robotech'' form. The footage was extensively restored from the original film stock by Shin Kurokawa, making this the most pristine release of ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' outside Japan. The final DVD of the series also contains commentary by chief director Noburo Ishiguro.\n* '''[[ADV Films]]''', an American distributor of anime, began releasing the entire series on [[DVD]] in 2001, typically with six episodes per disc. The first box sets of the series (dubbed the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'') included extra discs with special features ranging from ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' to pre-''Robotech'' dubs of the first ''Macross'' and ''Mospeada'' episodes. Complete collection box-sets were also released, containing all the episodes of each of the three ''Robotech'' sagas, minus the extras discs.\n** The restoration of the original ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' TV series led to speculation among fans that the remastered footage could also be used to create a similarly-remastered version of ''Robotech''. However, [http://robotech.com/news/viewarticle.php?id=191 Carl Macek stated that a remaster would be impossible] at the time because they lacked the necessary source materials, including edit-decision lists, unmixed audio elements, and restored video elements for ''Southern Cross'' and ''Mospeada'', as well as for ''Macross''. Some of this (the audio elements and edit-lists) had been destroyed in a flood in the early 1990s; some of it (remastered footage for the other two series) had never been available to begin with. But in 2002, a set of off-site audio backup tapes was discovered to include the missing audio elements, and in 2003 ADV delayed its release of the subtitled ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross|Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' series by several months in order to remaster them, as well. With the remastered footage and audio elements available, ADV were able to forego needing the edit-decision lists by commissioning the same video production company that had originally edited ''Robotech'' to [http://robotech.com/news/viewarticle.php?id=192 create a new edit of the show]. ''Robotech: Remastered'' included the restoration of some scenes previously cut from the original ''Robotech'' release to conform to broadcast standards and broadcast length requirements, new opening/ending sequences, 5.1 Dolby surround sound with rerecorded sound effects, and new eyecatch sequences.\n** ''Robotech: Remastered'' is not without its share of controversy. Some fans were upset by the reversal of ADV's position on a remastered ''Robotech'', feeling betrayed because they purchased the expensive ''Legacy Collection'' during the time ADV was insisting that there would be no remaster, and that this would be the best way ''Robotech'' would ever be seen on DVD. Other fans feel that the new 5.1 mix is overly loud and lacks subtlety; they prefer the unremastered version of the series, because it represents the ''Robotech'' that they love and remember as it first aired on television without the distraction of new sound effects. Also, the extent of the new footage is limited to sequences that did not require newly recorded dialogue (though other cut scenes are included, in the original Japanese, on one of the ''Legacy Collection'' extras discs). The video quality suffers slightly by comparison to AnimEigo's ''Macross'' DVDs: ADV includes six episodes per ''Robotech'' disc to AnimEigo's four per disc of ''Macross'', meaning that more compression is necessary, and therefore more compression artifacts appear. However, there is little question that the audio and video quality are substantially improved over the prior ''Robotech'' DVD release, and ''Robotech'' fans would likely prefer having had two different DVD versions released than none at all.\n** In 2003, the original ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross|Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' series were released subtitled on DVD in their original Japanese language by ADV Films.\n** Finally, in 2005, ADV released yet another box set, ''Robotech: The Protoculture Collection'', containing all the ''Robotech: Remastered'' DVDs plus the seven extras discs from the ''Legacy Collection'' in one thin-pack box. Detractors criticize these DVD re-releases as part of an industry trend to entice buyers to \"double-dip\", or buy more than one edition of the same DVD.\n** Nevertheless, ADV Films announced at [[Anime Expo]] 2005 that they would be creating an uncut dub for ''Macross'', with the original Japanese voice actress [[Mari Iijima]] reprising her role as Minmei. This six-volume release has been completed, with the first volume being released on January 10, 2006, and the final volume being released on December 19, 2006. However, this dub did not utilize the same voice actors used in ''[[Robotech]]''.\n* '''[[Manga Entertainment]]''' started to release ''Robotech'' on DVD as two-disc sets in the UK in late 2005. These sets are essentially the same as the ''Robotech: Remastered'' release from the US, but in different packaging.\n* '''[[Madman Entertainment]]''' released an Australian Region 4 version of the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'' boxed sets starting in November 2002 with Volume One, and ending with Volume Seven in May 2003; the Australian version almost identical to the original US release, except for not repeating the \"gold box\" mistake.\n** Claiming for a long time there wasn't enough demand for subtitled-only DVD releases, Madman eventually chose to test the waters with the release of the Japanese ''Macross'' series in March 2004. It was successful enough to secure the release of ''Southern Cross'' in July and ''Genesis Climber Mospeada'' in October of the same year. All three series are released in their own Madman-designed box, and bear little resemblance to the US releases; many fans preferring the Madman ''Macross'' box design over the various US versions.\n** When initially asked about the possibility of an Australian release of ''Robotech: Remastered'', Madman claimed that it would not be cost-effective or profitable with the ''Legacy Collection'' already in the market, only to change their tune and release the ''Robotech 20th Anniversary Remastered Extended Edition'', a single box with all 14 discs, in June 2005. The recommended retail price for this box was only a little more than that of two of Madman ''Legacy Collection'' boxes.\n** Continuing to follow the ADV Films trend, Madman announced the release of an Australian version of ''Robotech: The Protoculture Collection'' in November 2007, again with an RRP only a little more than the preceding 20th Anniversary set.\n* '''[[A&E Television Networks|A&E Networks Home Entertainment]]''' picked up the video distribution rights to ''Robotech'' following ADV's closure in 2009 and re-released the series on DVD in 2011, based on ADV's remastered version of the series. Their release includes many of the special features of ADV's Legacy and Protoculture collections as well as new features, including a documentary, ''Carl Macek's Robotech Universe'', an edited version of ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' (which omits the ''Macross'' flashback scenes) and a 29-minute version of ''Robotech: The Movie'' (which does not include the ''[[Megazone 23]]'' footage, as Harmony Gold USA no longer has the rights to that series). This release was duplicated by '''Go Entertainment''' for a Region 2 release in the UK and '''[[Beyond Home Entertainment]]''' for a Region 4 release in Australia, after Manga Entertainment and Madman Entertainment respectively lost the distribution rights. An advantage that the Beyond Home version presents over A&E and Go Entertainment's versions is that it also includes ''[[Robotech: Love Live Alive|Love Live Alive]]''.\n* '''[[Funimation]]''' announced in October 2019 that they have licensed the ''Robotech'' series, ''Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles'' and ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'', with a home video release planned later on.\n\n==Original series episodes==\n{{Main article|List of Robotech episodes}}\n\n==Original series cast and crew==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n{| width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n\n===English-language cast===\n* [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]] (as \"Axel Roberts\") - Rico\n* [[Arlene Banas]] (as \"Celena Banas\") - Azonia, The Invid Regess\n* [[Robert V.

The project fell through due to problems with  toy licensing and changes in the Japanese yen-US Dollar [[exchange rate]], among other reasons.

In addition, [[Netter Digital]], the animation producers of the trailer, went bankrupt shortly afterward.\n* ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' was first announced at [[Anime Expo]] 2004 as the latest incarnation of the ''Robotech'' saga. Unlike previous attempts, the movie was a direct continuation of the original series' last episode. The first teaser trailer debuted one year later at Anime Expo 2005 for the 20th anniversary of ''Robotech''. The 88-minute movie premiered at various film festivals in [[2006 in film|2006]] and a limited theatrical run in January [[2007 in film|2007]], but [http://www.robotech.com/community/forum/read.php?id=1656430&forumid=31 the DVD release was delayed] until February 6, 2007, the film's reception was very mixed.\n* ''[[Robotech: Shadow Rising]]'' was a proposed sequel to the ''Shadow Chronicles'' that was originally intended to be released in 2009.
