Gradually, a compromise arose, officialisation of ''Sofia'' for the nationwide institutions, while legitimating the title ''Sredets'' for the administrative and church institutions, before the latter was abandoned through the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://sredec-sofia.org/bg/page/38/istoriya|publisher=Capital Municipality|accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[Sofia City Province]] has an area of 1344&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|title=District Sofia-city |url=http://www.guide-bulgaria.com/SW/Sofia-city|work=Guide Bulgaria |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> while the surrounding and much bigger [[Sofia Province]] is 7,059&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Sofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the [[Balkans]]. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the [[Vitosha]] mountain, in the [[Sofia Valley]] that is surrounded by the [[Balkan mountains]] to the north. The valley has an average altitude of {{convert|550|m}}. Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides. Three [[mountain pass]]es lead to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, Vitosha being the watershed between [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Aegean Sea]]s.\n\nA number of shallow rivers cross the city, including the [[Boyanska reka|Boyanska]], [[Vladaya River|Vladayska]] and [[Perlovska]]. The [[Iskar (river)|Iskar River]] in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. It takes its source in [[Rila]], Bulgaria's highest mountain,<ref name=\"Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria 537\">{{harvnb|Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria|1980|p=537}}</ref> and enters Sofia Valley near the village of [[German, Bulgaria|German]].

As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete [[tower block]]s, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of [[Brutalist architecture]].\n\nAfter the abolition of [[Communism]] in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skryscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The {{convert|126|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Capital Fort]] Business Centre will be the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" caption=\"Architectural styles in Sofia\">\nFile:Rotunda Sveti Georgi, Sofia.jpg|[[Church of St. George, Sofia|The 4th century St. George Rotunda]] (the oldest building) behind some remains of Serdica\nFile:Mladost3.jpg|Socialist-era housing in [[Mladost, Sofia|Mladost]]\nFile:StSophiaChurch-Sofia-10.jpg|Interior of the ancient [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]]\nFile:CentralMarketHall-Sofia-C.jpg|The [[Central Sofia Market Hall]]\nFile:Sofia Hotel Rodina near Russki pametnik 2012 PD 2.jpg|[[Hotel Rodina]], an example of [[Brutalist architecture]]\nFile:BusinessParkSofia view3.jpg|[[Business Park Sofia]]\nFile:Old house - Sofia - 2.jpg|[[Neo-Gothic architecture]] in Sofia\nFile:Tsar Liberator blvd building - Sofia.jpg|[[Baroque Revival architecture]]\nFile:Bulgaria Bulgaria-0546 - Church of St Nicholas the Miracle-Maker (7390227698).jpg|The [[Russian Church, Sofia|Russian Church]]\nFile:Kvadrat 500.jpg|Kvadrat 500, part of the [[National Art Gallery, Bulgaria|National Gallery]]\nFile:Millenium Center (37140586954).jpg|[[Millennium Center (Sofia)|Millennium center]] is an example of modern construction in Sofia\n</gallery>\n\n===Green areas===\n[[File:Borisova gradina autumn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borisova gradina]]]]\nThe city has an extensive [[green belt]].

Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter and during the 70s and the 80s multiple ski slopes of various difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski area has been left to decay in the last 10 years so that currently there is only one chairlift and one slope working.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Government and law==\n===Local government===\n{{bar box\n|title=Composition of the City Council\n|titlebar=#DDD\n|float   =right\n|left1=Party\n|right2=61 Seats\n|width=375px\n|bars=\n{{bar pixel|'''[[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria|GERB]]'''|lightblue|30}} \n{{bar pixel|'''[[Reformist Bloc]]'''|darkblue|11}}\n{{bar pixel|'''[[Coalition for Bulgaria|Left Bulgaria]]'''|#FF0000|7}}\n{{bar pixel|'''Patriots for Sofia ([[IMRO - Bulgarian National Movement|IMRO]]/[[Attack (political party)|Attack]])'''|black|5}}\n{{bar pixel|'''5 Political Group'''|#333399|5}}\n{{bar pixel|'''Serdika Coalition'''|pink|3}}\n|caption='''Total''' votes: 375 010<br>2015 election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.cik.bg/minr2015/tur1/mestni/2246.html|title=\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 :: \u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c 2015|work=cik.bg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://council.sofia.bg/councilors|title=Municipal Councillors|publisher=Sofia City Council|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/28/2638234_listata_na_gerb_v_sofiia_se_srina_s_63_hil_glasa/|title=\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0415\u0420\u0411 \u0432 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441 63 \u0445\u0438\u043b. \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e 2011 \u0433.|work=dnevnik.bg}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Sofia Capital Municipality|Sofia Municipality]] is identical to [[Sofia City Province]], which is distinct from [[Sofia Province]], which surrounds but does not include the capital itself.

Gradually, a compromise arose, officialisation of ''Sofia'' for the nationwide institutions, while legitimating the title ''Sredets'' for the administrative and church institutions, before the latter was abandoned through the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://sredec-sofia.org/bg/page/38/istoriya|publisher=Capital Municipality|accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[Sofia City Province]] has an area of 1344&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|title=District Sofia-city |url=http://www.guide-bulgaria.com/SW/Sofia-city|work=Guide Bulgaria |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> while the surrounding and much bigger [[Sofia Province]] is 7,059&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Sofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the [[Balkans]]. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the [[Vitosha]] mountain, in the [[Sofia Valley]] that is surrounded by the [[Balkan mountains]] to the north. The valley has an average altitude of {{convert|550|m}}. Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides. Three [[mountain pass]]es lead to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, Vitosha being the watershed between [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Aegean Sea]]s.\n\nA number of shallow rivers cross the city, including the [[Boyanska reka|Boyanska]], [[Vladaya River|Vladayska]] and [[Perlovska]]. The [[Iskar (river)|Iskar River]] in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. It takes its source in [[Rila]], Bulgaria's highest mountain,<ref name=\"Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria 537\">{{harvnb|Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria|1980|p=537}}</ref> and enters Sofia Valley near the village of [[German, Bulgaria|German]].

These vary from Christian Roman architecture and medieval Bulgar fortresses to Neoclassicism and prefabricated Socialist-era apartment blocks. A number of ancient Roman, Byzantine and medieval Bulgarian buildings are preserved in the centre of the city. These include the 4th century [[Church of St. George, Sofia|Rotunda of St. George]], the walls of the Serdica fortress and the partially preserved [[Amphitheatre of Serdica]].\n\nAfter the Liberation War, knyaz [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Alexander Battenberg]] invited architects from [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] to shape the new capital's architectural appearance.<ref name=\"Fig. Arts\">{{cite book |last=Collective |title=Encyclopedia of Figurative Arts in Bulgaria, volume 1 |publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |year=1980 |location=Sofia |pages=209\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nAmong the architects invited to work in Bulgaria were [[Friedrich Gr\u00fcnanger]], Adolf V\u00e1clav Kol\u00e1\u0159, and [[Viktor Rumpelmayer]], who designed the most important public buildings needed by the newly re-established Bulgarian government, as well as numerous houses for the country's elite.<ref name=\"Fig. Arts\"/> Later, many foreign-educated Bulgarian architects also contributed. The architecture of Sofia's centre is thus a combination of [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]], Neo-[[Rococo]], [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]], with the [[Vienna Secession]] also later playing an important part, but it is most typically Central European.\n\nAfter World War II and the establishment of a [[Communist state|Communist government]] in Bulgaria in 1944, the architectural style was substantially altered. [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Gothic]] public buildings emerged in the centre, notably the spacious government complex around [[Largo, Sofia|The Largo]], Vasil Levski Stadium, the Cyril and Methodius National Library and others. As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete [[tower block]]s, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of [[Brutalist architecture]].\n\nAfter the abolition of [[Communism]] in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skryscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The {{convert|126|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Capital Fort]] Business Centre will be the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" caption=\"Architectural styles in Sofia\">\nFile:Rotunda Sveti Georgi, Sofia.jpg|[[Church of St. George, Sofia|The 4th century St. George Rotunda]] (the oldest building) behind some remains of Serdica\nFile:Mladost3.jpg|Socialist-era housing in [[Mladost, Sofia|Mladost]]\nFile:StSophiaChurch-Sofia-10.jpg|Interior of the ancient [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]]\nFile:CentralMarketHall-Sofia-C.jpg|The [[Central Sofia Market Hall]]\nFile:Sofia Hotel Rodina near Russki pametnik 2012 PD 2.jpg|[[Hotel Rodina]], an example of [[Brutalist architecture]]\nFile:BusinessParkSofia view2.jpg|[[Business Park Sofia]]\nFile:Old house - Sofia - 2.jpg|[[Neo-Gothic architecture]] in Sofia\nFile:Tsar Liberator blvd building - Sofia.jpg|[[Baroque Revival architecture]]\nFile:Bulgaria Bulgaria-0546 - Church of St Nicholas the Miracle-Maker (7390227698).jpg|The [[Russian Church, Sofia|Russian Church]]\nFile:Kvadrat 500.jpg|Kvadrat 500, part of the National Gallery\n</gallery>\n\n===Green areas===\n[[File:Borisova gradina autumn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borisova gradina]]]]\nThe city has an extensive [[green belt]].

Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter and during the 70s and the 80s multiple ski slopes of various difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski area has been left to decay in the last 10 years so that currently there is only one chairlift and one slope working.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Government and law==\n===Local government===\n{{bar box\n|title=Composition of the City Council\n|titlebar=#DDD\n|float   =right\n|left1=Party\n|right2=61 Seats\n|width=375px\n|bars=\n{{bar pixel|'''[[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria|GERB]]'''|lightblue|30}} \n{{bar pixel|'''[[Reformist Bloc]]'''|darkblue|11}}\n{{bar pixel|'''[[Coalition for Bulgaria|Left Bulgaria]]'''|#FF0000|7}}\n{{bar pixel|'''Patriots for Sofia ([[IMRO - Bulgarian National Movement|IMRO]]/[[Attack (political party)|Attack]])'''|black|5}}\n{{bar pixel|'''5 Political Group'''|#333399|5}}\n{{bar pixel|'''Serdika Coalition'''|pink|3}}\n|caption='''Total''' votes: 375 010<br>2015 election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.cik.bg/minr2015/tur1/mestni/2246.html|title=\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 :: \u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c 2015|work=cik.bg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://council.sofia.bg/councilors|title=Municipal Councillors|publisher=Sofia City Council|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/28/2638234_listata_na_gerb_v_sofiia_se_srina_s_63_hil_glasa/|title=\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0415\u0420\u0411 \u0432 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441 63 \u0445\u0438\u043b. \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e 2011 \u0433.|work=dnevnik.bg}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Sofia Capital Municipality|Sofia Municipality]] is identical to [[Sofia City Province]], which is distinct from [[Sofia Province]], which surrounds but does not include the capital itself.

In 1984, [[UNESCO]] declared the park a [[World Heritage Site]] under \"[[Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]\".<ref name=gaudiunesco>{{Citation | title =Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed |publisher = Unesco| url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 | accessdate = 15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}\nPark G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his [[naturalist]] phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G\u00fcell, Gaud\u00ed unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the [[Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family]] (Catalan: [[Sagrada Familia]]).\n\nG\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political [[Catalanism]] \u2013  especially in the entrance stairway where the [[Catalan countries]] are represented \u2013 and from [[Catholicism]] \u2013 the [[Monumento al Calvario]], originally designed to be a [[chapel]]. The [[mythological]] elements are so important: apparently G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed's conception of the park was also inspired by the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] of [[Delphi]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn the other hand, many experts{{Who|date=April 2016}} have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex [[iconography]] that Gaud\u00ed applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to [[religious]] exaltation, passing through [[mythology]], [[history]] and [[philosophy]]. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to [[Freemasonry]], despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud\u00ed and [[Count G\u00fcell]]. These references have not been proven in the [[historiography]] of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park G\u00fcell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and [[puzzles]].\n\n==Origins as a housing development==\n[[File:Barcelona 193.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Gaudi House Museum]]]]\nThe park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]], after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English [[garden city movement]]; hence the original English name ''Park'' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] the name is \"Parc G\u00fcell\"). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called ''Muntanya Pelada'' (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House and was next to a neighbourhood of upper-class houses called ''La Salut'' (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi G\u00fcell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaud\u00ed. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaud\u00ed, at G\u00fcell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906.<ref name=zim>{{Citation | last = Zimmermann | first = Robert | year =2002 | title =The Best of Gaud\u00ed | place = | publisher = | url =http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205603/http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf|archive-date=22 July 2007}}</ref> This house, where Gaud\u00ed lived from 1906 to 1926, was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaud\u00ed and several of his collaborators. It is now the [[Gaudi House Museum]] (Casa Museu Gaud\u00ed) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.\n\n== Municipal garden ==\n[[File:Parc G\u00fcell Dragon Restored.jpg|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's multicolored [[mosaic]] salamander, popularly known as \"el drac\" (the dragon), at the main entrance, as restored after the vandalism of February 2007]]\n[[File:Park Guell Terrace.JPG|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's mosaic work on the main terrace]]\n\nIt has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaud\u00ed's house, \"la Torre Rosa,\" \u2013 containing furniture that he designed \u2013 can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud\u00ed's house and the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] Church.\n\nPark G\u00fcell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud\u00ed. These two buildings make up the Porter's Lodge pavilion.<ref>https://parkguell.barcelona/en/park-guell/emblematic-features/entrance-pavilions</ref> One of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth.  The other, while once being the porter's house, is now a permanent exhibition of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=MUHBA Park G\u00fcell|url=http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museuhistoria/en/muhba-park-guell}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXEGigoEa5k|title=LMVC UPC CPSV. MUHBA.

The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud\u00ed incorporated many motifs of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaud\u00ed but of his often overlooked collaborator [[Josep Maria Jujol]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/09/gaudis-partner-in-iconic-barcelona-design-finally-gets-the-limelight |title=Gaud\u00ed's partner in iconic Barcelona design finally gets the limelight |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Stephen |last=Burgen |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\nRoadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud\u00ed as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud\u00ed designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his [[Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]] so that the [[Inverted catenary|inverted catenary arch]] shapes form perfect compression structures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dataphys.org/list/gaudis-hanging-chain-models/ |title=1889 \u2013 Gaud\u00ed's Hanging Chain Models |website=List of Physical Visualizations |access-date=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the park's high-point, there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform which holds three large crosses. The official name of this is \"El Tur\u00f3 de les Tres Creus,\" however many tourists choose to call it Calvary. Two of the crosses point north\u2013south and east\u2013west, the third, and tallest cross, points skyward. This lookout offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay.

{"title_page": "Lead smelting", "text_new": "[[File:Doe Run smelter Herculaneum 22.jpg|thumb|right|The now closed [[Doe Run Company|Doe Run]] primary lead smelting facility in [[Herculaneum, Missouri]]]]\nPlants for the production of [[lead]] are generally referred to as '''lead smelters'''. Primary lead production begins with [[sintering]]. Concentrated lead ore is fed into a sintering machine with iron, silica, [[Flux (metallurgy)|limestone flux]]es, [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], [[soda ash]], [[pyrite]], [[zinc]], caustics or [[pollution control]] particulates. [[Smelting]] uses suitable [[reduction (chemistry)|reducing substances]] that will combine with those [[oxidation (chemistry)|oxidizing]] elements to free the metal. Reduction is the final, high-temperature step in smelting. It is here that the oxide becomes the elemental metal. A reducing environment (often provided by carbon monoxide in an air-starved furnace) pulls the final oxygen atoms from the raw metal.\n\nLead is usually smelted in a [[blast furnace]], using the lead sinter produced in the sintering process and coke to provide the heat source. As melting occurs, several layers form in the furnace. A combination of molten lead and slag sinks to the bottom of the furnace, with a layer of the lightest elements referred to as [[speiss]], including [[arsenic]] and [[antimony]] floating to the top of the molten material. The crude bullion and lead slag layers flow out of the 'furnace front' and into the 'forehearth', where the two streams are separated. The lead slag stream, containing most of the 'fluxing' elements added to the sintering machine (predominantly silica, limestone, iron and zinc) can either be discarded or further processed to recover the contained zinc.\n\nThe crude lead bullion, containing significant quantities of copper will then undergo 'copper drossing'. In this step elemental sulphur, usually in solid form is added to the molten crude lead bullion to react with the contained copper. A \"matte\" layer forms in this step, containing most of the copper originating from the crude lead bullion and some other impurities as metal sulfides. The speiss and the matte are usually sold to [[copper smelting|copper smelter]]s where they are refined for copper processing.\n\nThe lead from the blast furnace, called lead bullion, then undergoes the drossing process. The bullion is agitated in kettles then cooled to 700-800 degrees. This process results in molten lead and [[dross]]. Dross refers to the [[lead oxide]]s, copper, antimony and other elements that float to the top of the lead. Dross is usually skimmed off and sent to a dross furnace to recover the non-lead components which are sold to other metal manufacturers. The [[Parkes process]] is used to separate [[silver]] or [[gold]] from lead.\n\nFinally, the molten lead is refined. Pyrometallurgical methods are usually used to remove the remaining non-lead components of the mixture, for example the [[Betterton-Kroll process]] and the [[Betts electrolytic process]]. The non-lead metals are usually sold to other metal processing plants. The refined lead may be made into alloys or directly cast.<ref>USEPA, Profile of The Nonferrous Metals Industry. EPA 310-R-95-010 as shown in [http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/library_docs/manuals/primmetals/chapter6.htm]</ref>\n\nPeople who operate or work in such plants are also referred to as '''smelters'''.\n\n==Lead ores==\n[[file:Evolution minerai plomb.svg|lang=en|thumb|Evolution of the extracted lead ores grade in different countries (Canada, Australia).]]\n\n[[Galena]], the most common mineral of [[lead]], is primarily lead sulfide (PbS). The sulfide is oxidized to a sulfite (PbSO<sub>3</sub>) which thermally decomposes into lead oxide and sulfur dioxide gas. (PbO and SO<sub>2</sub>) The [[sulfur dioxide]] (like the [[carbon dioxide]] in the example above) is expelled, and the lead oxide is reduced.\n[[Anglesite]], [[Cerussite]], [[Pyromorphite]], [[Mimetite]] and [[Wulfenite]] are other lead ores.\n\nOther elements frequently present with lead ores include [[zinc]] and [[silver]].<ref>Nicole Fobi, MD, LEAD SMELTING International Review, [[Morehouse School of Medicine]], Atlanta, GA May 15th, 2007</ref>\n\n==Secondary lead processing==\nMost of the lead produced comes from secondary sources. Lead scrap includes lead-acid batteries, cable coverings, pipes, sheets and lead coated, or terne bearing, metals. Solder, product waste and dross may also be recovered for its small lead content. Most secondary lead is used in batteries.\n\nTo recover lead from a battery, the battery is broken and the components are classified. The lead containing components are processed in blast furnaces for hard lead or rotary reverberatory furnaces for fine particles. The blast furnace is similar in structure to a [[cupola furnace]] used in [[iron foundry|iron foundries]]. The furnace is charged with slag, scrap iron, limestone, coke, oxides, dross, and reverberatory slag. The coke is used to melt and reduce the lead. Limestone reacts with impurities and floats to the top. This process also keeps the lead from oxidizing. The molten lead flows from the blast furnace into holding pots. Lead may be mixed with alloys, including antimony, tin, arsenic, copper and nickel. It is then cast into [[ingot]]s.<ref>USEPA, Profile of The Nonferrous Metals Industry.

Ancient smelting was done using loads of lead ore and charcoal in outdoor hearths and furnaces.\n\nAlthough lead is a common metal, its discovery had relatively little impact in the ancient world. It is too soft to be used for weapons (except possibly as [[sling (weapon)|sling]] projectiles) or for structural elements.  However, being easy to cast and shape, it came to be extensively used in the classical world of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] for piping and storage of water. It was also used as a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in stone buildings, and as a [[writing material]].\n[[Smeltmill]]s were water-powered [[water mill|mills]] used to [[smelting|smelt]] lead or other metals.  The Roman lead smelting has led to evidence of global pollution.  Greenland ice cores from 500 BCE to 300 CE show measurably elevated lead content in the atmosphere.<ref>MALCOLM W.

Primary lead production begins with [[sintering]]. Concentrated lead ore is fed into a sintering machine with iron, silica, [[Flux (metallurgy)|limestone flux]]es, [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], [[soda ash]], [[pyrite]], [[zinc]], caustics or [[pollution control]] particulates. [[Smelting]] uses suitable [[reduction (chemistry)|reducing substances]] that will combine with those [[oxidation (chemistry)|oxidizing]] elements to free the metal. Reduction is the final, high-temperature step in smelting. It is here that the oxide becomes the elemental metal. A reducing environment (often provided by carbon monoxide in an air-starved furnace) pulls the final oxygen atoms from the raw metal.\n\nLead is usually smelted in a [[blast furnace]], using the lead sinter produced in the sintering process and coke to provide the heat source. As melting occurs, several layers form in the furnace. A combination of molten lead and slag sinks to the bottom of the furnace, with a layer of the lightest elements referred to as [[speiss]], including [[arsenic]] and [[antimony]] floating to the top of the molten material. The crude bullion and lead slag layers flow out of the 'furnace front' and into the 'forehearth', where the two streams are separated. The lead slag stream, containing most of the 'fluxing' elements added to the sintering machine (predominantly silica, limestone, iron and zinc) can either be discarded or further processed to recover the contained zinc.\n\nThe crude lead bullion, containing significant quantities of copper will then undergo 'copper drossing'. In this step elemental sulphur, usually in solid form is added to the molten crude lead bullion to react with the contained copper. A \"matte\" layer forms in this step, containing most of the copper originating from the crude lead bullion and some other impurities as metal sulfides. The speiss and the matte are usually sold to [[copper smelting|copper smelter]]s where they are refined for copper processing.\n\nThe lead from the blast furnace, called lead bullion, then undergoes the drossing process. The bullion is agitated in kettles then cooled to 700-800 degrees. This process results in molten lead and [[dross]]. Dross refers to the [[lead oxide]]s, copper, antimony and other elements that float to the top of the lead. Dross is usually skimmed off and sent to a dross furnace to recover the non-lead components which are sold to other metal manufacturers. The [[Parkes process]] is used to separate [[silver]] or [[gold]] from lead.\n\nFinally, the molten lead is refined. Pyrometallurgical methods are usually used to remove the remaining non-lead components of the mixture, for example the [[Betterton-Kroll process]] and the [[Betts electrolytic process]]. The non-lead metals are usually sold to other metal processing plants. The refined lead may be made into alloys or directly cast.<ref>USEPA, Profile of The Nonferrous Metals Industry. EPA 310-R-95-010 as shown in [http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/library_docs/manuals/primmetals/chapter6.htm]</ref>\n\nPeople who operate or work in such plants are also referred to as '''smelters'''.\n\n==Lead ores==\n[[file:Evolution minerai plomb.svg|lang=en|thumb|Evolution of the extracted lead ores grade in different countries (Canada, Australia).]]\n\n[[Galena]], the most common mineral of [[lead]], is primarily lead sulfide (PbS). The sulfide is oxidized to a sulfite (PbSO<sub>3</sub>) which thermally decomposes into lead oxide and sulfur dioxide gas. (PbO and SO<sub>2</sub>) The [[sulfur dioxide]] (like the [[carbon dioxide]] in the example above) is expelled, and the lead oxide is reduced.\n[[Anglesite]], [[Cerussite]], [[Pyromorphite]], [[Mimetite]] and [[Wulfenite]] are other lead ores.\n\nOther elements frequently present with lead ores include [[zinc]] and [[silver]].<ref>Nicole Fobi, MD, LEAD SMELTING International Review, [[Morehouse School of Medicine]], Atlanta, GA May 15th, 2007</ref>\n\n==Secondary lead processing==\nMost of the lead produced comes from secondary sources. Lead scrap includes lead-acid batteries, cable coverings, pipes, sheets and lead coated, or terne bearing, metals. Solder, product waste and dross may also be recovered for its small lead content. Most secondary lead is used in batteries.\n\nTo recover lead from a battery, the battery is broken and the components are classified. The lead containing components are processed in blast furnaces for hard lead or rotary reverberatory furnaces for fine particles. The blast furnace is similar in structure to a [[cupola furnace]] used in [[iron foundry|iron foundries]]. The furnace is charged with slag, scrap iron, limestone, coke, oxides, dross, and reverberatory slag. The coke is used to melt and reduce the lead. Limestone reacts with impurities and floats to the top. This process also keeps the lead from oxidizing. The molten lead flows from the blast furnace into holding pots. Lead may be mixed with alloys, including antimony, tin, arsenic, copper and nickel. It is then cast into [[ingot]]s.<ref>USEPA, Profile of The Nonferrous Metals Industry.

Although [[lead poisoning]] is one of the oldest known work and environmental hazards,<!--<ref name=\"Flora08\"/> --> the modern understanding of the small amount of lead necessary to cause harm did not come about until the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. No safe threshold for lead exposure has been discovered\u2014that is, there is no known amount of lead that is too small to cause the body harm.<!--<ref name=\"Merrill07861\"/><ref name=\"Brodkin07-CMAJ\"/>-->\n\nThe US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[World Health Organization]] state that a blood lead level of 10&nbsp;\u03bcg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level.<ref name=\"Barbosa\">{{cite journal|last1=Barbosa Jr|first1=F|last2=Tanus-Santos|first2=JE|last3=Gerlach|first3=RF|last4=Parsons|first4=PJ|title=A Critical Review of Biomarkers Used for Monitoring Human Exposure to Lead: Advantages, Limitations, and Future Needs|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=113|issue=12|pages=1669\u201374|year=2005|pmid=16330345|pmc=1314903|doi=10.1289/ehp.7917}}</ref> Authorities such as the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10&nbsp;\u03bcg/dL.\n\nLead smelters with little pollution controls contribute to several environmental problems, especially raised blood lead levels in the surrounding population.

Ancient smelting was done using loads of lead ore and charcoal in outdoor hearths and furnaces.\n\nAlthough lead is a common metal, its discovery had relatively little impact in the ancient world. It is too soft to be used for weapons (except possibly as [[sling (weapon)|sling]] projectiles) or for structural elements.  However, being easy to cast and shape, it came to be extensively used in the classical world of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] for piping and storage of water. It was also used as a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in stone buildings, and as a [[writing material]].\n[[Smeltmill]]s were water-powered [[water mill|mills]] used to [[smelting|smelt]] lead or other metals.  The Roman lead smelting has led to evidence of global pollution.  Greenland ice cores from 500 BCE to 300 CE show measurably elevated lead content in the atmosphere.<ref>MALCOLM W.
