First, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created. In 1977 the football section was separated from the club and incorporated into [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Coal Mine|KWB Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''. In 1994, the club advanced to Polish league II, and in 1997 to league I \"B\" series. In 1999, it was promoted to series \"A\", but after a year it fell back down to series \"B\" again.\n\nIn 2001, the club led by [[Wies\u0142aw Czaja]] was promoted to [[PlusLiga]]. In their first season there - 2001/2002 - the team achieved the bronze medal in the Polish Men's Volleyball Championship, defeating [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]] after three matches. In 2002/2003 ''Skra'' took 6th place in the league and lost in the second round of the [[CEV Cup]] in a match against Russian club Lokomotiv Yekaterinburg.

They won first title of Polish Champion after three matches with [[Indykpol AZS Olsztyn|AZS Olsztyn]] and achieved their first Polish Cup also after a final match with the club from [[Olsztyn]] (3-1). The team repeated this success in the next season, when they won second title of Polish Champion in four final matches with [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]], and Polish Cup for the second year in a row (winning final match with [[AZS Cz\u0119stochowa]] (3-0)). They lost two matches against Greek [[Iraklis Thessaloniki V.C.]] in play-off 6 of [[2005\u201306 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2005/2006]].\n\nIn 2006, the new coach was [[Daniel Castellani]], who was the first coach of the club from outside Poland. He spent three seasons in [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. During his work ''PGE Skra'' won next three title of Polish Champion (2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009) and two Polish Cups (2007, 2009).

Next day, ''PGE Skra'' players won bronze medal in match with Italian [[Sisley Treviso]] (3-2).\n\nIn 2009 a new coach was hired. It was [[Jacek Nawrocki]]. The first success under the guidance of the new coach was the silver medal in the [[2009 FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|FIVB Club World Championship 2009]]. At this tournament after promoting from Pool B, ''PGE Skra'' won their semi final against [[VC Zenit-Kazan]] (3-1), but on November 8, 2009 the Polish club lost the final against [[Trentino Volley]] (0-3). 2 of 7 individual awards were received by ''PGE Skra'' players - [[Bartosz Kurek]] as the ''Best Scorer'', [[Marcin Mo\u017cd\u017conek]] as the ''Best Blocker''.\nIn 2010 the Polish team was the host of the Final Four [[2009\u201310 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2009/2010]] again.
