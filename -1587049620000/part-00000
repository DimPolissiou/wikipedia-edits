After completing his internship, Linnehan was commissioned as a [[Captain (land)|Captain]] in the [[Veterinary Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Veterinary Corps]] and reported for duty in early 1989 at the [[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific|Naval Ocean Systems Center]], [[San Diego, California]], as chief clinical veterinarian for the [[U.S. Navy]]\u2019s [[Marine Mammal Program]]. During his assignment at the Naval Ocean Systems Center, Linnehan initiated and supervised research in the areas of [[cetacean]] and [[pinniped]] [[anesthesia]], [[orthopedics]], drug [[pharmacokinetics]] and reproduction in direct support of U.S. Navy mobile marine mammal systems stationed in [[California]], [[Florida]], and [[Hawaii]].\n\n==NASA career==\nSelected by NASA in March 1992, Linnehan reported to the [[Johnson Space Center]] in August 1992 where he completed one year of Astronaut Candidate training, qualifying him for [[Space Shuttle]] flight assignments as a mission specialist. Linnehan was initially assigned to flight software verification in the [[Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory]] (SAIL). He was subsequently assigned to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, working on payload development, and mission development flight support for future Space Shuttle missions. He first flew as a mission specialist in 1996 on [[STS-78]], the Life Sciences and Microgravity Spacelab (LMS) mission. In 1998, he served as the payload commander on the [[STS-90]] Neurolab mission. In 2002, he was a member of the four-man EVA crew on [[STS-109]]. A veteran of four space flights, Linnehan has logged over 59 days in space, including six EVAs ([[spacewalk]]s) totaling 42 hours and 11 minutes.<ref name=\"bio1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/linnehan.pdf|title=Astronaut biography-RICHARD M.

The Life Sciences and Microgravity Spacelab mission was flown aboard Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]''. The 17-day flight included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life sciences payload. STS-78 orbited the Earth 271 times, and covered {{convert|7000000|mi|km}} in 405 hours and 48 minutes.\n\n[[STS-90]] Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998) was Linnehan's second [[Spacelab]] mission. During the 16-day flight the seven person crew aboard Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' served as both experimental subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. STS-90 orbited the Earth 256 times, and covered {{convert|6300000|mi|km}} in 381 hours and 50 minutes. Both missions served as a model for future life sciences studies on board the [[International Space Station]].\n\n[[STS-109]] HST Servicing Mission 3B (March 1 to March 12, 2002) was the fourth [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) servicing mission and Linnehan's third flight aboard ''Columbia''. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope's systems over the course of five consecutive EVAs, leaving it with a new power control unit, improved solar arrays, the new Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), and an experimental refrigeration unit for cooling the dormant Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). With his teammate [[John Grunsfeld]], Linnehan performed three of the five spacewalks totaling 21 hours and 9 minutes. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times and covered {{convert|3900000|mi|km}} in just over 262 hours.\n\n[[STS-123]] (March 11 to March 26, 2008) was Linnehan's fourth spaceflight, and his first aboard the Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''. The mission delivered the Japanese Logistics Module and the Canadian [[Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator]] to the [[International Space Station]]. Linnehan performed three of the five scheduled space walks on STS-123 with [[Garrett Reisman]], [[Mike Foreman]] and [[Robert Behnken|Bob Behnken]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/linnehan.html NASA biography of Richard M.

In 2005, its share was cut to 40 per cent because of the introduction of the Employer Reputation Survey.\n\n'''Faculty student ratio'''\n\nThis indicator accounts for 20 per cent of a university's possible score in the rankings. It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as a proxy for teaching commitment, but QS has admitted that it is less than satisfactory.<ref>[http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-faculty-student/ QS Intelligence Unit | Faculty Student Ratio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012150310/http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-faculty-student/ |date=October 12, 2011 }}.

The QS World University Rankings used citations data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20 per cent of a university's possible score in the Rankings.\n\nQS has explained that it uses this approach, rather than the citations per paper preferred for other systems, because it reduces the effect of biomedical science on the overall picture \u2013 bio-medicine has a ferocious \"[[publish or perish]]\" culture. Instead QS attempts to measure the density of research-active staff at each institution. But issues still remain about the use of citations in ranking systems, especially the fact that the arts and humanities generate comparatively few citations.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-citations-per-faculty/ QS Intelligence Unit | Citations per Faculty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028174836/http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-citations-per-faculty/ |date=October 28, 2011 }}.

For major world universities, the two systems capture more or less the same publications and citations. For less mainstream institutions, Scopus has more non-English language and smaller-circulation journals in its database.

Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.}}\n\nHowever, QS state that no survey participant, academic or employer, is offered a financial incentive to respond, while no academic is able to vote for their own institution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This renders this particular criticism invalid, as it is based on two incorrect premises: (1) that academics are currently financially incentivized to participate, and (2) that conflicts of interests are created by academics being able to vote for their own institution.\n\nAcademicians previously criticized of the use of the citation database, arguing that it undervalues institutions which excel in the social sciences. Ian Diamond, former chief executive of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] and now vice-chancellor of the [[University of Aberdeen]] and a member of the THE editorial board, wrote to ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' in 2007, saying:<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=311132 |title=Social sciences lose 1 |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2010-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123141114/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=311132 |archive-date=2011-11-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> {{quote|The use of a citation database must have an impact because such databases do not have as wide a cover of the social sciences (or arts and humanities) as the natural sciences.

These are generally oriented towards introducing prospective students to university admissions staff, while also facilitating access to admissions advice and scholarships. In 2019, over 360 events were hosted, attended by 265,000 candidates, in 100 cities across 50 countries.\nSeparated into \u2018tours\u2019, QS\u2019 event offerings typically comprise a series of university and business school fairs.\n\n===World MBA Tour===\nThe QS World MBA Tour is the world's largest series of international business school fairs, attended by more than 60,000 candidates in 100 cities across 50 countries.\n\n===World MBA Tour Premium===\nQS World MBA Premium also focuses on MBA student recruitment, but invites only business schools ranked in the top 200 internationally, according to the QS World University Rankings. The event aims to provide a more holistic overview of an MBA degree, with enhanced focus on pre- and post-study processes and insights.\n\n===World Grad School Tour===\nThe QS World Grad School Tour focuses on international postgraduate programs, particularly specialised master's degrees and PhDs in FAME (Finance, Accounting, Management and Economics) and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines.\n\n===World University Tour===\nThe QS World University Tour has an emphasis on undergraduate student recruitment, inviting undergraduate programs only.\n\n===Connect Events===\nQS Connect MBA and QS Connect Masters differ from other event series\u2019 in that an open fair format is not followed. Instead, candidates take part in pre-arranged 1-to-1 interviews with admissions staff, based on pre-submitted CVs and academic profiles.\n\n==QS Stars==\nQS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.<ref>{{cite web|title=QS Stars University Ratings|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars#sorting=overall+country=+rating=6+order=desc+orderby=uni+search=|website=Top Universities|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|access-date=2016-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914092702/https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars#sorting=overall+country=+rating=6+order=desc+orderby=uni+search=|archive-date=2016-09-14|url-status=live|date = 2014-05-08}}</ref>\n\nQS Stars<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/qs-stars-what-does-it-take-to-get-5-stars/|title=QS Stars Methodology}}</ref> ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories.

The QS World University Rankings used citations data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20 per cent of a university's possible score in the Rankings.\n\nQS has explained that it uses this approach, rather than the citations per paper preferred for other systems, because it reduces the effect of biomedical science on the overall picture \u2013 bio-medicine has a ferocious \"[[publish or perish]]\" culture. Instead QS attempts to measure the density of research-active staff at each institution.

For major world universities, the two systems capture more or less the same publications and citations. For less mainstream institutions, Scopus has more non-English language and smaller-circulation journals in its database.

We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.}}\n\nHowever, QS state that no survey participant, academic or employer, is offered a financial incentive to respond, while no academic is able to vote for their own institution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This renders this particular criticism invalid, as it is based on two incorrect premises: (1) that academics are currently financially incentivized to participate, and (2) that conflicts of interests are created by academics being able to vote for their own institution.\n\nAcademicians previously criticized of the use of the citation database, arguing that it undervalues institutions which excel in the social sciences.

These are generally oriented towards introducing prospective students to university admissions staff, while also facilitating access to admissions advice and scholarships. In 2019, over 360 events were hosted, attended by 265,000 candidates, in 100 cities across 50 countries.\nSeparated into \u2018tours\u2019, QS\u2019 event offerings typically comprise a series of university and business school fairs.\n\n===World MBA Tour===\nThe QS World MBA Tour is the world's largest series of international business school fairs, attended by more than 60,000 candidates in 100 cities across 50 countries.\n\n===World MBA Tour Premium===\nQS World MBA Premium also focuses on MBA student recruitment, but invites only business schools ranked in the top 200 internationally, according to the QS World University Rankings. The event aims to provide a more holistic overview of an MBA degree, with enhanced focus on pre- and post-study processes and insights.\n\n===World Grad School Tour===\nThe QS World Grad School Tour focuses on international postgraduate programs, particularly specialised master's degrees and PhDs in FAME (Finance, Accounting, Management and Economics) and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines.\n\n===World University Tour===\nThe QS World University Tour has an emphasis on undergraduate student recruitment, inviting undergraduate programs only.\n\n===Connect Events===\nQS Connect MBA and QS Connect Masters differ from other event series\u2019 in that an open fair format is not followed. Instead, candidates take part in pre-arranged 1-to-1 interviews with admissions staff, based on pre-submitted CVs and academic profiles.\n\n==QS Stars==\nQS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.<ref>{{cite web|title=QS Stars University Ratings|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars#sorting=overall+country=+rating=6+order=desc+orderby=uni+search=|website=Top Universities|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|access-date=2016-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914092702/https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars#sorting=overall+country=+rating=6+order=desc+orderby=uni+search=|archive-date=2016-09-14|url-status=live|date = 2014-05-08}}</ref>\n\nQS Stars<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/qs-stars-what-does-it-take-to-get-5-stars/|title=QS Stars Methodology}}</ref> ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories.

Families can enjoy many kinds of activities from cherry pit spitting and pie eating contests, to the Grand Royale Parade in which the newly crowned Cherry Queen greets the crowds.

Aircraft manufacturing company [[Cirrus Aircraft|Cirrus]] is also based on the airport grounds, where it has its main manufacturing facility and headquarters.\n\n==History==\nThe City of Duluth purchased the original property for the airport in 1929 from Saint Louis County. The airport was constructed on {{convert|640|acre|km2}} of land with two {{convert|2650|ft|m|adj=on}} sod runways. In 1930, the airfield was dedicated as Williamson\u2013Johnson Municipal Airport.\n\nIn 1940, Northwest Airlines began the first regularly scheduled air service to Duluth. Two years later, operations were temporarily halted by World War II.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://duluthairport.com/about/|title=About}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942, three runways were paved. Each runway was {{convert|4000|ft}} long, {{convert|150|ft}} wide, and at nearly equal angles from each other, 30, 90, and 130 degrees. They were identified as runways 3\u201321, 9\u201327, and 13\u201331, respectively. The Corps of Engineers extended Runways 9\u201327 and 3\u201321 to {{convert|5699|ft|m}} in 1945. In 1951, the USAF extended Runway 9\u201327 to {{convert|9000|ft|m}} with a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=mid}} overrun and the control tower was built. Runway 9\u201327 was rebuilt in 1956 and extended in 1966 to {{convert|10152|ft|m}} in length.\n\nThe original terminal building was built in 1954, south of Runway 9\u201327 and west of Runway 3\u201321. The terminal floor area was {{convert|14200|sqft|m2}} with 280 parking spaces. It would serve the airport for nearly 20 years. \n\nIn 1961, the Duluth Airport Authority Board renamed the facility Duluth International Airport.\n\nIn 1973, a new Terminal Building and U.S. Customs, International Arrivals Building, were completed east of Runway 13\u201331 and opened for operation. Runway 13\u201331 was shortened to {{convert|2578|ft}} to accommodate construction of an addition to the International Arrivals building. This resulted in Runway 13\u201331 being closed as a runway due to obstructions. Runway 13\u201331 was re-striped in 1980, decreasing its width to {{convert|75|ft}}, for use as a taxiway. In 1989, the newer terminal building and the adjacent structures were connected to form one enclosure. The original terminal building was then converted for use as offices for general aviation, the FAA, and the U.S. Weather Bureau.  The 1973 terminal building had its last flight take place on January 13, 2013.\n\nIn 2013, a new passenger terminal was built directly in front of the 1973 terminal.  This new building solved several problems of the previous terminal building, including that the tails of parked airplanes extended too close to the runway due to FAA airspace changes made after the building's completion.  This terminal building has restrooms and concessions beyond the TSA security checkpoint, something the previous terminal lost when screening processes were put in place after 9/11.  The first flight to leave the new terminal was on January 14: United flight 5292 to Chicago O'Hare.\n\nOn October 30, 2015, the new terminal was named for the late U.S. Representative [[Jim Oberstar]], who represented the congressional district in which the airport lies from 1975 to 2011 and helped secure funding for the facility before its 2013 opening.<ref>http://duluthairport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/for-media-distribution-Oberstar-PR-for-dedication-2-3.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/politics/3872814-duluth-airport-terminal-now-honors-oberstar |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124152402/https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/politics/3872814-duluth-airport-terminal-now-honors-oberstar |archive-date=January 24, 2019 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nA 370-stall parking ramp with skywalk connection to the terminal was completed in fall 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/3617098-duluth-airports-new-parking-garage-opens-friday|title=Duluth airport\u2019s new parking garage opens Friday|first=Candace|last=Renalls|date=January 2, 2018|website=www.duluthnewstribune.com}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities and aircraft==\nDuluth International Airport covers an area of {{convert|3020|acre|ha}} at an elevation of 1,428 feet (435 m) above [[mean sea level]].
