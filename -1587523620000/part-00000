Designated as a [[mountain warfare]] unit, the division is the only one of its size in the US military to receive intense specialized training for fighting in mountainous and arctic conditions. More recently, the 10th Mountain has been conducting operations in [[Iraq]], advising and assisting [[Iraqi security forces|Iraqi Security Forces]].\n\nOriginally activated as the '''10th Light Division (Alpine)''' in 1943, the division was redesignated the 10th Mountain Division in 1944 and fought in the mountains of [[Italy]] in some of the roughest terrain in [[World War II]]. On 5 May 1945 the Division reached [[Nauders]], Austria, beyond the [[Resia Pass]], where it made contact with German forces being pushed south by the [[United States Seventh Army|U.S. Seventh Army]].  A status quo was maintained until the enemy headquarters involved had completed their surrender to the Seventh.

The division first acted as a training division and, in 1954, was converted to a full combat division and sent to Germany before being deactivated again in 1958.\n\nReactivated again in 1985, the division was designated the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) to historically tie it to the World War II division and to also better describe its modern disposition. Since its reactivation, the division or elements of the division have deployed numerous times. The division has participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]] ([[Saudi Arabia]]), [[Hurricane Andrew]] disaster relief ([[Homestead, Florida]]), [[Operation Restore Hope]] and [[Operation Continue Hope]] ([[Somalia]]), [[Operation Uphold Democracy]] ([[Haiti]]), [[Operation Joint Forge]] ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), [[Operation Joint Guardian]] ([[Kosovo]]), and several deployments as part of the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] ([[Sinai Peninsula]]).\n\nSince 2001, the '''10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry)''' has been the most deployed unit in the US military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://10thmountaindivisioninfo.com/todays-10th-mountain-division/|title=Today's 10th Moun/tain Division |work=10th Mountain Division Info}}</ref> Its combat brigades have seen over 20 deployments to both [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\n{{US 10th Mountain Division}}\n\nThe 10th Division was originally organized in 1918 as a [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] and [[History of the United States Army#World War I|National Army]] division for World War I.

Designated as a [[mountain warfare]] unit, the division is the only one of its size in the US military to receive intense specialized training for fighting in mountainous and arctic conditions. More recently, the 10th Mountain has been conducting operations in [[Iraq]], advising and assisting [[Iraqi security forces|Iraqi Security Forces]].\n\nOriginally activated as the '''10th Light Division (Alpine)''' in 1943, the division was redesignated the 10th Mountain Division in 1944 and fought in the mountains of [[Italy]] in some of the roughest terrain in [[World War II]]. On 5 May 1945 the Division reached [[Nauders]], Austria, beyond the [[Resia Pass]], where it made contact with German forces being pushed south by the [[United States Seventh Army|U.S. Seventh Army]].  A status quo was maintained until the enemy headquarters involved had completed their surrender to the Seventh. On the 6th, 10th Mountain troops met the 44th Infantry Division of Seventh Army.<ref name=Alps>{{cite web|url=http://www.milhist.net/mto/racealps.html|title=5th Army History \u2022 Conclusion|first=Patrick G. Skely, Pocasset|last=MA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, the division was deactivated, only to be reactivated and redesignated as the '''10th Infantry Division''' in 1948. The division first acted as a training division and, in 1954, was converted to a full combat division and sent to Germany before being deactivated again in 1958.\n\nReactivated again in 1985, the division was designated the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) to historically tie it to the World War II division and to also better describe its modern disposition. Since its reactivation, the division or elements of the division have deployed numerous times.

Ex-soldiers from the 10th laid out ski hills, designed [[ski lift]]s, became ski coaches, racers, instructors, [[Ski patrol|patrollers]], shop owners, and [[Skiing and snowboarding on film and video|filmmakers]]. They wrote and published ski magazines, opened [[ski school]]s, improved ski equipment, and developed [[ski resorts]]. Up to 2,000 of the division's troops were involved in skiing-related professions after the war, and at least 60 ski resorts were founded by men of the division.<ref name=\"Skiing3\">{{harvnb|''Skiing''|1995|p=3|ref=\"Skiing\"}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Seneca Rocks -10th Mountain Division marker.JPG|thumb|left|Plaque in honor of 10th Mountain Division at [[Seneca Rocks]], [[West Virginia|WV]].]]\n\nPeople associated with the 10th Mountain Division later went on to achieve notability in other fields.

In the [[Talmud]] (Tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 38b), [[Adam]] was initially created as a golem (\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) when his dust was \"kneaded into a shapeless husk.\" Like Adam, all golems are [[creation of man from clay|created from mud]] by those close to divinity, but no anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 65b describes [[Rava (amora)|Rava]] creating a man (''gavra''). He sent the man to [[Rav Zeira]]. Rav Zeira spoke to him, but he did not answer. Rav Zeira said, \"You were created by the sages; return to your dust\".\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], passages from the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' (''Book of Creation'') were studied as a means to create and animate a golem, although there is little in the writings of Jewish mysticism that supports this belief. It was believed that golems could be activated by an [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] experience induced by the ritualistic use of various letters of the Hebrew Alphabet<ref name=idel/> forming a \"''[[Shemhamphorasch|shem]]''\" (any one of the [[Names of God in Judaism|Names of God]]), wherein the ''shem'' was written on a piece of paper and inserted in the mouth or in the forehead of the golem.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia\" />\n\nA golem is inscribed with Hebrew words in some tales (for example, some versions of Che\u0142m and Prague, as well as in Polish tales and versions of [[Brothers Grimm]]), such as the word ''emet'' (\u05d0\u05de\u05ea, \"truth\" in Hebrew) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (\u05d0) in ''emet'',<ref>Kerstein, Benjamin.

In the [[Talmud]] (Tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 38b), [[Adam]] was initially created as a golem (\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) when his dust was \"kneaded into a shapeless husk.\" Like Adam, all golems are [[creation of man from clay|created from mud]] by those close to divinity, but no anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 65b describes [[Rava (amora)|Rava]] creating a man (''gavra''). He sent the man to [[Rav Zeira]]. Rav Zeira spoke to him, but he did not answer. Rav Zeira said, \"You were created by the sages; return to your dust\".\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], passages from the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' (''Book of Creation'') were studied as a means to create and animate a golem, although there is little in the writings of Jewish mysticism that supports this belief. It was believed that golems could be activated by an [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] experience induced by the ritualistic use of various letters of the Hebrew Alphabet<ref name=idel/> forming a \"''[[Shemhamphorasch|shem]]''\" (any one of the [[Names of God in Judaism|Names of God]]), wherein the ''shem'' was written on a piece of paper and inserted in the mouth or in the forehead of the golem.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia\" />\n\nA golem is inscribed with Hebrew words in some tales (for example, some versions of Che\u0142m and Prague, as well as in Polish tales and versions of [[Brothers Grimm]]), such as the word ''emet'' (\u05d0\u05de\u05ea, \"truth\" in Hebrew) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (\u05d0) in ''emet'',<ref>Kerstein, Benjamin. ''Jewish Ideas Daily''. 14 September 2010. 24 August 2017.</ref> thus changing the inscription from \"truth\" to \"death\" (''met'' \u05de\u05ea, meaning \"dead\"). \n\nRabbi Jacob Ben Shalom arrived at [[Barcelona]] from Germany in 1325 and remarked that the law of destruction is the reversal of the law of creation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trachtenberg|first=Joshua|title=Jewish Magic and Superstition|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|year=2004|origyear=Originally published 1939|isbn=9780812218626|page=86}}</ref>\n\nOne source credits 11th century Jew [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] with creating a golem,<ref>Bokser, Ben Zion (2006).

([[Canadian French]]: {{lang|fr|Bell M\u00e9dia}}) is the [[mass media]] subsidiary of [[BCE Inc.]] (also known as Bell Canada Enterprises, the parent company of the former telephone monopoly [[Bell Canada]]). Its operations include [[television]] broadcasting and production (including the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CTV 2]] television networks), radio broadcasting (through [[iHeartRadio Canada]]), [[digital media]] (including [[CraveTV]]) and [[Internet]] properties including [[Sympatico]].ca.\n\nBell Media is the successor-in-interest to '''Baton Broadcasting''' (later '''CTV Inc.'''), one of Canada's first private-sector television broadcasters. The company in its current form was originally established as '''Bell Globemedia''' by BCE and [[The Woodbridge Company|the Thomson family]] in 2001 combining CTV Inc., which Bell had acquired the previous year, and the operations of the Thomsons' ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. Bell sold the majority of its interest in 2006 (at which point the company was renamed '''CTVglobemedia'''), but re-acquired the entire company, excluding the ''Globe'', in 2011.\n\n==History==\n===History before 2011===\n====Baton Broadcasting====\n{{Redirect|Baton Broadcasting|the defunct television system owned by Baton|Baton Broadcast System}}\nFor all practical purposes, Bell Media is the successor to '''Baton Broadcasting Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|e\u026a|t|\u0252|n}} {{respell|BAY|ton}}), which by the late 1990s had become one of Canada's largest broadcasters.\n\nBaton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting Ltd. was originally formed in 1960 to operate Toronto's first private television station, [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]]. The original investors included the [[John Bassett|<u>Ba</u>ssett]] and [[John David Eaton|Ea<u>ton</u>]] families ([[Telegram Corporation|Baton]]), Joel Aldred<ref>[https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thestar/obituary.aspx?n=joel-walkden-aldred&pid=154189621&fhid=8490 Joel Walkden Aldred]</ref> and [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.|Ted Rogers]], and [[Foster Hewitt]] in a much smaller role.<ref name=\"Nolan2001\">{{cite book|author=Michael Nolan|title=CTV, the Network that Means Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6c3FkFx0-uoC&pg=PA20|year=2001|publisher=University of Alberta|isbn=978-0-88864-384-1|page=20}}</ref> Aldred sold his shares in 1961, followed by Rogers by 1970. With the Bassett and Eaton families firmly in control, the company went public in the early 1970s.\n\nCFTO was one of the charter affiliates of CTV when that network formed in 1961, becoming the network's flagship. In 1966, Baton became a part-owner in the network when it was reorganized as a station-owned [[cooperative]]. The [[Board of Broadcast Governors]] was initially skeptical about the proposal to turn CTV into a cooperative. Since CFTO was by far the largest and richest station in the network, the BBG feared Baton would take advantage of this to dominate the network. However, it approved the deal after Baton and the other owners included a provision in the cooperative's bylaws stipulating that the eight station owners would each have a single vote regardless of audience share. Additionally, if one owner ever bought another station, the acquired station's shares would be redistributed among the remaining owners so that each owner would still have one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1972, Baton began purchasing other CTV affiliates, starting with [[CFQC-DT|CFQC-TV]] in [[Saskatoon]]. This did not, however, give Baton a substantially higher investment in CTV, since its shares were redistributed among the other owners.  As a result, Baton still had only one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1987, Baton began a concerted effort to take over CTV.  It started this drive with a further expansion into [[Saskatchewan]], purchasing [[CKCK-DT|CKCK-TV]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Yorkton]] [[twinstick]] [[CKOS-TV]]/[[CICC-TV]], and CBC affiliate [[CKBI-TV]] [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. A twinstick CTV affiliate was soon launched in Prince Albert, [[CIPA-TV]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Baton applied for a high-power station in [[Ottawa]] on channel 60. The licence was approved by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), appealed to [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] by rival broadcasters, and ultimately sent back to the CRTC for review.<ref>[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html Order Referring back to the CRTC a Decision Respecting Nation's Capital Television Incorporated] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181627/http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html |date=2011-07-06 }}, 28 April 1987</ref> However the licence was surrendered when Baton was instead able to acquire the local CTV affiliate, [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV]], from [[Allan Slaight]]'s [[Standard Broadcasting]].\n\nIn 1990, Baton purchased the [[Mid-Canada Communications|MCTV]] system of [[twinstick]] operations in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Timmins]], and the [[Huron Broadcasting]] twinstick in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. In 1993, Baton purchased [[CFPL-DT|CFPL-TV]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[CKNX-TV]] in [[Wingham, Ontario|Wingham]] and received a licence for a new independent station, [[CHWI-DT|CHWI-TV]], in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\nIn 1991, the company launched Ontario Network Television, a secondary affiliation carried by Baton's CTV and [[independent station]]s in Ontario. This was expanded in 1994 into the [[Baton Broadcast System]], or BBS, which included Baton's Saskatchewan stations. BBS was meant as a backup in case Baton's ongoing acquisitions did not translate into control of CTV itself. A year earlier, CTV had been recently restructured into a corporation, with each owner holding a 14.3 percent stake in the network. However, any ''future'' acquisitions by Baton would come with all of that affiliate's CTV shares. It was around this time that former CBC executive [[Ivan Fecan]] joined the company.\n\n====Baton-Electrohome alliance====\nIn 1996, the CRTC approved two major deals involving Baton. First was the acquisition of [[CFCN-DT|CFCN-TV]] in [[Calgary]] from [[Rogers Communications]], which had recently purchased [[Maclean Hunter]]. Second, Baton and [[Electrohome]], owner of [[CKCO-DT|CKCO-TV]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN-TV]] in [[Edmonton]], formed an alliance, under which the companies would share ownership of CFCN, Baton's stations in Saskatchewan and its independent stations in southwestern Ontario, and Electrohome's CKCO. The deals doubled Baton's own interest in CTV to 28.6%.  However, as part of the deal, Baton took control of Electrohome's CTV vote, allowing it to command 42.9% of CTV's shares.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1996/DB96-251.htm Decision CRTC 96-251], June 21, 1996</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, Baton-Electrohome's \"Vancouver Television\" proposal emerged as the CRTC's choice for the new independent station in [[Vancouver]], beating out four other competitors. The new station, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT-TV]], would compete directly with [[Western International Communications]]'s two CTV affiliates in the market when it was launched that fall.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-39.htm Decision CRTC 97-39], January 31, 1997</ref>\n\nOn February 25, 1997, the Baton-Electrohome alliance and [[CHUM Limited]] announced that several stations would be swapped between them. Baton-Electrohome would acquire CHUM's [[CTV Atlantic|Atlantic Television System]] (ATV), consisting of four CTV affiliates in the [[Maritimes]], the [[CTV 2 Atlantic|Atlantic Satellite Network]] (ASN), and a further 14.3% in CTV. CHUM would receive Baton's independent stations in southwestern Ontario, as well as [[CHRO-TV]] in Pembroke, which had recently disaffiliated from CTV. The Baton-Electrohome alliance now held 57.2% of CTV.\n\nShortly thereafter, Electrohome announced it would sell its broadcasting assets \u2013 including CFRN its interest in the alliance and its CTV shares \u2013 to Baton in exchange for cash and shares in Baton. These two deals were approved by the CRTC in August.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-527.HTM Decision CRTC 97-527], August 28, 1997</ref> Baton now held controlling interest in CTV, triggering a [[put option]] that allowed the other owners to sell their stakes in the network while still keeping their stations. Accordingly, Baton acquired the remaining CTV shares from WIC and [[Moffat Communications]], which remained affiliates for the moment, that fall.\n\nThe BBS television system was merged into CTV, with the company itself being renamed CTV Inc. the following year. The Eatons' remaining shares, representing 41% of Baton, were sold off to the general public in early 1998. By the end of 2001, nearly all CTV stations were consolidated under network ownership (including one replacement).\n\n====NetStar Communications====\nNetStar Communications Inc. (previously Labatt Communications Inc., and currently CTV Specialty Television Inc.) was formed by [[Labatt Brewing Company]] to hold that firm's broadcasting assets, which included TSN, RDS, [[Viewers Choice]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]. In 1995, when the parent company was sold to the foreign brewing conglomerate [[Interbrew]], a consortium of four Canadian investors - [[Stephen Bronfman]] (22.5%), [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec|the Caisse]] (22.5%), [[Reitmans]] (16.5%), and senior management (6.5%) - along with [[ESPN]], with 32%, took over the company.<ref>[http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf Broadcast Dialogue newsletter, January 21, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304175349/http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf |date=March 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter a takeover attempt by [[CanWest Global]] that was vetoed by ESPN, CTV announced a friendly bid to take over NetStar Communications in early 1999, with CRTC approval on March 24, 2000.\n\n====Under BCE ownership: Bell Globemedia (2000-2006)====\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, CTV (including the NetStar assets) was folded into a new media venture, Bell Globemedia Inc. (abbreviated \"BGM\"). This was masterminded by former [[Bell Canada]] chief executive [[Jean Monty]], largely as a response to [[Canwest]]'s purchase of the [[Southam Newspapers|Southam]] newspaper chain as well as the trend of [[media convergence]], particularly the [[AOL]]-[[Time Warner]] merger. Monty believed that, to survive in a changing technological landscape, and in particular to drive subscriptions to [[satellite television]] provider [[Bell TV|Bell ExpressVu]]<!-- As it was known at the time. --> and [[internet service provider]] [[Bell Sympatico]], BCE had to have control over content.\n\nThe transaction was structured as follows: In 2000, BCE acquired CTV Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.3 billion ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/02/25/bcectv000225.html BCE announces $2.3 billion bid for CTV], CBC.ca, February 25, 2000 (modified November 11, 2000); accessed August 9, 2006</ref> Soon after, Monty arranged to have [[Thomson Corporation]] transfer control of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the [[Toronto]]-based national newspaper, to BCE in exchange for a significant (20%) interest in the merged CTV/''Globe'' entity. The Thomsons' family holding company, [[The Woodbridge Company|The Woodbridge Company Ltd.]], invested in the company directly to obtain an additional 9.9% interest, and later bought Thomson Corp.'s interests itself.\n\nThe resulting company, Bell Globemedia, consisted of CTV, ''The Globe and Mail'', and the [[internet]] portal then known as [[Sympatico]]-[[Lycos]] (Lycos was later replaced by [[MSN]]). Fecan was named the combined firm's president and CEO, a role he remained in for the duration of the BGM / CTVgm era. After Monty resigned and was replaced by [[Michael Sabia]] in 2002, it became clear that Monty's vision was not producing anything near the desired results, notwithstanding the good results for the individual units, particularly the CTV network.\n\nThe following years provided a few cosmetic changes in BGM's assets. In 2001, CTV acquired [[CKY-DT|CKY-TV]] in [[Winnipeg]] and [[CFCF-DT|CFCF-TV]] in Montreal, and moved the CTV affiliation in British Columbia to CIVT, replacing two affiliates that had been purchased by Canwest. That fall also brought the launch of the first digital [[specialty channel]]s, including several owned by CTV.\n\nThe company acquired partial ownership in TQS in 2002, the Sympatico portal was sold back to Bell Canada, while a further investment from the Thomsons (whose ownership increased to 31.5%) funded the acquisition of 15% of [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]. However, beginning in 2003, BCE management began to refer to BGM as a non-core asset; as a result, much attention was given to the likely sale of the company, and potentially a breakup into several different pieces.\n\n====Reorganization and CHUM Limited merger (2006-2011)====\n{{see also|CHUM Limited}}\n\nOn December 2, 2005, [[Bell Canada|Bell Canada Enterprises]] (BCE) announced it would sell an 8.5% interest to Woodbridge (increasing their total ownership to 40%), a 20% interest to [[Torstar]], and a 20% interest to the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]]. BCE retained 20% of the group - a condition that ensured that Bell TV, Sympatico, and other Bell units continued to have access to Globemedia content. The transaction closed on August 30, 2006.<ref>\"[http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html BGM Ownership Deal Closes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202033123/http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html |date=December 2, 2007 }}\", BGM press release, August 30, 2006</ref>\n\nThis deal put to rest any rumours about a possible breakup of the company. However, Torstar's involvement led to additional [[media concentration]] concerns, mainly from media [[trade union|union]]s. Torstar insisted it was committed to maintaining the [[editorial independence]] of the ''Globe'' and its own ''[[Toronto Star]]'', and ultimately there were no major regulatory hurdles due to this.\n\n{{Wikinews|Canadian media company Bell Globemedia to acquire rival CHUM}}On July 12, 2006, BGM announced a friendly bid to take over [[CHUM Limited]] for an estimated $1.7 billion. The acquisition would bring the secondary broadcast system ([[Citytv]]), other stations including [[CP24|CablePulse24]], [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Star!]], [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo!]], and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]], and all of CHUM's radio stations, into the BGM fold. BGM originally announced that CHUM's [[CTV 2|A-Channel]] stations, [[Access (TV channel)|Access]], [[CKX-TV]], [[MusiquePlus]], [[MusiMax]], [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[Cooking Channel (Canadian TV channel)|SexTV: The Channel]] and BGM's own [[OLN]] would not be retained.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, in order to pay for the CHUM acquisition, BGM sold additional shares to its existing shareholders. BCE did not participate in the refinancing; the net effect was an increase in Teachers' ownership to 25%, while BCE's interest was reduced to 15%.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html Bell Globemedia Completes Financing to Pay for CHUM Limited Shares] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222027/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, BGM press release, September 7, 2006</ref> As a result of BCE's reduced ownership, the company was renamed as CTVglobemedia as of January 1, 2007.\n\nIn April 2007, [[Rogers Communications]] announced a tentative deal to purchase A-Channel, CKX-TV, Access Alberta, Canadian Learning Television, and SexTV: The Channel from CTVglobemedia, if its purchase of CHUM was approved. [[Astral Media]] made a similar deal for CHUM's 50% interest in MusiMax and MusiquePlus.\n\nThat June, the CRTC approved the CHUM takeover, on condition that CTV sell off the Citytv stations, because of the CTV network's O&O stations serving the very same cities. CTV ultimately chose to keep the A-Channel stations along with the rest of CHUM assets it had previously said it would sell, except for MusiquePlus/MusiMax. [[Rogers Communications]] was announced as the buyer of the Citytv stations on June 11, 2007, and the CHUM acquisition was finalized on June 22.\n\nSince then, CTVglobemedia has sold off its interests in various non-core channels. Rogers has purchased several of these assets, including CTV's 33% interest in OLN in late 2007, as well as radio stations [[CHST-FM]] in [[London, Ontario]] and [[CHBN-FM]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm Canada's Rogers Radio acquires Edmonton top 40 station 91.7 The Bounce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627032732/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm |date=2010-06-27 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario Canada's Rogers Radio acquires 102.3 Bob FM in London, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804172359/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario |date=2011-08-04 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref> [[Corus Entertainment]] would acquire [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[SexTV: The Channel]], and [[Drive-In Classics]] for a combined $113 million.

([[Canadian French]]: {{lang|fr|Bell M\u00e9dia}}) is the [[mass media]] subsidiary of [[BCE Inc.]] (also known as Bell Canada Enterprises, the parent company of the former telephone monopoly [[Bell Canada]]). Its operations include [[television]] broadcasting and production (including the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CTV 2]] television networks), radio broadcasting (through [[iHeartRadio Canada]]), [[digital media]] (including [[CraveTV]]) and [[Internet]] properties including [[Sympatico]].ca.\n\nBell Media is the successor-in-interest to '''Baton Broadcasting''' (later '''CTV Inc.'''), one of Canada's first private-sector television broadcasters. The company in its current form was originally established as '''Bell Globemedia''' by BCE and [[The Woodbridge Company|the Thomson family]] in 2001 combining CTV Inc., which Bell had acquired the previous year, and the operations of the Thomsons' ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. Bell sold the majority of its interest in 2006 (at which point the company was renamed '''CTVglobemedia'''), but re-acquired the entire company, excluding the ''Globe'', in 2011.\n\n==History==\n===History before 2011===\n====Baton Broadcasting====\n{{Redirect|Baton Broadcasting|the defunct television system owned by Baton|Baton Broadcast System}}\nFor all practical purposes, Bell Media is the successor to '''Baton Broadcasting Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|e\u026a|t|\u0252|n}} {{respell|BAY|ton}}), which by the late 1990s had become one of Canada's largest broadcasters.\n\nBaton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting Ltd. was originally formed in 1960 to operate Toronto's first private television station, [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]]. The original investors included the [[John Bassett|<u>Ba</u>ssett]] and [[John David Eaton|Ea<u>ton</u>]] families ([[Telegram Corporation|Baton]]), [[Joel Aldred]] and [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.|Ted Rogers]], and [[Foster Hewitt]] in a much smaller role.<ref name=\"Nolan2001\">{{cite book|author=Michael Nolan|title=CTV, the Network that Means Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6c3FkFx0-uoC&pg=PA20|year=2001|publisher=University of Alberta|isbn=978-0-88864-384-1|page=20}}</ref> Aldred sold his shares in 1961, followed by Rogers by 1970. With the Bassett and Eaton families firmly in control, the company went public in the early 1970s.\n\nCFTO was one of the charter affiliates of CTV when that network formed in 1961, becoming the network's flagship. In 1966, Baton became a part-owner in the network when it was reorganized as a station-owned [[cooperative]]. The [[Board of Broadcast Governors]] was initially skeptical about the proposal to turn CTV into a cooperative. Since CFTO was by far the largest and richest station in the network, the BBG feared Baton would take advantage of this to dominate the network. However, it approved the deal after Baton and the other owners included a provision in the cooperative's bylaws stipulating that the eight station owners would each have a single vote regardless of audience share. Additionally, if one owner ever bought another station, the acquired station's shares would be redistributed among the remaining owners so that each owner would still have one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1972, Baton began purchasing other CTV affiliates, starting with [[CFQC-DT|CFQC-TV]] in [[Saskatoon]]. This did not, however, give Baton a substantially higher investment in CTV, since its shares were redistributed among the other owners.  As a result, Baton still had only one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1987, Baton began a concerted effort to take over CTV.  It started this drive with a further expansion into [[Saskatchewan]], purchasing [[CKCK-DT|CKCK-TV]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Yorkton]] [[twinstick]] [[CKOS-TV]]/[[CICC-TV]], and CBC affiliate [[CKBI-TV]] [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. A twinstick CTV affiliate was soon launched in Prince Albert, [[CIPA-TV]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Baton applied for a high-power station in [[Ottawa]] on channel 60. The licence was approved by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), appealed to [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] by rival broadcasters, and ultimately sent back to the CRTC for review.<ref>[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html Order Referring back to the CRTC a Decision Respecting Nation's Capital Television Incorporated] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181627/http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html |date=2011-07-06 }}, 28 April 1987</ref> However the licence was surrendered when Baton was instead able to acquire the local CTV affiliate, [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV]], from [[Allan Slaight]]'s [[Standard Broadcasting]].\n\nIn 1990, Baton purchased the [[Mid-Canada Communications|MCTV]] system of [[twinstick]] operations in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Timmins]], and the [[Huron Broadcasting]] twinstick in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. In 1993, Baton purchased [[CFPL-DT|CFPL-TV]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[CKNX-TV]] in [[Wingham, Ontario|Wingham]] and received a licence for a new independent station, [[CHWI-DT|CHWI-TV]], in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\nIn 1991, the company launched Ontario Network Television, a secondary affiliation carried by Baton's CTV and [[independent station]]s in Ontario. This was expanded in 1994 into the [[Baton Broadcast System]], or BBS, which included Baton's Saskatchewan stations. BBS was meant as a backup in case Baton's ongoing acquisitions did not translate into control of CTV itself. A year earlier, CTV had been recently restructured into a corporation, with each owner holding a 14.3 percent stake in the network. However, any ''future'' acquisitions by Baton would come with all of that affiliate's CTV shares. It was around this time that former CBC executive [[Ivan Fecan]] joined the company.\n\n====Baton-Electrohome alliance====\nIn 1996, the CRTC approved two major deals involving Baton. First was the acquisition of [[CFCN-DT|CFCN-TV]] in [[Calgary]] from [[Rogers Communications]], which had recently purchased [[Maclean Hunter]]. Second, Baton and [[Electrohome]], owner of [[CKCO-DT|CKCO-TV]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN-TV]] in [[Edmonton]], formed an alliance, under which the companies would share ownership of CFCN, Baton's stations in Saskatchewan and its independent stations in southwestern Ontario, and Electrohome's CKCO. The deals doubled Baton's own interest in CTV to 28.6%.  However, as part of the deal, Baton took control of Electrohome's CTV vote, allowing it to command 42.9% of CTV's shares.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1996/DB96-251.htm Decision CRTC 96-251], June 21, 1996</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, Baton-Electrohome's \"Vancouver Television\" proposal emerged as the CRTC's choice for the new independent station in [[Vancouver]], beating out four other competitors. The new station, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT-TV]], would compete directly with [[Western International Communications]]'s two CTV affiliates in the market when it was launched that fall.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-39.htm Decision CRTC 97-39], January 31, 1997</ref>\n\nOn February 25, 1997, the Baton-Electrohome alliance and [[CHUM Limited]] announced that several stations would be swapped between them. Baton-Electrohome would acquire CHUM's [[CTV Atlantic|Atlantic Television System]] (ATV), consisting of four CTV affiliates in the [[Maritimes]], the [[CTV 2 Atlantic|Atlantic Satellite Network]] (ASN), and a further 14.3% in CTV. CHUM would receive Baton's independent stations in southwestern Ontario, as well as [[CHRO-TV]] in Pembroke, which had recently disaffiliated from CTV. The Baton-Electrohome alliance now held 57.2% of CTV.\n\nShortly thereafter, Electrohome announced it would sell its broadcasting assets \u2013 including CFRN its interest in the alliance and its CTV shares \u2013 to Baton in exchange for cash and shares in Baton. These two deals were approved by the CRTC in August.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-527.HTM Decision CRTC 97-527], August 28, 1997</ref> Baton now held controlling interest in CTV, triggering a [[put option]] that allowed the other owners to sell their stakes in the network while still keeping their stations. Accordingly, Baton acquired the remaining CTV shares from WIC and [[Moffat Communications]], which remained affiliates for the moment, that fall.\n\nThe BBS television system was merged into CTV, with the company itself being renamed CTV Inc. the following year. The Eatons' remaining shares, representing 41% of Baton, were sold off to the general public in early 1998. By the end of 2001, nearly all CTV stations were consolidated under network ownership (including one replacement).\n\n====NetStar Communications====\nNetStar Communications Inc. (previously Labatt Communications Inc., and currently CTV Specialty Television Inc.) was formed by [[Labatt Brewing Company]] to hold that firm's broadcasting assets, which included TSN, RDS, [[Viewers Choice]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]. In 1995, when the parent company was sold to the foreign brewing conglomerate [[Interbrew]], a consortium of four Canadian investors - [[Stephen Bronfman]] (22.5%), [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec|the Caisse]] (22.5%), [[Reitmans]] (16.5%), and senior management (6.5%) - along with [[ESPN]], with 32%, took over the company.<ref>[http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf Broadcast Dialogue newsletter, January 21, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304175349/http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf |date=March 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter a takeover attempt by [[CanWest Global]] that was vetoed by ESPN, CTV announced a friendly bid to take over NetStar Communications in early 1999, with CRTC approval on March 24, 2000.\n\n====Under BCE ownership: Bell Globemedia (2000-2006)====\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, CTV (including the NetStar assets) was folded into a new media venture, Bell Globemedia Inc. (abbreviated \"BGM\"). This was masterminded by former [[Bell Canada]] chief executive [[Jean Monty]], largely as a response to [[Canwest]]'s purchase of the [[Southam Newspapers|Southam]] newspaper chain as well as the trend of [[media convergence]], particularly the [[AOL]]-[[Time Warner]] merger. Monty believed that, to survive in a changing technological landscape, and in particular to drive subscriptions to [[satellite television]] provider [[Bell TV|Bell ExpressVu]]<!-- As it was known at the time. --> and [[internet service provider]] [[Bell Sympatico]], BCE had to have control over content.\n\nThe transaction was structured as follows: In 2000, BCE acquired CTV Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.3 billion ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/02/25/bcectv000225.html BCE announces $2.3 billion bid for CTV], CBC.ca, February 25, 2000 (modified November 11, 2000); accessed August 9, 2006</ref> Soon after, Monty arranged to have [[Thomson Corporation]] transfer control of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the [[Toronto]]-based national newspaper, to BCE in exchange for a significant (20%) interest in the merged CTV/''Globe'' entity. The Thomsons' family holding company, [[The Woodbridge Company|The Woodbridge Company Ltd.]], invested in the company directly to obtain an additional 9.9% interest, and later bought Thomson Corp.'s interests itself.\n\nThe resulting company, Bell Globemedia, consisted of CTV, ''The Globe and Mail'', and the [[internet]] portal then known as [[Sympatico]]-[[Lycos]] (Lycos was later replaced by [[MSN]]). Fecan was named the combined firm's president and CEO, a role he remained in for the duration of the BGM / CTVgm era. After Monty resigned and was replaced by [[Michael Sabia]] in 2002, it became clear that Monty's vision was not producing anything near the desired results, notwithstanding the good results for the individual units, particularly the CTV network.\n\nThe following years provided a few cosmetic changes in BGM's assets. In 2001, CTV acquired [[CKY-DT|CKY-TV]] in [[Winnipeg]] and [[CFCF-DT|CFCF-TV]] in Montreal, and moved the CTV affiliation in British Columbia to CIVT, replacing two affiliates that had been purchased by Canwest. That fall also brought the launch of the first digital [[specialty channel]]s, including several owned by CTV.\n\nThe company acquired partial ownership in TQS in 2002, the Sympatico portal was sold back to Bell Canada, while a further investment from the Thomsons (whose ownership increased to 31.5%) funded the acquisition of 15% of [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]. However, beginning in 2003, BCE management began to refer to BGM as a non-core asset; as a result, much attention was given to the likely sale of the company, and potentially a breakup into several different pieces.\n\n====Reorganization and CHUM Limited merger (2006-2011)====\n{{see also|CHUM Limited}}\n\nOn December 2, 2005, [[Bell Canada|Bell Canada Enterprises]] (BCE) announced it would sell an 8.5% interest to Woodbridge (increasing their total ownership to 40%), a 20% interest to [[Torstar]], and a 20% interest to the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]]. BCE retained 20% of the group - a condition that ensured that Bell TV, Sympatico, and other Bell units continued to have access to Globemedia content. The transaction closed on August 30, 2006.<ref>\"[http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html BGM Ownership Deal Closes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202033123/http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html |date=December 2, 2007 }}\", BGM press release, August 30, 2006</ref>\n\nThis deal put to rest any rumours about a possible breakup of the company. However, Torstar's involvement led to additional [[media concentration]] concerns, mainly from media [[trade union|union]]s. Torstar insisted it was committed to maintaining the [[editorial independence]] of the ''Globe'' and its own ''[[Toronto Star]]'', and ultimately there were no major regulatory hurdles due to this.\n\n{{Wikinews|Canadian media company Bell Globemedia to acquire rival CHUM}}On July 12, 2006, BGM announced a friendly bid to take over [[CHUM Limited]] for an estimated $1.7 billion. The acquisition would bring the secondary broadcast system ([[Citytv]]), other stations including [[CP24|CablePulse24]], [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Star!]], [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo!]], and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]], and all of CHUM's radio stations, into the BGM fold. BGM originally announced that CHUM's [[CTV 2|A-Channel]] stations, [[Access (TV channel)|Access]], [[CKX-TV]], [[MusiquePlus]], [[MusiMax]], [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[Cooking Channel (Canadian TV channel)|SexTV: The Channel]] and BGM's own [[OLN]] would not be retained.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, in order to pay for the CHUM acquisition, BGM sold additional shares to its existing shareholders. BCE did not participate in the refinancing; the net effect was an increase in Teachers' ownership to 25%, while BCE's interest was reduced to 15%.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html Bell Globemedia Completes Financing to Pay for CHUM Limited Shares] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222027/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, BGM press release, September 7, 2006</ref> As a result of BCE's reduced ownership, the company was renamed as CTVglobemedia as of January 1, 2007.\n\nIn April 2007, [[Rogers Communications]] announced a tentative deal to purchase A-Channel, CKX-TV, Access Alberta, Canadian Learning Television, and SexTV: The Channel from CTVglobemedia, if its purchase of CHUM was approved. [[Astral Media]] made a similar deal for CHUM's 50% interest in MusiMax and MusiquePlus.\n\nThat June, the CRTC approved the CHUM takeover, on condition that CTV sell off the Citytv stations, because of the CTV network's O&O stations serving the very same cities. CTV ultimately chose to keep the A-Channel stations along with the rest of CHUM assets it had previously said it would sell, except for MusiquePlus/MusiMax. [[Rogers Communications]] was announced as the buyer of the Citytv stations on June 11, 2007, and the CHUM acquisition was finalized on June 22.\n\nSince then, CTVglobemedia has sold off its interests in various non-core channels. Rogers has purchased several of these assets, including CTV's 33% interest in OLN in late 2007, as well as radio stations [[CHST-FM]] in [[London, Ontario]] and [[CHBN-FM]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm Canada's Rogers Radio acquires Edmonton top 40 station 91.7 The Bounce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627032732/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm |date=2010-06-27 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario Canada's Rogers Radio acquires 102.3 Bob FM in London, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804172359/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario |date=2011-08-04 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref> [[Corus Entertainment]] would acquire [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[SexTV: The Channel]], and [[Drive-In Classics]] for a combined $113 million.

Chicago AC (Also known as Chicago Athletic Association, or C.A.A) scored all of there 16 points against the Light Artillerymen in the first half.
