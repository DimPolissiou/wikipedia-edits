The shot did not kill her, but she was left disfigured and lost her right eye. Griffith was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to commit murder. The prosecution was led by [[Henry Gage|Henry T. Gage]], former [[governor of California]]. Griffith was defended by attorney [[Earl Rogers]], whose cross-examination of the veiled Mrs. Griffith revealed that her husband\u2014generally thought to be a [[teetotaler]]\u2014was in fact a secret [[alcoholism|drunk]] who was subject to [[paranoia|paranoid]] delusions. Griffith was convicted of a lesser charge, assault with a deadly weapon.

The offer was accepted by the City Council, but members of the Park Commission objected and instituted a court action to block the donation. Griffith left the offer in his will. He died of liver disease on July 6, 1919.

After amassing a significant fortune from a [[mining|mining syndicate]] in the 1880s, Griffith donated {{convert|3015|acre|km2}} to the [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]] which became [[Griffith Park]], and he bequeathed the money to build the park's [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] and [[Griffith Observatory]]. Griffith's legacy was marred by his notorious shooting of his wife in 1903, a crime for which he served two years in prison.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Career and philanthropy===\n[[File:GriffithJGriffithStatue01.JPG|240px|thumb|Bronze statue of Griffith J.

Griffith became mining correspondent for the ''Alta California'', a San Francisco newspaper. As a reporter he gained extensive knowledge of the mining industry on the Pacific Coast and in Nevada, which led to his employment by various mining syndicates. As a mining expert, Griffith acquired a fortune.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8751943/The-Britons-who-made-their-mark-on-LA.html|title=The Britons who made their mark on LA|date=2011-09-11|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nIn 1882 Griffith moved to Los Angeles and purchased approximately {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of the [[Rancho Los Feliz]] Mexican land grant. On December 16, 1896, Griffith and his wife Christina presented {{convert|3015|acre|km2}} of the Rancho Los Feliz to the city of Los Angeles for use as a public park. Griffith called it \"a Christmas present.\" After accepting the donation, the city passed an ordinance to name the property Griffith Park, in honor of the donor.<ref>\"Death Claims G. J. Griffith,\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 7, 1919</ref>\n\n\"It must be made a place of rest and relaxation for the masses, a resort for the rank and file, for the plain people,\" Griffith told the Los Angeles City Council when he donated the land. \"I consider it my obligation to make Los Angeles a happy, cleaner, and finer city.

The shot did not kill her, but she was left disfigured and lost her right eye. Griffith was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to commit murder. The prosecution was led by [[Henry Gage|Henry T. Gage]], former [[governor of California]]. Griffith was defended by attorney [[Earl Rogers]], whose cross-examination of the veiled Mrs. Griffith revealed that her husband\u2014generally thought to be a [[teetotaler]]\u2014was in fact a secret [[alcoholism|drunk]] who was subject to [[paranoia|paranoid]] delusions. Griffith was convicted of a lesser charge, assault with a deadly weapon. The judge sentenced him to two years in [[San Quentin State Prison]], instructing that he be given \"medical aid for his condition of alcoholic insanity\".<ref>[[Adela Rogers St. Johns|St. Johns, Adela Rogers]], ''Final Verdict''. Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1962, pp. 220\u2013239. \"That was where Earl Rogers began the first alcoholic [[insanity defense]],\" St. Johns wrote. \"Perhaps the first\u2014certainly one of the first\u2014times that alcohol was called to account in an American courtroom as a disease, a [[mental illness]], not just a sin or a crime or an indulgence\". (''Final Verdict'', p. 232.)</ref>\n\nOn November 4, 1904, while he was in prison, Mrs. Griffith was granted a divorce on the grounds of cruelty, and she was awarded custody of their 16-year-old son Vandell. The court also stated that G. J. Griffith would pay for his son's education at [[Stanford University]]. The decree was made in the record time of four and a half minutes.<ref>\"Mrs. Griffith Gets Divorce,\" ''Los Angeles Times'', November 5, 1904</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nG. J. Griffith was released from prison December 3, 1906, after serving nearly two years. His conduct at the penitentiary was called exemplary. Griffith returned to Los Angeles and began lecturing on prison reform.<ref>\"Griffith is Freed Today,\" ''Los Angeles Times'', December 3, 1906; \"Griffith to Lecture: Gone to San Francisco to Advocate Prison Reform Along Elmira Institution Lines,\" ''Los Angeles Times'', January 26, 1908</ref>\n\nIn December 1912 Griffith offered a second \"Christmas present\" to Los Angeles, in the form of a Greek Theater and a Hall of Science to be built at his expense in Griffith Park. The offer was accepted by the City Council, but members of the Park Commission objected and instituted a court action to block the donation. Griffith left the offer in his will. He died of liver disease on July 6, 1919. The bulk of his $1.5 million estate was bequeathed to the city for the building of the [[Greek Theater (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] (1929) and [[Griffith Observatory]] (1935).<ref>\"Death Claims G.

However, once 4Kids realized ''One Piece'' was not appropriate for their intended demographic, the company decided to edit it into a more child-oriented series until they had an opportunity to legally drop the license.

However, once 4Kids realized ''One Piece'' was not appropriate for their intended demographic, the company decided to edit it into a more child-oriented series until they had an opportunity to legally drop the license.

As a result, the meaning of the term \"lawyer\" may vary from place to place. Some jurisdictions have two types of lawyers, [[barrister]] and [[Solicitor|solicitors]], whilst others fuse the two. A barrister is a lawyer who specializes in higher court appearances. A solicitor is a lawyer who is trained to prepare cases and give advice on legal subjects and can represent people in lower courts. Both barristers and solicitors have gone through law school, completed the requisite practical training. However, in jurisdictions where there is a split-profession, only barristers are admitted as members of their respective bar association.\n\n* In [[Australia]], the word \"lawyer\" can be used to refer to both [[barrister]]s and [[solicitor]]s (whether in private practice or practicing as corporate in-house counsel), and whoever is admitted as a lawyer of the Supreme Court of a state or territory.\n* In Canada, the word \"lawyer\" only refers to individuals who have been [[called to the bar]] or, in [[Quebec]], have qualified as civil law notaries. Common [[law]] lawyers in Canada are formally and properly called \"barristers and solicitors\", but should not be referred to as \"attorneys\", since that term has a different meaning in Canadian usage, being a person appointed under a [[power of attorney]]. However, in Quebec, civil law advocates (or ''avocats'' in [[French language|French]]) often call themselves \"attorney\" and sometimes \"barrister and solicitor\" in English, and all lawyers in Quebec, or lawyers in the rest of Canada when practicing in French, are addressed with the [[honorific]] title, \"Me.\" or \"[[Ma\u00eetre]]\".\n* In [[England]] and Wales, \"lawyer\" is used to refer to persons who provide reserved  and unreserved legal activities and includes practitioners such as [[barrister]]s, [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s, [[solicitor]]s, registered foreign lawyers, patent attorneys, trade mark attorneys, licensed conveyancers, public notaries, commissioners for oaths, immigration advisers and claims management services. The  [[Legal Services Act 2007]] defines the ''\"legal activities\"'' that may only be performed by a person who is entitled to do so pursuant to the Act. 'Lawyer' is not a protected title.\n* In Pakistan, the term \"Advocate\" is used instead of lawyer in '''The Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973.'''\n*In [[India]], the term \"lawyer\" is often commonly used, but the official term is \"[[Advocate#Advocates in India|advocate]]\" as prescribed under the Advocates Act, 1961.<ref>[http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf Advocates Act, 1961] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |date=2008-08-19 }}, s. 2.</ref>\n* In Scotland, the word \"lawyer\" refers to a more specific group of legally trained people. It specifically includes [[Advocate#Advocates in Scotland|advocates]] and [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitors]]. In a generic sense, it may also include judges and law-trained support staff.\n* In the United States, the term generally refers to [[Attorneys in the United States|attorneys]] who may [[Practice of law|practice law]]. It is never used to refer to [[patent agent]]s<ref>Carl W. Battle, ''The Patent Guide: A Friendly Guide to Protecting and Profiting from Patents'' (New York: Allworth Press, 1997), 49.</ref> or [[paralegal]]s.<ref>David G. Cooper and Michael J.

Abel, ''The Legal Profession in England and Wales'' ([[London]]: [[Basil Blackwell]], 1989), 116.</ref> In countries like the United States, that have fused legal professions, there are trial lawyers who specialize in trying cases in court, but trial lawyers do not have a [[legal monopoly]] like barristers. In some countries, litigants have the option of arguing ''[[pro se]]'', or on their own behalf. It is common for litigants to appear unrepresented before certain courts like [[small claims court]]s; indeed, many such courts do not allow lawyers to speak for their clients, in an effort to save money for all participants in a small case.<ref>See, e.g., [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/ccp/116.510-116.570.html Cal.

Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 380\u2013399 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 387.</ref> The advantage of the latter regime is that lawyers are familiar with the court's customs and procedures, and make the legal system more efficient for all involved. Unrepresented parties often damage their own credibility or slow the court down as a result of their inexperience.<ref>Gordon Kent, \"Lawyerless Litigants: Is Justice Being Served?\" ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', 27 January 2002, A1.</ref><ref>Alan Feuer, \"Lawyering by Laymen: More Litigants Are Taking a Do-It-Yourself Tack,\" ''[[The New York Times]]'', 22 January 2001, B1.</ref>\n\n===Research and drafting of court papers===\nOften, lawyers brief a court in writing on the issues in a case before the issues can be orally argued. They may have to perform extensive research into relevant facts. Also, they are drafting legal papers and preparing for an oral argument.\n\nIn England, the usual division of labor is that a [[solicitor]] will obtain the facts of the case from the client and then brief a barrister (usually in writing).<ref>Fiona Boyle, Deveral Capps, Philip Plowden, Clare Sandford, ''A Practical Guide to Lawyering Skills'', 3rd ed. (London: Cavendish Publishing, 2005), 47\u201350.</ref> The barrister then researches and drafts the necessary court pleadings (which will be filed and served by the solicitor) and orally argues the case.<ref>See Abel, ''England and Wales'', 56 and 141.</ref>\n\nIn Spain, the procurator merely signs and presents the papers to the court, but it is the advocate who drafts the papers and argues the case.<ref>Jene, 369.</ref>\n\nIn some countries, like Japan, a [[scrivener]] or clerk may fill out court forms and draft simple papers for lay persons who cannot afford or do not need attorneys, and advise them on how to manage and argue their own cases.<ref name=\"Rokumoto, 164\">Rokumoto, 164.</ref>\n\n===Advocacy (written and oral) in administrative hearings===\nIn most developed countries, the legislature has granted [[original jurisdiction]] over highly technical matters to [[executive branch]] administrative agencies which oversee such things. As a result, some lawyers have become specialists in [[administrative law]]. In a few countries, there is a special category of jurists with a monopoly over this form of advocacy; for example, France formerly had ''conseils juridiques'' (who were merged into the main legal profession in 1991).<ref>Anne Boigeol, \"The French Bar: The Difficulties of Unifying a Divided Profession,\" in ''Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World'', vol. 2, eds.

National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors'', {{ussc|473|305|1985}} (same).</ref>\n\n===Client intake and counseling (with regard to pending litigation)===\nAn important aspect of a lawyer's job is developing and managing relationships with clients (or the client's employees, if the lawyer works in-house for a government or corporation). The client-lawyer relationship is explained in six steps. First, the relationship begins with an intake interview where the lawyer gets to know the client personally. Second step is discovering the facts of the client's case. Thirdly is clarifying what the client wants to accomplish.  The fourth step is where the lawyer shapes the client's expectations as to what actually can be accomplished. The second to last step, begins to develop various claims or defenses for the client. Lastly, the lawyer explains her or his fees to the client.<ref>Paul J. Zwier & Anthony J.

The vast majority of law firms worldwide are [[small business]]es that range in size from 1 to 10 lawyers.<ref>Hazard, 39.</ref> The United States, with its large number of firms with more than 50 lawyers, is an exception.<ref>Junqueira, 92. According to this source, as of 2003, there were 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers in the United States.</ref> The United Kingdom and Australia are also exceptions, as the UK, Australia and the U.S. are now home to several firms with more than 1,000 lawyers after a wave of mergers in the late 1990s.\n\nNotably, [[barrister]]s in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some states in Australia do ''not'' work in \"law firms\". Those who offer their services to members of the general public\u2014as opposed to those working \"in-house\" \u2014 are required to be self-employed.<ref>Gary Slapper and David Kelly, ''The English Legal System'', 7th ed. (London: Cavendish Publishing Ltd., 2004), 550.</ref> Most work in groupings known as \"sets\" or \"chambers\", where some administrative and marketing costs are shared. An important effect of this different organizational structure is that there is no [[conflict of interest]] where barristers in the same chambers work for opposing sides in a case, and in some specialized chambers this is commonplace.\n\n==Professional associations and regulation==\n[[File:American Bar Association 3c 1953 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the [[American Bar Association]].]]\n\n===Mandatory licensing and membership in professional organizations===\nIn some jurisdictions, either the judiciary<ref>Weisbrot, 264.</ref> or the Ministry of Justice<ref name=\"Johnsen, 86\">Johnsen, 86.</ref> directly supervises the admission, licensing, and regulation of lawyers.\n\nOther jurisdictions, by statute, tradition, or court order, have granted such powers to a professional association which all lawyers must belong to.<ref>Boigeol, \u201cThe French Bar,\u201d 271; Merryman, 106, and Junqueira, 89.</ref> In the U.S., such associations are known as mandatory, integrated, or unified [[bar association]]s.

Generally, a nonmember caught practicing law may be liable for the crime of [[unauthorized practice of law]].<ref>Arthurs, 143.</ref>\n\nIn common law countries with divided legal professions, barristers traditionally belong to the bar council (or an Inn of Court) and solicitors belong to the law society. In the English-speaking world, the largest mandatory professional association of lawyers is the [[State Bar of California]], with 230,000 members.\n\nSome countries admit and regulate lawyers at the national level, so that a lawyer, once licensed, can argue cases in any court in the land. This is common in small countries like New Zealand, Japan, and Belgium.<ref>Murray, 339; Rokumoto, 163; and Schuyt, 207.</ref> Others, especially those with federal governments, tend to regulate lawyers at the state or provincial level; this is the case in the United States,<ref>Abel, ''American Lawyers'', 116.</ref> Canada,<ref>Arthurs, 139.</ref> Australia,<ref>Weisbrot, 244.</ref> and Switzerland,<ref>Bastard, 299.</ref> to name a few. Brazil is the most well-known federal government that regulates lawyers at the national level.<ref>Falc\u00e3o, 404.</ref>\n\nSome countries, like Italy, regulate lawyers at the regional level,<ref>Olgiati, 343.</ref> and a few, like Belgium, even regulate them at the local level (that is, they are licensed and regulated by the local equivalent of bar associations but can advocate in courts nationwide).<ref>Huyse, 239.</ref> In Germany, lawyers are admitted to regional bars and may appear for clients before all courts nationwide with the exception of the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'' or BGH); oddly, securing admission to the BGH's bar limits a lawyer's practice solely to the supreme federal courts and the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]].<ref>Howard D. Fisher, ''The German Legal System and Legal Language'', 3rd ed. (London: Routledge Cavendish, 2002), 208\u2013209.</ref>\n\nGenerally, geographic limitations can be troublesome for a lawyer who discovers that his client's cause requires him to litigate in a court beyond the normal geographic scope of his license. Although most courts have special ''[[pro hac vice]]'' rules for such occasions, the lawyer will still have to deal with a different set of [[professional responsibility]] rules, as well as the possibility of other differences in substantive and procedural law.\n\nSome countries grant licenses to non-resident lawyers, who may then appear regularly on behalf of foreign clients. Others require all lawyers to live in the jurisdiction or to even hold national citizenship as a prerequisite for receiving a license to practice.

However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a \"friend\" for assistance.<ref>Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.</ref> However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.<ref>Bonner, 204.</ref> Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.<ref>Bonner, 206.</ref> They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession\u2014with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance\u2014like their modern counterparts.<ref>Bonner, 208\u2013209.</ref> Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].<ref>Hazard, 18.</ref>\n\n===Ancient Rome===\nA law enacted in 204 BC barred Roman advocates from taking fees, but the law was widely ignored.<ref>[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.</ref> The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly\u2014but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].<ref>Crook, 90.

In 1231, two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop's courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the [[papal legate]] in London in 1237.<ref>Brundage, 188.</ref> During the same decade, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the king of the [[Kingdom of Sicily (Medieval and Early Modern)|Kingdom of Sicily]], imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.<ref>Brundage, 188\u2013189.</ref> By 1250, the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.<ref>Brundage, 190.</ref> The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1275 that ''all'' ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.<ref name=\"Brundage, 189\">Brundage, 189.</ref> Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Brundage, 189\"/> The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of [[Deception|deceit]],<ref>[[Statute of Westminster 1275]], ch. 29.</ref> and in 1280 the mayor's court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.<ref>John Hamilton Baker, ''An Introduction to British Legal History'', 3rd ed.

As a result, the meaning of the term \"lawyer\" may vary from place to place. Some jurisdictions have two types of lawyers, [[barrister]] and [[Solicitor|solicitors]], whilst others fuse the two. A barrister is a lawyer who specializes in higher court appearances. A solicitor is a lawyer who is trained to prepare cases and give advice on legal subjects and can represent people in lower courts. Both barristers and solicitors have gone through law school, completed the requisite practical training. However, in jurisdictions where there is a split-profession, only barristers are admitted as members of their respective bar association.\n\n* In [[Australia]], the word \"lawyer\" can be used to refer to both [[barrister]]s and [[solicitor]]s (whether in private practice or practicing as corporate in-house counsel), and whoever is admitted as a lawyer of the Supreme Court of a state or territory.\n* In Canada, the word \"lawyer\" only refers to individuals who have been [[called to the bar]] or, in [[Quebec]], have qualified as civil law notaries. Common [[law]] lawyers in Canada are formally and properly called \"barristers and solicitors\", but should not be referred to as \"attorneys\", since that term has a different meaning in Canadian usage, being a person appointed under a [[power of attorney]]. However, in Quebec, civil law advocates (or ''avocats'' in [[French language|French]]) often call themselves \"attorney\" and sometimes \"barrister and solicitor\" in English, and all lawyers in Quebec, or lawyers in the rest of Canada when practicing in French, are addressed with the [[honorific]] title, \"Me.\" or \"[[Ma\u00eetre]]\".\n* In [[England]] and Wales, \"lawyer\" is used to refer to persons who provide reserved  and unreserved legal activities and includes practitioners such as [[barrister]]s, [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s, [[solicitor]]s, registered foreign lawyers, patent attorneys, trade mark attorneys, licensed conveyancers, public notaries, commissioners for oaths, immigration advisers and claims management services. The  [[Legal Services Act 2007]] defines the ''\"legal activities\"'' that may only be performed by a person who is entitled to do so pursuant to the Act. 'Lawyer' is not a protected title.\n* In Pakistan, the term \"Advocate\" is used instead of lawyer in '''The Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973.'''\n*In [[India]], the term \"lawyer\" is often commonly used, but the official term is \"[[Advocate#Advocates in India|advocate]]\" as prescribed under the Advocates Act, 1961.<ref>[http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf Advocates Act, 1961] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |date=2008-08-19 }}, s. 2.</ref>\n* In Scotland, the word \"lawyer\" refers to a more specific group of legally trained people. It specifically includes [[Advocate#Advocates in Scotland|advocates]] and [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitors]]. In a generic sense, it may also include judges and law-trained support staff.\n* In the United States, the term generally refers to [[Attorneys in the United States|attorneys]] who may [[Practice of law|practice law]].

As a result, some lawyers have become specialists in [[administrative law]]. In a few countries, there is a special category of jurists with a monopoly over this form of advocacy; for example, France formerly had ''conseils juridiques'' (who were merged into the main legal profession in 1991).<ref>Anne Boigeol, \"The French Bar: The Difficulties of Unifying a Divided Profession,\" in ''Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World'', vol. 2, eds.

The client-lawyer relationship is explained in six steps. First, the relationship begins with an intake interview where the lawyer gets to know the client personally. Second step is discovering the facts of the client's case. Thirdly is clarifying what the client wants to accomplish.  The fourth step is where the lawyer shapes the client's expectations as to what actually can be accomplished. The second to last step, begins to develop various claims or defenses for the client. Lastly, the lawyer explains her or his fees to the client.<ref>Paul J. Zwier & Anthony J.

The vast majority of law firms worldwide are [[small business]]es that range in size from 1 to 10 lawyers.<ref>Hazard, 39.</ref> The United States, with its large number of firms with more than 50 lawyers, is an exception.<ref>Junqueira, 92. According to this source, as of 2003, there were 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers in the United States.</ref> The United Kingdom and Australia are also exceptions, as the UK, Australia and the U.S. are now home to several firms with more than 1,000 lawyers after a wave of mergers in the late 1990s.\n\nNotably, [[barrister]]s in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some states in Australia do ''not'' work in \"law firms\". Those who offer their services to members of the general public\u2014as opposed to those working \"in-house\" \u2014 are required to be self-employed.<ref>Gary Slapper and David Kelly, ''The English Legal System'', 7th ed. (London: Cavendish Publishing Ltd., 2004), 550.</ref> Most work in groupings known as \"sets\" or \"chambers\", where some administrative and marketing costs are shared. An important effect of this different organizational structure is that there is no [[conflict of interest]] where barristers in the same chambers work for opposing sides in a case, and in some specialized chambers this is commonplace.\n\n==Professional associations and regulation==\n[[File:American Bar Association 3c 1953 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the [[American Bar Association]].]]\n\n===Mandatory licensing and membership in professional organizations===\nIn some jurisdictions, either the judiciary<ref>Weisbrot, 264.</ref> or the Ministry of Justice<ref name=\"Johnsen, 86\">Johnsen, 86.</ref> directly supervises the admission, licensing, and regulation of lawyers.\n\nOther jurisdictions, by statute, tradition, or court order, have granted such powers to a professional association which all lawyers must belong to.<ref>Boigeol, \u201cThe French Bar,\u201d 271; Merryman, 106, and Junqueira, 89.</ref> In the U.S., such associations are known as mandatory, integrated, or unified [[bar association]]s.

Generally, a nonmember caught practicing law may be liable for the crime of [[unauthorized practice of law]].<ref>Arthurs, 143.</ref>\n\nIn common law countries with divided legal professions, barristers traditionally belong to the bar council (or an Inn of Court) and solicitors belong to the law society. In the English-speaking world, the largest mandatory professional association of lawyers is the [[State Bar of California]], with 230,000 members.\n\nSome countries admit and regulate lawyers at the national level, so that a lawyer, once licensed, can argue cases in any court in the land. This is common in small countries like New Zealand, Japan, and Belgium.<ref>Murray, 339; Rokumoto, 163; and Schuyt, 207.</ref> Others, especially those with federal governments, tend to regulate lawyers at the state or provincial level; this is the case in the United States,<ref>Abel, ''American Lawyers'', 116.</ref> Canada,<ref>Arthurs, 139.</ref> Australia,<ref>Weisbrot, 244.</ref> and Switzerland,<ref>Bastard, 299.</ref> to name a few. Brazil is the most well-known federal government that regulates lawyers at the national level.<ref>Falc\u00e3o, 404.</ref>\n\nSome countries, like Italy, regulate lawyers at the regional level,<ref>Olgiati, 343.</ref> and a few, like Belgium, even regulate them at the local level (that is, they are licensed and regulated by the local equivalent of bar associations but can advocate in courts nationwide).<ref>Huyse, 239.</ref> In Germany, lawyers are admitted to regional bars and may appear for clients before all courts nationwide with the exception of the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'' or BGH); oddly, securing admission to the BGH's bar limits a lawyer's practice solely to the supreme federal courts and the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]].<ref>Howard D. Fisher, ''The German Legal System and Legal Language'', 3rd ed. (London: Routledge Cavendish, 2002), 208\u2013209.</ref>\n\nGenerally, geographic limitations can be troublesome for a lawyer who discovers that his client's cause requires him to litigate in a court beyond the normal geographic scope of his license. Although most courts have special ''[[pro hac vice]]'' rules for such occasions, the lawyer will still have to deal with a different set of [[professional responsibility]] rules, as well as the possibility of other differences in substantive and procedural law.\n\nSome countries grant licenses to non-resident lawyers, who may then appear regularly on behalf of foreign clients. Others require all lawyers to live in the jurisdiction or to even hold national citizenship as a prerequisite for receiving a license to practice. But the trend in industrialized countries since the 1970s has been to abolish citizenship and residency restrictions. For example, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] struck down a citizenship requirement on equality rights grounds in 1989,<ref>''[[Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia]]'' [1989] 1 SCR 143.</ref> and similarly, American citizenship and residency requirements were struck down as unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1973 and 1985, respectively.<ref>Abel, ''American Lawyers'', 68.</ref> The [[European Court of Justice]] made similar decisions in 1974 and 1977 striking down citizenship restrictions in Belgium and France.<ref>Mary C.

However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a \"friend\" for assistance.<ref>Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.</ref> However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.<ref>Bonner, 204.</ref> Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.<ref>Bonner, 206.</ref> They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession\u2014with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance\u2014like their modern counterparts.<ref>Bonner, 208\u2013209.</ref> Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].<ref>Hazard, 18.</ref>\n\n===Ancient Rome===\nA law enacted in 204 BC barred Roman advocates from taking fees, but the law was widely ignored.<ref>[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.</ref> The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly\u2014but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].<ref>Crook, 90.

The City of Henrico, which included the settlement of [[Henricus]], was the furthest incorporation upstream on the James River.  In 1634, Henrico was reorganized under royal authority as the shire of Henrico, one of eight shires in the [[Colony_of_Virginia#Crown_colony_(1624\u20131652)|Crown Colony of Virginia]], Later, it became known as [[Henrico County, Virginia]].\n\n==History==\nThe City of Henrico was formed in 1618 when the [[Virginia Company]], the proprietor of the [[Virginia Colony|colony of Virginia]] provided instructions to Governor [[George Yeardley]] for the reorganization of the colony's government<ref name=Kingsbury1933v3/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/recordsofvirgini03virg/page/98 98}} }}. These instructions provided for the incorporation of most of the plantations and developments of Virginia into four boroughs or cities that extended across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], the main conduit of transportation of the era. These incorporations were called [[James City (Virginia Company)|James City]], [[Charles City (Virginia Company)|Charles City]], [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Kiccowtan]]\n{{notetag|Kiccowtan, whose modern spelling is Kecoughtan, was renamed Elizabeth City in 1620<ref name=Kingsbury1933v3/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/recordsofvirgini03virg/page/276 276}} }} by the Virginia Company in response the [[Virginia General Assembly#History|legislative assembly in Virginia's]] petition to change Kiccowtan's \"savage\" name <ref name=Kingsbury1933v3/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/recordsofvirgini03virg/page/161 161}} }} }}\nand Henrico. The seat of the colony's government was in Virginia's only major town, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in James City. \n\nThe City of Henrico's major settlement was the fortified town of [[Henricus]], which was founded by Sir [[Thomas Dale]] on what is now known as [[Farrar's Island]],<ref name=Surface1907/> near the location of the [[Dutch Gap Canal]] today. Henrico had been founded to potentially replace Jamestown as a more healthier and militarily more secure seat of the colony's government.  By 1612, [[Alexander Whitaker]], the \"apostle to Virginia\" and the man who married [[John Rolfe]] and [[Pocahontas]] became Henricus's first minister<ref name=Porter1957/> the Surrounding lands were designated for the first English college in North America,<ref name=Chandler&Thames1907/>. and the [[Falling Creek Ironworks]], the first iron production facility in North America,<ref name=Bezis-Selfa2003/> were founded there.\n\nHowever, by the time the City of Henrico was incorporated in 1619, the town of Henricus was already in a state of dilapidation.<ref name=Tyler1906/> The town, the ironworks, and the plan for a college was abandoned after the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]].<ref name=Cave2013/> Initially, the attack had an adverse effect on Henrico's settlement: 1624, 29 people as living in Henrico, all on the former college lands<ref name=Hotten1874Living&Dead/> and in 1625, 22 people were listed as living there.<ref name=Hotten1874Muster/>.

The station is owned by the [[Fox Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[Fox Corporation]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Tacoma-licensed [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] station [[KCPQ]] (channel 13). The two stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle's [[Westlake, Seattle|Westlake]] neighborhood; KZJO's transmitter is located near the [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] section of Seattle. There is no separate website for KZJO; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station KCPQ.\n\nThe station operates two UHF [[Broadcast relay station#Translator stations|translators]], and KZJO rebroadcasts KCPQ's programming on its second [[digital subchannel]] in [[widescreen]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] to provide that station to areas in the eastern portion of the Seattle market that receive weak signal coverage from KCPQ's [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]] transmitter.\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasting as '''KTZZ-TV''' on June 22, 1985, owned by Alden Television, Inc. The call letters stood for '''T'''elevision '''22''', the '''Z'''s closely resembling numeral '''2'''s. At the time the station signed on, it was the first new TV station to sign on in the Seattle area since [[KIRO-TV]] went on the air in 1958, and there was a hole in the Seattle market for [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and [[sitcom]]s. While [[KSTW]] (channel 11) was running such programming, KCPQ counter-programmed with more adult fare like [[drama (film and television)|dramas]], [[game show]]s, and [[feature film|movies]]. As such, KTZZ signed on with a lineup of classic off-network sitcoms, [[Western (genre)|westerns]], cartoons, movies, and dramas. Originally, to keep people from changing channels, the station broadcast only its [[station identification]]\u2014no commercials\u2014between the [[closing credits]] of one show and the opening credits of the next show. One [[Christmas]] season, as snow fell in the [[Puget Sound]] area, viewers were treated to a gag in which someone pretending to be a [[janitor]] ([[Vern Fonk|Rob Thielke]]) takes control of the station for a few moments to deliver \"the news\" which was mostly a fake weather forecast which began \"The weather outside is frightful. But inside it's quite delightful. As long as I've got no place to go, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.\"\n\nKTZZ began with a very promising start, airing fairly strong syndicated shows, and was initially profitable under Alden ownership. However, in 1989, the station was sold to Dudley Broadcasting. By that time, KCPQ and KSTW had strong lineups, including much of the children's programming available, but KTZZ was losing ground and unable to acquire strong off-network syndicated shows. With KCPQ now in the kids business, the best cartoons were now airing on KSTW and KCPQ, leaving KTZZ with leftovers (which still was about five hours worth of cartoons a day). KTZZ was also the home, for several years, of the eclectic Seattle [[talk show]] ''[[The Spud Goodman Show]]''. Producing the weekly interview/music/feature show was an ambitious undertaking for a small station, and the program relied heavily on a large staff of volunteers. The programming costs became too high for KTZZ. As a result, KTZZ began airing [[CBS]] shows preempted by [[KIRO-TV]] (channel 7), along with paid programming and brokered shows. It still ran some conventional syndicated products, but they were essentially programs that no other stations in the market wanted.\n\nOn January 11, 1995, KTZZ affiliated with the newly-formed [[The WB|Warner Brothers television network]].<ref name=tst-ktzzwb>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=KTZZ To Join New WB Television Network|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950104&slug=2097765|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=January 4, 1995}}</ref> The WB had initially signed KSTW in 1993 as its Seattle affiliate;<ref name=tst-kstwwb>{{cite news|title=KSTW-TV Will Join New WB Network|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931104&slug=1729799|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=November 4, 1993}}</ref> however, that station's owner, [[Ryman Hospitality Properties|Gaylord Broadcasting]], backed out of the deal a year later to affiliate with CBS, only to become a UPN station in 1997.<ref name=tst-kstwnowb>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=CBS Dropping KIRO-TV, May Pick Up KSTW \u2013 Industrywide Shake-Up Finally Hits Seattle Area|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940913&slug=1930463|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=September 13, 1994}}</ref> KTZZ picked up syndicated cartoons formerly on KSTW in 1995, added more off-network sitcoms and moved away from the [[brokered programming|brokered show]] format. As it began airing programming from The WB, KTZZ was helped in part by the fact that KCPQ was moving towards news and more first-run syndicated talk, [[court show|courtroom]], and drama shows.\n\nDudley Communications sold KTZZ, along with sister station [[WXMI]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], to [[Emmis Communications]] in 1998; the two stations were then promptly dealt to [[Tribune Broadcasting]] in exchange for [[WFAN-FM|WQCD]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=psbj-saletotribune>{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Nancy J|title=Nordstrom eyes first national brand campaign|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/1998/01/12/newscolumn1.html?page=all|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]]|date=January 11, 1998}}</ref> Tribune changed the station's call letters to '''KTWB-TV''' ('''T'''he '''W'''arner '''B'''rothers Network) on April 26, 1999. After Tribune acquired KCPQ in early 1999, KTWB's license was transferred to a trustee in the short-term until the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s approval of television [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopolies]] later that year, though Tribune managed and operated the station during this period via a [[local marketing agreement]]. In 2004, KTWB revised its on-air brand from ''WB 22'' to ''Seattle's WB'' as part of a groupwide branding effort.\n\n===MyNetworkTV affiliation===\n[[File:KMYQ-TV.png|thumb|left|Logo as \"myQ\u00b2\", used from 2006 to 2010.]]\nOn January 24, 2006, [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] announced that the company would merge the operations of The WB with [[CBS Corporation]]'s [[UPN]] (which CBS acquired one month earlier in December 2005 following its [[Viacom (original)#2005 split|split]] from [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]), to form a joint venture called [[The CW|The CW Television Network]].<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/ 'Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September], [[CNNMoney.com]], January 24, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 2006.</ref> The network signed a ten-year affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting for 13 of the 16 WB affiliates that the company owned at the time.<ref>[http://corporate.tribune.com/pressroom/?p=574 Tribune TV Stations to Lead Affiliate Group of New Network] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20121216131255/http://corporate.tribune.com/pressroom/?p=574 |date=December 16, 2012 }}, Tribune Company corporate website, January 24, 2006.</ref> KTWB was one of the three Tribune stations passed over for an affiliation as CBS-owned UPN affiliate KSTW (which was included in 11 of 14 CBS-owned UPN affiliates) was chosen as The CW's Seattle-Tacoma charter station.

On March 31, 2008, KMYQ became just the second MyNetworkTV affiliate in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] to utilize an early primetime schedule from 7\u20139 p.m. (the first was [[KQCA]]/[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which has since moved MyNetworkTV programming back to its recommended 8\u201310 p.m. timeslot). By 2009, MyNetworkTV converted from a full-fledged network to a programming service.\n\nOn September 13, 2010, the station moved its MyNetworkTV programming to 11&nbsp;pm.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150926105337/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=10769&channel=10]</ref> KMYQ changed its call letters to '''KZJO''' and as part of a company-wide branding effort to play down network affiliations, rebranded as ''JOEtv'' that same day, casting the station in its branding as a neighborhood [[dive bar]] carrying 'blue collar' programming (including its website being called \"Joe's Wall\" and being designed to look like a 'bar bathroom', with appropriate [[graffiti]] advertising the station's offerings). Currently the branding remains, though outside the logo, it is now promoted more traditionally, after the last of the [[Sam Zell]] ownership group which forced the rebrandings was removed from Tribune Media. On September 19, 2011, the station moved MyNetworkTV programming yet again, this time, back one hour to 12 a.m. As of the 2015-16 season it airs even later, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. and is rarely promoted on air, if at all, to the point that the station's website does not mention the affiliation (for several years, the site's 'about us' copy erroneously said it ended the affiliation in 2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201185329/http://q13fox.com/joetv/|title=Archive of KZJO's website|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Aborted sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group===\nOn May 8, 2017, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]\u2014which has owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KOMO-TV]] (channel 4) and [[Univision]] affiliate [[KUNS-TV]] (channel 51) since its 2013 merger with Seattle-based [[Fisher Communications]]\u2014entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune.

The station is owned by the [[Fox Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[Fox Corporation]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Tacoma-licensed [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] station [[KCPQ]] (channel 13). The two stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle's [[Westlake, Seattle|Westlake]] neighborhood; KZJO's transmitter is located near the [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] section of Seattle. There is no separate website for KZJO; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station KCPQ.\n\nThe station operates two UHF [[Broadcast relay station#Translator stations|translators]], and KZJO rebroadcasts KCPQ's programming on its second [[digital subchannel]] in [[widescreen]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] to provide that station to areas in the eastern portion of the Seattle market that receive weak signal coverage from KCPQ's [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]] transmitter.\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasting as '''KTZZ-TV''' on June 22, 1985, owned by Alden Television, Inc. The call letters stood for '''T'''elevision '''22''', the '''Z'''s closely resembling numeral '''2'''s. At the time the station signed on, it was the first new TV station to sign on in the Seattle area since [[KIRO-TV]] went on the air in 1958, and there was a hole in the Seattle market for [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and [[sitcom]]s. While [[KSTW]] (channel 11) was running such programming, KCPQ counter-programmed with more adult fare like [[drama (film and television)|dramas]], [[game show]]s, and [[feature film|movies]]. As such, KTZZ signed on with a lineup of classic off-network sitcoms, [[Western (genre)|westerns]], cartoons, movies, and dramas. Originally, to keep people from changing channels, the station broadcast only its [[station identification]]\u2014no commercials\u2014between the [[closing credits]] of one show and the opening credits of the next show. One [[Christmas]] season, as snow fell in the [[Puget Sound]] area, viewers were treated to a gag in which someone pretending to be a [[janitor]] ([[Vern Fonk|Rob Thielke]]) takes control of the station for a few moments to deliver \"the news\" which was mostly a fake weather forecast which began \"The weather outside is frightful. But inside it's quite delightful. As long as I've got no place to go, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.\"\n\nKTZZ began with a very promising start, airing fairly strong syndicated shows, and was initially profitable under Alden ownership. However, in 1989, the station was sold to Dudley Broadcasting. By that time, KCPQ and KSTW had strong lineups, including much of the children's programming available, but KTZZ was losing ground and unable to acquire strong off-network syndicated shows. With KCPQ now in the kids business, the best cartoons were now airing on KSTW and KCPQ, leaving KTZZ with leftovers (which still was about five hours worth of cartoons a day). KTZZ was also the home, for several years, of the eclectic Seattle [[talk show]] ''[[The Spud Goodman Show]]''. Producing the weekly interview/music/feature show was an ambitious undertaking for a small station, and the program relied heavily on a large staff of volunteers. The programming costs became too high for KTZZ. As a result, KTZZ began airing [[CBS]] shows preempted by [[KIRO-TV]] (channel 7), along with paid programming and brokered shows. It still ran some conventional syndicated products, but they were essentially programs that no other stations in the market wanted.\n\nOn January 11, 1995, KTZZ affiliated with the newly-formed [[The WB|Warner Brothers television network]].<ref name=tst-ktzzwb>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=KTZZ To Join New WB Television Network|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950104&slug=2097765|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=January 4, 1995}}</ref> The WB had initially signed KSTW in 1993 as its Seattle affiliate;<ref name=tst-kstwwb>{{cite news|title=KSTW-TV Will Join New WB Network|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931104&slug=1729799|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=November 4, 1993}}</ref> however, that station's owner, [[Ryman Hospitality Properties|Gaylord Broadcasting]], backed out of the deal a year later to affiliate with CBS, only to become a UPN station in 1997.<ref name=tst-kstwnowb>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=CBS Dropping KIRO-TV, May Pick Up KSTW \u2013 Industrywide Shake-Up Finally Hits Seattle Area|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940913&slug=1930463|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=September 13, 1994}}</ref> KTZZ picked up syndicated cartoons formerly on KSTW in 1995, added more off-network sitcoms and moved away from the [[brokered programming|brokered show]] format.

On March 31, 2008, KMYQ became just the second MyNetworkTV affiliate in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] to utilize an early primetime schedule from 7\u20139 p.m. (the first was [[KQCA]]/[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which has since moved MyNetworkTV programming back to its recommended 8\u201310 p.m. timeslot).

Currently the branding remains, though outside the logo, it is now promoted more traditionally, after the last of the [[Sam Zell]] ownership group which forced the rebrandings was removed from Tribune Media. On September 19, 2011, the station moved MyNetworkTV programming yet again, this time, back one hour to 12 a.m. As of the 2015-16 season it airs even later, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. and is rarely promoted on air, if at all, to the point that the station's website does not mention the affiliation (for several years, the site's 'about us' copy erroneously said it ended the affiliation in 2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201185329/http://q13fox.com/joetv/|title=Archive of KZJO's website|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Aborted sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group===\nOn May 8, 2017, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]\u2014which has owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KOMO-TV]] (channel 4) and [[Univision]] affiliate [[KUNS-TV]] (channel 51) since its 2013 merger with Seattle-based [[Fisher Communications]]\u2014entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune.
