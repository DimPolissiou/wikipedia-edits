Super-teams such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Midnight Sons]], and many Marvel superheroes live in this universe, including characters such as [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Captain America]], [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Ghost Rider]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Adam Warlock]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], the [[Moon Knight]], the [[Punisher]], [[Deadpool]] and numerous others. It also contains well-known supervillains such as [[Doctor Doom]], [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], [[Thanos]], [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], [[Green Goblin]], [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Red Skull]], [[Ultron]], [[Doctor Octopus]], the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]], [[MODOK]], [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], [[Apocalypse (Marvel Comics)|Apocalypse]], [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]], [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Dormammu]], [[Annihilus]] and [[Galactus]].\n\nThe Marvel Universe is further depicted as existing within a \"[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]\" consisting of thousands of separate universes, all of which are the creations of Marvel Comics and all of which are, in a sense, \"Marvel universes\". In this context, \"Marvel Universe\" is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], which is known as '''[[Earth-616]]''' or currently as '''Earth Prime'''.\n\n==History==\n\nThough the concept of a [[shared universe]] was not new or unique to [[comic book]]s in 1961, writer/editor [[Stan Lee]], together with several artists including [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters' growth and change. Headline characters in one title would make cameos or guest appearances in other books. Eventually, many of the leading heroes assembled into a team known as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  This was not the first time that Marvel's characters had interacted with one another&mdash;[[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]] had been rivals when Marvel was [[Timely Comics]] (Marvel Vault)&mdash; but it was the first time that the comic book publisher's characters seemed to share a world.<ref>''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]''. ''Marvel Comics'' #1</ref>  The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in [[New York City]]; by contrast, many [[DC Universe|DC heroes]] live in fictional cities. Care was taken to portray the city and the world as realistically as possible, with the presence of superhumans affecting the common citizens in various ways.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOver time, a few Marvel Comics writers lobbied Marvel editors to incorporate the idea of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Multiverse]] resembling [[DC multiverse|DC's parallel worlds]]; this plot device allows one to create several fictional universes which normally do not overlap. What happens on Earth in the main Marvel Universe would normally not affect what happens on a parallel Earth in another Marvel-created universe. However, writers would have the creative ability to write stories in which people from one such universe would visit this alternative universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 1982, Marvel published the miniseries ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]'', in which all of the major heroes in existence at the time were gathered together to deal with one threat.  This was Marvel's first miniseries.  Each issue contained biographical information on many major costumed characters; these biographies were a precursor to Marvel's series of reference material, ''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', which followed shortly on the heels of ''Contest of Champions''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Concepts==\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}\nThe Marvel Universe is strongly based on the real world. Earth in the Marvel Universe has all the features of the real one: same countries, same personalities (politicians, movie stars, etc.), same historical events (such as World War II), and so on; however, it also contains many other fictional elements: countries such as [[Wakanda]] and [[Latveria]] (very small nations) and organizations like the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and its enemies, [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] In 2009 Marvel officially described its world's geography in a two-part miniseries, the ''Marvel Atlas''.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.1787.Travel_The_World_With_The_Marvel_Atlas Travel \"The World With The Marvel Atlas\"]. Marvel.com News</ref><!-- We need a primary source for this!-->\n\nMost importantly, the Marvel Universe also incorporates examples of almost all major [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] concepts, with writers adding more continuously. Aliens, gods, magic, cosmic powers and extremely advanced human-developed technology all exist prominently in the Marvel Universe. (A universe incorporating ''all'' these types of fantastic elements is fairly rare; another example is the [[DC Universe]].)  Monsters also play a more prominent role with east Asian origins of magical incantation, outlandish sorcery and manifesting principle in the Marvel Universe. One such case is [[Fin Fang Foom]] arising from the ashes of tantric magic.  Thanks to these extra elements, Earth in the Marvel Universe is home to a large number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s, who have gained their powers by any of these means.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nComparatively, little time passes in the Marvel Universe compared to the real world, owing to the serial nature of storytelling, with the stories of certain issues picking up mere seconds after the conclusion of the previous one, while a whole month has passed by in \"real-time\". Marvel's major heroes were created in the 1960s, but the amount of time that has passed between then and now within the universe itself has (after a prolonged period of being identified as about 10 years in the mid-to-late 1990s) most recently been identified as 13 years.<ref>''The Thing'' #13 (July 2006); ''Civil War Battle Damage Report'' (March 2007)</ref> Consequently, the settings of some events which were contemporary when written have to be updated every few years to \"make sense\" in this [[floating timeline]]. Thus, the events of previous stories are considered to have happened within a certain number of years before the publishing date of the current issue. For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s high school graduation was published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #28 (September 1965), his college graduation in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #185 (October 1978), and his high school reunion in ''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #7 (December 2004). Because of the floating timeline, where stories refer to real-life historic events, these references are later ignored or rewritten to suit current sensibilities; for instance, the origin of [[Iron Man]] was changed in a 2004 storyline to refer to the [[War on Terror]] in [[Afghanistan]],<ref>'' Iron Man'' (vol. 4) #1 (November 2004)</ref> whereas the original Iron Man stories had referred to the [[Vietnam War]] in [[Vietnam]]; similarly, [[The Punisher]]'s backstory has also been changed as well.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] itself exists as a company within the Marvel Universe, and versions of people such as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] have appeared in some of the stories, whereas characters like Steve Rogers, ([[Captain America]]'s [[alter ego]]), have worked for Marvel.{{issue|date=September 2014}} The Marvel of this reality publishes comics that adapt the actual adventures of the superheroes (except for details not known to the public, like their secret identities); many of these are licensed with the permission of the heroes themselves, who customarily donate their share of profits to charity. Additionally, the [[DC Comics]] Universe is also said to exist in the Marvel Universe as one of the many alternative universes. The reverse may also be said concerning the DC Universe. This is one method of explaining the various crossover stories co-published by the two companies.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nPop culture characters such as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]] exist in the Marvel Universe. This is usually justified as a second-hand account of events as told to credited authors [[Bram Stoker]] and [[Mary Shelley]], although the general public continues to believe them to be fictional. [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan the Barbarian]], [[Red Sonja]], [[Kull (comics)|Kull the Conqueror]], and [[Solomon Kane (comics)|Solomon Kane]] also have real-life existences in the Marvel Universe. The [[Hyborian Era]] of Conan and Kull is considered part of Earth-616 pre-recorded history. However, they rarely encounter modern Marvel superhero characters.  This is most likely possible due to the uncertain legal status of Howard's works before 2006 when they became public domain. As of 2019, Conan the Barbarian, as well as Kull the Conqueror and Solomon Kane, have been firmly integrated, thanks to Marvel regaining the publishing rights to the characters. Other licensed works that have been incorporated into the Marvel Universe include [[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]], the [[Transformers (franchise)|Transformers]], the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (in the character of [[Machine Man]]), [[Rom the Space Knight|Rom the Spaceknight]], the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]], and the [[Shogun Warriors (comics)|Shogun Warriors]]. In most cases, such material is either restricted from use after the license expires or the characters redesigned or renamed to avoid copyright infringement.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Costumed superheroes and supervillains===\nWithin the fictional history of the Marvel Universe, the tradition of using costumed secret identities to fight or commit evil had long existed, but it came into prominence during the days of the American \"[[Wild West]]\" with heroes such as [[Phantom Rider|Carter Slade/the Phantom Rider]]. During the 20th century, the tradition was reinvigorated by [[Captain America|Steve Rogers/Captain America]] and the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] in the 1940s, who fought for the [[Allies of World War II]].\n\nMarvel's most prominent heroes were created during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in the 1960s to early 1970s, including [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker/Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark/Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Hulk|Bruce Banner/the Hulk]], [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock/Daredevil]],

(comics)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak Mandel-Azur/Karnak the Shatterer]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]]) and [[Red Guardian#Alexi Shostakov|Alexi Shostakov/the Red

Raccoon]], [[Punisher|Frank Castle/the Punisher]], [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector/the Moon Knight]], [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Barbara \"Bobbi\" Morde/Mockingbird]], the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] (composed of [[Ikaris]], [[Thena]], [[Ajak (comics)|Ajak]], [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Kingo]], [[Phastos]], [[Gilgamesh (comics)|Gilgamesh]] and [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]]), [[War Machine

[[Rogue (comics)|Anna Marie LeBeau/Rogue]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilation Lee/Jubilee]].\n\nSome of Marvel's more recent creations from the mid-to-late 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, such as [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson/Deadpool]], [[Gambit (comics)|Remy LeBeau/Gambit]], [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers/Cable]], [[Domino (comics)|Neena Thurman/Domino]], [[Blink (comics)|Clarice Fong/Blink]], the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], [[Yelena Belova]] (also known as the second Black Widow), the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the modern [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the modern [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] (based off [[The Defenders (miniseries)|the Netflix MCU version of the same name]]), [[X-23|Laura Kinney/X-23]] (a.k.a. the second Wolverine), [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]], the [[Dora Milaje]], [[Daisy Johnson]] (also known as Quake), [[Phil Coulson]], [[Melinda May]], [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier]], [[Maria Hill]], [[Miles Morales]] (the second Spider-Man of the Ultimate Marvel Universe), [[Hope Pym|Hope van Dyne]] (also known as the Red Queen and the second Wasp), [[Cassandra Lang]] (also known as Stature, Stinger, Ant-Girl and Giant-Girl), the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], [[Amadeus Cho]] (also known as the second Hulk), [[Kamala Khan]] (also known as the second Ms. Marvel), [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] (also known as the third Hawkeye), [[Moon Girl (Marvel Comics)|Lunaella Lafayette/Moon Girl]], [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]] (also known as the second Miss America), [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] (also known as the fourth Ghost Rider), [[Ironheart (character)|Riri Williams/Ironheart]] and [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] ([[Gwen Stacy]] of Earth-65) have become popular characters in their own right. Unlike the [[DC Universe]], few of Marvel's 1940s characters have risen to prominence in modern publications; [[Captain America]] is one exception, and to a lesser extent, his contemporary, [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], primarily because both of these characters were reintroduced to readers and the Marvel Universe during the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nProminent teams of superheroes include the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Inhumans]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[Howling Commandos]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the [[Midnight Sons]] and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. All these groups have varying lineups; the Avengers have included Marvel's major heroes as members at one time or another. The X-Men are a team of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] led by [[Professor X]] and include many of Marvel's most popular characters, such as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and others. The Fantastic Four are viewed as \"Marvel's First Family\" of superheroes, usually consisting of [[Mister Fantastic]], the [[Invisible Woman]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], as well as siblings [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards]]. The Defenders were an ad-hoc team usually brought together by [[Doctor Strange]] which has included the [[Hulk]], [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Silver Surfer]], while the most recent incarnation of the team consists of street-level New York City heroes [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. The Guardians of the Galaxy include Marvel's cosmic characters such as [[Star-Lord]], [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Groot]] and [[Rocket Raccoon]], but the team has also introduced other heroes into the roster such as [[Kitty Pryde]], the Silver Surfer, the Thing and [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]. The Inhumans are a royal family comprising of [[Black Bolt]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Crystal]], [[Gorgon]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], [[Karnak|Karnak the Shatterer]] and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]], who rule the city of Attilan. The Runaways are a group of teenagers and a dinosaur consisting of [[Alex Wilder]], [[Nico Minoru]], [[Karolina Dean]], [[Chase Stein]], [[Molly Hayes]], [[Gert Yorkes]] and [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] who rebel against their evil parents known as [[The Pride (comics)|the Pride]]. The Midnight Sons consist of supernatural heroes such as [[Blade (comics)|Blade the Vampire-Slayer]], the [[Ghost Rider]], [[Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Daemon Hellstrom|Hellstorm the Son of Satan]], the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]] and the [[Man-Thing]]. The Thunderbolts' original incarnation were supervillains disguised as superheroes consisting of [[Citizen V]] (a.k.a. [[Helmut Zemo]]), [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]] (a.k.a. the Beetle), [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] (a.k.a. Screaming Mimi), [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]] (a.k.a. Meteorite), [[Fixer (comics)#Paul Norbert Ebersol|Techno/the Ogre]] (a.k.a. the Fixer) and [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], while the current incarnation of the team is made up of reformed supervillains working for the government: [[Deadpool]], the [[Punisher]], the [[Red Hulk]], the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]]. Although teams of supervillains are few and far between, notable examples include the [[Masters of Evil]], the [[Emissaries of Evil]], the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], the [[Sinister Six]], the [[Frightful Four]], the [[Lethal Legion]], the [[Legion of the Unliving]], the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], the [[Annihilation Wave]], the [[Starforce]] and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]].\n\n===Origin of superhuman powers===\nMost of the superhumans in Marvel's Earth owe their powers to the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], cosmic entities who visited Earth millions of years ago and experimented on our [[prehistoric]] ancestors (a process they also carried out on several other planets). This resulted in the creation of two [[Hidden races (Marvel Comics)|hidden races]], the godlike [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] and the genetically unstable [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], in addition to giving some humans an \"x-factor\" in their genes, which sometimes activates naturally, resulting in sometimes superpowered, sometimes disfigured individuals called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s. Others require other factors (such as [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]]) for their powers to come forth. Depending on the genetic profile, individuals who are exposed to different chemicals or radiation will often suffer death or injury, while in others it will cause superhuman abilities to manifest. Except for [[psionic]] abilities, these powers are usually random; rarely do two people have the same set of powers. It is not clear why the Celestials did this, although it is known that they continue to observe humanity's evolution. A Marvel series titled ''[[Earth X]]'' explored one possible reason for this: that superhumans are meant to protect a Celestial embryo that grows inside Earth against any planetary threats and have done so for eons. An X-Men villain that is known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] claims to be a new direction in human evolution, as he is born with superpowers even though his genetic profile said he was an ordinary human being. The majority of the public is unaware of what may cause superhuman powers.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nOther possible origins for superhuman powers include [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] and/or [[Bionics|bionic]] implants. Some heroes and villains have no powers at all but depend instead on hand-to-hand combat training or advanced technological equipment. In the Marvel Universe, technology is considerably more advanced than in the real world; this is due to unique individuals of genius-level intelligence, such as Reed Richards ([[Mister Fantastic]]) of the Fantastic Four. However, most of the advanced devices (such as [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] and [[death ray]]s) are too expensive for the common citizen, and are usually in the hands of government organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D., or powerful criminal organizations like [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]. One major company producing these devices is Stark Industries, owned by Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), but there are others. Advanced technology has also been given to humans by hidden races, aliens, or [[time travel]]ers like [[Kang the Conqueror]], who is known to have influenced the [[robotics]] industry in the past.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn superhumans, the energy required for their superpowers either comes from within using their own body as a source or, if the demand of energy exceeds what their body is capable to deliver, comes from another source. In most cases, this other source seems to be what is called the universal psionic field (UPF), which they can tap into. Sometimes they are connected to another source, and more rarely they are even a host for it.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMarvel tries to explain most superpowers and their sources \"scientifically\", usually through the use of fictional science-like concepts, such as:\n* Energy absorption (the battery effect); the cells in the body have the same function as batteries, being charged with energy that comes from an outer source. This is most often seen in gamma ray-exposed individuals such as the Hulk, who get their powers from this stored energy. The powers will remain as long as the energy is present, and can even be increased by filling the \"batteries\" even more. If the energy is emptied, the powers will fade away.\n* The [[Power Primordial]] is a leftover force from Big Bang and is controlled by the [[Elders of the Universe]].\n* The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] is a force of incredible power. It channels energy from life itself and has been shown to favor [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[telepaths]] like [[Jean Grey]].\n* Psionic energy, which is assumed to be an invisible, unknown form of energy generated by living brains that can manipulate other forms of matter and energy.\n* The universal psionic field is a force present everywhere in the universe, but only those with abilities to connect to it can make use of its energy.\n* The Enigma Force is suspected to be connected to the Microverse and is also the source of its counterpart on Earth the Uni-Power, which transforms an individual into Captain Universe.\n* Extradimensional space: dimensions that can be tapped to pull mass from them (to add to objects on Earth) or taken away from those objects and be stored in those \"pocket dimensions\" to be retrieved later. This is how characters like the Hulk can grow and shrink with no visible absorption of mass. A type of subatomic particles called Pym particles can be used for these effects (Note: many giant-sized characters have a limited ability to manipulate gravity to handle their increased weight). The change in mass can be in the form of a density change instead, allowing a character to become harder or [[incorporeal]]. Some characters can seem to \"transform\" themselves (or others) into unliving substances, or even pure energy, by storing their bodies in extradimensional space and replacing them with bodies made from matter or energy from that dimension, while their souls remain on Earth, controlling their new body. Travel into other dimensions can also be used as a way to \"[[Teleportation|teleport]]\" by re-entering the Earth dimension at a different point.\n* The [[Darkforce]] is an unknown, dark substance from another dimension (known simply as the [[Darkforce Dimension]]) that can be summoned and manipulated in many ways: to create impenetrable darkness, to solidify it in various forms, and (most notably) to absorb the \"life energy\" from living beings (not all users can use all these effects). The Darkforce can also be used to travel to and from its home dimension, but this is dangerous to all except those with Darkforce powers. Some believe that the Darkforce is sentient and sometimes has an evil influence on those who use it.  Various heroes and villains have versions of Darkforce powers, including [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], the first [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]], the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], the [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] and [[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]] (of the [[Squadron Supreme]] Universe). Cloak seems to be the prime 'portal' to the Darkforce, however.\n* The [[Lightforce]] is the opposite of the Darkforce: a form of energy that resembles light and also comes from its dimension, but has healing effects on living beings (except ones made of darkness or the Darkforce). It is unknown if it might be sentient. Cloak's partner, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] seems to be the Lightforce's main [[avatar]].\n* The [[Power Cosmic]] is a force that can alter reality, allowing the user to do whatever he or she wants (including bending the laws of physics), only being limited by how much cosmic energy the character can tap at a time. It seems to be part of the universe itself and is most prominently used by [[Galactus]] and his [[Heralds of Galactus|heralds]].\n* Magic also appears to be like a form of energy, except that it can defy the laws of physics naturally, and usually overrules ordinary science. However, it does have rules of its own to follow, which vary with the method of invocation, usually in the form of spoken spells. It appears to be present in everything, even living beings. All humans in the Marvel Universe can use magic, but only if properly trained. Most people are unaware that magic works. Also, powerful magical beings from other dimensions have created specific, extremely powerful magical spells that they allow to be used (often indiscriminately) by those [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s who invoke their names; one example is the trinity of beings called the Vishanti, who serve as patrons to heroic sorcerers. At any given time, there is a sorcerer on Earth whose task is to protect the universe against extra-dimensional mystical invaders; this sorcerer is known as the [[Sorcerer Supreme]], an office left empty since the death of [[Brother Voodoo]], but most recently has been reinstated to [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #34 (November 2012)</ref> Stars in the Marvel Universe are sentient beings, and the source of all mystic energy.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #24 (August 1977)</ref>\n* Pym particles are what make people shrink and grow.\n\n===Nonhuman===\nA degree of paranoid fear against mutants exists due to stories of mutants being a species or even a subspecies of humans (''Homo superior'' or ''Homo sapiens superior'') that is evolving and is meant to replace normal humans. This has caused organizations to form to deal with the problem, who can be divided into three camps: those who seek peaceful coexistence between mutants and normal humans (the X-Men and their affiliated groups), those who seek to control or eliminate humans to give mutants safety or dominance ([[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his followers, as well as other mutants such as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]), and those who seek to regulate or eliminate mutants in favor of humans. The latter often use the robots known as the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] as weapons.  Certain species are regarded as [[Untermensch|subhuman]], like the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lurk beneath New York City and have been discriminated against by the outside world because of their mutant deformities. The Morlocks have recently joined the terrorist organization Gene Nation.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn addition to mutants, Eternals, and Deviants, several other intelligent races have existed secretly on Earth. These include the [[Inhumans]], another genetically unstable race (like the Deviants, but in their case, it is due to their use of a substance called the \"Terrigen Mists\") that was created by a [[Kree]] experiment long ago; the [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterraneans]], a race of humanoids adapted to living below the surface, created by the Deviants (some Subterraneans were transformed into the 'Lava Men' by a demon); and ''[[Homo mermanus]]'', a [[humanoid]] species of water-breathers that live in Earth's oceans. Most of these races have advanced technology but existed hidden from humanity until recent times. More variants of humanity can be found in the [[Savage Land]] (see Places below). Most of the Savage Land races have their origin from a group of primitive ape-men who seems to have escaped the Celestial experiments and whose influence is present in all modern ''Homo sapiens''. Other leftovers from the era when primitive humanoids walked on Earth still exist, such as the radiation-altered [[Neanderthal]] man known as the [[Missing Link (comics)|Missing Link]], an enemy of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #105-106</ref>\n\n===Alien races===\n{{Main|List of alien races in Marvel Comics}}\nThe Marvel Universe also contains hundreds of intelligent alien races. Earth has interacted with many of them because a major \"[[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] warp\" happens to exist in the [[Solar System]].\n\nThe three major space empires are:\n* the [[Kree]], who rule the Kree Empire (in the [[Greater Magellanic Cloud]])\n* the [[Skrull]]s, who rule the Skrull Empire (in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]])\n* the [[Shi'ar]], who rule the Shi'ar Empire (no known real-world counterpart for its galaxy, but it might be in the [[Triangulum Galaxy]]<ref>Triangulum is the third-largest galaxy of the Local Group and located more or less between the two main members of the group, Andromeda and the Milky Way.</ref>)\nThe three are often in direct or indirect conflict, which occasionally involves Earth humans; in particular, the Kree and Skrulls are ancient enemies, and the [[Kree-Skrull War]] has involved humans on several occasions.\n\nThe Skrulls have also been known to be in a long and consistent war against the Majesdanians, who live on a milky planet named Majesdane.<ref name=\" Vol2#8\">'' Runaways'' (vol. 2) #8</ref> The war between the two had started after two Majesdanians, Frank and Leslie Dean of [[Pride (comics)|the Pride]] had been kicked out for criminal activities; the two traveled to Earth, where Frank and Leslie stopped the war against Earth in exchange for giving the Skrulls the location of Majesdane, which was hidden behind the corona of a [[white dwarf]]. The war had gone on for 16 years minimum; it ended abruptly after the Skrulls shot a barrage of missiles at Majesdane, who retaliated.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/>\n\nAnother prominent alien race is the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], immortal and wise beings who watch over the Marvel Universe and have taken a sacred vow not to intervene in events, though the Watcher assigned to Earth, [[Uatu]], has violated this oath on several occasions.\n\nThe [[Elders of the Universe]] are ancient aliens who have often had a great impact on many worlds for billions of years, acting alone or as a group. A power called the Power Primordial is channeled through them.\n\nMany other races exist and have formed an \"Intergalactic Council\" to have their say on matters that affect them all, such as interference from Earth humans in their affairs.\n\n===Supernatural creatures===\nAlso abundant in the Marvel Universe are legendary creatures such as [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|gods]], [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] and [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]. The 'gods' of most [[polytheistic]] pantheons are powerful, immortal human-like races residing in other dimensions who visited Earth in ancient times, and became the basis of many legends. However, all of these 'gods' share a common ancestry and connection to Earth due to [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]], the primeval Elder Goddess that infused her life essence into all living things on Earth. Gaea is known by various names and appearances in other cultures and among the various pantheons, but she is the same being. As a result, she is a member of every polytheistic pantheon of 'gods' worshiped by humans. Besides mythological gods, many deities made up by Marvel writers exist as well, such as the Dark Gods, enemies of the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]]. The Dark Gods are a race of 'gods' that have been worshiped by [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] races. Well-known alien races like the [[Shi'ar]] and [[Skrull]]s also have beings they worship as 'gods', though little has been revealed about them.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMany persons and beings have falsely pretended to be gods or demons during history; in particular, none of the ones claiming to be major figures from [[Judeo-Christian]] beliefs have turned out to be the real article, although several angels have appeared in recent years, as well as an apparent true rebellion and expulsion of angels from a higher realm known as Paradise, proving that some form of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] do exist in this Universe, seemingly like those in keeping with common real-world religious belief. Similarly, [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] are evil magical beings who take affairs in the matters of the universe. Some of the most powerful are [[Blackheart]], [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], [[Satannish]], [[Thog (comics)|Thog the Nether-Spawn]] and [[Zom]]. There are also powerful benevolent mystical entities such as the Vishanti; or amoral and malevolent entities who are not truly demonic, such as [[Dormammu]] and [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|the Octessence]], or ones heavily drawing upon the mythologies of [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and [[Robert E. Howard]]. Some supernatural beings, entities and human characters created by Lovecraft and Howard, who were friends and influenced each other's work, have been adapted by Marvel and include [[Abdul Alhazred]],<ref>''Tarzan'' #15 (August 1978)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62 (November 1990)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #152 (April 1994)</ref> [[Conan the Barbarian]]<ref>''Conan the Barbarian'' #1 (July 1971)</ref> [[Nyarlathotep]]<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' (vol. 2) #4 (June 1973)</ref> and [[Father Set|Set]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #6 (May 1976)</ref> Some deities or demonic beings that are original characters of Marvel have been heavily influenced by these mythologies, such as [[Shuma-Gorath]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #10 (September 1973)</ref>\n\nMost of the current generation of gods have been revealed to be the descendants of the Elder Goddess [[Gaea (comics)|Gaea]]. The two most featured pantheons are the [[Norse mythology|Asgardians]] (of whom [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is a member) and the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]] (of whom [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] is a member). The lords of the various pantheons sometimes gather in groups known as either the Council of Godheads or the Council of Skyfathers. The gods were forced to stop meddling with humanity (at least openly) a thousand years ago by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and most people today believe them to be fictional. Other pantheons have been depicted in the Marvel Universe that is still actively worshiped in the real world, including those worshiped by the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] inhabitants of [[Australia]], the [[Hindu deities|gods]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Shinto]] gods and the gods of [[Zoroastrianism]]. These deities are rarely depicted, however. One such appearance generated a good deal of controversy as the depiction involved a fight between [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Marvel's incarnation of Thor]] and the Hindu god [[Shiva]], a battle which Shiva lost.<ref>''Thor'' #301 (November 1980)</ref> As Shiva is one of the principal deities of Hindu religion, his defeat offended some followers of Hinduism. This battle was [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned later as having been the deity [[Indra]], the Hindu god of thunder, who was posing as Shiva, that met defeat.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #10 (1981)</ref> To avoid offending the believers of still active religions, Marvel features such deities as characters in the background or who make very brief cameo appearances.\n\nMarvel's depiction of vampires has been heavily influenced by various interpretations of popular media, such as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]''. As with many other supernatural creatures, Marvel entwined the origin of vampires with aspects of the mythologies created by Lovecraft and Howard. They were created by magical rites performed by priests of Atlantis before the Great Cataclysm that destroyed much of the world, with [[Varnae]] becoming the first vampire. Marvel would depict vampires as frequent antagonists during the [[Hyborian Age]] to Howard characters such as [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] and Conan. In recent years, Marvel's depiction of vampires has altered greatly by creating various subspecies of vampires that exist in [[clan]]s that greatly differ in appearance and belief. All vampires are depicted with varying degrees of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes and accelerated healing. Many are capable of transforming into animals such as bats or wolves; some can transform into a mist-like substance; some of the most powerful are capable of controlling the weather to a somewhat limited degree. All vampires must ingest blood to maintain their survival and physical vitality. So long as they do so regularly, they cease to age and are immune to diseases. They retain the well-known vulnerabilities common to vampires in other media interpretations, including sunlight, garlic, religious icons and weapons made of silver. Vampires can be killed by a wooden stake driven through the heart, though they return to life if the stake is removed. Vampires are highly allergic to silver and can be killed with it. While they normally heal rapidly, injuries inflicted by silver weapons heal at a much slower rate if the injuries are not fatal. Vampires can also be killed by decapitation or being burned with fire, with burning them to ashes and then scattering the ashes being the most effective means of ensuring their demise (scattering the ashes is done so that the vampire cannot be mystically resurrected).\n\n===Cosmic entities===\nThe [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]] are beings of unbelievably great levels of power (the weakest of whom can destroy entire planets) who exist to perform duties that maintain the existence of the universe. Most do not care at all about \"lesser beings\" such as humans, and as a consequence, their acts are recurrently dangerous to mortals. When dire threats threaten the universe, it is not uncommon for these beings to gather together to discuss the threat and even act on it.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMost conceptual entities are simply interested in furthering their essential function or to keep the balance with an opposing force. However, certain cosmic entities, such as [[Galactus]], the [[In-Betweener]], the [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], or the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] have demonstrated personality, motivations, or (except for the first one mentioned) even ambitions beyond their functions, but often maintain the perspective that morality is entirely relative, or that destroying civilizations of \"lesser\" beings is no eviler than if these beings destroyed an anthill. Others such as [[Uatu the Watcher]], [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], or the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] [[Ashema the Listener|Ashema]] and [[Dreaming Celestial|Tiamut]] are aberrations in the sense of sympathizing with, and occasionally coming to the defense of, humanity.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe \"'''Fulcrum'''\" is a comparatively recent addition to the hierarchy, that \"all\" cosmic entities allegedly serve, of a level of raw power stated to far surpass the might of the Watchers and the Celestials. Unlike most other entities, it is capable of conscience, compassion, and even a sense of humor, and has stated that it wants other cosmic beings to develop such as well. He is a possible manifestation/[[avatar]] of the [[One Above All]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] first received personification in [[Jean Grey]]. The Phoenix Force is composed of the psionic energy from all living beings' past, present, and future, and is an embodiment of rebirth and destructive transformation through \"burning away what doesn't work\", and helped to restart the universe before the [[Big Bang]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Cosmology==\nThe Marvel Universe is part of a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], with various universes coexisting simultaneously, ''usually'' without affecting each other directly.{{issue|date=September 2014}} According to Reed Richards, the ultimate fate of the Multiverse is to perish in all-encompassing heat death.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n\n===Universes/Earths/continuities===\nThe action of most of the Marvel Comics titles takes place in a [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] known as [[Earth-616]]. This continuity exists in a [[multiverse]] alongside trillions of alternative continuities.<ref>''Exiles Annual'' #1 (November 2006)</ref> Alternative continuities in the Marvel Multiverse are generally defined in terms of their differences from Earth-616.\n\nContinuities besides Earth-616 include the following (for a complete listing see [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)]]):\n\n* ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''- an alternate reality ruled by the mutant god [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

Designated as '''[[Earth-93060]]'''.\n* ''[[X-Men Adventures]]'' - originally based on the [[X-Men (TV series)|'' X-Men'' animated series]], this universe went on to feature more original stories, and in its final issue revealed itself to be the universe which existed before the current Earth-616 reality, when it was destroyed by the fracturing of the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. The current edition of the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' corroborates this.\n* [[Earth-96283]] - an alternate reality in which Spider-Man is the only superhero on Earth. [[Sam Raimi]]'s Spider-Man trilogy takes place here.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Earth-96283|title=Earth-96283|website=Marvel Database|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n* Earth 615 - sometimes being the same universe as [[Earth-616]], and sometimes not.\n* Earth 1218 - The setting of the real world, where supernatural entities don't exist.\n\nIn addition, multiple continuities are visited in the comic book series ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'', ''[[What The--?!]]'' (formerly ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'') and ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''. The concept of continuity is not the same as a \"dimension\" or a \"universe\"; for example, characters like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Dormammu]] hail from parallel dimensions and [[Galactus]] from the universe that existed before the [[Big Bang]] which began the current universe, but they all nevertheless belong to the Earth-616 continuity (where all the parallel dimensions and alternate universes seem to be connected to the same main timeline). A continuity should also not be confused with an [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]; for example, while the titles of some imprints, such as [[Ultimate Marvel]], take place in a different continuity, some or all publications in other imprints, such as [[Epic Comics]], [[Marvel MAX]], and [[Marvel UK]], take place within the Earth-616 continuity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Dimensions===\nWithin and sometimes ''between'' continuities, there exist a variety of ''dimensions'', sometimes called ''pocket dimensions'', which typically are not depicted as separate continuities, but rather part of one, typically Earth-616. There is a score of such dimensions, ranging from the Earth-like to the alien. Some are magical and others are scientific; some are inhabited and others are not. These include realities like the [[Microverse]], the [[Darkforce|Darkforce Dimension]], [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]], the [[Mojoverse]], and many more. The [[Astral Plane]] is a dimensional plane that is the source of telekinesis and various other psychic powers. It is a dimension created by the Elder Goddess Oshtur that is sometimes referred to as the \"Temple of Oshtur\" or the \"Realm of the Mind\".<ref name=\"ma1\">'' Mystic Arcana: The Marvel Tarot'' one-shot, Marvel Publishing, Inc. 2007.</ref>\n\nDespite various contradictions, the term ''dimension'' is sometimes interchangeable with ''universe'' or ''reality''. Every reality of the Marvel Universe has numerous interconnected dimensions, with each dimension differing from those of other realities; for example, the Ultimate Asgard has clearly been shown to be distinct from the Asgard known to [[Earth-616]] characters. Such dimensions, such as Asgard or the Dark Dimension are not \"pocket dimensions\" as they reside completely ''outside'' the boundaries of the Marvel Universe instead of within, as the former does.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Time===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nOne cannot normally alter the Marvel Universe's history; if a time-traveler should cause an alteration to the established flow of events at some point in the past, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|divergent universe]] will simply \"branch out\" from the existing timeline, and the time-traveler will still return to his or her unaltered original universe. Those realities can also spawn realities of their own. There exist hundreds, probably thousands of such realities. It is unknown why this happens, though a warp known as the Nexus of All Realities exists in a swamp in the Florida Everglades of Earth-616. For the most part, this does not matter, as most beings are unaware that this occurs, or even that their universes were recently \"born\" from another. However, individuals and organizations exist that try to monitor or manipulate the various realities. These include [[Immortus]], the [[Captain Britain|Captain Britain Corps]], the [[Time Variance Authority]], the [[Timebreaker]]s/[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], and [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s forces. It is possible to travel through time without creating a new alternative universe, instead of altering events in the future, but this seems to have devastating and very far-reaching repercussions, as depicted in [[Marvel 1602]] (it almost destroyed the whole multiverse, including the [[afterlife]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nAlso, time itself passes much differently within the confines of the Marvel Universe than it does in the real world. Despite various characters having appeared within company publications for decades, few, if any, have aged to any appreciable degree. For example, the patriotic hero [[Captain America]] was created in 1941 but stopped appearing in titles soon after the end of [[World War II]]. The character was revived more than 20 years later, explained as having been frozen in a block of ice though believed to be dead, to lead Marvel's latest team of superheroes the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. This first Avengers team featured several characters that would go on to be some of the company's most famous and most popular. Although the characters would be portrayed in hundreds and even thousands of adventures over the decades, they have been portrayed as having aged little or not at all.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nNaturally, this tendency is purely due to story conveniences (or a somewhat haphazardly shifting patchwork pattern of authors), and mainly that the fictional \"continuity\" has been maintained and expanded far beyond what [[Stan Lee]] and others originally planned or hoped for. Hence, the passing of time was more discernible in the very early years, such as the graduation of [[Spider-Man]]; and what started as children or teenaged characters, such as [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], [[Valeria Richards]], [[Power Pack]], or the [[New Mutants]] are all allowed to age at wildly shifting rates (in the second case even backward at times), whereas surrounding characters somewhat dependent on a certain age limit do not change at all. This recurrently creates inherently contradictory effects, as events are routinely described to have happened several years ago, even in cases when this would mean that some of the involved characters would have been toddlers. Different approaches also exist regarding allowing \"second-generation\" descendants of heroes or villains, full-grown over 18 years after an event (for example, [[Hulkling]], other members of the [[Young Avengers]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], and the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]), whereas other books, such as ''[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)#Heroic Age|Young Allies]]'' use the inherent contradiction to debunk similar claims. If a past storyline wherein a direct depiction of a then-current president or similar is referred to in a later era, it tends to become updated accordingly, sometimes with an \"in-joke\" acknowledgment.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nA more recent explanation was given by Galactus to the Ultimates, namely that some important events - for instance, the creation of the Fantastic Four or the Avengers -  have a 'gravity' all their own and warp time around them, causing the timeline to subtly change to accommodate this.<ref>''Ultimates'' (2015) #5</ref>\n\n===Space===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nWhile the Marvel Universe is presumably as large as the non-fictional universe comic book readers inhabit, for all intents and purposes the [[Local Group]] is the universe; practically all action takes place in it. The Skrull Empire is located in the Andromeda Galaxy, the Kree Empire in the Greater Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite of the Milky Way galaxy in which Earth, of course, is found, and the Shi\u00b4ar Empire is located somewhere between them in one of the smaller galaxies (perhaps the Triangulum Galaxy); frequently, these three empires are quoted as the main political powers \"in the universe\". Similarly, the Local Group seems to be the only affected area when the [[Annihilation Wave]] cut its bloody swath \"across the universe\".\n\n==Role-playing games==\nFour [[role-playing game]]s have been set in the Marvel Universe:\n\n* ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1984)\n* ''[[Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1998)\n* ''[[Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game]]'' ([[Marvel Comics]], 2003)\n* ''[[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]]'' ([[Margaret Weis Productions]], 2012)\n\n==See also==\nFor more complete lists of inhabitants of the Marvel Universe, see [[List of Marvel Comics characters]], [[List of Marvel Comics teams and organizations]], and [[List of Marvel Comics alien races]].\n* [[Features of the Marvel Universe]]\n* [[Publication history of Marvel Comics crossover events]]\n* ''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]''\n* [[List of Marvel Comics superhero debuts]]\n* [[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|'' Marvel Super Heroes'' (role-playing game)]]\n* [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the official film and TV franchise of all Marvel Comics characters owned by [[Marvel Studios]]/[[Disney]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com Marvel Entertainment] (official site)\n* [http://www.chronologyproject.com Marvel Chronology Project]\n* [http://s15.zetaboards.com/MUA/index/] (Forums named after Marvel Universe)\n\n{{Marvel Comics}}\n{{Marvel Multiverse}}\n{{DisneyConsumer}}\n{{Marvel Characters}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:Superhero fiction]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics dimensions|Marvel Comics dimensions]]\n[[Category:Canons (fiction)]]\n[[Category:Marvel Entertainment franchises]]\n[[Category:Fictional universes]]\n[[Category:Mythopoeia]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the shared comic book universe|the shared film and TV universe of \n heroes owned by [[Marvel Studios]]/[[Marvel Television]]|Marvel Cinematic Universe|other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}\n{{Infobox media franchise\n|title          = {{no italic|Marvel Universe}}\n|italic_title = no\n|image          = Marvel Universe (Civil War).jpg\n|image_upright  =  \n|caption        = Various characters of the Marvel Universe.

Super-teams such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Inhumans]], and many Marvel superheroes live in this universe, including characters such as [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], the [[Hulk]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Doctor Strange]], the [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Ant-Man]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], the [[Punisher]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Deadpool]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade the Vampire-Slayer]], the [[Ghost Rider]], the [[Moon Knight]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Adam Warlock]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and numerous others. It also contains well-known supervillains such as [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], [[Ultron]], [[Galactus]], \n[[Thanos]], [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], the [[Red Skull]], [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Malekith the Accursed]], [[Annihilus]], the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Apocalypse (Marvel Comics)|Apocalypse]], [[Bullseye (Marvel Comics)]], [[Lady Deathstrike]], [[MODOK]], the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and the [[Green Goblin]].\n\nThe Marvel Universe is further depicted as existing within a \"[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]\" consisting of thousands of separate universes, all of which are the creations of Marvel Comics and all of which are, in a sense, \"Marvel universes\". In this context, \"Marvel Universe\" is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], which is known as '''[[Earth-616]]''' or currently as '''Earth Prime'''.\n\n==History==\n\nThough the concept of a [[shared universe]] was not new or unique to [[comic book]]s in 1961, writer/editor [[Stan Lee]], together with several artists including [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters' growth and change. Headline characters in one title would make cameos or guest appearances in other books. Eventually, many of the leading heroes assembled into a team known as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  This was not the first time that Marvel's characters had interacted with one another&mdash;[[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]] had been rivals when Marvel was [[Timely Comics]] (Marvel Vault)&mdash; but it was the first time that the comic book publisher's characters seemed to share a world.<ref>''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]''. ''Marvel Comics'' #1</ref>  The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in [[New York City]]; by contrast, many [[DC Universe|DC heroes]] live in fictional cities. Care was taken to portray the city and the world as realistically as possible, with the presence of superhumans affecting the common citizens in various ways.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOver time, a few Marvel Comics writers lobbied Marvel editors to incorporate the idea of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Multiverse]] resembling [[DC multiverse|DC's parallel worlds]]; this plot device allows one to create several fictional universes which normally do not overlap. What happens on Earth in the main Marvel Universe would normally not affect what happens on a parallel Earth in another Marvel-created universe. However, writers would have the creative ability to write stories in which people from one such universe would visit this alternative universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 1982, Marvel published the miniseries ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]'', in which all of the major heroes in existence at the time were gathered together to deal with one threat.  This was Marvel's first miniseries.  Each issue contained biographical information on many major costumed characters; these biographies were a precursor to Marvel's series of reference material, ''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', which followed shortly on the heels of ''Contest of Champions''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Concepts==\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}\nThe Marvel Universe is strongly based on the real world. Earth in the Marvel Universe has all the features of the real one: same countries, same personalities (politicians, movie stars, etc.), same historical events (such as World War II), and so on; however, it also contains many other fictional elements: countries such as [[Wakanda]] and [[Latveria]] (very small nations) and organizations like the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and its enemies, [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] In 2009 Marvel officially described its world's geography in a two-part miniseries, the ''Marvel Atlas''.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.1787.Travel_The_World_With_The_Marvel_Atlas Travel \"The World With The Marvel Atlas\"]. Marvel.com News</ref><!-- We need a primary source for this!-->\n\nMost importantly, the Marvel Universe also incorporates examples of almost all major [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] concepts, with writers adding more continuously. Aliens, gods, magic, cosmic powers and extremely advanced human-developed technology all exist prominently in the Marvel Universe. (A universe incorporating ''all'' these types of fantastic elements is fairly rare; another example is the [[DC Universe]].)  Monsters also play a more prominent role with east Asian origins of magical incantation, outlandish sorcery and manifesting principle in the Marvel Universe. One such case is [[Fin Fang Foom]] arising from the ashes of tantric magic.  Thanks to these extra elements, Earth in the Marvel Universe is home to a large number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s, who have gained their powers by any of these means.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nComparatively, little time passes in the Marvel Universe compared to the real world, owing to the serial nature of storytelling, with the stories of certain issues picking up mere seconds after the conclusion of the previous one, while a whole month has passed by in \"real-time\". Marvel's major heroes were created in the 1960s, but the amount of time that has passed between then and now within the universe itself has (after a prolonged period of being identified as about 10 years in the mid-to-late 1990s) most recently been identified as 13 years.<ref>''The Thing'' #13 (July 2006); ''Civil War Battle Damage Report'' (March 2007)</ref> Consequently, the settings of some events which were contemporary when written have to be updated every few years to \"make sense\" in this [[floating timeline]]. Thus, the events of previous stories are considered to have happened within a certain number of years before the publishing date of the current issue. For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s high school graduation was published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #28 (September 1965), his college graduation in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #185 (October 1978), and his high school reunion in ''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #7 (December 2004). Because of the floating timeline, where stories refer to real-life historic events, these references are later ignored or rewritten to suit current sensibilities; for instance, the origin of [[Iron Man]] was changed in a 2004 storyline to refer to the [[War on Terror]] in [[Afghanistan]],<ref>'' Iron Man'' (vol. 4) #1 (November 2004)</ref> whereas the original Iron Man stories had referred to the [[Vietnam War]] in [[Vietnam]]; similarly, [[The Punisher]]'s backstory has also been changed as well.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] itself exists as a company within the Marvel Universe, and versions of people such as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] have appeared in some of the stories, whereas characters like Steve Rogers, ([[Captain America]]'s [[alter ego]]), have worked for Marvel.{{issue|date=September 2014}} The Marvel of this reality publishes comics that adapt the actual adventures of the superheroes (except for details not known to the public, like their secret identities); many of these are licensed with the permission of the heroes themselves, who customarily donate their share of profits to charity. Additionally, the [[DC Comics]] Universe is also said to exist in the Marvel Universe as one of the many alternative universes. The reverse may also be said concerning the DC Universe. This is one method of explaining the various crossover stories co-published by the two companies.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nPop culture characters such as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]] exist in the Marvel Universe. This is usually justified as a second-hand account of events as told to credited authors [[Bram Stoker]] and [[Mary Shelley]], although the general public continues to believe them to be fictional. [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan the Barbarian]], [[Red Sonja]], [[Kull (comics)|Kull the Conqueror]], and [[Solomon Kane (comics)|Solomon Kane]] also have real-life existences in the Marvel Universe. The [[Hyborian Era]] of Conan and Kull is considered part of Earth-616 pre-recorded history. However, they rarely encounter modern Marvel superhero characters.  This is most likely possible due to the uncertain legal status of Howard's works before 2006 when they became public domain. As of 2019, Conan the Barbarian, as well as Kull the Conqueror and Solomon Kane, have been firmly integrated, thanks to Marvel regaining the publishing rights to the characters. Other licensed works that have been incorporated into the Marvel Universe include [[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]], the [[Transformers (franchise)|Transformers]], the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (in the character of [[Machine Man]]), [[Rom the Space Knight|Rom the Spaceknight]], the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]], and the [[Shogun Warriors (comics)|Shogun Warriors]]. In most cases, such material is either restricted from use after the license expires or the characters redesigned or renamed to avoid copyright infringement.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Costumed superheroes and supervillains===\nWithin the fictional history of the Marvel Universe, the tradition of using costumed secret identities to fight or commit evil had long existed, but it came into prominence during the days of the American \"[[Wild West]]\" with heroes such as [[Phantom Rider|Carter Slade/the Phantom Rider]]. During the 20th century, the tradition was reinvigorated by [[Captain America|Steve Rogers/Captain America]] and the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] in the 1940s, who fought for the [[Allies of World War II]].\n\nMarvel's most prominent heroes were created during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in the 1960s to early 1970s, including [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker/Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark/Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Hulk|Bruce Banner/the Hulk]], [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock/Daredevil]],

[[Deadpool|Wade Wilson/Deadpool]], [[Gambit (comics)|Remy LeBeau/Gambit]], [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers/Cable]], [[Domino (comics)|Neena Thurman/Domino]], [[Blink (comics)|Clarice Fong/Blink]], the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], [[Yelena Belova]] (also known as the second Black Widow), the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the modern [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the modern [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] (based off [[The Defenders (miniseries)|the Netflix MCU version of the same name]]), [[X-23|Laura Kinney/X-23]] (a.k.a. the second Wolverine), [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]], the [[Dora Milaje]], [[Daisy Johnson]] (also known as Quake), [[Phil Coulson]], [[Melinda May]], [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier]], [[Maria Hill]], [[Miles Morales]] (the second Spider-Man of the Ultimate Marvel Universe), [[Hope Pym|Hope van Dyne]] (also known as the Red Queen and the second Wasp), [[Cassandra Lang]] (also known as Stature, Stinger, Ant-Girl and Giant-Girl), the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], [[Amadeus Cho]] (also known as the second Hulk), [[Kamala Khan]] (also known as the second Ms. Marvel), [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] (also known as the third Hawkeye), [[Moon Girl (Marvel Comics)|Lunaella Lafayette/Moon Girl]], [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]] (also known as the second Miss America), [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] (also known as the fourth Ghost Rider), [[Ironheart (character)|Riri Williams/Ironheart]] and [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] ([[Gwen Stacy]] of Earth-65) have become popular characters in their own right. Unlike the [[DC Universe]], few of Marvel's 1940s characters have risen to prominence in modern publications; [[Captain America]] is one exception, and to a lesser extent, his contemporary, [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], primarily because both of these characters were reintroduced to readers and the Marvel Universe during the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nProminent teams of superheroes include the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Inhumans]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[Howling Commandos]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the [[Midnight Sons]] and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. All these groups have varying lineups; the Avengers have included Marvel's major heroes as members at one time or another. The X-Men are a team of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] led by [[Professor X]] and include many of Marvel's most popular characters, such as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and others. The Fantastic Four are viewed as \"Marvel's First Family\" of superheroes, usually consisting of [[Mister Fantastic]], the [[Invisible Woman]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], as well as siblings [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards]]. The Defenders were an ad-hoc team usually brought together by [[Doctor Strange]] which has included the [[Hulk]], [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Silver Surfer]], while the most recent incarnation of the team consists of street-level New York City heroes [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. The Guardians of the Galaxy include Marvel's cosmic characters such as [[Star-Lord]], [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Groot]] and [[Rocket Raccoon]], but the team has also introduced other heroes into the roster such as [[Kitty Pryde]], the Silver Surfer, the Thing and [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]. The Inhumans are a royal family comprising of [[Black Bolt]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Crystal]], [[Gorgon]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], [[Karnak|Karnak the Shatterer]] and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]], who rule the city of Attilan. The Runaways are a group of teenagers and a dinosaur consisting of [[Alex Wilder]], [[Nico Minoru]], [[Karolina Dean]], [[Chase Stein]], [[Molly Hayes]], [[Gert Yorkes]] and [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] who rebel against their evil parents known as [[The Pride (comics)|the Pride]]. The Midnight Sons consist of supernatural heroes such as [[Blade (comics)|Blade the Vampire-Slayer]], the [[Ghost Rider]], [[Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Daemon Hellstrom|Hellstorm the Son of Satan]], the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]] and the [[Man-Thing]]. The Thunderbolts' original incarnation were supervillains disguised as superheroes consisting of [[Citizen V]] (a.k.a. [[Helmut Zemo]]), [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]] (a.k.a. the Beetle), [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] (a.k.a. Screaming Mimi), [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]] (a.k.a. Meteorite), [[Fixer (comics)#Paul Norbert Ebersol|Techno/the Ogre]] (a.k.a. the Fixer) and [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], while the current incarnation of the team is made up of reformed supervillains working for the government: [[Deadpool]], the [[Punisher]], the [[Red Hulk]], the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]]. Although teams of supervillains are few and far between, notable examples include the [[Masters of Evil]], the [[Emissaries of Evil]], the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], the [[Sinister Six]], the [[Frightful Four]], the [[Lethal Legion]], the [[Legion of the Unliving]], the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], the [[Annihilation Wave]], the [[Starforce]] and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]].\n\n===Origin of superhuman powers===\nMost of the superhumans in Marvel's Earth owe their powers to the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], cosmic entities who visited Earth millions of years ago and experimented on our [[prehistoric]] ancestors (a process they also carried out on several other planets). This resulted in the creation of two [[Hidden races (Marvel Comics)|hidden races]], the godlike [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] and the genetically unstable [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], in addition to giving some humans an \"x-factor\" in their genes, which sometimes activates naturally, resulting in sometimes superpowered, sometimes disfigured individuals called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s. Others require other factors (such as [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]]) for their powers to come forth. Depending on the genetic profile, individuals who are exposed to different chemicals or radiation will often suffer death or injury, while in others it will cause superhuman abilities to manifest. Except for [[psionic]] abilities, these powers are usually random; rarely do two people have the same set of powers. It is not clear why the Celestials did this, although it is known that they continue to observe humanity's evolution. A Marvel series titled ''[[Earth X]]'' explored one possible reason for this: that superhumans are meant to protect a Celestial embryo that grows inside Earth against any planetary threats and have done so for eons. An X-Men villain that is known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] claims to be a new direction in human evolution, as he is born with superpowers even though his genetic profile said he was an ordinary human being. The majority of the public is unaware of what may cause superhuman powers.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nOther possible origins for superhuman powers include [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] and/or [[Bionics|bionic]] implants. Some heroes and villains have no powers at all but depend instead on hand-to-hand combat training or advanced technological equipment. In the Marvel Universe, technology is considerably more advanced than in the real world; this is due to unique individuals of genius-level intelligence, such as Reed Richards ([[Mister Fantastic]]) of the Fantastic Four. However, most of the advanced devices (such as [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] and [[death ray]]s) are too expensive for the common citizen, and are usually in the hands of government organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D., or powerful criminal organizations like [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]. One major company producing these devices is Stark Industries, owned by Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), but there are others. Advanced technology has also been given to humans by hidden races, aliens, or [[time travel]]ers like [[Kang the Conqueror]], who is known to have influenced the [[robotics]] industry in the past.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn superhumans, the energy required for their superpowers either comes from within using their own body as a source or, if the demand of energy exceeds what their body is capable to deliver, comes from another source. In most cases, this other source seems to be what is called the universal psionic field (UPF), which they can tap into. Sometimes they are connected to another source, and more rarely they are even a host for it.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMarvel tries to explain most superpowers and their sources \"scientifically\", usually through the use of fictional science-like concepts, such as:\n* Energy absorption (the battery effect); the cells in the body have the same function as batteries, being charged with energy that comes from an outer source. This is most often seen in gamma ray-exposed individuals such as the Hulk, who get their powers from this stored energy. The powers will remain as long as the energy is present, and can even be increased by filling the \"batteries\" even more. If the energy is emptied, the powers will fade away.\n* The [[Power Primordial]] is a leftover force from Big Bang and is controlled by the [[Elders of the Universe]].\n* The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] is a force of incredible power. It channels energy from life itself and has been shown to favor [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[telepaths]] like [[Jean Grey]].\n* Psionic energy, which is assumed to be an invisible, unknown form of energy generated by living brains that can manipulate other forms of matter and energy.\n* The universal psionic field is a force present everywhere in the universe, but only those with abilities to connect to it can make use of its energy.\n* The Enigma Force is suspected to be connected to the Microverse and is also the source of its counterpart on Earth the Uni-Power, which transforms an individual into Captain Universe.\n* Extradimensional space: dimensions that can be tapped to pull mass from them (to add to objects on Earth) or taken away from those objects and be stored in those \"pocket dimensions\" to be retrieved later. This is how characters like the Hulk can grow and shrink with no visible absorption of mass. A type of subatomic particles called Pym particles can be used for these effects (Note: many giant-sized characters have a limited ability to manipulate gravity to handle their increased weight). The change in mass can be in the form of a density change instead, allowing a character to become harder or [[incorporeal]]. Some characters can seem to \"transform\" themselves (or others) into unliving substances, or even pure energy, by storing their bodies in extradimensional space and replacing them with bodies made from matter or energy from that dimension, while their souls remain on Earth, controlling their new body. Travel into other dimensions can also be used as a way to \"[[Teleportation|teleport]]\" by re-entering the Earth dimension at a different point.\n* The [[Darkforce]] is an unknown, dark substance from another dimension (known simply as the [[Darkforce Dimension]]) that can be summoned and manipulated in many ways: to create impenetrable darkness, to solidify it in various forms, and (most notably) to absorb the \"life energy\" from living beings (not all users can use all these effects). The Darkforce can also be used to travel to and from its home dimension, but this is dangerous to all except those with Darkforce powers. Some believe that the Darkforce is sentient and sometimes has an evil influence on those who use it.  Various heroes and villains have versions of Darkforce powers, including [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], the first [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]], the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], the [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] and [[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]] (of the [[Squadron Supreme]] Universe). Cloak seems to be the prime 'portal' to the Darkforce, however.\n* The [[Lightforce]] is the opposite of the Darkforce: a form of energy that resembles light and also comes from its dimension, but has healing effects on living beings (except ones made of darkness or the Darkforce). It is unknown if it might be sentient. Cloak's partner, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] seems to be the Lightforce's main [[avatar]].\n* The [[Power Cosmic]] is a force that can alter reality, allowing the user to do whatever he or she wants (including bending the laws of physics), only being limited by how much cosmic energy the character can tap at a time. It seems to be part of the universe itself and is most prominently used by [[Galactus]] and his [[Heralds of Galactus|heralds]].\n* Magic also appears to be like a form of energy, except that it can defy the laws of physics naturally, and usually overrules ordinary science. However, it does have rules of its own to follow, which vary with the method of invocation, usually in the form of spoken spells. It appears to be present in everything, even living beings. All humans in the Marvel Universe can use magic, but only if properly trained. Most people are unaware that magic works. Also, powerful magical beings from other dimensions have created specific, extremely powerful magical spells that they allow to be used (often indiscriminately) by those [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s who invoke their names; one example is the trinity of beings called the Vishanti, who serve as patrons to heroic sorcerers. At any given time, there is a sorcerer on Earth whose task is to protect the universe against extra-dimensional mystical invaders; this sorcerer is known as the [[Sorcerer Supreme]], an office left empty since the death of [[Brother Voodoo]], but most recently has been reinstated to [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #34 (November 2012)</ref> Stars in the Marvel Universe are sentient beings, and the source of all mystic energy.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #24 (August 1977)</ref>\n* Pym particles are what make people shrink and grow.\n\n===Nonhuman===\nA degree of paranoid fear against mutants exists due to stories of mutants being a species or even a subspecies of humans (''Homo superior'' or ''Homo sapiens superior'') that is evolving and is meant to replace normal humans. This has caused organizations to form to deal with the problem, who can be divided into three camps: those who seek peaceful coexistence between mutants and normal humans (the X-Men and their affiliated groups), those who seek to control or eliminate humans to give mutants safety or dominance ([[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his followers, as well as other mutants such as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]), and those who seek to regulate or eliminate mutants in favor of humans. The latter often use the robots known as the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] as weapons.  Certain species are regarded as [[Untermensch|subhuman]], like the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lurk beneath New York City and have been discriminated against by the outside world because of their mutant deformities. The Morlocks have recently joined the terrorist organization Gene Nation.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn addition to mutants, Eternals, and Deviants, several other intelligent races have existed secretly on Earth. These include the [[Inhumans]], another genetically unstable race (like the Deviants, but in their case, it is due to their use of a substance called the \"Terrigen Mists\") that was created by a [[Kree]] experiment long ago; the [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterraneans]], a race of humanoids adapted to living below the surface, created by the Deviants (some Subterraneans were transformed into the 'Lava Men' by a demon); and ''[[Homo mermanus]]'', a [[humanoid]] species of water-breathers that live in Earth's oceans. Most of these races have advanced technology but existed hidden from humanity until recent times. More variants of humanity can be found in the [[Savage Land]] (see Places below). Most of the Savage Land races have their origin from a group of primitive ape-men who seems to have escaped the Celestial experiments and whose influence is present in all modern ''Homo sapiens''. Other leftovers from the era when primitive humanoids walked on Earth still exist, such as the radiation-altered [[Neanderthal]] man known as the [[Missing Link (comics)|Missing Link]], an enemy of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #105-106</ref>\n\n===Alien races===\n{{Main|List of alien races in Marvel Comics}}\nThe Marvel Universe also contains hundreds of intelligent alien races. Earth has interacted with many of them because a major \"[[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] warp\" happens to exist in the [[Solar System]].\n\nThe three major space empires are:\n* the [[Kree]], who rule the Kree Empire (in the [[Greater Magellanic Cloud]])\n* the [[Skrull]]s, who rule the Skrull Empire (in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]])\n* the [[Shi'ar]], who rule the Shi'ar Empire (no known real-world counterpart for its galaxy, but it might be in the [[Triangulum Galaxy]]<ref>Triangulum is the third-largest galaxy of the Local Group and located more or less between the two main members of the group, Andromeda and the Milky Way.</ref>)\nThe three are often in direct or indirect conflict, which occasionally involves Earth humans; in particular, the Kree and Skrulls are ancient enemies, and the [[Kree-Skrull War]] has involved humans on several occasions.\n\nThe Skrulls have also been known to be in a long and consistent war against the Majesdanians, who live on a milky planet named Majesdane.<ref name=\" Vol2#8\">'' Runaways'' (vol. 2) #8</ref> The war between the two had started after two Majesdanians, Frank and Leslie Dean of [[Pride (comics)|the Pride]] had been kicked out for criminal activities; the two traveled to Earth, where Frank and Leslie stopped the war against Earth in exchange for giving the Skrulls the location of Majesdane, which was hidden behind the corona of a [[white dwarf]]. The war had gone on for 16 years minimum; it ended abruptly after the Skrulls shot a barrage of missiles at Majesdane, who retaliated.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/>\n\nAnother prominent alien race is the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], immortal and wise beings who watch over the Marvel Universe and have taken a sacred vow not to intervene in events, though the Watcher assigned to Earth, [[Uatu]], has violated this oath on several occasions.\n\nThe [[Elders of the Universe]] are ancient aliens who have often had a great impact on many worlds for billions of years, acting alone or as a group. A power called the Power Primordial is channeled through them.\n\nMany other races exist and have formed an \"Intergalactic Council\" to have their say on matters that affect them all, such as interference from Earth humans in their affairs.\n\n===Supernatural creatures===\nAlso abundant in the Marvel Universe are legendary creatures such as [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|gods]], [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] and [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]. The 'gods' of most [[polytheistic]] pantheons are powerful, immortal human-like races residing in other dimensions who visited Earth in ancient times, and became the basis of many legends. However, all of these 'gods' share a common ancestry and connection to Earth due to [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]], the primeval Elder Goddess that infused her life essence into all living things on Earth. Gaea is known by various names and appearances in other cultures and among the various pantheons, but she is the same being. As a result, she is a member of every polytheistic pantheon of 'gods' worshiped by humans. Besides mythological gods, many deities made up by Marvel writers exist as well, such as the Dark Gods, enemies of the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]]. The Dark Gods are a race of 'gods' that have been worshiped by [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] races. Well-known alien races like the [[Shi'ar]] and [[Skrull]]s also have beings they worship as 'gods', though little has been revealed about them.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMany persons and beings have falsely pretended to be gods or demons during history; in particular, none of the ones claiming to be major figures from [[Judeo-Christian]] beliefs have turned out to be the real article, although several angels have appeared in recent years, as well as an apparent true rebellion and expulsion of angels from a higher realm known as Paradise, proving that some form of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] do exist in this Universe, seemingly like those in keeping with common real-world religious belief. Similarly, [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] are evil magical beings who take affairs in the matters of the universe. Some of the most powerful are [[Blackheart]], [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], [[Satannish]], [[Thog (comics)|Thog the Nether-Spawn]] and [[Zom]]. There are also powerful benevolent mystical entities such as the Vishanti; or amoral and malevolent entities who are not truly demonic, such as [[Dormammu]] and [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|the Octessence]], or ones heavily drawing upon the mythologies of [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and [[Robert E. Howard]]. Some supernatural beings, entities and human characters created by Lovecraft and Howard, who were friends and influenced each other's work, have been adapted by Marvel and include [[Abdul Alhazred]],<ref>''Tarzan'' #15 (August 1978)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62 (November 1990)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #152 (April 1994)</ref> [[Conan the Barbarian]]<ref>''Conan the Barbarian'' #1 (July 1971)</ref> [[Nyarlathotep]]<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' (vol. 2) #4 (June 1973)</ref> and [[Father Set|Set]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #6 (May 1976)</ref> Some deities or demonic beings that are original characters of Marvel have been heavily influenced by these mythologies, such as [[Shuma-Gorath]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #10 (September 1973)</ref>\n\nMost of the current generation of gods have been revealed to be the descendants of the Elder Goddess [[Gaea (comics)|Gaea]]. The two most featured pantheons are the [[Norse mythology|Asgardians]] (of whom [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is a member) and the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]] (of whom [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] is a member). The lords of the various pantheons sometimes gather in groups known as either the Council of Godheads or the Council of Skyfathers. The gods were forced to stop meddling with humanity (at least openly) a thousand years ago by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and most people today believe them to be fictional. Other pantheons have been depicted in the Marvel Universe that is still actively worshiped in the real world, including those worshiped by the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] inhabitants of [[Australia]], the [[Hindu deities|gods]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Shinto]] gods and the gods of [[Zoroastrianism]]. These deities are rarely depicted, however. One such appearance generated a good deal of controversy as the depiction involved a fight between [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Marvel's incarnation of Thor]] and the Hindu god [[Shiva]], a battle which Shiva lost.<ref>''Thor'' #301 (November 1980)</ref> As Shiva is one of the principal deities of Hindu religion, his defeat offended some followers of Hinduism. This battle was [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned later as having been the deity [[Indra]], the Hindu god of thunder, who was posing as Shiva, that met defeat.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #10 (1981)</ref> To avoid offending the believers of still active religions, Marvel features such deities as characters in the background or who make very brief cameo appearances.\n\nMarvel's depiction of vampires has been heavily influenced by various interpretations of popular media, such as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]''. As with many other supernatural creatures, Marvel entwined the origin of vampires with aspects of the mythologies created by Lovecraft and Howard. They were created by magical rites performed by priests of Atlantis before the Great Cataclysm that destroyed much of the world, with [[Varnae]] becoming the first vampire. Marvel would depict vampires as frequent antagonists during the [[Hyborian Age]] to Howard characters such as [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] and Conan. In recent years, Marvel's depiction of vampires has altered greatly by creating various subspecies of vampires that exist in [[clan]]s that greatly differ in appearance and belief. All vampires are depicted with varying degrees of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes and accelerated healing. Many are capable of transforming into animals such as bats or wolves; some can transform into a mist-like substance; some of the most powerful are capable of controlling the weather to a somewhat limited degree. All vampires must ingest blood to maintain their survival and physical vitality. So long as they do so regularly, they cease to age and are immune to diseases. They retain the well-known vulnerabilities common to vampires in other media interpretations, including sunlight, garlic, religious icons and weapons made of silver. Vampires can be killed by a wooden stake driven through the heart, though they return to life if the stake is removed. Vampires are highly allergic to silver and can be killed with it. While they normally heal rapidly, injuries inflicted by silver weapons heal at a much slower rate if the injuries are not fatal. Vampires can also be killed by decapitation or being burned with fire, with burning them to ashes and then scattering the ashes being the most effective means of ensuring their demise (scattering the ashes is done so that the vampire cannot be mystically resurrected).\n\n===Cosmic entities===\nThe [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]] are beings of unbelievably great levels of power (the weakest of whom can destroy entire planets) who exist to perform duties that maintain the existence of the universe. Most do not care at all about \"lesser beings\" such as humans, and as a consequence, their acts are recurrently dangerous to mortals. When dire threats threaten the universe, it is not uncommon for these beings to gather together to discuss the threat and even act on it.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nMost conceptual entities are simply interested in furthering their essential function or to keep the balance with an opposing force. However, certain cosmic entities, such as [[Galactus]], the [[In-Betweener]], the [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], or the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] have demonstrated personality, motivations, or (except for the first one mentioned) even ambitions beyond their functions, but often maintain the perspective that morality is entirely relative, or that destroying civilizations of \"lesser\" beings is no eviler than if these beings destroyed an anthill. Others such as [[Uatu the Watcher]], [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], or the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] [[Ashema the Listener|Ashema]] and [[Dreaming Celestial|Tiamut]] are aberrations in the sense of sympathizing with, and occasionally coming to the defense of, humanity.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe \"'''Fulcrum'''\" is a comparatively recent addition to the hierarchy, that \"all\" cosmic entities allegedly serve, of a level of raw power stated to far surpass the might of the Watchers and the Celestials. Unlike most other entities, it is capable of conscience, compassion, and even a sense of humor, and has stated that it wants other cosmic beings to develop such as well. He is a possible manifestation/[[avatar]] of the [[One Above All]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] first received personification in [[Jean Grey]]. The Phoenix Force is composed of the psionic energy from all living beings' past, present, and future, and is an embodiment of rebirth and destructive transformation through \"burning away what doesn't work\", and helped to restart the universe before the [[Big Bang]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Cosmology==\nThe Marvel Universe is part of a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], with various universes coexisting simultaneously, ''usually'' without affecting each other directly.{{issue|date=September 2014}} According to Reed Richards, the ultimate fate of the Multiverse is to perish in all-encompassing heat death.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n\n===Universes/Earths/continuities===\nThe action of most of the Marvel Comics titles takes place in a [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] known as [[Earth-616]]. This continuity exists in a [[multiverse]] alongside trillions of alternative continuities.<ref>''Exiles Annual'' #1 (November 2006)</ref> Alternative continuities in the Marvel Multiverse are generally defined in terms of their differences from Earth-616.\n\nContinuities besides Earth-616 include the following (for a complete listing see [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)]]):\n\n* ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''- an alternate reality ruled by the mutant god [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

Designated as '''[[Earth-93060]]'''.\n* ''[[X-Men Adventures]]'' - originally based on the [[X-Men (TV series)|'' X-Men'' animated series]], this universe went on to feature more original stories, and in its final issue revealed itself to be the universe which existed before the current Earth-616 reality, when it was destroyed by the fracturing of the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. The current edition of the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' corroborates this.\n* [[Earth-96283]] - an alternate reality in which Spider-Man is the only superhero on Earth. [[Sam Raimi]]'s Spider-Man trilogy takes place here.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Earth-96283|title=Earth-96283|website=Marvel Database|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n* Earth 615 - sometimes being the same universe as [[Earth-616]], and sometimes not.\n* Earth 1218 - The setting of the real world, where supernatural entities don't exist.\n\nIn addition, multiple continuities are visited in the comic book series ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'', ''[[What The--?!]]'' (formerly ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'') and ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''. The concept of continuity is not the same as a \"dimension\" or a \"universe\"; for example, characters like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Dormammu]] hail from parallel dimensions and [[Galactus]] from the universe that existed before the [[Big Bang]] which began the current universe, but they all nevertheless belong to the Earth-616 continuity (where all the parallel dimensions and alternate universes seem to be connected to the same main timeline). A continuity should also not be confused with an [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]; for example, while the titles of some imprints, such as [[Ultimate Marvel]], take place in a different continuity, some or all publications in other imprints, such as [[Epic Comics]], [[Marvel MAX]], and [[Marvel UK]], take place within the Earth-616 continuity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Dimensions===\nWithin and sometimes ''between'' continuities, there exist a variety of ''dimensions'', sometimes called ''pocket dimensions'', which typically are not depicted as separate continuities, but rather part of one, typically Earth-616. There is a score of such dimensions, ranging from the Earth-like to the alien. Some are magical and others are scientific; some are inhabited and others are not. These include realities like the [[Microverse]], the [[Darkforce|Darkforce Dimension]], [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]], the [[Mojoverse]], and many more. The [[Astral Plane]] is a dimensional plane that is the source of telekinesis and various other psychic powers. It is a dimension created by the Elder Goddess Oshtur that is sometimes referred to as the \"Temple of Oshtur\" or the \"Realm of the Mind\".<ref name=\"ma1\">'' Mystic Arcana: The Marvel Tarot'' one-shot, Marvel Publishing, Inc. 2007.</ref>\n\nDespite various contradictions, the term ''dimension'' is sometimes interchangeable with ''universe'' or ''reality''. Every reality of the Marvel Universe has numerous interconnected dimensions, with each dimension differing from those of other realities; for example, the Ultimate Asgard has clearly been shown to be distinct from the Asgard known to [[Earth-616]] characters. Such dimensions, such as Asgard or the Dark Dimension are not \"pocket dimensions\" as they reside completely ''outside'' the boundaries of the Marvel Universe instead of within, as the former does.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Time===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nOne cannot normally alter the Marvel Universe's history; if a time-traveler should cause an alteration to the established flow of events at some point in the past, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|divergent universe]] will simply \"branch out\" from the existing timeline, and the time-traveler will still return to his or her unaltered original universe. Those realities can also spawn realities of their own. There exist hundreds, probably thousands of such realities. It is unknown why this happens, though a warp known as the Nexus of All Realities exists in a swamp in the Florida Everglades of Earth-616. For the most part, this does not matter, as most beings are unaware that this occurs, or even that their universes were recently \"born\" from another. However, individuals and organizations exist that try to monitor or manipulate the various realities. These include [[Immortus]], the [[Captain Britain|Captain Britain Corps]], the [[Time Variance Authority]], the [[Timebreaker]]s/[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], and [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s forces. It is possible to travel through time without creating a new alternative universe, instead of altering events in the future, but this seems to have devastating and very far-reaching repercussions, as depicted in [[Marvel 1602]] (it almost destroyed the whole multiverse, including the [[afterlife]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nAlso, time itself passes much differently within the confines of the Marvel Universe than it does in the real world. Despite various characters having appeared within company publications for decades, few, if any, have aged to any appreciable degree. For example, the patriotic hero [[Captain America]] was created in 1941 but stopped appearing in titles soon after the end of [[World War II]]. The character was revived more than 20 years later, explained as having been frozen in a block of ice though believed to be dead, to lead Marvel's latest team of superheroes the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. This first Avengers team featured several characters that would go on to be some of the company's most famous and most popular. Although the characters would be portrayed in hundreds and even thousands of adventures over the decades, they have been portrayed as having aged little or not at all.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nNaturally, this tendency is purely due to story conveniences (or a somewhat haphazardly shifting patchwork pattern of authors), and mainly that the fictional \"continuity\" has been maintained and expanded far beyond what [[Stan Lee]] and others originally planned or hoped for. Hence, the passing of time was more discernible in the very early years, such as the graduation of [[Spider-Man]]; and what started as children or teenaged characters, such as [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], [[Valeria Richards]], [[Power Pack]], or the [[New Mutants]] are all allowed to age at wildly shifting rates (in the second case even backward at times), whereas surrounding characters somewhat dependent on a certain age limit do not change at all. This recurrently creates inherently contradictory effects, as events are routinely described to have happened several years ago, even in cases when this would mean that some of the involved characters would have been toddlers. Different approaches also exist regarding allowing \"second-generation\" descendants of heroes or villains, full-grown over 18 years after an event (for example, [[Hulkling]], other members of the [[Young Avengers]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], and the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]), whereas other books, such as ''[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)#Heroic Age|Young Allies]]'' use the inherent contradiction to debunk similar claims. If a past storyline wherein a direct depiction of a then-current president or similar is referred to in a later era, it tends to become updated accordingly, sometimes with an \"in-joke\" acknowledgment.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nA more recent explanation was given by Galactus to the Ultimates, namely that some important events - for instance, the creation of the Fantastic Four or the Avengers -  have a 'gravity' all their own and warp time around them, causing the timeline to subtly change to accommodate this.<ref>''Ultimates'' (2015) #5</ref>\n\n===Space===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nWhile the Marvel Universe is presumably as large as the non-fictional universe comic book readers inhabit, for all intents and purposes the [[Local Group]] is the universe; practically all action takes place in it. The Skrull Empire is located in the Andromeda Galaxy, the Kree Empire in the Greater Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite of the Milky Way galaxy in which Earth, of course, is found, and the Shi\u00b4ar Empire is located somewhere between them in one of the smaller galaxies (perhaps the Triangulum Galaxy); frequently, these three empires are quoted as the main political powers \"in the universe\".

Initially the 29th/46th, serving as part of the [[4th Brigade (Australia)|4th Brigade]], undertook garrison duties in Australia, however, in 1943 the battalion was deployed to [[New Guinea]] where it garrisoned [[Milne Bay]] before subsequently taking part in the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in support of the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]]. In late 1944, after being deployed for over a year and a half, the battalion returned to Australia for a brief period of leave and reorganisation. In early 1945, however, they were again deployed overseas, this time to the island of [[New Britain]] where they undertook a [[New Britain campaign|campaign]] to contain the large [[Japan]]ese garrison.

It was formed in August 1942 by the amalgamation of two previously existing [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] battalions, the [[29th Battalion (Australia)|29th]] and [[46th Battalion (Australia)|46th]], which were merged following a decision by the Australian government to release manpower from the military back into industry to meet the nation's increased production requirements. Initially the 29th/46th, serving as part of the [[4th Brigade (Australia)|4th Brigade]], undertook garrison duties in Australia, however, in 1943 the battalion was deployed to [[New Guinea]] where it garrisoned [[Milne Bay]] before subsequently taking part in the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in support of the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]]. In late 1944, after being deployed for over a year and a half, the battalion returned to Australia for a brief period of leave and reorganisation. In early 1945, however, they were again deployed overseas, this time to the island of [[New Britain]] where they undertook a [[New Britain campaign|campaign]] to contain the large [[Japan]]ese garrison.

In order to strengthen ties with the West, his son Istv\u00e1n is marrying the Bavarian princess Gizella.\n\nS\u00far, Solt and Bese, a group of opportunist noblemen, talk about human frailty - every man chooses the side that seems the most promising. Principles are unimportant (''Gyarl\u00f3 az ember'').\n\nThe daughter of Istv\u00e1n's relative Kopp\u00e1ny, R\u00e9ka, has also converted to Christianity and is praying to the new God. Laborc, a follower of her father's, tells her they don't need a foreign god - she should rather trust her father (''Nem vagyunk m\u00e9g hozz\u00e1d m\u00e9lt\u00f3k/Nem kell olyan isten'').\n\nG\u00e9za has died, the country is in mourning (''G\u00e9za fejedelem temet\u00e9se - Kyrie eleison''). Istv\u00e1n promises at his grave to be a good prince to his people, yet he is defied by Kopp\u00e1ny, who claims to be the rightful successor of G\u00e9za's. The followers of both gather behind them and hail them (''Nincs m\u00e1s \u00fat csak az Isten \u00fatja'').\n\n===Act II, ''Esztergom''===\nR\u00e9ka, Gizella, the priests and the people are saddened and pray for peace (''Adj b\u00e9k\u00e9t Uram/Da pacem, Domine'').\n\nA group of singers hail Istv\u00e1n, yet they also sing about past glory (''\u00dcdv\u00f6z l\u00e9gyen G\u00e9za fia''). Istv\u00e1n's tempestuous mother Sarolt is suspicious of such pagan attitudes.\nLaborc arrives in Kopp\u00e1ny's name, proposing Sarolt a marriage with his lord (''Kopp\u00e1ny k\u00fcld\u00f6tt, j\u00f3 \u00farn\u0151m''). Kopp\u00e1ny hopes that by marrying G\u00e9za's widow, he may be accepted as his successor. Sarolt finds the proposal outrageous. Laborc is executed immediately.\n\nThe three noblemen start making fun of Kopp\u00e1ny in front of Istv\u00e1n, describing him as uncivilized and stupid (''Abc\u00fag Kopp\u00e1ny''). Istv\u00e1n is disgusted with them and chases them away.\n\nIstv\u00e1n is torn apart by the situation. His deep faith and his loyalty towards his family forbid him to fight, yet there don't seem to be any other possibilities. Sarolt admonishes him to be cunning. She tells him to prepare for war (''Istv\u00e1n fiam!'').\n\nGizella declares herself \"bored with politics\" and is upset with Istv\u00e1n: she would like them to have a baby. The German knight Vecellin is also rather unnerved by the fact that they have not yet started a war (''Unom a politik\u00e1t'').\n\nIn triumph, Istv\u00e1n is elected as the ruling prince of the Hungarians. The people hail him as their new lord (''Fejedelm\u00fcnk Istv\u00e1n!'').{{CN|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter the feast, Istv\u00e1n goes away to be alone. He is sad and undecided and converses with God about what to do. R\u00e9ka observes him. She is secretly in love with Istv\u00e1n - her father's archenemy -, yet has to keep her feelings secret (''Oly t\u00e1vol vagy t\u0151lem (\u00e9s m\u00e9gis k\u00f6zel)'').\n\n===Act III, ''Kopp\u00e1ny vez\u00e9r'' (Kopp\u00e1ny, the chief)===\nKopp\u00e1ny convokes his followers. He promises a glorious future to them and prepares them for the fight. The people respond enthusiastically (''Sz\u00e1llj fel, szabad mad\u00e1r'').\n\nKopp\u00e1ny sits in his tent with his three pretty young wives. They extol his qualities as a husband and lover and express their desire for him (''Te vagy a legszebb \u00e1lmunk''). Kopp\u00e1ny is rather distracted and he is soon unnerved by their chattering. He sends them away.\n\nThe three opportunists now appear in front of Kopp\u00e1ny. They propose him different ways of assassinating Istv\u00e1n (''Abc\u00fag Istv\u00e1n''). Kopp\u00e1ny sends them away - he wants to fight honorably. He also confirms this in front of the shaman Torda and the people - he wants to stand \"face to face\" with Istv\u00e1n and his army (''Szemt\u0151l szembe''). Torda prays to the pagan gods for victory and brings them sacrifice (''\u00c1ldozatunk fogadj\u00e1tok'').\n\nR\u00e9ka has had a nightmare in which she saw her father dead. She implores him not to pursue the conflict. Istv\u00e1n proposes Kopp\u00e1ny the crown if he submits to the Church of Rome. But Kopp\u00e1ny's hatred of priests and his determination to win the country are stronger. He tells them that it is \"too late\" for peace now (''Elk\u00e9sett b\u00e9kev\u00e1gy'').\n\nTorda presents Kopp\u00e1ny's followers the bloody sword, the symbol of war. If they win, Hungary will have a glorious future, he prophesies. The war breaks out and ends with Istv\u00e1n's victory (''V\u00e9res kardot hoztam/Vezess minket, Istv\u00e1n!'').\n\n===Act IV, ''Istv\u00e1n a kir\u00e1ly'' (Istv\u00e1n, the king)===\nKopp\u00e1ny's side has lost, he has died in battle. A singer laments the dead (''Gy\u00e1szba \u00f6lt\u00f6z\u00f6tt csillagom''). Istv\u00e1n's followers celebrate at his court. Everyone demands his due (''H\u00e1la n\u00e9ked, fejedelem!''). Finally, R\u00e9ka appears and asks Istv\u00e1n to give her her dead father's body. He is moved by her sorrow and beauty, but Sarolt brutally chases her away: Kopp\u00e1ny would be quartered, as a deterrent for potential rebels (''Halld meg uram, k\u00e9r\u00e9sem/Feln\u00e9gyelni!'').\n\nIstv\u00e1n is shattered and demands to be alone. He desperately prays to God (''Oly t\u00e1vol vagy t\u0151lem'' - reprise). Finally, he backs his mother's decision.\n\nKopp\u00e1ny's body is quartered (''Kopp\u00e1ny feln\u00e9gyel\u00e9se/Gloria gloria''). Finally, Istv\u00e1n is triumphally crowned king of Hungary (''Istv\u00e1n a kir\u00e1ly'').\n\n==Political background and interpretation==\n{{Essay-like|date=November 2008}}\nThe choice of a theme that was both strongly connected with national history and with the Christian religion seemed rather daring in the Hungary of the early 1980s. Furthermore, the topic of a fight between two antagonists for the country harkened back to the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956]] which had been crushed by [[Communism|Communist]] party chief [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], who was still in power at the time ''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' was written.\n\nOn the another hand, the fact that the character of Istv\u00e1n was presented as a thoughtful man who nevertheless does \"what a man`s gotta do\", made the interpretation that he stood for K\u00e1d\u00e1r who also \"had to do what he'd gotta do\" quite compelling for the regime. Though Istv\u00e1n's antagonist Kopp\u00e1ny is presented as a noble, honest soul, he could also be seen as being somewhat \"behind the times\", as a person who does not understand what the country needs most. In such an allegorical interpretation, the German knights and the Catholic priests could be put into parallel with the Soviet army stationed in Hungary, and the vital connection of Hungary with the papacy with the country's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nOn yet another hand, however, the rock opera can also be read as a subversive piece that introduced daring themes such as an open uprising against the state or religion into a mainstream theater piece. Especially among the minority Hungarians in the neighboring countries, ''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' was understood as an expression of nationhood and patriotism, explicitly spelled out in the last words of its last song: \"Sz\u00e9p Magyarorsz\u00e1g, \u00e9des haz\u00e1nk.\" (\"Beautiful Hungary, our sweet home.\")\n\n==''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' as a work of art==\n===Music===\nComposer Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi, who had already worked together with J\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy (lyrics) for more than two decades when they wrote ''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' (most famously in the bands [[Ill\u00e9s (band)|Ill\u00e9s]] and [[Fonogr\u00e1f]]), chose to characterize every major character and group in the play by its own style of music. Thus, the music of the rock opera encompasses a great variety of styles, ranging from [[Gregorian chant]] to [[hard rock]].\n\nIstv\u00e1n's hopes and fears are expressed in melodious [[pop music|pop]] songs, while Kopp\u00e1ny's power and determination is shown through rock pieces. R\u00e9ka is characterized by simple [[Folk music|folk]] tunes as a girl of the people (her part was sung by famous folk singer [[M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n]] in the original version - she is best known internationally from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' and for her frequent collaborations with the well-known folk music ensemble [[Muzsik\u00e1s]]). The priests and missionaries sing music akin to Gregorian chant. The mass scenes of the election in Act II and the coronation in Act IV soar to symphonical heights at some moments.\n\nThe transition from the old to the new is often compellingly expressed musically, for example in the funeral scene where a traditional Hungarian folk melody is blended into and then vanishes behind a Gregorian \"Kyrie eleison\".\n\nThe wide range of musical styles also explains the large [[orchestra]] that is needed for the opera - it has to encompass both most features of a classical orchestra and of a [[rock band]].\n\n===Lyrics===\nJ\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy has been acknowledged as one of the most talented lyrics writers of Hungary and ''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' was certainly written in his prime. His subtlety of characterization makes a one-sided interpretation difficult and contributes to the credibility of the characters. Especially the main characters Istv\u00e1n and Kopp\u00e1ny appear as complex figures: Istv\u00e1n as a pious, deeply affected, somewhat \"[[Hamlet]]-y\", yet finally determined man; Kopp\u00e1ny as a passionate character who knows what he wants, yet is not power-hungry, but is rather led by his respect for tradition and the fear that tradition would disappear through the \"foreigners\" Istv\u00e1n is bringing into the land.\n\nBr\u00f3dy, himself a [[secular]] [[Jew]], is especially subtle in his characterization of the [[Catholic Church]]. The rock opera can both be read as traditional \"priest criticism\", or as a piece that is deeply respectful of faith. In this way, directors are free to determine how to present and represent the priests and missionaries. The original version that was made into a 1984 film favored a neutral position in this respect.\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Istvan, a kiraly}}\n[[Category:1983 musicals]]\n[[Category:1984 albums]]\n[[Category:1984 films]]\n[[Category:Rock operas]]\n[[Category:Hungarian music]]\n[[Category:Hungarian musicals]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hungarian rock opera}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox musical\n| name          = Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly\n| subtitle      =\n| image         = File:Pels\u0151czy L\u00e1szl\u00f3 fortepan 125570.jpg\n| image_size    =\n| caption       =[[:hu:Pels\u0151czy L\u00e1szl\u00f3|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Pels\u0151czy ]] plays the title role of Stephen in Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly, which he played at the King's Hill and at the [[:hu:Szegedi Szabadt\u00e9ri J\u00e1t\u00e9kok|Szeged Open Air Festival]]\n| music         = Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi\n| lyrics        = [[J\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy]]\n| book          = J\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy <br> Boldizs\u00e1r Mikl\u00f3s\n| basis         = ''Ezredfordul\u00f3'' <br> by Boldizs\u00e1r Mikl\u00f3s\n| setting       = Hungary, cca. 1000\n| premiere_date = August 18, 1983\n| premiere_location =  [[City Park (Budapest)|V\u00e1rosliget]]\n| productions   =\n| awards        = <!-- Please do not include production-specific (acting, directing, etc.) awards -->\n}}\n'''''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly''''' (\"Stephen, the King\") is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[rock opera]] with music by Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi, lyrics by [[J\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy]] and book by Br\u00f3dy and Mikl\u00f3s Boldizs\u00e1r, based on the latter's play, ''Ezredfordul\u00f3''.\n\nThe musical is based on the life of [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen of Hungary]].

He was crowned the first king of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Dramatis personae===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n| ''[[Stephen I of Hungary|Istv\u00e1n]]''\n| Hungarian prince, later ruling prince of Hungary\n|-\n| ''[[Giselle of Bavaria|Gizella]]''\n| his wife, a Bavarian princess\n|-\n| ''[[Sarolt]]''\n| Istv\u00e1n's mother\n|-\n| ''[[Astrik|Asztrik]]''\n| bishop\n|-\n| ''Hont''\n| rowspan=3 | German knights\n|-\n| ''P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny''\n|-\n| ''[[Vecelin|Vecellin]]''\n|-\n| ''[[Kopp\u00e1ny]]''\n| a [[paganism|pagan]] relative of Istv\u00e1n's\n|-\n| ''R\u00e9ka''\n| Kopp\u00e1ny's daughter, a [[Christianity|Christian]]\n|-\n| ''Laborc''\n| a follower of Kopp\u00e1ny's\n|-\n| ''Torda''\n| a pagan [[shaman]]\n|-\n| ''Picur''\n| rowspan=3 | Kopp\u00e1ny's wives\n|-\n| ''Enik\u0151''\n|-\n| ''Bogl\u00e1rka''\n|-\n| ''S\u00far''\n| rowspan=3 | Hungarian noblemen, [[opportunist]]s\n|-\n| ''Solt''\n|-\n| ''Bese''\n|-\n| colspan=2 | people, followers, soldiers, priests\n|}\n\n''The piece is set in Hungary, around the year 1000.''\n\n===Act I, ''Az \u00f6r\u00f6ks\u00e9g'' (the heritage)===\nA singer sings about good leadership for the country and asks \"Whom would you choose?\" (''Te kit v\u00e1lasztan\u00e1l?'')\nThe ruling prince of Hungary, G\u00e9za, has invited Christian missionaries into the country (''Veni lumen cordium/T\u00f6ltsd el sz\u00edv\u00fcnk, f\u00e9nyess\u00e9g''). In order to strengthen ties with the West, his son Istv\u00e1n is marrying the Bavarian princess Gizella.\n\nS\u00far, Solt and Bese, a group of opportunist noblemen, talk about human frailty - every man chooses the side that seems the most promising. Principles are unimportant (''Gyarl\u00f3 az ember'').\n\nThe daughter of Istv\u00e1n's relative Kopp\u00e1ny, R\u00e9ka, has also converted to Christianity and is praying to the new God. Laborc, a follower of her father's, tells her they don't need a foreign god - she should rather trust her father (''Nem vagyunk m\u00e9g hozz\u00e1d m\u00e9lt\u00f3k/Nem kell olyan isten'').\n\nG\u00e9za has died, the country is in mourning (''G\u00e9za fejedelem temet\u00e9se - Kyrie eleison''). Istv\u00e1n promises at his grave to be a good prince to his people, yet he is defied by Kopp\u00e1ny, who claims to be the rightful successor of G\u00e9za's. The followers of both gather behind them and hail them (''Nincs m\u00e1s \u00fat csak az Isten \u00fatja'').\n\n===Act II, ''Esztergom''===\nR\u00e9ka, Gizella, the priests and the people are saddened and pray for peace (''Adj b\u00e9k\u00e9t Uram/Da pacem, Domine'').\n\nA group of singers hail Istv\u00e1n, yet they also sing about past glory (''\u00dcdv\u00f6z l\u00e9gyen G\u00e9za fia''). Istv\u00e1n's tempestuous mother Sarolt is suspicious of such pagan attitudes.\nLaborc arrives in Kopp\u00e1ny's name, proposing Sarolt a marriage with his lord (''Kopp\u00e1ny k\u00fcld\u00f6tt, j\u00f3 \u00farn\u0151m''). Kopp\u00e1ny hopes that by marrying G\u00e9za's widow, he may be accepted as his successor. Sarolt finds the proposal outrageous. Laborc is executed immediately.\n\nThe three noblemen start making fun of Kopp\u00e1ny in front of Istv\u00e1n, describing him as uncivilized and stupid (''Abc\u00fag Kopp\u00e1ny''). Istv\u00e1n is disgusted with them and chases them away.\n\nIstv\u00e1n is torn apart by the situation. His deep faith and his loyalty towards his family forbid him to fight, yet there don't seem to be any other possibilities. Sarolt admonishes him to be cunning. She tells him to prepare for war (''Istv\u00e1n fiam!'').\n\nGizella declares herself \"bored with politics\" and is upset with Istv\u00e1n: she would like them to have a baby. The German knight Vecellin is also rather unnerved by the fact that they have not yet started a war (''Unom a politik\u00e1t'').\n\nIn triumph, Istv\u00e1n is elected as the ruling prince of the Hungarians. The people hail him as their new lord (''Fejedelm\u00fcnk Istv\u00e1n!'').{{CN|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter the feast, Istv\u00e1n goes away to be alone. He is sad and undecided and converses with God about what to do. R\u00e9ka observes him. She is secretly in love with Istv\u00e1n - her father's archenemy -, yet has to keep her feelings secret (''Oly t\u00e1vol vagy t\u0151lem (\u00e9s m\u00e9gis k\u00f6zel)'').\n\n===Act III, ''Kopp\u00e1ny vez\u00e9r'' (Kopp\u00e1ny, the chief)===\nKopp\u00e1ny convokes his followers. He promises a glorious future to them and prepares them for the fight. The people respond enthusiastically (''Sz\u00e1llj fel, szabad mad\u00e1r'').\n\nKopp\u00e1ny sits in his tent with his three pretty young wives. They extol his qualities as a husband and lover and express their desire for him (''Te vagy a legszebb \u00e1lmunk''). Kopp\u00e1ny is rather distracted and he is soon unnerved by their chattering. He sends them away.\n\nThe three opportunists now appear in front of Kopp\u00e1ny. They propose him different ways of assassinating Istv\u00e1n (''Abc\u00fag Istv\u00e1n''). Kopp\u00e1ny sends them away - he wants to fight honorably. He also confirms this in front of the shaman Torda and the people - he wants to stand \"face to face\" with Istv\u00e1n and his army (''Szemt\u0151l szembe''). Torda prays to the pagan gods for victory and brings them sacrifice (''\u00c1ldozatunk fogadj\u00e1tok'').\n\nR\u00e9ka has had a nightmare in which she saw her father dead. She implores him not to pursue the conflict. Istv\u00e1n proposes Kopp\u00e1ny the crown if he submits to the Church of Rome. But Kopp\u00e1ny's hatred of priests and his determination to win the country are stronger. He tells them that it is \"too late\" for peace now (''Elk\u00e9sett b\u00e9kev\u00e1gy'').\n\nTorda presents Kopp\u00e1ny's followers the bloody sword, the symbol of war. If they win, Hungary will have a glorious future, he prophesies. The war breaks out and ends with Istv\u00e1n's victory (''V\u00e9res kardot hoztam/Vezess minket, Istv\u00e1n!'').\n\n===Act IV, ''Istv\u00e1n a kir\u00e1ly'' (Istv\u00e1n, the king)===\nKopp\u00e1ny's side has lost, he has died in battle. A singer laments the dead (''Gy\u00e1szba \u00f6lt\u00f6z\u00f6tt csillagom''). Istv\u00e1n's followers celebrate at his court. Everyone demands his due (''H\u00e1la n\u00e9ked, fejedelem!''). Finally, R\u00e9ka appears and asks Istv\u00e1n to give her her dead father's body. He is moved by her sorrow and beauty, but Sarolt brutally chases her away: Kopp\u00e1ny would be quartered, as a deterrent for potential rebels (''Halld meg uram, k\u00e9r\u00e9sem/Feln\u00e9gyelni!'').\n\nIstv\u00e1n is shattered and demands to be alone. He desperately prays to God (''Oly t\u00e1vol vagy t\u0151lem'' - reprise). Finally, he backs his mother's decision.\n\nKopp\u00e1ny's body is quartered (''Kopp\u00e1ny feln\u00e9gyel\u00e9se/Gloria gloria''). Finally, Istv\u00e1n is triumphally crowned king of Hungary (''Istv\u00e1n a kir\u00e1ly'').\n\n==Political background and interpretation==\n{{Essay-like|date=November 2008}}\nThe choice of a theme that was both strongly connected with national history and with the Christian religion seemed rather daring in the Hungary of the early 1980s. Furthermore, the topic of a fight between two antagonists for the country harkened back to the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956]] which had been crushed by [[Communism|Communist]] party chief [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], who was still in power at the time ''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' was written.\n\nOn the another hand, the fact that the character of Istv\u00e1n was presented as a thoughtful man who nevertheless does \"what a man`s gotta do\", made the interpretation that he stood for K\u00e1d\u00e1r who also \"had to do what he'd gotta do\" quite compelling for the regime. Though Istv\u00e1n's antagonist Kopp\u00e1ny is presented as a noble, honest soul, he could also be seen as being somewhat \"behind the times\", as a person who does not understand what the country needs most. In such an allegorical interpretation, the German knights and the Catholic priests could be put into parallel with the Soviet army stationed in Hungary, and the vital connection of Hungary with the papacy with the country's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nOn yet another hand, however, the rock opera can also be read as a subversive piece that introduced daring themes such as an open uprising against the state or religion into a mainstream theater piece. Especially among the minority Hungarians in the neighboring countries, ''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' was understood as an expression of nationhood and patriotism, explicitly spelled out in the last words of its last song: \"Sz\u00e9p Magyarorsz\u00e1g, \u00e9des haz\u00e1nk.\" (\"Beautiful Hungary, our sweet home.\")\n\n==''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' as a work of art==\n===Music===\nComposer Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi, who had already worked together with J\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy (lyrics) for more than two decades when they wrote ''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' (most famously in the bands [[Ill\u00e9s (band)|Ill\u00e9s]] and [[Fonogr\u00e1f]]), chose to characterize every major character and group in the play by its own style of music. Thus, the music of the rock opera encompasses a great variety of styles, ranging from [[Gregorian chant]] to [[hard rock]].\n\nIstv\u00e1n's hopes and fears are expressed in melodious [[pop music|pop]] songs, while Kopp\u00e1ny's power and determination is shown through rock pieces. R\u00e9ka is characterized by simple [[Folk music|folk]] tunes as a girl of the people (her part was sung by famous folk singer [[M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n]] in the original version - she is best known internationally from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' and for her frequent collaborations with the well-known folk music ensemble [[Muzsik\u00e1s]]). The priests and missionaries sing music akin to Gregorian chant. The mass scenes of the election in Act II and the coronation in Act IV soar to symphonical heights at some moments.\n\nThe transition from the old to the new is often compellingly expressed musically, for example in the funeral scene where a traditional Hungarian folk melody is blended into and then vanishes behind a Gregorian \"Kyrie eleison\".\n\nThe wide range of musical styles also explains the large [[orchestra]] that is needed for the opera - it has to encompass both most features of a classical orchestra and of a [[rock band]].\n\n===Lyrics===\nJ\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy has been acknowledged as one of the most talented lyrics writers of Hungary and ''Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly'' was certainly written in his prime. His subtlety of characterization makes a one-sided interpretation difficult and contributes to the credibility of the characters. Especially the main characters Istv\u00e1n and Kopp\u00e1ny appear as complex figures: Istv\u00e1n as a pious, deeply affected, somewhat \"[[Hamlet]]-y\", yet finally determined man; Kopp\u00e1ny as a passionate character who knows what he wants, yet is not power-hungry, but is rather led by his respect for tradition and the fear that tradition would disappear through the \"foreigners\" Istv\u00e1n is bringing into the land.\n\nBr\u00f3dy, himself a [[secular]] [[Jew]], is especially subtle in his characterization of the [[Catholic Church]]. The rock opera can both be read as traditional \"priest criticism\", or as a piece that is deeply respectful of faith. In this way, directors are free to determine how to present and represent the priests and missionaries. The original version that was made into a 1984 film favored a neutral position in this respect.\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Istvan, a kiraly}}\n[[Category:1983 musicals]]\n[[Category:1984 albums]]\n[[Category:1984 films]]\n[[Category:Rock operas]]\n[[Category:Hungarian music]]\n[[Category:Hungarian musicals]]\n", "name_user": "Evrik", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n,_a_kir%C3%A1ly"}
