The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011.  A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

It features former series regulars [[Sarah Jane Smith]], an investigative journalist played by [[Elisabeth Sladen]], and [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]], a [[Robot dog|robotic dog]] voiced by [[John Leeson]]. Both characters had been [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] of the [[Fourth Doctor]], but they had not appeared together before. The single episode, \"A Girl's Best Friend\", was broadcast by [[BBC One|BBC1]] as a Christmas special on 28 December 1981, but was not taken up for a continuing series.\n\n\"A Girl's Best Friend\" is set in the fictional English village of Moreton Harwood in 1981. In the programme, Sarah and K9 investigate the disappearance of Brendan Richards (Ian Sears), the ward of Sarah's Aunt Lavinia ([[Mary Wimbush]]), in the wake of increasing reports of witchcraft.\n\nUnder a different production team, the overall concept of a Sarah Jane and K9 series did eventually come to fruition: ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), featuring both of these key characters and actors (though K9 and Leeson only appear in some episodes).\n\n==Programme origins==\nThe programme has its roots firmly in the desire of ''Doctor Who'' producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] to get [[Elisabeth Sladen]] back into the [[TARDIS]]. He had wanted her to have the contract eventually awarded to [[Janet Fielding]] in late 1980. John Nathan-Turner's preferred plan for the transition from Baker to Davison was to have Sarah Jane be along for the ride from ''[[Logopolis]]'' to the second story of series 19. However, Sladen had no interest in returning simply to reprise a role and function identical to the one she had left years before.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan-Turner was trying to figure out what to do about K9. The robot dog was very popular among children but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.\n\n==\"A Girl's Best Friend\"==\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| serial_name        = A Girl's Best Friend\n| show               = K9C\n| type               = episode\n| image              =\n\n| cast               = \n*[[Elisabeth Sladen]] \u2013 [[Sarah Jane Smith]]\n*[[John Leeson]] \u2013 Voice of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K\u00b79]]\n| guests             = \n*[[Colin Jeavons]] \u2013 George Tracey\n*[[Bill Fraser]] \u2013 Bill Pollock\n*Nigel Gregory \u2013 Vince Wilson\n*[[Sean Chapman]] \u2013 Peter Tracey\n*[[Mary Wimbush]] \u2013 Aunt Lavinia\n*Ian Sears \u2013 Brendan Richards\n*Linda Polan \u2013 Juno Baker\n*Neville Barber \u2013 Howard Baker\n*[[John Quarmby]] \u2013 Henry Tobias\n*Gillian Martell \u2013 Lily Gregson\n*Stephen Oxley \u2013 P.C.

When she arrives at her aunt's house, though, she finds that her learned relative has left early for a lecture tour in America, Christmas notwithstanding. Sarah is thus left disappointed by the prospect of another holiday without family. Lavinia's ward, Brendan Richards, breaks her moment of reflection on her aunt's sudden disappearance. After picking him up from the railway station, they return to the house and discover a large crate that has been waiting for Sarah for a number of years. When they open it, they discover a mechanical dog named K9. Upon activation, it tells Sarah that it is a gift from the Doctor.\n\nBrendan's curiosity about K9 is matched only by Sarah's renewed concern over Lavinia's absence. They thus split up and follow their new-found obsessions. Sarah goes into town to question the locals, and Brendan stays behind to test the capabilities of Sarah's new \"pet\". In town, Sarah discovers that Lavinia has become disliked by some because of her blunt letters to the local newspaper editors about a growing practice of witchcraft in the area. Brendan, meanwhile, is attacked while using K9 to analyse soil samples in Lavinia's garden. His attackers, George Tracey and his son, Peter, are tied into the local [[coven]]. George Tracey flees before Brendan can get a good look at him, however K9 uses his laser gun to stun Peter before setting off in pursuit of George.  Peter is pinioned and interrogated by Brendan, but makes his escape when Brendan goes outside to investigate a crashing sound which turns out to be the accidental destruction of a greenhouse by K9 in his pursuit of the elder Tracey.\n\nSince Tracey is actually Lavinia's gardener, he is naturally called in the next morning to investigate the damage K9's pursuit of him caused to the greenhouse. After Brendan attempts to brag about the pH balance of the soil, Tracey sharply comments that gardening is more about respect for nature than scientific theory. Otherwise, though, he doesn't betray his more sinister intent towards Brendan. Later that night, he sends his son out to kidnap the sleeping Brendan from the house.\n\nThis time, Brendan's attacker is successful, stealing him out from under Sarah, who is elsewhere in the house, reading up on the local practice of witchcraft.\n\nSarah is now increasingly suspicious of Tracey, believing he would have the opportunity to commit the crime, even if she can't yet put her finger on the motive. She therefore finds a way to hide K9 in Tracey's house. K9 quietly monitors the household, until he eventually listens in on a conversation that implicates Tracey as a member of a coven. He also discovers that Tracey intends to kill Brendan in an act of [[ritual murder]].\n\nWhen Tracey leaves his cottage, Sarah is able to retrieve K9, who alerts his new mistress to the impending crime. She has no way to enlist the aid of the local police or, really anyone else in the town, because she can't substantiate her claim of overhearing the conversation without also then having to explain who and what the anachronistic K9 actually is.\n\nRealising that she and K9 are effectively on their own, she tries to figure out how to stop the sacrifice. Her first order of business is determining the ''when'' of it. Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter [[solstice]], now just a few short hours away. The ''where'' of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire looking at all the churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property. Rushing home, K9 and Sarah are briefly upset at missing something that was right under their noses all along.\n\nThey arrive just in time for K9 to use his blaster to stop the coven's Priest and Priestess from plunging a knife into Brendan's chest. Now stunned, the group's ringleaders are easily apprehended by the police.\n\nFinally able to celebrate Christmas, Sarah receives a call from her Aunt Lavinia. She's surprised that Sarah was worried about her, since she left instructions for her business partner to send Sarah a cable. As he turned out to be the High Priest of the coven, Sarah merely laughs and tells her aunt that she has a story to tell her about why that message never reached her. Meanwhile, K9 tries to connect with the human holiday in his own way, teaching himself to sing \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".\n\n==Production==\n {{Episode table\n   |background =\n   |series = 6 |title = 20 | aux1=6 | airdate = 10 | viewers = 6 | country = UK\n   |seriesT    = Episode\n   |aux1T      = Run time\n   |viewersR   = {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n   |episodes   =\n  {{Episode list/sublist|K-9 and Company\n   |EpisodeNumber      = 1\n   |Title              = A Girl's Best Friend\n   |RTitle             =\n   |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1981|12|28|df=y}}\n   |Viewers            = 8.4\n   |Aux1               = 50:00\n   |LineColor          =\n  }}\n  }}\n\n===Cast notes===\n[[Bill Fraser]] previously appeared with [[Tom Baker]] and K9 Mark II in the ''Doctor Who'' story ''[[Meglos]]''.\n\n===Theme music===\nMany ''Doctor Who'' fans remember \"A Girl's Best Friend\" most clearly for its electronic [[theme music]], composed by long-term ''Doctor Who'' enthusiast and record producer, [[Ian Levine]], with his musical partner [[Fiachra Trench]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138972/fullcredits |title=Full cast and crew for K-9 and Company |accessdate=2 January 2008 |work=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> Levine, who was also the unofficial continuity consultant for ''Doctor Who'' in the 1980s, said in an interview with ''[[Dreamwatch|Dreamwatch Bulletin]]'' that the music was intended to be an orchestral score, but was instead arranged directly from his electronic demonstration arrangement by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] (who also arranged the 1980s version of the [[Doctor Who theme music|''Doctor Who'' theme music]]) without Levine's knowledge.\n\n===Broadcast and production===\nThe viewing figures for the pilot were strong, achieving a viewership of about 8.4&nbsp;million Britons on its premi\u00e8re.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=k9 \n |title=K-9 and Company \n |accessdate=19 August 2006 \n |last=Lyon \n |first=Shaun \n |work=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617150033/http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=k9 \n |archivedate=17 June 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> This meant that it attracted more viewers than the average episode of ''Doctor Who'' during John Nathan-Turner's era as producer.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/epguide.php \n |title=Doctor Who Episode Guide \n |accessdate=19 August 2006 \n |last=Lyon \n |first=Shaun \n |work=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815090628/http://www.gallifreyone.com/epguide.php \n |archivedate=15 August 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>  It was even more popular than the other seasonal special of the era, ''The Five Doctors'', which posted a rating of 7.7.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=6k \n |title=The Five Doctors \n |accessdate=19 August 2006 \n |last=Lyon \n |first=Shaun \n |work=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617231709/http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=6k \n |archivedate=17 June 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>  Only when one looks narrowly at Season 19 \u2013 the one which immediately followed the broadcast of ''K-9 and Company'' \u2013 can one find a period where sustained ratings in the parent show were higher than the ratings for this spin-off pilot.\n\nDespite these above-average ratings, the show did not go to series.

It features former series regulars [[Sarah Jane Smith]], an investigative journalist played by [[Elisabeth Sladen]], and [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]], a [[Robot dog|robotic dog]] voiced by [[John Leeson]]. Both characters had been [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] of the [[Fourth Doctor]], but they had not appeared together before. The single episode, \"A Girl's Best Friend\", was broadcast by [[BBC One|BBC1]] as a Christmas special on 28 December 1981, but was not taken up for a continuing series.\n\n\"A Girl's Best Friend\" is set in the fictional English village of Moreton Harwood in 1981. In the programme, Sarah and K9 investigate the disappearance of Brendan Richards (Ian Sears), the ward of Sarah's Aunt Lavinia ([[Mary Wimbush]]), in the wake of increasing reports of witchcraft.\n\nUnder a different production team, the overall concept of a Sarah Jane and K9 series did eventually come to fruition: ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), featuring both of these key characters and actors (though K9 and Leeson only appear in some episodes).\n\n==Programme origins==\nThe programme has its roots firmly in the desire of ''Doctor Who'' producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] to get [[Elisabeth Sladen]] back into the [[TARDIS]]. He had wanted her to have the contract eventually awarded to [[Janet Fielding]] in late 1980. John Nathan-Turner's preferred plan for the transition from Baker to Davison was to have Sarah Jane be along for the ride from ''[[Logopolis]]'' to the second story of series 19. However, Sladen had no interest in returning simply to reprise a role and function identical to the one she had left years before.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan-Turner was trying to figure out what to do about K9. The robot dog was very popular among children but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.\n\n==\"A Girl's Best Friend\"==\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| serial_name        = A Girl's Best Friend\n| show               = K9C\n| type               = episode\n| image              =\n\n| cast               = \n*[[Elisabeth Sladen]] \u2013 [[Sarah Jane Smith]]\n*[[John Leeson]] \u2013 Voice of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K\u00b79]]\n| guests             = \n*[[Colin Jeavons]] \u2013 George Tracey\n*[[Bill Fraser]] \u2013 Bill Pollock\n*Nigel Gregory \u2013 Vince Wilson\n*[[Sean Chapman]] \u2013 Peter Tracey\n*[[Mary Wimbush]] \u2013 Aunt Lavinia\n*Ian Sears \u2013 Brendan Richards\n*Linda Polan \u2013 Juno Baker\n*Neville Barber \u2013 Howard Baker\n*[[John Quarmby]] \u2013 Henry Tobias\n*Gillian Martell \u2013 Lily Gregson\n*Stephen Oxley \u2013 P.C.

When she arrives at her aunt's house, though, she finds that her learned relative has left early for a lecture tour in America, Christmas notwithstanding. Sarah is thus left disappointed by the prospect of another holiday without family. Lavinia's ward, Brendan Richards, breaks her moment of reflection on her aunt's sudden disappearance. After picking him up from the railway station, they return to the house and discover a large crate that has been waiting for Sarah for a number of years. When they open it, they discover a mechanical dog named K9. Upon activation, it tells Sarah that it is a gift from the Doctor.\n\nBrendan's curiosity about K9 is matched only by Sarah's renewed concern over Lavinia's absence. They thus split up and follow their new-found obsessions. Sarah goes into town to question the locals, and Brendan stays behind to test the capabilities of Sarah's new \"pet\". In town, Sarah discovers that Lavinia has become disliked by some because of her blunt letters to the local newspaper editors about a growing practice of witchcraft in the area. Brendan, meanwhile, is attacked while using K9 to analyse soil samples in Lavinia's garden. His attackers, George Tracey and his son, Peter, are tied into the local [[coven]].

An important migration from North Africa across the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] also appears to have occurred before the formation of the Natufian.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.\n\n==Historical period==\nIn historical times, there has been a period of North African influence in southern Europe, especially western-southern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and parts of [[Southern Italy]] (namely Sicily), during various [[Muslim conquests]]. The genetic effect of this period on modern European populations is the subject of discussion (see below). In more recent history, the peoples of Europe and Africa came into contact during the [[European exploration of Africa|exploration]] and [[colonization of Africa]] and as a consequence of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name=\"malyarchuk2005\">{{Harvcoltxt|Malyarchuk|Czarny|2005}}</ref>\n\n==Assessing African genetic contributions in non-Africans==\nThe evolutionary forces that contribute to patterns of human genetic variation include new [[mutations]], [[natural selection]], [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[population bottleneck]]s, [[founder effects]], [[isolation by distance]], [[genetic admixture]] and barriers to [[gene flow]]. The most influential factors affecting human genetic variation are [[founder effects]] and [[isolation by distance]].<ref name=\"ramachandran\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramachandran S, Deshpande O, Roseman CC, Rosenberg NA, Feldman MW, Cavalli-Sforza LL | title = Support from the relationship of genetic and geographic distance in human populations for a serial founder effect originating in Africa | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 44 | pages = 15942\u20137 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16243969 | pmc = 1276087 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0507611102 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10215942R }}</ref><ref name=\"handley\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Handley LJ, Manica A, Goudet J, Balloux F | title = Going the distance: human population genetics in a clinal world | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 432\u20139 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17655965 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2007.07.002 | ref = harv | url = https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_B0CA510362E4.P001/REF.pdf }}</ref>\n\n[[Founder effect]] occurs when a population is established by a small number of individuals who have departed from a much larger population. Several generations after the population has expanded, individuals will still possess the limited gene pool of the founders. Therefore, founder effects result in a loss of [[genetic diversity]]. Genetic evidence suggests that the Out of Africa migration involved only small numbers of individuals. The African migrants carried a small subset of the prehistoric African genetic diversity, resulting in a founder effect on the non-African population. As humans spread across the globe populating Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, there were several founder effects. As a result of these [[serial founder effect]]s, genetic diversity tends to decrease with distance from Africa.<ref name=\"ramachandran\"/><ref name=\"handley\"/>\n\nThe other major factor contributing to patterns of human genetic variation is \"[[isolation by distance]]\". According to this model, populations that live near one another are more likely to exchange mates than populations that live farther apart. As a result, populations that live near one another are genetically more similar than populations that live far apart.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"280px\"\n|+''' Percentage genetic distances among major continents based on 120 classical polymorphisms{{Citation needed|reason=please provide citation for where the data in this table came from|date=February 2010}} '''\n!               ||Africa\t||\tOceania\t|| East Asia\t||\tEurope\n|-\n|Oceania\t||\t24.7    || \t\t||\t        ||\n|-\n|East Asia\t||\t20.6\t||\t10\t||\t        ||\n|-\n|Europe\t        ||\t16.6\t||\t13.5\t||\t9.7\t||\n|-\n|America\t||\t22.6\t||\t14.6\t||\t8.9\t||\t9.5\n|}\n[[Genetic distance]] is a measure used to compare the genetic relationship between populations. It is based on the principle that populations that share similar frequencies of a trait are more closely related than populations that have different frequencies of a trait. The genetic distance between two populations increases linearly with the geographic distance between them, due to [[isolation by distance]] and serial founder effects.<ref name=\"ramachandran\"/><ref name=\"handley\"/> [[Genetic admixture]] increases the genetic diversity of a population. When admixture occurs between populations, the genetic distance between the two populations is reduced.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}} applied genetic distance measures to various populations around the world to infer phylogenetic relationships (see Table on the right). All non-African populations are more closely related to one another (i.e. short genetic distance) than they are to African populations. This is consistent with a founder effect on the non-African population in that only a few individuals participated in the initial Out of Africa migration. The largest genetic distances observed are between Africa and Oceania and between Africa and the Americas. This is consistent with the isolation by distance and serial founder effects.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}} suggests that the genetic distance between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe is anomalously lower than it would be if the two populations had been evolving independently. The study suggests that the lower genetic distance between Europe and Africa can be explained by genetic admixture.\n\n===Defining African admixture===\nGenerally, markers and lineages used to characterize African admixture are those that are believed to be specific to Africa. There are also DNA polymorphisms that are shared between populations native to [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]], [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], such as the [[Y chromosome|y-chromosomal]] haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and the [[mitochondria]]l haplogroup [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]].<ref name=\"malyarchuk2005\"/><!---Note there are many more shared than these, some are or recent Eurasian origin in North Africa--->\n\nWith regard to the paternal haplogroup E1b1b and maternal haplogroup M1, derivatives of these clades have been observed in prehistoric human fossils excavated at the [[Ifri n'Amr or Moussa]] site in [[Morocco]], which have been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to the Early [[Neolithic]] period (ca. 5,000 BC). Ancient DNA analysis of these specimens indicates that they carried paternal haplotypes related to the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b1b1a]] (E-M81) subclade and the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U6a]] and [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]], all of which are frequent among present-day communities in the Maghreb. These ancient individuals also bore an autochthonous Maghrebi genomic component that peaks among modern [[Berbers]], indicating that they were ancestral to populations in the area. Additionally, fossils excavated at the [[Kelif el Boroud]] site near Rabat were found to carry the broadly-distributed paternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup T-M184|T-M184]] as well as the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K1]], [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T2]] and [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X2]], the latter of which were common mtDNA lineages in Neolithic [[Europe]] and [[Anatolia]]. These ancient individuals likewise bore the Berber-associated Maghrebi genomic component. This altogether indicates that the Late Neolithic Kelif el Boroud inhabitants were ancestral to contemporary populations in the area, but also likely experienced gene flow from Europe.<ref>{{cite biorxiv|last1=Fregel |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=Neolithization of North Africa involved the migration of people from both the Levant and Europe|biorxiv=191569}}</ref>\n\nOther lineages that are now found in Africa and Europe may have a common origin in Asia (e.g. Y haplogroups [[haplogroup R1 (Y-DNA)|R1]], and some paternal haplogroup [[haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|T]] and [[haplogroup U|U]] subclades).

E1b1a is closely related to E1b1b, the most frequent clade in Europe. E lineages that are not E1b1a or E1b1b could therefore reflect either a recent expansion associated with E1b1a or ancient population movements associated with E1b1b.

The authors suggest that this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than during the slave trade. According to {{harvcoltxt|Pereira|Cunha|Alves|Amorim|2005}}, the Sub-Saharan lineages found in Iberia matched lineages from diverse regions in Africa. They suggest this pattern is more compatible with a recent arrival of these lineages after slave trading began in the 15th century. According to the study,  alternative scenarios that invoke much older and demographically more significant introductions ({{Harvcoltxt|Gonz\u00e1lez|Brehm|P\u00e9rez|Maca-Meyer|2003}}) or that claim a substantial role of the Roman and/or Islamic periods on the introduction of Sub-Saharan lineages seem unlikely. {{Harvcoltxt|Casas|Hagelberg|Fregel|Larruga|2006}} extracted DNA from human remains that were exhumed from old burial sites in [[Al-Andalus]], Spain. The remains date to between the 12th and 13th centuries. The frequency of Sub-Saharan lineages detected in the medieval samples was 14.6% and 8.3% in the present population of [[Priego de Cordoba]].

The introduction of African markers could be due to the Phoenician colonization at the end of the second millennium B.C. or to the more recent Arab conquest (8th\u20139th centuries A.D.).\n\n===Sickle cell trait===\nSickle cell genes of African origin have been detected in Europe, mostly in the Mediterranean region. The [[sickle cell trait]] is associated with resistance to [[malaria]]. Individuals with one copy of the sickle cell gene, [[heterozygotes]], have higher resistance to malaria than individuals with no sickle cell genes. In regions affected by malaria, the fertility of sickle cell heterozygotes will be higher than average. Individuals with two copies of the sickle cell gene, [[homozygotes]], will be affected by [[sickle cell disease]] and historically have had lower than average fertility. The sickle cell trait is thus an example of [[heterozygote advantage]] which is subject to [[balancing selection]]. When the sickle cell trait is introduced into a region affected by malaria, balancing selection will, on one hand, act to increase the frequency of the trait to counter malaria. On the other hand, if the frequency of the trait in the population becomes high enough so that homozygotes with sickle cell disease become common, balancing selection will act to limit the spread of the trait. Therefore, in regions affected by malaria, the sickle cell trait is maintained at intermediate frequencies relative to the incidence of malaria.\n\nIn Africa, malaria is believed to be one of the most important factors that contributed to restricting population growth in prehistoric times. Sickle cell mutations are believed to have occurred independently at least five times. Four variants are of African origin and one of Indian/Arabian origin. The African variants are referred to as Cameroon, Senegal, Benin and Bantu. The emergence of the sickle cell trait would have contributed to population expansion, with the emergence of farming into tropical regions where malaria was endemic.\n\nArcheological and historical evidence suggests that malaria has been endemic in the\nMediterranean regions of Europe in historical times.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sallares R, Bouwman A, Anderung C | title = The spread of malaria to Southern Europe in antiquity: new approaches to old problems | journal = Medical History | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 311\u201328 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 16021928 | pmc = 547919 | doi = 10.1017/s0025727300007651 | ref = harv }}</ref> In eastern Mediterranean regions\u2014such as Italy, Greece, Albania, and Turkey\u2014the Benin haplotype is the most frequent sickle cell variant.

Some recent studies have focused on corroborating current genetic data with the archeological evidence from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.<ref name=lancaster/> The [[Natufian culture]], which existed about 12,000 years ago, has been the subject of various archeological investigations, as it is generally believed to be the source of the European and North African Neolithic.\n\nAccording to a hypothesis stated by {{Harvcoltxt|Bar-Yosef|1987}}, the [[Natufian culture]] emerged from the mixing of two Stone Age cultures:  (1) the [[Kebaran]], a culture indigenous to the Levant, and  (2) the [[Mushabian culture|Mushabian]], a culture introduced into the Levant from North Africa'''\u2020'''. It is suggested that the Mushabian culture originated in Africa, given that archeological sites with Mushabian industries in the Nile Valley predate those in the Levant'''\u2020'''. The Mushabians would have then moved into the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] from the Nile Delta bringing with them their technologies'''\u2020'''. {{Harvcoltxt|Bar-Yosef|1987}} states: \"the population overflow from Northeast Africa played a definite role in the establishment of the Natufian adaptation, which in turn led to the emergence of agriculture as a new subsistence system\".\n\nA study by {{Harvcoltxt|Brace|Seguchi|Quintyn|Fox|2006}} analysed human remains from the Natufian culture.\nAccording to the study, there is evidence of Sub-Saharan influences in the Natufian samples. They argue that these influences would have been diluted by the interbreeding of the Neolithic farmers from the Near East with the indigenous foragers in Europe. {{Harvcoltxt|Ricaut|Waelkens|2008}} associate the Sub-Saharan influences detected in the Natufian samples with the migration of [[E1b1b]] lineages from Northeast Africa to the Levant and then into Europe.\n\nAccording to the most recent ancient DNA analyses conducted by Lazaridis et al. (2016) on Natufian skeletal remains from present-day northern Israel, the Natufians in fact shared no evident genetic affinity to sub-Saharan Africans. The authors also state that they were unable to test for affinity in the Natufians to early North African populations using present-day North Africans as a reference because present-day North Africans owe most of their ancestry to back-migration from Eurasia.<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\"/><ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/06/16/059311.full.pdf (Quote:\"However, no affinity of Natufians to sub-Saharan Africans is evident in our genome-wide analysis, as present-day sub-Saharan Africans do not share more alleles with Natufians than with other ancient Eurasians (Extended Data Table 1).\")</ref> The Natufians carried the Y-DNA (paternal) haplogroups [[Haplogroup E-Z827#E-Z830 (E1b1b1b2)|E1b1b1b2(xE1b1b1b2a,E1b1b1b2b)]] (2/5; 40%), [[Haplogroup CT|CT]] (2/5; 40%), and [[Haplogroup E-P2|E1b1(xE1b1a1,E1b1b1b1)]] (1/5; 20%).<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\">{{cite biorxiv |last=Lazaridis |display-authors=et al.|first=Iosif|date=17 June 2016|title=The genetic structure of the world's first farmers|biorxiv=059311}} -- [http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/suppl/2016/06/16/059311.DC1/059311-1.pdf Table S6.1 - Y-chromosome haplogroups]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazaridis I | display-authors = etal | year = 2016 | title = Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 536 | issue = | pages = 419\u2013424 }}, Supplementary Table 1.</ref> In terms of autosomal DNA, these Natufians carried around 50% of the [[Basal Eurasian]] (BE) and 50% of Western Eurasian Unknown Hunter Gather (UHG) components.

An important migration from North Africa across the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] also appears to have occurred before the formation of the Natufian.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.\n\n==Historical period==\nIn historical times, there has been a period of North African influence in southern Europe, especially western-southern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and parts of [[Southern Italy]] (namely Sicily), during various [[Muslim conquests]]. The genetic effect of this period on modern European populations is the subject of discussion (see below). In more recent history, the peoples of Europe and Africa came into contact during the [[European exploration of Africa|exploration]] and [[colonization of Africa]] and as a consequence of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name=\"malyarchuk2005\">{{Harvcoltxt|Malyarchuk|Czarny|2005}}</ref>\n\n==Assessing African genetic contributions in non-Africans==\nThe evolutionary forces that contribute to patterns of human genetic variation include new [[mutations]], [[natural selection]], [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[population bottleneck]]s, [[founder effects]], [[isolation by distance]], [[genetic admixture]] and barriers to [[gene flow]].

Several generations after the population has expanded, individuals will still possess the limited gene pool of the founders. Therefore, founder effects result in a loss of [[genetic diversity]]. Genetic evidence suggests that the Out of Africa migration involved only small numbers of individuals. The African migrants carried a small subset of the prehistoric African genetic diversity, resulting in a founder effect on the non-African population. As humans spread across the globe populating Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, there were several founder effects. As a result of these [[serial founder effect]]s, genetic diversity tends to decrease with distance from Africa.<ref name=\"ramachandran\"/><ref name=\"handley\"/>\n\nThe other major factor contributing to patterns of human genetic variation is \"[[isolation by distance]]\". According to this model, populations that live near one another are more likely to exchange mates than populations that live farther apart. As a result, populations that live near one another are genetically more similar than populations that live far apart.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"280px\"\n|+''' Percentage genetic distances among major continents based on 120 classical polymorphisms{{Citation needed|reason=please provide citation for where the data in this table came from|date=February 2010}} '''\n!               ||Africa\t||\tOceania\t|| East Asia\t||\tEurope\n|-\n|Oceania\t||\t24.7    || \t\t||\t        ||\n|-\n|East Asia\t||\t20.6\t||\t10\t||\t        ||\n|-\n|Europe\t        ||\t16.6\t||\t13.5\t||\t9.7\t||\n|-\n|America\t||\t22.6\t||\t14.6\t||\t8.9\t||\t9.5\n|}\n[[Genetic distance]] is a measure used to compare the genetic relationship between populations. It is based on the principle that populations that share similar frequencies of a trait are more closely related than populations that have different frequencies of a trait. The genetic distance between two populations increases linearly with the geographic distance between them, due to [[isolation by distance]] and serial founder effects.<ref name=\"ramachandran\"/><ref name=\"handley\"/> [[Genetic admixture]] increases the genetic diversity of a population. When admixture occurs between populations, the genetic distance between the two populations is reduced.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}} applied genetic distance measures to various populations around the world to infer phylogenetic relationships (see Table on the right). All non-African populations are more closely related to one another (i.e. short genetic distance) than they are to African populations. This is consistent with a founder effect on the non-African population in that only a few individuals participated in the initial Out of Africa migration. The largest genetic distances observed are between Africa and Oceania and between Africa and the Americas. This is consistent with the isolation by distance and serial founder effects.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}} suggests that the genetic distance between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe is anomalously lower than it would be if the two populations had been evolving independently. The study suggests that the lower genetic distance between Europe and Africa can be explained by genetic admixture.\n\n===Defining African admixture===\nGenerally, markers and lineages used to characterize African admixture are those that are believed to be specific to Africa. There are also DNA polymorphisms that are shared between populations native to [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]], [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], such as the [[Y chromosome|y-chromosomal]] haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and the [[mitochondria]]l haplogroup [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]].<ref name=\"malyarchuk2005\"/><!---Note there are many more shared than these, some are or recent Eurasian origin in North Africa--->\n\nWith regard to the paternal haplogroup E1b1b and maternal haplogroup M1, derivatives of these clades have been observed in prehistoric human fossils excavated at the [[Ifri n'Amr or Moussa]] site in [[Morocco]], which have been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to the Early [[Neolithic]] period (ca. 5,000 BC). Ancient DNA analysis of these specimens indicates that they carried paternal haplotypes related to the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b1b1a]] (E-M81) subclade and the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U6a]] and [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]], all of which are frequent among present-day communities in the Maghreb. These ancient individuals also bore an autochthonous Maghrebi genomic component that peaks among modern [[Berbers]], indicating that they were ancestral to populations in the area. Additionally, fossils excavated at the [[Kelif el Boroud]] site near Rabat were found to carry the broadly-distributed paternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup T-M184|T-M184]] as well as the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K1]], [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T2]] and [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X2]], the latter of which were common mtDNA lineages in Neolithic [[Europe]] and [[Anatolia]]. These ancient individuals likewise bore the Berber-associated Maghrebi genomic component. This altogether indicates that the Late Neolithic Kelif el Boroud inhabitants were ancestral to contemporary populations in the area, but also likely experienced gene flow from Europe.<ref>{{cite biorxiv|last1=Fregel |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=Neolithization of North Africa involved the migration of people from both the Levant and Europe|biorxiv=191569}}</ref>\n\nOther lineages that are now found in Africa and Europe may have a common origin in Asia (e.g. Y haplogroups [[haplogroup R1 (Y-DNA)|R1]], and some paternal haplogroup [[haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|T]] and [[haplogroup U|U]] subclades).

E1b1a is closely related to E1b1b, the most frequent clade in Europe. E lineages that are not E1b1a or E1b1b could therefore reflect either a recent expansion associated with E1b1a or ancient population movements associated with E1b1b.

The authors suggest that this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than during the slave trade. According to {{harvcoltxt|Pereira|Cunha|Alves|Amorim|2005}}, the Sub-Saharan lineages found in Iberia matched lineages from diverse regions in Africa. They suggest this pattern is more compatible with a recent arrival of these lineages after slave trading began in the 15th century. According to the study,  alternative scenarios that invoke much older and demographically more significant introductions ({{Harvcoltxt|Gonz\u00e1lez|Brehm|P\u00e9rez|Maca-Meyer|2003}}) or that claim a substantial role of the Roman and/or Islamic periods on the introduction of Sub-Saharan lineages seem unlikely. {{Harvcoltxt|Casas|Hagelberg|Fregel|Larruga|2006}} extracted DNA from human remains that were exhumed from old burial sites in [[Al-Andalus]], Spain. The remains date to between the 12th and 13th centuries. The frequency of Sub-Saharan lineages detected in the medieval samples was 14.6% and 8.3% in the present population of [[Priego de Cordoba]].

The introduction of African markers could be due to the Phoenician colonization at the end of the second millennium B.C. or to the more recent Arab conquest (8th\u20139th centuries A.D.).\n\n===Sickle cell trait===\nSickle cell genes of African origin have been detected in Europe, mostly in the Mediterranean region. The [[sickle cell trait]] is associated with resistance to [[malaria]]. Individuals with one copy of the sickle cell gene, [[heterozygotes]], have higher resistance to malaria than individuals with no sickle cell genes. In regions affected by malaria, the fertility of sickle cell heterozygotes will be higher than average. Individuals with two copies of the sickle cell gene, [[homozygotes]], will be affected by [[sickle cell disease]] and historically have had lower than average fertility. The sickle cell trait is thus an example of [[heterozygote advantage]] which is subject to [[balancing selection]]. When the sickle cell trait is introduced into a region affected by malaria, balancing selection will, on one hand, act to increase the frequency of the trait to counter malaria. On the other hand, if the frequency of the trait in the population becomes high enough so that homozygotes with sickle cell disease become common, balancing selection will act to limit the spread of the trait. Therefore, in regions affected by malaria, the sickle cell trait is maintained at intermediate frequencies relative to the incidence of malaria.\n\nIn Africa, malaria is believed to be one of the most important factors that contributed to restricting population growth in prehistoric times. Sickle cell mutations are believed to have occurred independently at least five times. Four variants are of African origin and one of Indian/Arabian origin. The African variants are referred to as Cameroon, Senegal, Benin and Bantu. The emergence of the sickle cell trait would have contributed to population expansion, with the emergence of farming into tropical regions where malaria was endemic.\n\nArcheological and historical evidence suggests that malaria has been endemic in the\nMediterranean regions of Europe in historical times.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sallares R, Bouwman A, Anderung C | title = The spread of malaria to Southern Europe in antiquity: new approaches to old problems | journal = Medical History | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 311\u201328 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 16021928 | pmc = 547919 | doi = 10.1017/s0025727300007651 | ref = harv }}</ref> In eastern Mediterranean regions\u2014such as Italy, Greece, Albania, and Turkey\u2014the Benin haplotype is the most frequent sickle cell variant.

Some recent studies have focused on corroborating current genetic data with the archeological evidence from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.<ref name=lancaster/> The [[Natufian culture]], which existed about 12,000 years ago, has been the subject of various archeological investigations, as it is generally believed to be the source of the European and North African Neolithic.\n\nAccording to a hypothesis stated by {{Harvcoltxt|Bar-Yosef|1987}}, the [[Natufian culture]] emerged from the mixing of two Stone Age cultures:  (1) the [[Kebaran]], a culture indigenous to the Levant, and  (2) the [[Mushabian culture|Mushabian]], a culture introduced into the Levant from North Africa'''\u2020'''. It is suggested that the Mushabian culture originated in Africa, given that archeological sites with Mushabian industries in the Nile Valley predate those in the Levant'''\u2020'''. The Mushabians would have then moved into the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] from the Nile Delta bringing with them their technologies'''\u2020'''. {{Harvcoltxt|Bar-Yosef|1987}} states: \"the population overflow from Northeast Africa played a definite role in the establishment of the Natufian adaptation, which in turn led to the emergence of agriculture as a new subsistence system\".\n\nA study by {{Harvcoltxt|Brace|Seguchi|Quintyn|Fox|2006}} analysed human remains from the Natufian culture.\nAccording to the study, there is evidence of Sub-Saharan influences in the Natufian samples. They argue that these influences would have been diluted by the interbreeding of the Neolithic farmers from the Near East with the indigenous foragers in Europe. {{Harvcoltxt|Ricaut|Waelkens|2008}} associate the Sub-Saharan influences detected in the Natufian samples with the migration of [[E1b1b]] lineages from Northeast Africa to the Levant and then into Europe.\n\nAccording to the most recent ancient DNA analyses conducted by Lazaridis et al. (2016) on Natufian skeletal remains from present-day northern Israel, the Natufians in fact shared no evident genetic affinity to sub-Saharan Africans. The authors also state that they were unable to test for affinity in the Natufians to early North African populations using present-day North Africans as a reference because present-day North Africans owe most of their ancestry to back-migration from Eurasia.<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\"/><ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/06/16/059311.full.pdf (Quote:\u201dHowever, no affinity of Natufians to sub-Saharan Africans is evident in our genome-wide analysis, as present-day sub-Saharan Africans do not share more alleles with Natufians than with other ancient Eurasians (Extended Data Table 1).\u201d)</ref> The Natufians carried the Y-DNA (paternal) haplogroups [[Haplogroup E-Z827#E-Z830 (E1b1b1b2)|E1b1b1b2(xE1b1b1b2a,E1b1b1b2b)]] (2/5; 40%), [[Haplogroup CT|CT]] (2/5; 40%), and [[Haplogroup E-P2|E1b1(xE1b1a1,E1b1b1b1)]] (1/5; 20%).<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\">{{cite biorxiv |last=Lazaridis |display-authors=et al.|first=Iosif|date=17 June 2016|title=The genetic structure of the world's first farmers|biorxiv=059311}} -- [http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/suppl/2016/06/16/059311.DC1/059311-1.pdf Table S6.1 - Y-chromosome haplogroups]</ref><ref>Lazaridis, Iosif et al.

The German renaissance artist is credited with first describing the technique.]]\n{{Expand section|date=September 2019}}\nThe idea of ray tracing comes from as early as 16<sup>th</sup> century when it was described by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], who is credited for its invention.<ref name=\"raytracing\">{{Cite journal|title=Who invented ray tracing?|author=Georg Rainer Hofmann|journal=The Visual Computer|volume=6|issue=3|pages=120\u2013124|year=1990|doi=10.1007/BF01911003}}.</ref> In 1982, Scott Roth used the related term ''[[ray casting]]'' in the context of [[computer graphics]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Algorithm overview==\n[[File:Ray trace diagram.svg|right|thumb|300px|The ray-tracing algorithm builds an image by extending rays into a scene and bouncing them off surfaces and towards sources of light to approximate the color value of pixels.]]\n[[File:Ray Tracing Illustration First Bounce.png|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of the ray-tracing algorithm for one pixel (up to the first bounce)]]\nOptical ray tracing describes a method for producing visual images constructed in [[3D computer graphics]] environments, with more photorealism than either [[ray casting]] or [[scanline rendering]] techniques. It works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each [[pixel]] in a virtual screen, and calculating the color of the object visible through it.\n\nScenes in ray tracing are described mathematically by a programmer or by a visual artist (typically using intermediary tools). Scenes may also incorporate data from images and models captured by means such as digital photography.\n\nTypically, each ray must be tested for intersection with some subset of all the objects in the scene. Once the nearest object has been identified, the algorithm will estimate the incoming [[Computer graphics lighting|light]] at the point of intersection, examine the material properties of the object, and combine this information to calculate the final color of the pixel. Certain illumination algorithms and reflective or translucent materials may require more rays to be re-cast into the scene.\n\nIt may at first seem counterintuitive or \"backward\" to send rays ''away'' from the camera, rather than ''into'' it (as actual light does in reality), but doing so is many orders of magnitude more efficient. Since the overwhelming majority of light rays from a given light source do not make it directly into the viewer's eye, a \"forward\" simulation could potentially waste a tremendous amount of computation on light paths that are never recorded.\n\nTherefore, the shortcut taken in ray tracing is to presuppose that a given ray intersects the view frame. After either a maximum number of reflections or a ray traveling a certain distance without intersection, the ray ceases to travel and the pixel's value is updated.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Calculate rays for rectangular viewport ===\n\n{{technical|date=March 2020}}\nOn input we have (in calculation we use vector [[Euclidean vector#Length|normalization]] and [[cross product]]):\n\n* <math>E \\in \\mathbb{R^3}</math> eye position\n* <math>T \\in \\mathbb{R^3}</math> target position\n* <math>\\theta \\in [0,\\pi] </math> [[field of view]] - for human we can assume <math>\\approx \\pi/2 \\text{ rad}= 90^\\circ</math>\n* <math>m,k \\in \\mathbb{N}</math> numbers of square pixels on viewport vertical and horizontal direction \n* <math>i,j  \\in \\mathbb{N}, 1\\leq i\\leq k \\land 1\\leq j\\leq m </math> numbers of actual pixel \n* <math>\\vec w \\in \\mathbb{R^3}</math> vertical vector which indicates where is up and down, usually <math>\\vec w = [0,1,0]</math> (not visible on picture) - [[:simple:Pitch, yaw, and roll|roll]] component which determine viewport rotation around point C (where the axis of rotation is the ET section)\n\n[[File:RaysViewportSchema.png|708px|Viewport schema witch pixels, eye E and target T, viewport center C]]\n\nThe idea is to find the position of each viewport pixel center  <math>P_{ij}</math> which allows us to find the line going from eye <math>E</math> through that pixel and finally get the ray described by point <math>E</math> and vector <math>\\vec R_{ij} = P_{ij} -E </math> (or its normalisation <math>\\vec r_{ij}</math>).

One can think of this \"ray\" as a stream of [[photon]]s traveling along the same path.  In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line (ignoring [[general relativity|relativistic effects]]). Any combination of four things might happen with this light ray: [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]] and [[fluorescence]].  A surface may absorb part of the light ray, resulting in a loss of intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light.  It might also reflect all or part of the light ray, in one or more directions. If the surface has any [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Transparency (optics)|translucent]] properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the [[Visible spectrum|spectrum]] (and possibly altering the color). Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more.  A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of the incoming rays.  Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.\n\n===Ray casting algorithm===\n{{Main|Ray casting}}\n\nThe first ray tracing algorithm used for rendering was presented by [[Arthur Appel]] in 1968.<ref>Appel A. (1968) ''[http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/Appel.pdf Some techniques for shading machine renderings of solids]''.  AFIPS Conference Proc. 32 pp.37-45</ref> This algorithm has since been termed \"[[ray casting]]\". The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray. Think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel.  This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel.  Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the [[shading]] of this object.  The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow.  The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models.  One important advantage ray casting offered over older [[scanline rendering|scanline algorithms]] was its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as [[cone (geometry)|cones]] and [[sphere]]s. If a mathematical surface can be intersected by a ray, it can be rendered using ray casting. Elaborate objects can be created by using [[solid modeling]] techniques and easily rendered.\n\n===Recursive ray tracing algorithm===\n[[File:Glasses 800 edit.png|right|thumb|300px|Ray tracing can create realistic-looking images.]]\n[[File:BallsRender.png|right|thumb|300px|In addition to the high degree of realism, ray tracing can simulate the [[Camera#Mechanics|effects of a camera]] due to [[depth of field]] and [[aperture]] shape (in this case a [[hexagon]]).]]\n[[File:Ray-traced steel balls.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The number of reflections, or bounces, a \u201cray\u201d can make, and how it is affected each time it encounters a surface, is controlled by settings in the software.

Here, each ray was set to refract or reflect (the \"depth\") ''up to 9 times''. [[Fresnel reflection]]s were used and [[Caustic (optics)|caustics]] are visible. (Image created with [[V-Ray]].)]]\n\nThe next important research breakthrough came from [[Turner Whitted]] in 1979.<ref>Whitted T. (1979) ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.156.1534 An improved illumination model for shaded display]''.  Proceedings of the 6th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques</ref> Previous algorithms traced rays from the eye into the scene until they hit an object, but determined the ray color without recursively tracing more rays.  Whitted continued the process.  When a ray hits a surface, it can generate up to three new types of rays: reflection, refraction, and shadow.<ref>{{cite journal | url = https://dip.felk.cvut.cz/browse/pdfcache/nikodtom_2010bach.pdf | title = Ray Tracing Algorithm For Interactive Applications | author = Tomas Nikodym | journal = Czech Technical University, FEE | date = June 2010 }}</ref> A reflection ray is traced in the mirror-reflection direction. The closest object it intersects is what will be seen in the reflection.  Refraction rays traveling through transparent material work similarly, with the addition that a refractive ray could be entering or exiting a material.  A shadow ray is traced toward each light. If any opaque object is found between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and the light does not illuminate it.  This recursive ray tracing added more realism to ray traced images.\n\n===Advantages over other rendering methods===\nRay tracing-based rendering's popularity stems from its basis in a realistic simulation of [[Computer graphics lighting|light transport]], as compared to other rendering methods, such as [[rasterisation|rasterization]], which focuses more on the realistic simulation of geometry. Effects such as reflections and [[shadow]]s, which are difficult to simulate using other algorithms, are a natural result of the ray tracing algorithm. The computational independence of each ray makes ray tracing amenable to a basic level of [[parallelization]],<ref>J.-C. Nebel. A New Parallel Algorithm Provided by a Computation Time Model, Eurographics Workshop on Parallel Graphics and Visualisation, 24\u201325 September 1998, Rennes, France.</ref><ref>A. Chalmers, T. Davis, and E. Reinhard. Practical parallel rendering, {{ISBN|1-56881-179-9}}. AK Peters, Ltd., 2002.</ref> but the divergence of ray paths makes high utilization under parallelism quite difficult to achieve in practice.<ref>Aila, Timo and Samulii Laine, Understanding the Efficiency of Ray Traversal on GPUs, High Performance Graphics 2009, New Orleans, LA.</ref>\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nA serious disadvantage of ray tracing is performance (though it can in theory be faster than traditional scanline rendering depending on scene complexity vs. number of pixels on-screen). Until the late 2010s, ray tracing in real time was usually considered impossible on consumer hardware for nontrivial tasks. Scanline algorithms and other algorithms use data coherence to share computations between pixels, while ray tracing normally starts the process anew, treating each eye ray separately. However, this separation offers other advantages, such as the ability to shoot more rays as needed to perform [[spatial anti-aliasing]] and improve image quality where needed.\n\nAlthough it does handle interreflection and optical effects such as refraction accurately, traditional ray tracing is also not necessarily [[photorealistic rendering|photorealistic]]. True photorealism occurs when the [[rendering equation]] is closely approximated or fully implemented. Implementing the rendering equation gives true photorealism, as the equation describes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is usually infeasible given the computing resources required.\n\nThe realism of all rendering methods can be evaluated as an approximation to the equation. Ray tracing, if it is limited to Whitted's algorithm, is not necessarily the most realistic. Methods that trace rays, but include additional techniques ([[photon mapping]], [[path tracing]]), give a far more accurate simulation of real-world lighting.\n\n===Reversed direction of traversal of scene by the rays===\nThe process of shooting rays from the eye to the light source to render an image is sometimes called ''backwards ray tracing'', since it is the opposite direction photons actually travel. However, there is confusion with this terminology. Early ray tracing was always done from the eye, and early researchers such as [[James Arvo]] used the term ''backwards ray tracing'' to mean shooting rays from the lights and gathering the results.  Therefore, it is clearer to distinguish ''eye-based'' versus ''light-based'' ray tracing.\n\nWhile the direct illumination is generally best sampled using eye-based ray tracing, certain indirect effects can benefit from rays generated from the lights. [[Caustic (optics)|Caustics]] are bright patterns caused by the focusing of light off a wide reflective region onto a narrow area of (near-)diffuse surface.  An algorithm that casts rays directly from lights onto reflective objects, tracing their paths to the eye, will better sample this phenomenon. This integration of eye-based and light-based rays is often expressed as bidirectional path tracing, in which paths are traced from both the eye and lights, and the paths subsequently joined by a connecting ray after some length.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~eric/Portugal.html | title = Bi-Directional Path Tracing | author = Eric P.

In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points.<ref>[http://graphics.ucsd.edu/~henrik/papers/photon_map/global_illumination_using_photon_maps_egwr96.pdf Global Illumination using Photon Maps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808140048/http://graphics.ucsd.edu/~henrik/papers/photon_map/global_illumination_using_photon_maps_egwr96.pdf |date=2008-08-08 }}</ref><ref>[http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~emmanuel/courses/cs563/write_ups/zackw/photon_mapping/PhotonMapping.html Photon Mapping - Zack Waters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional path tracing is the ability to achieve significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias.\n\nAn additional problem occurs when light must pass through a very narrow aperture to illuminate the scene (consider a darkened room, with a door slightly ajar leading to a brightly lit room), or a scene in which most points do not have direct line-of-sight to any light source (such as with ceiling-directed light fixtures or [[torchiere]]s). In such cases, only a very small subset of paths will transport energy; [[Metropolis light transport]] is a method which begins with a random search of the path space, and when energetic paths are found, reuses this information by exploring the nearby space of rays.<ref>http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/metro/metro.pdf</ref>\n\n[[File:PathOfRays.svg|thumb|Image showing recursively generated rays from the \"eye\" (and through an image plane) to a light source after encountering two [[Diffuse surface|diffuse surfaces]].]]\nTo the right is an image showing a simple example of a path of rays recursively generated from the camera (or eye) to the light source using the above algorithm. A diffuse surface reflects light in all directions.\n\nFirst, a ray is created at an eyepoint and traced through a pixel and into the scene, where it hits a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where it hits another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where it hits the light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on the colors of the first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example, if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces were blue, then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.\n\n===Example===\n{{duplication|dupe=Line\u2013sphere intersection|section=yes|date=May 2014}}\n\nAs a demonstration of the principles involved in ray tracing, consider how one would find the intersection between a ray and a sphere. This is merely the math behind the [[line\u2013sphere intersection]] and the subsequent determination of the colour of the pixel being calculated. There is, of course, far more to the general process of ray tracing, but this demonstrates an example of the algorithms used.\n\nIn [[vector notation]], the equation of a sphere with center <math>\\mathbf c</math> and radius <math>r</math> is\n\n:<math>\\left\\Vert \\mathbf x - \\mathbf c \\right\\Vert^2=r^2.</math>\n\nAny point on a ray starting from point <math>\\mathbf s</math> with direction <math>\\mathbf d</math> (here <math>\\mathbf d</math> is a [[unit vector]]) can be written as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x=\\mathbf s+t\\mathbf d,</math>\n\nwhere <math> t</math> is its distance between <math>\\mathbf x</math> and <math>\\mathbf s</math>.  In our problem, we know <math>\\mathbf c</math>,  <math>r</math>, <math>\\mathbf s</math> (e.g. the position of a light source) and <math>\\mathbf d</math>, and we need to find <math> t</math>. Therefore, we substitute for <math>\\mathbf x</math>:\n\n:<math>\\left\\Vert\\mathbf{s}+t\\mathbf{d}-\\mathbf{c}\\right\\Vert^{2}=r^2.</math>\n\nLet <math>\\mathbf{v}\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\mathbf{s}-\\mathbf{c}</math> for simplicity; then\n\n:<math>\\left\\Vert\\mathbf{v}+t\\mathbf{d}\\right\\Vert^{2}=r^{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}^2+t^2\\mathbf{d}^2+2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot t\\mathbf{d}=r^2</math>\n\n:<math>(\\mathbf{d}^2)t^2+(2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})t+(\\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)=0.</math>\n\nKnowing that d is a unit vector allows us this minor simplification:\n\n:<math>t^2+(2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})t+(\\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)=0.</math>\n\nThis [[quadratic equation]] has solutions\n:<math>t=\\frac{-(2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})^2-4(\\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)}}{2}=-(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})\\pm\\sqrt{(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})^2-(\\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)}.</math>\n\nThe two values of <math>t</math> found by solving this equation are the two ones such that <math>\\mathbf s+t\\mathbf d</math> are the points where the ray intersects the sphere.\n\nAny value which is negative does not lie on the ray, but rather in the opposite [[Line (mathematics)|half-line]] (i.e. the one starting from <math>\\mathbf s</math> with opposite direction).\n\nIf the quantity under the square root ( the [[quadratic equation#Discriminant|discriminant]] )  is negative, then the ray does not intersect the sphere.\n\nLet us suppose now that there is at least a positive solution, and let <math>t</math> be the minimal one. In addition, let us suppose that the sphere is the nearest object on our scene intersecting our ray, and that it is made of a reflective material. We need to find in which direction the light ray is reflected. The laws of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] state that the angle of reflection is equal and opposite to the angle of incidence between the incident ray and the [[surface normal|normal]] to the sphere.\n\nThe normal to the sphere is simply\n\n:<math>\\mathbf n=\\frac{\\mathbf y- \\mathbf c}{\\left\\Vert\\mathbf y- \\mathbf c\\right\\Vert},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf y=\\mathbf s+t\\mathbf d</math> is the intersection point found before. The reflection direction can be found by a [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] of <math>\\mathbf d</math> with respect to <math>\\mathbf n</math>, that is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf r = \\mathbf d - 2(\\mathbf n \\cdot \\mathbf d ) \\mathbf n.</math>\n\nThus the reflected ray has equation\n\n: <math>\\mathbf x = \\mathbf y  + u \\mathbf r. \\, </math>\n\nNow we only need to compute the intersection of the latter ray with our [[field of view]], to get the pixel which our reflected light ray will hit. Lastly, this pixel is set to an appropriate color, taking into account how the color of the original light source and the one of the sphere are combined by the reflection.\n\n==Adaptive depth control==\nAdaptive depth control means that the renderer stops generating reflected/transmitted rays when the computed intensity becomes less than a certain threshold. There must always be a set maximum depth or else the program would generate an infinite number of rays. But it is not always necessary to go to the maximum depth if the surfaces are not highly reflective. To test for this the ray tracer must compute and keep the product of the global and reflection coefficients as the rays are traced.\n\nExample: let Kr = 0.5 for a set of surfaces. Then from the first surface the maximum contribution is 0.5, for the reflection from the second: 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.25, the third: 0.25 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.125, the fourth: 0.125 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.0625, the fifth: 0.0625 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.03125, etc. In addition we might implement a distance attenuation factor such as 1/D2, which would also decrease the intensity contribution.\n\nFor a transmitted ray we could do something similar but in that case the distance traveled through the object would cause even faster intensity decrease. As an example of this, Hall & Greenberg found that even for a very reflective scene, using this with a maximum depth of 15 resulted in an average ray tree depth of 1.7.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Roy A.|last2=Greenberg|first2=Donald P.|date=November 1983|title=A Testbed for Realistic Image Synthesis|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=3|issue=8|pages=10\u201320|doi=10.1109/MCG.1983.263292|citeseerx=10.1.1.131.1958}}</ref>\n\n==Bounding volumes==\nWe enclose groups of objects in sets of [[Bounding volume hierarchy|hierarchical bounding volumes]] and first test for intersection with the [[bounding volume]], and then only if there is an intersection, against the objects enclosed by the volume.\n\nBounding volumes should be easy to test for intersection, for example a sphere or box (slab). The best bounding volume will be determined by the shape of the underlying object or objects. For example, if the objects are long and thin then a sphere will enclose mainly empty space and a box is much better. Boxes are also easier for hierarchical bounding volumes.\n\nNote that using a hierarchical system like this (assuming it is done carefully) changes the intersection computational time from a linear dependence on the number of objects to something between linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, and we would have a binary tree type structure. Spatial subdivision methods, discussed below, try to achieve this.\n\nKay & Kajiya give a list of desired properties for hierarchical bounding volumes:\n\n* Subtrees should contain objects that are near each other and the further down the tree the closer should be the objects.\n* The volume of each node should be minimal.\n* The sum of the volumes of all bounding volumes should be minimal.\n* Greater attention should be placed on the nodes near the root since pruning a branch near the root will remove more potential objects than one farther down the tree.\n* The time spent constructing the hierarchy should be much less than the time saved by using it.\n\n==Interactive ray tracing{{anchor|In real time}}==\n{{See also|Ray-tracing hardware}}\nThe first implementation of an interactive ray tracer was the [[Supercomputing in Japan|LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System]] built in 1982 at [[Osaka University]]'s School of Engineering, by professors Ohmura Kouichi, Shirakawa Isao and Kawata Toru with 50 students.{{Citation needed|reason=There were other real-time ray tracing claims researched for and discussed at SIGGRAPH 2005, but none could be proven prior to 1986.

Initially published in 1987 at [[USENIX]], the BRL-CAD ray tracer was an early implementation of a parallel network distributed ray tracing system that achieved several frames per second in rendering performance.<ref>See Proceedings of 4th Computer Graphics Workshop, Cambridge, MA, USA, October 1987.

The technique is capable of producing a high degree of visual realism, more so than typical [[scanline rendering]] methods, but at a greater [[computation time|computational cost]]. This makes ray tracing best suited for applications where taking a relatively long time to render can be tolerated, such as in still computer-generated images, and film and television [[visual effects]] (VFX), but more poorly suited to [[real-time computer graphics|real-time]] applications such as [[video game]]s, where [[Frame rate|speed is critical]] in rendering each [[Film frame|frame]].\n\nRay tracing is capable of simulating a variety of [[Optics|optical]] effects, such as [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]], [[Light scattering|scattering]], and [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] phenomena (such as [[chromatic aberration]]).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Albrecht durer ray tracing enhanced.png|thumb|right|This image by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] from 1532 shows a man using a grid layout to create an image.

It works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each [[pixel]] in a virtual screen, and calculating the color of the object visible through it.\n\nScenes in ray tracing are described mathematically by a programmer or by a visual artist (typically using intermediary tools). Scenes may also incorporate data from images and models captured by means such as digital photography.\n\nTypically, each ray must be tested for intersection with some subset of all the objects in the scene. Once the nearest object has been identified, the algorithm will estimate the incoming [[Computer graphics lighting|light]] at the point of intersection, examine the material properties of the object, and combine this information to calculate the final color of the pixel. Certain illumination algorithms and reflective or translucent materials may require more rays to be re-cast into the scene.\n\nIt may at first seem counterintuitive or \"backward\" to send rays ''away'' from the camera, rather than ''into'' it (as actual light does in reality), but doing so is many orders of magnitude more efficient. Since the overwhelming majority of light rays from a given light source do not make it directly into the viewer's eye, a \"forward\" simulation could potentially waste a tremendous amount of computation on light paths that are never recorded.\n\nTherefore, the shortcut taken in ray tracing is to presuppose that a given ray intersects the view frame. After either a maximum number of reflections or a ray traveling a certain distance without intersection, the ray ceases to travel and the pixel's value is updated.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Calculate rays for rectangular viewport ===\n\n{{technical|date=March 2020}}\nOn input we have (in calculation we use vector [[Euclidean vector#Length|normalization]] and [[cross product]]):\n\n* <math>E \\in \\mathbb{R^3}</math> eye position\n* <math>T \\in \\mathbb{R^3}</math> target position\n* <math>\\theta \\in [0,\\pi] </math> [[field of view]] - for human we can assume <math>\\approx \\pi/2 \\text{ rad}= 90^\\circ</math>\n* <math>m,k \\in \\mathbb{N}</math> numbers of square pixels on viewport vertical and horizontal direction \n* <math>i,j  \\in \\mathbb{N}, 1\\leq i\\leq k \\land 1\\leq j\\leq m </math> numbers of actual pixel \n* <math>\\vec w \\in \\mathbb{R^3}</math> vertical vector which indicates where is up and down, usually <math>\\vec w = [0,1,0]</math> (not visible on picture) - [[:simple:Pitch, yaw, and roll|roll]] component which determine viewport rotation around point C (where the axis of rotation is the ET section)\n\n[[File:RaysViewportSchema.png|708px|Viewport schema witch pixels, eye E and target T, viewport center C]]\n\nThe idea is to find the position of each viewport pixel center  <math>P_{ij}</math> which allows us to find the line going from eye <math>E</math> through that pixel and finally get the ray described by point <math>E</math> and vector <math>\\vec R_{ij} = P_{ij} -E </math> (or its normalisation <math>\\vec r_{ij}</math>).

One can think of this \"ray\" as a stream of [[photon]]s traveling along the same path.  In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line (ignoring [[general relativity|relativistic effects]]). Any combination of four things might happen with this light ray: [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]] and [[fluorescence]].  A surface may absorb part of the light ray, resulting in a loss of intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light.  It might also reflect all or part of the light ray, in one or more directions. If the surface has any [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Transparency (optics)|translucent]] properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the [[Visible spectrum|spectrum]] (and possibly altering the color). Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more.  A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of the incoming rays.  Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.\n\n===Ray casting algorithm===\n{{Main|Ray casting}}\n\nThe first ray tracing algorithm used for rendering was presented by [[Arthur Appel]] in 1968.<ref>Appel A. (1968) ''[http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/Appel.pdf Some techniques for shading machine renderings of solids]''.  AFIPS Conference Proc. 32 pp.37-45</ref> This algorithm has since been termed \"[[ray casting]]\". The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray. Think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel.  This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel.  Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the [[shading]] of this object.  The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow.  The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models.  One important advantage ray casting offered over older [[scanline rendering|scanline algorithms]] was its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as [[cone (geometry)|cones]] and [[sphere]]s. If a mathematical surface can be intersected by a ray, it can be rendered using ray casting. Elaborate objects can be created by using [[solid modeling]] techniques and easily rendered.\n\n===Recursive ray tracing algorithm===\n[[File:Glasses 800 edit.png|right|thumb|300px|Ray tracing can create realistic-looking images.]]\n[[File:BallsRender.png|right|thumb|300px|In addition to the high degree of realism, ray tracing can simulate the [[Camera#Mechanics|effects of a camera]] due to [[depth of field]] and [[aperture]] shape (in this case a [[hexagon]]).]]\n[[File:Ray-traced steel balls.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The number of reflections, or bounces, a \u201cray\u201d can make, and how it is affected each time it encounters a surface, is controlled by settings in the software.

Here, each ray was set to refract or reflect (the \"depth\") ''up to 9 times''. [[Fresnel reflection]]s were used and [[Caustic (optics)|caustics]] are visible. (Image created with [[V-Ray]].)]]\n\nThe next important research breakthrough came from [[Turner Whitted]] in 1979.<ref>Whitted T. (1979) ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.156.1534 An improved illumination model for shaded display]''.  Proceedings of the 6th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques</ref> Previous algorithms traced rays from the eye into the scene until they hit an object, but determined the ray color without recursively tracing more rays.  Whitted continued the process.  When a ray hits a surface, it can generate up to three new types of rays: reflection, refraction, and shadow.<ref>{{cite journal | url = https://dip.felk.cvut.cz/browse/pdfcache/nikodtom_2010bach.pdf | title = Ray Tracing Algorithm For Interactive Applications | author = Tomas Nikodym | journal = Czech Technical University, FEE | date = June 2010 }}</ref> A reflection ray is traced in the mirror-reflection direction. The closest object it intersects is what will be seen in the reflection.  Refraction rays traveling through transparent material work similarly, with the addition that a refractive ray could be entering or exiting a material.  A shadow ray is traced toward each light. If any opaque object is found between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and the light does not illuminate it.  This recursive ray tracing added more realism to ray traced images.\n\n===Advantages over other rendering methods===\nRay tracing-based rendering's popularity stems from its basis in a realistic simulation of [[Computer graphics lighting|light transport]], as compared to other rendering methods, such as [[rasterisation|rasterization]], which focuses more on the realistic simulation of geometry. Effects such as reflections and [[shadow]]s, which are difficult to simulate using other algorithms, are a natural result of the ray tracing algorithm. The computational independence of each ray makes ray tracing amenable to a basic level of [[parallelization]],<ref>J.-C. Nebel. A New Parallel Algorithm Provided by a Computation Time Model, Eurographics Workshop on Parallel Graphics and Visualisation, 24\u201325 September 1998, Rennes, France.</ref><ref>A. Chalmers, T. Davis, and E. Reinhard. Practical parallel rendering, {{ISBN|1-56881-179-9}}. AK Peters, Ltd., 2002.</ref> but the divergence of ray paths makes high utilization under parallelism quite difficult to achieve in practice.<ref>Aila, Timo and Samulii Laine, Understanding the Efficiency of Ray Traversal on GPUs, High Performance Graphics 2009, New Orleans, LA.</ref>\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nA serious disadvantage of ray tracing is performance (though it can in theory be faster than traditional scanline rendering depending on scene complexity vs. number of pixels on-screen). Until the late 2010s, ray tracing in real time was usually considered impossible on consumer hardware for nontrivial tasks. Scanline algorithms and other algorithms use data coherence to share computations between pixels, while ray tracing normally starts the process anew, treating each eye ray separately. However, this separation offers other advantages, such as the ability to shoot more rays as needed to perform [[spatial anti-aliasing]] and improve image quality where needed.\n\nAlthough it does handle interreflection and optical effects such as refraction accurately, traditional ray tracing is also not necessarily [[photorealistic rendering|photorealistic]]. True photorealism occurs when the [[rendering equation]] is closely approximated or fully implemented. Implementing the rendering equation gives true photorealism, as the equation describes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is usually infeasible given the computing resources required.\n\nThe realism of all rendering methods can be evaluated as an approximation to the equation. Ray tracing, if it is limited to Whitted's algorithm, is not necessarily the most realistic. Methods that trace rays, but include additional techniques ([[photon mapping]], [[path tracing]]), give a far more accurate simulation of real-world lighting.\n\n===Reversed direction of traversal of scene by the rays===\nThe process of shooting rays from the eye to the light source to render an image is sometimes called ''backwards ray tracing'', since it is the opposite direction photons actually travel. However, there is confusion with this terminology. Early ray tracing was always done from the eye, and early researchers such as [[James Arvo]] used the term ''backwards ray tracing'' to mean shooting rays from the lights and gathering the results.  Therefore, it is clearer to distinguish ''eye-based'' versus ''light-based'' ray tracing.\n\nWhile the direct illumination is generally best sampled using eye-based ray tracing, certain indirect effects can benefit from rays generated from the lights. [[Caustic (optics)|Caustics]] are bright patterns caused by the focusing of light off a wide reflective region onto a narrow area of (near-)diffuse surface.  An algorithm that casts rays directly from lights onto reflective objects, tracing their paths to the eye, will better sample this phenomenon. This integration of eye-based and light-based rays is often expressed as bidirectional path tracing, in which paths are traced from both the eye and lights, and the paths subsequently joined by a connecting ray after some length.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~eric/Portugal.html | title = Bi-Directional Path Tracing | author = Eric P.

In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points.<ref>[http://graphics.ucsd.edu/~henrik/papers/photon_map/global_illumination_using_photon_maps_egwr96.pdf Global Illumination using Photon Maps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808140048/http://graphics.ucsd.edu/~henrik/papers/photon_map/global_illumination_using_photon_maps_egwr96.pdf |date=2008-08-08 }}</ref><ref>[http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~emmanuel/courses/cs563/write_ups/zackw/photon_mapping/PhotonMapping.html Photon Mapping - Zack Waters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional path tracing is the ability to achieve significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias.\n\nAn additional problem occurs when light must pass through a very narrow aperture to illuminate the scene (consider a darkened room, with a door slightly ajar leading to a brightly lit room), or a scene in which most points do not have direct line-of-sight to any light source (such as with ceiling-directed light fixtures or [[torchiere]]s). In such cases, only a very small subset of paths will transport energy; [[Metropolis light transport]] is a method which begins with a random search of the path space, and when energetic paths are found, reuses this information by exploring the nearby space of rays.<ref>http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/metro/metro.pdf</ref>\n\n[[File:PathOfRays.svg|thumb|Image showing recursively generated rays from the \"eye\" (and through an image plane) to a light source after encountering two [[Diffuse surface|diffuse surfaces]].]]\nTo the right is an image showing a simple example of a path of rays recursively generated from the camera (or eye) to the light source using the above algorithm. A diffuse surface reflects light in all directions.\n\nFirst, a ray is created at an eyepoint and traced through a pixel and into the scene, where it hits a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where it hits another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where it hits the light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on the colors of the first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example, if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces were blue, then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.\n\n===Example===\n{{duplication|dupe=Line\u2013sphere intersection|section=yes|date=May 2014}}\n\nAs a demonstration of the principles involved in ray tracing, consider how one would find the intersection between a ray and a sphere. This is merely the math behind the [[line\u2013sphere intersection]] and the subsequent determination of the colour of the pixel being calculated. There is, of course, far more to the general process of ray tracing, but this demonstrates an example of the algorithms used.\n\nIn [[vector notation]], the equation of a sphere with center <math>\\mathbf c</math> and radius <math>r</math> is\n\n:<math>\\left\\Vert \\mathbf x - \\mathbf c \\right\\Vert^2=r^2.</math>\n\nAny point on a ray starting from point <math>\\mathbf s</math> with direction <math>\\mathbf d</math> (here <math>\\mathbf d</math> is a [[unit vector]]) can be written as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf x=\\mathbf s+t\\mathbf d,</math>\n\nwhere <math> t</math> is its distance between <math>\\mathbf x</math> and <math>\\mathbf s</math>.  In our problem, we know <math>\\mathbf c</math>,  <math>r</math>, <math>\\mathbf s</math> (e.g. the position of a light source) and <math>\\mathbf d</math>, and we need to find <math> t</math>. Therefore, we substitute for <math>\\mathbf x</math>:\n\n:<math>\\left\\Vert\\mathbf{s}+t\\mathbf{d}-\\mathbf{c}\\right\\Vert^{2}=r^2.</math>\n\nLet <math>\\mathbf{v}\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\mathbf{s}-\\mathbf{c}</math> for simplicity; then\n\n:<math>\\left\\Vert\\mathbf{v}+t\\mathbf{d}\\right\\Vert^{2}=r^{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}^2+t^2\\mathbf{d}^2+2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot t\\mathbf{d}=r^2</math>\n\n:<math>(\\mathbf{d}^2)t^2+(2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})t+(\\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)=0.</math>\n\nKnowing that d is a unit vector allows us this minor simplification:\n\n:<math>t^2+(2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})t+(\\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)=0.</math>\n\nThis [[quadratic equation]] has solutions\n:<math>t=\\frac{-(2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})^2-4(\\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)}}{2}=-(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})\\pm\\sqrt{(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{d})^2-(\\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)}.</math>\n\nThe two values of <math>t</math> found by solving this equation are the two ones such that <math>\\mathbf s+t\\mathbf d</math> are the points where the ray intersects the sphere.\n\nAny value which is negative does not lie on the ray, but rather in the opposite [[Line (mathematics)|half-line]] (i.e. the one starting from <math>\\mathbf s</math> with opposite direction).\n\nIf the quantity under the square root ( the [[quadratic equation#Discriminant|discriminant]] )  is negative, then the ray does not intersect the sphere.\n\nLet us suppose now that there is at least a positive solution, and let <math>t</math> be the minimal one. In addition, let us suppose that the sphere is the nearest object on our scene intersecting our ray, and that it is made of a reflective material. We need to find in which direction the light ray is reflected. The laws of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] state that the angle of reflection is equal and opposite to the angle of incidence between the incident ray and the [[surface normal|normal]] to the sphere.\n\nThe normal to the sphere is simply\n\n:<math>\\mathbf n=\\frac{\\mathbf y- \\mathbf c}{\\left\\Vert\\mathbf y- \\mathbf c\\right\\Vert},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf y=\\mathbf s+t\\mathbf d</math> is the intersection point found before. The reflection direction can be found by a [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] of <math>\\mathbf d</math> with respect to <math>\\mathbf n</math>, that is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf r = \\mathbf d - 2(\\mathbf n \\cdot \\mathbf d ) \\mathbf n.</math>\n\nThus the reflected ray has equation\n\n: <math>\\mathbf x = \\mathbf y  + u \\mathbf r. \\, </math>\n\nNow we only need to compute the intersection of the latter ray with our [[field of view]], to get the pixel which our reflected light ray will hit. Lastly, this pixel is set to an appropriate color, taking into account how the color of the original light source and the one of the sphere are combined by the reflection.\n\n==Adaptive depth control==\nAdaptive depth control means that the renderer stops generating reflected/transmitted rays when the computed intensity becomes less than a certain threshold. There must always be a set maximum depth or else the program would generate an infinite number of rays. But it is not always necessary to go to the maximum depth if the surfaces are not highly reflective. To test for this the ray tracer must compute and keep the product of the global and reflection coefficients as the rays are traced.\n\nExample: let Kr = 0.5 for a set of surfaces. Then from the first surface the maximum contribution is 0.5, for the reflection from the second: 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.25, the third: 0.25 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.125, the fourth: 0.125 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.0625, the fifth: 0.0625 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.03125, etc. In addition we might implement a distance attenuation factor such as 1/D2, which would also decrease the intensity contribution.\n\nFor a transmitted ray we could do something similar but in that case the distance traveled through the object would cause even faster intensity decrease. As an example of this, Hall & Greenberg found that even for a very reflective scene, using this with a maximum depth of 15 resulted in an average ray tree depth of 1.7.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Roy A.|last2=Greenberg|first2=Donald P.|date=November 1983|title=A Testbed for Realistic Image Synthesis|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=3|issue=8|pages=10\u201320|doi=10.1109/MCG.1983.263292|citeseerx=10.1.1.131.1958}}</ref>\n\n==Bounding volumes==\nWe enclose groups of objects in sets of [[Bounding volume hierarchy|hierarchical bounding volumes]] and first test for intersection with the [[bounding volume]], and then only if there is an intersection, against the objects enclosed by the volume.\n\nBounding volumes should be easy to test for intersection, for example a sphere or box (slab). The best bounding volume will be determined by the shape of the underlying object or objects. For example, if the objects are long and thin then a sphere will enclose mainly empty space and a box is much better. Boxes are also easier for hierarchical bounding volumes.\n\nNote that using a hierarchical system like this (assuming it is done carefully) changes the intersection computational time from a linear dependence on the number of objects to something between linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, and we would have a binary tree type structure. Spatial subdivision methods, discussed below, try to achieve this.\n\nKay & Kajiya give a list of desired properties for hierarchical bounding volumes:\n\n* Subtrees should contain objects that are near each other and the further down the tree the closer should be the objects.\n* The volume of each node should be minimal.\n* The sum of the volumes of all bounding volumes should be minimal.\n* Greater attention should be placed on the nodes near the root since pruning a branch near the root will remove more potential objects than one farther down the tree.\n* The time spent constructing the hierarchy should be much less than the time saved by using it.\n\n==Interactive ray tracing{{anchor|In real time}}==\n{{See also|Ray-tracing hardware}}\nThe first implementation of an interactive ray tracer was the [[Supercomputing in Japan|LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System]] built in 1982 at [[Osaka University]]'s School of Engineering, by professors Ohmura Kouichi, Shirakawa Isao and Kawata Toru with 50 students.{{Citation needed|reason=There were other real-time ray tracing claims researched for and discussed at SIGGRAPH 2005, but none could be proven prior to 1986.

Despite the essence of the mission the troops came from various groups that were poorly equipped; some units were not provided with uniforms until January 1942. Many of the ''Stadswacht'' and ''Landwacht'' brigades were only set up in 1941 and had training in handling weapons or maneuvering in battle.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 75</ref>  \n\nUpon completion of the main mission, all soldiers outside Java had to conduct guerrilla warfare.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 74</ref> The command staff and governor would relocate to [[Muara_Teweh|Moearatewe]], in [[North_Barito_Regency|North Barito]], while the administrative staff would remain behind, hoping to continue working normally after the occupation.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 75</ref> Three storage facilities were set up along the route to Moearatewe as part of this.<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 834</ref>\n\n== Japanese Plans ==\n[[File:Japanese attack on Borneo, 1941-1942.jpg|thumb|329x329px|Route of Japanese attack on Borneo from 1941-1942, including that on Banjarmasin|alt=|left]]\nConsidering that the Japanese did not have any updated intelligence on the condition of the airfields in Banjarmasin, in addition to the lengthy time it would take to set up the airfield for operation once captured, the Navy cancelled its involvement in the operation.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 207</ref> Instead, the Army planned to conduct a two-pronged attack on the city from the sea and overland, with the latter being the main thrust.\n\nCol. Yamamoto's Land Drive Unit that planned to attack overland will leave Balikpapan on the night of 30 January and land in Tanahgrogot at dawn on the 31st. The Unit would then traverse the jungle and mountains southward, with an element of its force advancing as vanguard to block any Dutch ambush attempts. After moving out of the jungle, it would quickly advance to the city to get ahead of any Dutch efforts to blow up the bridges while retreating. Since provisions were to be procured mostly on site, troops only carried nine days worth of rations with them.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 392</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Capt. Okamoto's Sea Drive Unit, would leave a few days before Yamamoto's Unit. Using landing craft, the unit would only move at nighttime. During the day they planned to go upriver near the river mouths and hide under the forest to avoid Allied air reconnaissance. To secure passage through the channel west of Laoet (Laut) Island, Okamoto planned to conduct a night raid on Kotabaroe (Kotabaru) to gather supplies and intelligence. Upon landing at Banjarmasin, the Unit would advance and capture Oelin airfield. Opposite of the Land Drive Unit, Okamoto's troops needed to procure provisions along the advance.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 393</ref>\n\n== The Battle ==\n\n=== Prelude Raids ===\n\nAfter the fall of [[Tarakan]], daily Japanese air raids began to be seen over Banjarmasin. The first Japanese fighters conducted strafing runs on Oelin airfield on 20 January, but caused little damage. During the air raid on 21 January, 4 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zeros]] and a [[Mitsubishi Ki-15|Babs reconnaissance plane]] of the Tainan Air Wing destroyed a PBY Catalina from MLD's 16th Flight Group (GVT.16) that had landed on the Barito Delta.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 80</ref><ref>Womack (2006), pp. 87</ref> A major loss occurred on 27 January, when eight [[Martin B-10|Glenn Martin]] bombers stopped by at Oelin en route to the Samarinda II Airfield. When the air raid came, the [[Lewis gun|Lewis Guns]] that were stationed as AA defense were ineffective against the Japanese planes. The Japanese destroyed six of the bombers and damaged the other two,<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indische Leger (1948), pp. 517</ref> dealing a severe blow to the Dutch morale. \n[[File:Detail of the advance of the Land Drive and Sea Drive Unit to Banjarmasin, 1942.png|alt=|thumb|344x344px|Advance of the Land and Sea Drive Unit, 31 January-10 February 1942. The Land Drive Unit is indicated by the single arrow; The Sea Drive Unit indicated by the double arrow. ]]\n\n=== Land Drive Unit ===\n\nThe advance party of Yamamoto's Unit left Balikpapan on the morning of 31 January and landed at Adang Bay at 20:00 on the same day.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 393</ref> Upon being notified about the landing, Lt. Michielsen, who was in command of the defense in Tanahgrogot, withdrew with his 60 troops after destroying the town. Families of indigenous soldiers were prohibited from being evacuated, while families of European soldiers could evacuate on their own terms. Michielsen had set up a camp with food supplies 20 km east of Tanahgrogot to accommodate the evacuees, who now had joined the ranks of retreating soldiers. Many soldiers, however, deserted along the way or went back to their families, leaving Michielsen with five soldiers - two of them sick - when he reached Tandjoeng.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 80</ref>\n\nBy 1 February at 10:30, the Japanese advance guard seized Tanahgrogot. On 2 February, the remainder of Yamamoto's Unit left Balikpapan and landed on Tanahgrogot on the 3rd. As they advanced southward to Banjarmasin, the Land Drive Unit had to contend with the lack of adequate road, which rendered their motor vehicles and 600 bicycles useless. They climbed up steep mountains and crossed makeshift log bridges over deep gorges, while fending off attacks from mosquitoes, leeches and other insects.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 393</ref> Yamamoto reached Moeara Oeja (Muara Uya) on 4 February. Under Halkema's orders, the Landwacht brigades in Tandjoeng (Tanjung), Amoentai and Barabai scorched the city and retreated without a fight.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 518</ref>\n\nThis order brought Halkema in clash with the Dutch Borneo governor, Bauke Jan Haga. Gov. Haga perceived the destruction to be premature, as it would disrupt the economic life in the cities along the Hoeloe Soengei (Hulu Sungei/Sungai), which refers to the line of towns and villages located east of the Barito River. In protest, Gov. Haga sent official complaint to the Dutch army commander, Heinrich ter Poorten, asking for Halkema to be replaced. In agreement, ter Poorten sent Major A. Doup to replace him.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 77</ref>\n\nAt Dajoe, Lt. van der Poel's troops destroyed the small airfield in the town before retreating up north to Boentok (Buntok) and lost communication with the command staff. When the local population mistakenly reported that the Japanese forces are advancing on the town, many of van der Poel's indigenous soldiers and field police deserted, leaving him with five men. On 7 February, Halkema reinforced the troops at Kandangan with two brigades from Oelin (armed with a [[Madsen machine gun]]) under the command of 1st. Lt. W.K. Remmert. Remmert had to delay Yamamoto's advance along the Kandangan-Martapoera Road, before regrouping with a conscript brigade at Oelin Airfield. By 11:30, Remmert's troops arrived in Kandangan and began to take up position north of the town, before assisting Scholte in the demolition effort. Both groups then withdrew into a defensive position in Martapoera to protect Oelin Airfield.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 81</ref>\n\nOn the night of 8 February, Dutch reports from Rantau stated that one of their ship steamed along the river towards Banjarmasin with its lights off. Not excluding the possibility that there might be Japanese troops onboard, Halkema ordered Capt. van Epen to send three brigade (one conscript and two Stadswacht, reinforced with a machine gun and a [[Madsen machine gun|Madsen]]) on steam barges from Oelin to Negara to prevent the Japanese from attacking Banjarmasin via the Barito River, before pulling back again to Oelin. By 22:00, Halkema ordered for the destruction of Banjarmasin and Pelaihari. As the destruction, and with it, the vandalism began to took place, Gov. Haga was advised to leave the city, but he insisted that he will not do so until 23:30. Afterwards, Gov. Haga left for Moearatewe,<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 836</ref> before moving further up north to Poeroektjaoe (Puruk Cahu).<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 81</ref>[[File:Dutch Troops undergoing inspection in Tanahgrogot, sometime in the 1940s.png|thumb|310x310px|Dutch troops undergoing inspection in Tanahgrogot, sometime in the 1940s|alt=|left]]Two days earlier, ter Poorten had commissioned Doup as a lieutenant-colonel and appointed him as Halkema's successor, citing the latter's health status (rheumatism) and mental imbalance. Doup left Surabaya on 8 February, but as his plane reached the coast of Borneo at 01:00, he saw large fires on the mouth of Barito River, where Banjarmasin would be. As the radio operator failed to make contact with the ground, the pilot, Lt. Onyx refused to land. Eventually Onyx flew Doup to Samarinda II Airfield; the failure to make contact is due to the destruction of the radio station at Oelin Airfield. Doup eventually returned to Java and serve as the Inspector of Infantry. After sending out the destruction orders, Halkema and a few staff officers drove to Oelin Airfield to hand over command to his successor. At the airfield, he saw a plane that circled above the airfield several times before leaving without making a landing attempt.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 82</ref>\n\nAs Halkema drove to Oelin, part of his staff had begun to embark on the ships ''Irene'' and ''Otto''. Both ships were directed to steam towards Schans van Tuyl (junction of the Martapoera (Martapura) and Barito River), where they will await further instructions there. In the meantime, Banjarmasin's harbormaster ordered a steamboat to head to Takisoeng (Takisung), a coastal town south of Banjarmasin, where it would be made available for Halkema's disposal.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 82</ref> From Schans van Tuyl, ''Irene'' and ''Otto'' eventually head towards Java, taking Dutch refugees from Banjarmasin and part of Halkema's staff with them.<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 834</ref>\n\nAfter seeing Doup's plane left, Halkema drove in the direction of Takisoeng, where he arrived on the mouth of Barito River on 9 February.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 82</ref> In the evening, a Borsumij (''Borneo Sumatera Maatschappij''; Borneo Sumatera Company) ship appeared with the rest of the staff that didn't embark on the ''Irene'' and ''Otto.'' After boarding Halkema, the ship then received a telegram from Bandung, ordering them to head west to Kotawaringin and await further instructions there.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 83</ref>\n\nThe Borsumij ship steamed on at 19:00; Dutch forces onboard that managed to evacuate to Kotawaringin at the time only numbered at 75 troops.<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 835</ref> After docking at Kotawaringin on the 11th, Halkema and other non-essential personnels left by plane for Java on 12 February, while the infantrymen under Capt. W.C.A. van Beek reinforced the forces at the airfield.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 518</ref> Back at the Oelin Airfield, Capt. Bolderhey waited until 9 February for Doup's flight to arrive, unaware that it already did the day before. By nightfall on the 9th, he decided to leave the airfield and head up north to Koeala Kapoeas (Kuala Kapuas). The hostile attitude of the local population, along with desertion made guerrilla fighting out of option. With fewer choices at hand, Bolderhey decided to make an attempt to reach Java.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 84</ref> On 11 February, he and his troops left in a small 17-meter boat, alongside 180 other Dutch civilians (including 20 women). After sailing in the rough seas for six days, Bolderhey landed in Madura.<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 835</ref>\n\nYamamoto's Unit, once it came out of the jungle, tried to make pursuit of the retreating Dutch forces, but the advance had scattered the force. However, an advance company led by Capt. Kataoka had competed with the engineer company to be the first to drove off the Dutch. As the Land Drive Unit advanced, they obtained bicycles, vehicles and provisions from many supportive local population. At 09:00 on 10 February, Kataoka, with the engineer company, seized the Oelin Airfield with no resistance.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 394</ref> By nightfall, the Unit had occupied Banjarmasin.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 257</ref>\n\n=== Sea Drive Unit ===\nOkamoto's Sea Drive Unit left Balikpapan on the evening 30 January on four large and two small landing crafts and began to make their way along the coast southward.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 83</ref> In accordance with the plan, the Unit concentrated their advance at rivermouths at night according to plan, with a naval officer attached to pilot the movement. At day, the landing crafts were camouflaged under mangrove forests to avoid detection. Coming through Apar Besar Bay, Pamukan Bay and Klumpang Bay, Okamoto made a night raid on Kotabaroe, encountering no opposition and capturing many supplies and provisions.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 257</ref> On 8 February, the Sea Drive Unit landed 80 km from Banjarmasin and advanced without opposition to the Oelin Airfield. Since the Land Drive Unit had already dispersed Halkema's troops, Okamoto's troops reached Oelin Airfield without opposition on 10 February.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 393</ref><ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 83</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:B.J. Haga.jpg|thumb|314x314px|Governor Bauke Jan Haga]]\nBy the end of the battle, the Land Drive Unit had advanced 400 km south from their landing point in Adang Bay to Banjarmasin, 100 km of which were done through the jungle. Base material for the 11th Air Fleet arrived at Oelin via fishing boats on 20 February, and by the 25th, an element of the 23rd Air Flotilla landed on the airfield, which was soon to be used as a base for the advance to Bali.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 257</ref>\n\n=== Casualties ===\nThe battle had cost the Japanese 9 soldiers killed in action or died from sickness. About 80% (ca. 800) troops of the Land Drive Unit were stricken with malaria.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 394</ref>\n\nThe Dutch casualties were unknown. However, the battle has been characterized with the high desertion rates among the local troops.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 81</ref>\n\n=== Post-Capitulation Surrenders ===\nAfter the Dutch capitulation on Java on 8 March, troops who were holding out in Borneo began to surrender as well. Michielsen's group hand themselves over to the Japanese in Tandjoeng after the capitulation announcement. After holding out in Poeroektjaoe for some time, van der Poel's group surrendered to the Japanese in Banjarmasin on 14 March. The Japanese then instructed him, along with Capt. van der Epen who had arrived at Banjarmasin on the same time, to guide the troops who will pick up Gov. Haga in Poeroektjaoe.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 81</ref> Gov. Haga was captured on 17 March. On 14 December 1943, he died in jail after being tortured for conspiring to bring back Dutch rule into Banjarmasin through an armed uprising, in what is to be known as the \"Haga Plot\".<ref>Post, et al. (2010), pp. 496</ref>\n\n=== Kotawaringin Airfield ===\nThe units that stayed behind at Kotawaringin Airfield were reinforced with the 2/15 Punjab batallion under Lt. Col. M.C. Lane that had arrived exhausted from Miri & Kuching. On 24 February, a ship carrying supplies arrived to provide additional food stocks to the defenders. It was not until late March-early April that the Japanese finally arrived in Kotawaringin and taken the defenders captured.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 85</ref>\n\n=== Liberation ===\nBanjarmasin remained under Japanese occupation until September 1945, when it was liberated by the [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st Battalion]] of the Australian [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]].\n\n== Notes ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

The Japanese destroyed six of the bombers and damaged the other two,<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indische Leger (1948), pp. 517</ref> dealing a severe blow to the Dutch morale. \n[[File:Detail of the advance of the Land Drive and Sea Drive Unit to Banjarmasin, 1942.png|alt=|thumb|344x344px|Advance of the Land and Sea Drive Unit, 31 January-10 February 1942. The Land Drive Unit is indicated by the single arrow; The Sea Drive Unit indicated by the double arrow. ]]\n\n=== Land Drive Unit ===\n\nThe advance party of Yamamoto's Unit left Balikpapan on the morning of 31 January and landed at Adang Bay at 20:00 on the same day.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 393</ref> Upon being notified about the landing, Lt. Michielsen, who was in command of the defense in Tanahgrogot, withdrew with his 60 troops after destroying the town. Families of indigenous soldiers were prohibited from being evacuated, while families of European soldiers could evacuate on their own terms. Michielsen had set up a camp with food supplies 20 km east of Tanahgrogot to accommodate the evacuees, who now had joined the ranks of retreating soldiers. Many soldiers, however, deserted along the way or went back to their families, leaving Michielsen with five soldiers - two of them sick - when he reached Tandjoeng.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 80</ref>\n\nBy 1 February at 10:30, the Japanese advance guard seized Tanahgrogot. On 2 February, the remainder of Yamamoto's Unit left Balikpapan and landed on Tanahgrogot on the 3rd. As they advanced southward to Banjarmasin, the Land Drive Unit had to contend with the lack of adequate road, which rendered their motor vehicles and 600 bicycles useless. They climbed up steep mountains and crossed makeshift log bridges over deep gorges, while fending off attacks from mosquitoes, leeches and other insects.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 393</ref> Yamamoto reached Moeara Oeja (Muara Uya) on 4 February. Under Halkema's orders, the Landwacht brigades in Tandjoeng (Tanjung), Amoentai and Barabai scorched the city and retreated without a fight.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 518</ref>\n\nThis order brought Halkema in clash with the Dutch Borneo governor, Bauke Jan Haga. Gov. Haga perceived the destruction to be premature, as it would disrupt the economic life in the cities along the Hoeloe Soengei (Hulu Sungei/Sungai), which refers to the line of towns and villages located east of the Barito River. In protest, Gov. Haga sent official complaint to the Dutch army commander, Heinrich ter Poorten, asking for Halkema to be replaced. In agreement, ter Poorten sent Major A. Doup to replace him.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 77</ref>\n\nAt Dajoe, Lt. van der Poel's troops destroyed the small airfield in the town before retreating up north to Boentok (Buntok) and lost communication with the command staff. When the local population mistakenly reported that the Japanese forces are advancing on the town, many of van der Poel's indigenous soldiers and field police deserted, leaving him with five men. On 7 February, Halkema reinforced the troops at Kandangan with two brigades from Oelin (armed with a [[Madsen machine gun]]) under the command of 1st. Lt. W.K. Remmert. Remmert had to delay Yamamoto's advance along the Kandangan-Martapoera Road, before regrouping with a conscript brigade at Oelin Airfield. By 11:30, Remmert's troops arrived in Kandangan and began to take up position north of the town, before assisting Scholte in the demolition effort. Both groups then withdrew into a defensive position in Martapoera to protect Oelin Airfield.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 81</ref>\n\nOn the night of 8 February, Dutch reports from Rantau stated that one of their ship steamed along the river towards Banjarmasin with its lights off. Not excluding the possibility that there might be Japanese troops onboard, Halkema ordered Capt. van Epen to send three brigade (one conscript and two Stadswacht, reinforced with a machine gun and a [[Madsen machine gun|Madsen]]) on steam barges from Oelin to Negara to prevent the Japanese from attacking Banjarmasin via the Barito River, before pulling back again to Oelin. By 22:00, Halkema ordered for the destruction of Banjarmasin and Pelaihari. As the destruction, and with it, the vandalism began to took place, Gov. Haga was advised to leave the city, but he insisted that he will not do so until 23:30. Afterwards, Gov. Haga left for Moearatewe,<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 836</ref> before moving further up north to Poeroektjaoe (Puruk Cahu).<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 81</ref>[[File:Dutch Troops undergoing inspection in Tanahgrogot, sometime in the 1940s.png|thumb|310x310px|Dutch troops undergoing inspection in Tanahgrogot, sometime in the 1940s|alt=|left]]Two days earlier, ter Poorten had commissioned Doup as a lieutenant-colonel and appointed him as Halkema's successor, citing the latter's health status (rheumatism) and mental imbalance. Doup left Surabaya on 8 February, but as his plane reached the coast of Borneo at 01:00, he saw large fires on the mouth of Barito River, where Banjarmasin would be. As the radio operator failed to make contact with the ground, the pilot, Lt. Onyx refused to land. Eventually Onyx flew Doup to Samarinda II Airfield; the failure to make contact is due to the destruction of the radio station at Oelin Airfield. Doup eventually returned to Java and serve as the Inspector of Infantry. After sending out the destruction orders, Halkema and a few staff officers drove to Oelin Airfield to hand over command to his successor. At the airfield, he saw a plane that circled above the airfield several times before leaving without making a landing attempt.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 82</ref>\n\nAs Halkema drove to Oelin, part of his staff had begun to embark on the ships ''Irene'' and ''Otto''. Both ships were directed to steam towards Schans van Tuyl (junction of the Martapoera (Martapura) and Barito River), where they will await further instructions there. In the meantime, Banjarmasin's harbormaster ordered a steamboat to head to Takisoeng (Takisung), a coastal town south of Banjarmasin, where it would be made available for Halkema's disposal.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 82</ref> From Schans van Tuyl, ''Irene'' and ''Otto'' eventually head towards Java, taking Dutch refugees from Banjarmasin and part of Halkema's staff with them.<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 834</ref>\n\nAfter seeing Doup's plane left, Halkema drove in the direction of Takisoeng, where he arrived on the mouth of Barito River on 9 February.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 82</ref> In the evening, a Borsumij (''Borneo Sumatera Maatschappij''; Borneo Sumatera Company) ship appeared with the rest of the staff that didn't embark on the ''Irene'' and ''Otto.'' After boarding Halkema, the ship then received a telegram from Bandung, ordering them to head west to Kotawaringin and await further instructions there.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 83</ref>\n\nThe Borsumij ship steamed on at 19:00; Dutch forces onboard that managed to evacuate to Kotawaringin at the time only numbered at 75 troops.<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 835</ref> After docking at Kotawaringin on the 11th, Halkema and other non-essential personnels left by plane for Java on 12 February, while the infantrymen under Capt. W.C.A. van Beek reinforced the forces at the airfield.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 518</ref> Back at the Oelin Airfield, Capt. Bolderhey waited until 9 February for Doup's flight to arrive, unaware that it already did the day before. By nightfall on the 9th, he decided to leave the airfield and head up north to Koeala Kapoeas (Kuala Kapuas). The hostile attitude of the local population, along with desertion made guerrilla fighting out of option. With fewer choices at hand, Bolderhey decided to make an attempt to reach Java.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 84</ref> On 11 February, he and his troops left in a small 17-meter boat, alongside 180 other Dutch civilians (including 20 women). After sailing in the rough seas for six days, Bolderhey landed in Madura.<ref>De Jong (1984), pp. 835</ref>\n\nYamamoto's Unit, once it came out of the jungle, tried to make pursuit of the retreating Dutch forces, but the advance had scattered the force. However, an advance company led by Capt. Kataoka had competed with the engineer company to be the first to drove off the Dutch. As the Land Drive Unit advanced, they obtained bicycles, vehicles and provisions from many supportive local population. At 09:00 on 10 February, Kataoka, with the engineer company, seized the Oelin Airfield with no resistance.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 394</ref> By nightfall, the Unit had occupied Banjarmasin.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 257</ref>\n\n=== Sea Drive Unit ===\nOkamoto's Sea Drive Unit left Balikpapan on the evening 30 January on four large and two small landing crafts and began to make their way along the coast southward.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 83</ref> In accordance with the plan, the Unit concentrated their advance at rivermouths at night according to plan, with a naval officer attached to pilot the movement. At day, the landing crafts were camouflaged under mangrove forests to avoid detection. Coming through Apar Besar Bay, Pamukan Bay and Klumpang Bay, Okamoto made a night raid on Kotabaroe, encountering no opposition and capturing many supplies and provisions.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 257</ref> On 8 February, the Sea Drive Unit landed 80 km from Banjarmasin and advanced without opposition to the Oelin Airfield. Since the Land Drive Unit had already dispersed Halkema's troops, Okamoto's troops reached Oelin Airfield without opposition on 10 February.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 393</ref><ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 83</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:B.J. Haga.jpg|thumb|314x314px|Governor Bauke Jan Haga]]\nBy the end of the battle, the Land Drive Unit had advanced 400 km south from their landing point in Adang Bay to Banjarmasin, 100 km of which were done through the jungle. Base material for the 11th Air Fleet arrived at Oelin via fishing boats on 20 February, and by the 25th, an element of the 23rd Air Flotilla landed on the airfield, which was soon to be used as a base for the advance to Bali.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 257</ref>\n\n=== Casualties ===\nThe battle had cost the Japanese 9 soldiers killed in action or died from sickness. About 80% (ca. 800) troops of the Land Drive Unit were stricken with malaria.<ref>Remmelink (2015), pp. 394</ref>\n\nThe Dutch casualties were unknown. However, the battle has been characterized with the high desertion rates among the local troops.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 81</ref>\n\n=== Post-Capitulation Surrenders ===\nAfter the Dutch capitulation on Java on 8 March, troops who were holding out in Borneo began to surrender as well. Michielsen's group hand themselves over to the Japanese in Tandjoeng after the capitulation announcement. After holding out in Poeroektjaoe for some time, van der Poel's group surrendered to the Japanese in Banjarmasin on 14 March. The Japanese then instructed him, along with Capt. van der Epen who had arrived at Banjarmasin on the same time, to guide the troops who will pick up Gov. Haga in Poeroektjaoe.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 81</ref> Gov. Haga was captured on 17 March. On 14 December 1943, he died in jail after being tortured for conspiring to bring back Dutch rule into Banjarmasin through an armed uprising, in what is to be known as the \"Haga Plot\".<ref>Post, et al. (2010), pp. 496</ref>\n\n=== Kotawaringin Airfield ===\nThe units that stayed behind at Kotawaringin Airfield were reinforced with the 2/15 Punjab batallion under Lt. Col. M.C. Lane that had arrived exhausted from Miri & Kuching. On 24 February, a ship carrying supplies arrived to provide additional food stocks to the defenders. It was not until late March-early April that the Japanese finally arrived in Kotawaringin and taken the defenders captured.<ref>Nortier (1982), pp. 85</ref>\n\n=== Liberation ===\nBanjarmasin remained under Japanese occupation until September 1945, when it was liberated by the [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st Battalion]] of the Australian [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]].\n\n== Notes ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
