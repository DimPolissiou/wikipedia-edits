construction began.\n\nThe line is designed to follow an inverted-L shaped route running from the southwestern corner of urban Beijing in Fengtai District to the northeastern corner in Chaoyang District. Currently, the west section and east section of Line 14 are operated separately, while the middle section is still under construction.\n\nIn the west section, Line 14 begins at {{BJS stations|Zhangguozhuang}} on Yuanboyuan South Road, west of the Yongding River. The line crosses the river to Zhangyi Village and enters the [[5th Ring Road]]. Going east on Fengtai South Road, Line 14 passes by the [[Beijing Fengtai Stadium|Fengtai Sports Center]], enters the [[4th Ring Road]] and continues eastward on Fengtai Road to {{BJS stations|Xiju}} on the [[Line 10, Beijing Subway|Line 10 loop]].\n\nThe middle section (currently under construction) continues on Lize Road inside the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] and then meets [[Line 4, Beijing Subway|Line 4]] at the [[Beijing South railway station]].\n\nThe east section runs east from [[Beijing South railway station]]. It crosses [[Line 5, Beijing Subway|Line 5]] at {{BJS stations|Puhuangyu}} and follows the Pufang Road through the [[Fangzhuang]] residential neighborhood. It leaves the 3rd Ring Road at {{BJS stations|Shilihe}} and continues eastward until it abruptly turns north at Xidawang Road. Then it runs north, between the eastern 3rd and 4th Ring Roads. After passing the [[Beijing University of Technology]], the line crosses [[Line 7, Beijing Subway|Line 7]] at {{BJS stations|Jiulongshan}} and [[Line 1, Beijing Subway|Line 1]] at {{BJS stations|Dawanglu}}. Further north, the Xidawang Road turns into Jintai Road. The line crosses [[Line 6 (Beijing Subway)|Line 6]] at [[Jintailu]] and runs north through [[Chaoyang Park]].  Upon leaving the 4th Ring Road, Line 14 enters the vast [[Wangjing, Beijing|Wangjing]] sub-district.  The line bisects Wangjing from south to north on Guangshun South and North Streets and intersects with Line 15 at the heart of Wangjing.  After leaving Wangjing, the line emerges north of the [[5th Ring Road]] and terminates at Shangezhuang.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==History==\n* Sept. 23, 2008: Construction of Line 14 set to begin by the end of 2008.<ref name=autogenerated1>(Chinese) [https://archive.today/20130101175822/http://estate.chinanews.com.cn/cj/gncj/news/2008/09-23/1391056.shtml \u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c114\u53f7\u7ebf1\u671f\u53ca\u5730\u94c17\u53f7\u7ebf\u6709\u671b\u5e74\u5e95\u5f00\u5efa''\u5317\u4eac\u665a\u62a5''] Sept. 23, 2008</ref>\n* Nov. 6, 2009: Commencement of construction deferred; may begin by the end of 2009<ref name=autogenerated2>(Chinese) [http://auto.sohu.com/20091106/n268003174.shtml \u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c1\u201c\u5357\u5317\u5927\u52a8\u8109\u201d2010\u5e95\u524d\u6253\u901a] Nov. 6, 2009.</ref>\n* Jan. 7, 2010: Commencement of construction set to begin in 2010.<ref name=autogenerated3>(Chinese) [http://finance.ifeng.com/roll/20100107/1676155.shtml \"\u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c17\u53f7\u7ebf\u300114\u53f7\u7ebf\u3001S1\u7ebf\u53ca\u897f\u90ca\u7ebf\u5e74\u5185\u5f00\u5de5\"] Jan. 7, 2010</ref>\n* Apr. 29, 2010: Construction begins.<ref name=autogenerated4>(Chinese) [http://ccnews.people.com.cn/GB/11489591.htm \u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c114\u53f7\u7ebf\u5f00\u5de5 \u8ba1\u52122014\u5e74\u5e95\u7ae3\u5de5\u901a\u8f66 l \u300a\u5317\u4eac\u665a\u62a5\u300b]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Apr. 29, 2010</ref>\n*May 5, 2013: The West section, from [[Zhangguozhuang Station|Zhangguozhuang]] to [[Xiju Station|Xiju]] opens.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-03/11/content_16296453.htm \"New subway lines to get Beijing on fast track\" ''China Daily''] 2013-03-11</ref>\n*February 15, 2014: An infill station on west section, [[Qilizhuang Station]] opens.<ref>{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://news.sohu.com/20140213/n394944306.shtml|title=\u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c114\u53f7\u7ebf\u4e03\u91cc\u5e84\u7ad9\u5c06\u4e8e2\u670815\u65e5\u6b63\u5f0f\u542f\u7528 |publisher=[[Sohu]] News |date=2014-02-13}}</ref>\n* December 28, 2014: The 1st part of east section, from [[Shangezhuang Station]] to [[Jintailu Station]] opens.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bjrb.bjd.com.cn/html/2014-12/28/content_245158.htm|script-title=zh:4\u6761\u5730\u94c1\u65b0\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a|author=Liu Mian (\u5218\u5195) |work=[[Beijing Daily]]|date=2014-12-28|accessdate=2014-12-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141228140902/http://bjrb.bjd.com.cn/html/2014-12/28/content_245158.htm|archivedate=2014-12-28}}</ref>\n* December 26, 2015: The 2nd part of east section, from [[Jintailu Station]] to [[Beijing South railway station]], opens.\n* December 31, 2016: An infill station on East section, [[Chaoyang Park station]] opens.\n* December 30, 2017: An infill station on East section, [[Pingleyuan station]] opens.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: right;\"\n!Segment!!Commencement!!Length!!Station(s)!!Name\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Zhangguozhuang \u2014 Xiju\n| 5 May 2013\n| {{convert|12.4|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}<ref name=line14 />\n| 6\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| (western section)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Qilizhuang\n| 15 February 2014\n| Infill station\n| 1\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| \n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Jintailu \u2014 Shangezhuang\n| 28 December 2014\n| {{convert|14.8|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}<ref name=line14 />\n| 10\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| (1st part of eastern section)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Beijing South railway station \u2014 Jintailu\n| 26 December 2015\n| {{convert|16.6|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}<ref name=line14 />\n| 9\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| (2nd part of eastern section)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Chaoyang Park\n| 31 December 2016\n| Infill station\n| 1\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| \n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Pingleyuan\n| 30 December 2017\n| Infill station\n| 1\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| \n|}\n\n==Controversy==\n\n===Western terminal===\n\nThe proposed final routing of Line 14 headed through Zhangyi Village, near [[Marco Polo Bridge]]. However, residents of Dujiakan and nearby Wanpingcheng wanted the subway to be routed south and terminating in their neighborhoods instead. Wanpingcheng residents argued that the neighborhood's more than 60,000 residents as well as a sculpture park, a war memorial, [[Wanping Fortress]] and many other attractions need better public transport options. In addition roads going through Dujiakan are severely congested with traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sohu.com/20101020/n276027975.shtml|date=2010-10-20|title=\u5317\u4eac\u65a55\u4ebf\u6539\u9020\u675c\u5bb6\u574e\u6536\u8d39\u7ad9 \u8206\u8bba\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5176\u53d6\u6d88|accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref> The terrain, rivers and railways going through the area have made it difficult to construct new roads to the surrounding areas.

Tiantongyuan is a large residential area within Beijing's northern [[Changping District]]. Tiantongyuan is heavily dependent on Beiyuan road, Anli Road and [[Line 5, Beijing Subway|Subway Line 5]]. Both roads and the Metro line suffer from congestion. The existing Line 5 only serves the west side of Tiantongyuan and is over capacity. The Tiantongyuan online community launched a petition to extend Line 14 into Tiantongyuan. Tiantongyuan and its periphery argue that with the new developments being built in the area, traffic demand will be large. The extension of Line 14 into the area will improve access and transport capacity. Wangjing residents opposed the proposal put forward by Tiantongyuan residents believing that the huge passenger flow from an extension to Tiantongyuan will overwhelm Line 14 which is already slated to serve their neighborhood.  Wangjing is a large community with significant commercial areas in [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] north east of the fourth ring road. Although numerous buses connect Wangjing with its vicinity and the city center, it is still suffering from traffic congestion. The existing [[Line 13 (Beijing Subway)|Line 13]] [[Wangjing West station]] is too far from the commercial center of Wangjing, making access inconvenient. Wangjing residents proposed Line 14 to terminate at Wangjing as originally planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/09/1228/16/5RKQRD050001124J.html|title=\u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c114\u53f7\u7ebf\u4e89\u593a\u6218|access-date=2015-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231122734/http://news.163.com/09/1228/16/5RKQRD050001124J.html|archive-date=2009-12-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> The proposal by Tiantongyuan residents was rejected by planning authorities. Instead authorities proposed to construct a new north south express subway line called [[Line 17 (Beijing Subway)|Line 17]] (formerly R2 line) through eastern Tiantongyuan to better serve the area. Construction of [[Line 17 (Beijing Subway)|Line 17]] began in 2015.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{commons category|Line 14, Beijing Subway}}\n{{Beijing transit}}\n{{Beijing Subway Station\n|line14=yes\n}}\n\n[[Category:Beijing Subway lines]]\n[[Category:MTR Corporation]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rail line\n| name        =\n| other_name  = M14 (planned name)\n| logo        = {{huge|{{rint|beijing|14}}}}\n| logo_width  = \n| color       = {{BJS color|14}}\n| image       = \u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c114\u53f7\u7ebf\u5217\u8f66.JPG\n| image_width = \n| image_alt   =\n| caption     = [[File:BeijingMTR.svg|100px|Beijing MTR|link=MTR Corporation#Beijing]]\n| type        = [[Rapid transit]]\n| system      = [[Beijing Subway]]\n| status      = Operational\n| locale      = [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang]], [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]], and [[Dongcheng District, Beijing|Dongcheng]] districts<br/>[[Beijing]]\n| start       = {{BJS stations|Zhangguozhuang}} - {{BJS stations|Xiju}} (west section) <br> [[Beijing South railway station]] - {{BJS stations|Shangezhuang}} (east section)\n| end         = \n| stations    = 7 (West section), 21 (East section)\n| routes      = \n| daily_ridership   = 65,000 (2016 West section Peak) <br> 538,000 (2016 East section Peak)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sohu.com/20160327/n442297081.shtml |script-title=zh:\u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c1\u65e5\u5ba2\u6d41\u521b\u7eaa\u5f55 \u9996\u78341200\u4e07\u5927\u5173 |date=2016-03-27 |accessdate=2016-03-26 |publisher=[[Sohu]]}}</ref>\n| open        = {{Start date and age|2013|05|05}}\n| close       = \n| owner       = \n| operator    = [[MTR Corporation#Beijing|Beijing MTR Corporation Limited]]\n| character   = \n| depot       = \n| stock       = 6-car Type A (DKZ53, SFM18)\n| linelength  = {{convert|12.4|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} (West section)<ref name=line14 /><br>{{convert|31.4|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} (East section)<ref name=line14 />\n| tracklength = \n| tracks     = \n| gauge       = {{RailGauge|sg|allk=on}}\n| electrification          = 1500 [[volt|V]] [[Overhead line]]\n| speed       = \n| elevation   = \n| website     = www.mtr.bj.cn\n| map         = {{Beijing Subway/14}}\n| map_state   = collapsed\n}}\n'''Line 14''' of the [[Beijing Subway]] ({{zh|s=\u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c114\u53f7\u7ebf|p=b\u011bij\u012bng d\u00ecti\u011b sh\u00eds\u00ec h\u00e0oxi\u00e0n}}) is a [[rapid transit]] rail line in the south and east of [[Beijing]].

construction began.\n\nThe line is designed to follow an inverted-L shaped route running from the southwestern corner of urban Beijing in Fengtai District to the northeastern corner in Chaoyang District. Currently, the west section and east section of Line 14 are operated separately, while the middle section is still under construction.\n\nIn the west section, Line 14 begins at {{BJS stations|Zhangguozhuang}} on Yuanboyuan South Road, west of the Yongding River. The line crosses the river to Zhangyi Village and enters the [[5th Ring Road]]. Going east on Fengtai South Road, Line 14 passes by the [[Beijing Fengtai Stadium|Fengtai Sports Center]], enters the [[4th Ring Road]] and continues eastward on Fengtai Road to {{BJS stations|Xiju}} on the [[Line 10, Beijing Subway|Line 10 loop]].\n\nThe middle section (currently under construction) continues on Lize Road inside the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] and then meets [[Line 4, Beijing Subway|Line 4]] at the [[Beijing South railway station]].\n\nThe east section runs east from [[Beijing South railway station]]. It crosses [[Line 5, Beijing Subway|Line 5]] at {{BJS stations|Puhuangyu}} and follows the Pufang Road through the [[Fangzhuang]] residential neighborhood. It leaves the 3rd Ring Road at {{BJS stations|Shilihe}} and continues eastward until it abruptly turns north at Xidawang Road. Then it runs north, between the eastern 3rd and 4th Ring Roads. After passing the [[Beijing University of Technology]], the line crosses [[Line 7, Beijing Subway|Line 7]] at {{BJS stations|Jiulongshan}} and [[Line 1, Beijing Subway|Line 1]] at {{BJS stations|Dawanglu}}. Further north, the Xidawang Road turns into Jintai Road. The line crosses [[Line 6 (Beijing Subway)|Line 6]] at [[Jintailu]] and runs north through [[Chaoyang Park]].

Wanpingcheng residents argued that the neighborhood's more than 60,000 residents as well as a sculpture park, a war memorial, [[Wanping Fortress]] and many other attractions need better public transport options. In addition roads going through Dujiakan are severely congested with traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sohu.com/20101020/n276027975.shtml|date=2010-10-20|title=\u5317\u4eac\u65a55\u4ebf\u6539\u9020\u675c\u5bb6\u574e\u6536\u8d39\u7ad9 \u8206\u8bba\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5176\u53d6\u6d88|accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref> The terrain, rivers and railways going through the area have made it difficult to construct new roads to the surrounding areas.

Tiantongyuan is a large residential area within Beijing's northern [[Changping District]]. Tiantongyuan is heavily dependent on Beiyuan road, Anli Road and [[Line 5, Beijing Subway|Subway Line 5]]. Both roads and the Metro line suffer from congestion. The existing Line 5 only serves the west side of Tiantongyuan and is over capacity. The Tiantongyuan online community launched a petition to extend Line 14 into Tiantongyuan. Tiantongyuan and its periphery argue that with the new developments being built in the area, traffic demand will be large. The extension of Line 14 into the area will improve access and transport capacity. Wangjing residents opposed the proposal put forward by Tiantongyuan residents believing that the huge passenger flow from an extension to Tiantongyuan will overwhelm Line 14 which is already slated to serve their neighborhood.  Wangjing is a large community with significant commercial areas in [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] north east of the fourth ring road. Although numerous buses connect Wangjing with its vicinity and the city center, it is still suffering from traffic congestion. The existing [[Line 13 (Beijing Subway)|Line 13]] [[Wangjing West station]] is too far from the commercial center of Wangjing, making access inconvenient. Wangjing residents proposed Line 14 to terminate at Wangjing as originally planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/09/1228/16/5RKQRD050001124J.html|title=\u5317\u4eac\u5730\u94c114\u53f7\u7ebf\u4e89\u593a\u6218|access-date=2015-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231122734/http://news.163.com/09/1228/16/5RKQRD050001124J.html|archive-date=2009-12-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> The proposal by Tiantongyuan residents was rejected by planning authorities. Instead authorities proposed to construct a new north south express subway line called [[Line 17 (Beijing Subway)|Line 17]] (formerly R2 line) through eastern Tiantongyuan to better serve the area.

In jazz chords and theory, most [[triad (music)|triad]]s that appear in [[lead sheet]]s or [[fake book]]s can have [[Seventh (chord)|sevenths]] added to them, using the performer's discretion and ear. For example, if a tune is in the key of C, if there is a G chord, the chord-playing performer usually [[Chord voicing|voices]] this chord as G<sup>7</sup>. While the notes of a G<sup>7</sup> chord are G\u2013B\u2013D\u2013F, jazz often omits the [[Fifth (chord)|fifth]] of the chord\u2014and even the [[Root (chord)|root]] if playing in a group. However, not all jazz pianists leave out the root when they play voicings: [[Bud Powell]], one of the best-known of the bebop pianists, and [[Horace Silver]], whose quintet included many of jazz's biggest names from the 1950s to the 1970s, included the root note in their voicings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chord-voicings/powell-voicings/|title=Bud Powell Chord Voicings - The Jazz Piano Site|work=The Jazz Piano Site|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/259793476/5-Ways-to-Play-Like-Horace-Silver|title=5 Ways to Play Like Horace Silver {{!}} Jazz {{!}} Piano|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n[[jazz improvisation|Improvising]] chord-playing musicians who omit the root and fifth are given the option to play other notes. For example, if a seventh chord, such as G<sup>7</sup>, appears in a lead sheet or fake book, many chord-playing performers add the [[ninth]], [[thirteenth]] or other notes to the chord, even though the lead sheet does not specify these additional notes. Jazz players can add these additional, upper notes because they can create an important part of the jazz sound. Lead sheets and fake books often do not detail how to voice the chord because a lead sheet or fake book is only intended to provide basic guide to the harmony. An experienced \"[[comping]]\" performer playing [[electric guitar]] or [[piano]] may add or remove notes as chosen according to the style and desired sound of that musician, but must do so in a way that still emphasizes the correct musical context for other musicians and listeners.\n\nIn voicing jazz chords, performers focus first on the seventh and the major or minor third of the chord, with the latter indicating the [[major and minor|chord quality]], along with added [[extended chord|chord extensions]] (e.g., ninths, elevenths, or thirteenths, even if not indicated in the lead sheet or fake book) to add tone \"colour\" to the chord. As such, a [[jazz guitar]]ist or [[jazz piano]] player might \"voice\" a printed G<sup>7</sup> chord with the notes B\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A, which would be the third, sixth (thirteenth), flat seventh, and ninth of the chord. Jazz chord-playing musicians may also add [[altered chord|altered chord tones]] (e.g., {{music|b}}9, {{music|#}}9, {{music|#}}11, {{music|b}}13) and [[Added tone chord|added tones]]. An example of an [[altered dominant]] chord in the key of C, built on a G would be to voice the chord as \"B\u2013C{{music|#}}\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A{{music|b}}\"; this would be G<sup>7({{music|b}}9{{music|#}}11)</sup>.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n===Intervals===\nEach chord is described as a series of [[Interval (music)|intervallic]] relationships to the root of the chord. This provides an accurate and easily understandable basis for working out these chords in each key.\n\nThe terms used to describe intervals are as follows:\n*'''r''' = [[root (chord)|root]] of the chord (while the root is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the root is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|flat}}2''' = minor second = 1 [[semitone]] (half step) above the root\n*'''2''' = [[major second]] = 2 semitones above root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}2''' = [[augmented second]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}3''' = [[minor third]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''3''' = [[major third]] = 4 semitones above the root\n*'''4''' = [[perfect fourth]] = 5 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}4''' = [[Augmented Fourth|augmented fourth]] ([[tritone]]) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}5''' = [[diminished fifth]] (tritone) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''5''' = [[perfect fifth]] = 7 semitones above the root (while the fifth is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the fifth is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|sharp}}5''' = [[augmented fifth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}6''' = [[minor sixth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''6''' = [[major sixth]] = 9 semitones above the root\n*'''7''' = [[minor seventh]] = 10 semitones above the root\n*'''M7''' = [[major seventh]] = 11 semitones above the root\n\nAll [[Inversion (music)#Root position|root chords]] are described starting with the lowest note, and ascending in pitch. For instance, a chord described as\n\n:root, 3, 5.\n\ncontains the root, a major third above the root, and a perfect fifth above the root. It is a [[Major chord|major triad]]. If this chord were built on C (with C as the root), it would contain the notes\n\n:C, E, G.\n\n==== Compound intervals ====\n[[Interval (music)#Number|Compound intervals]] are intervals larger than an [[octave]]. They can also be described as an octave plus a simple interval. Note that this is not a complete list of compound intervals, only those that are commonly used in jazz chords.\n\n*'''{{music|flat}}9''' = compound minor second ([[minor ninth]]) = 1 semitone + an octave = 13 semitones above the root\n*'''9''' = compound major second ([[ninth]]) = 2 semitones + an octave = 14 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}9'''/'''{{music|flat}}10''' = compound [[augmented second]]/minor third (augmented ninth/minor tenth) = 3 semitones + an octave = 15 semitones above the root.\n*'''10''' = compound major third ([[tenth (music)|tenth]]) = 4 semitones + an octave = 16 semitones above the root\n*'''11''' = compound perfect fourth ([[eleventh]]) = 5 semitones + an octave = 17 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}11''' = compound augmented fourth  (augmented eleventh) = 6 semitones + an octave = 18 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}13''' = compound minor sixth (minor thirteenth) = 8 semitones + an octave = 20 semitones above the root\n*'''13''' = compound major sixth ([[thirteenth]]) = 9 semitones + an octave = 21 semitones above the root\n\n===Extensions===\n\nOptional extensions to the chords are written in parentheses, e.g. ({{music|sharp}}11). These notes are not necessary to define the function of the chord, but are included to add colour or fill out the sound according to the tastes of the performer. Extensions may be written into the chords when a specific colour or texture is warranted, or the chords in a lead sheet or fake book may simply state \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\". This does not mean that the chord-playing performer can only perform four-note [[dominant seventh]] chords. Chord-playing performers can use their ear, their sense of good taste acquired from listening to jazz, and their knowledge of the style of the tune being played (e.g., is it a [[bebop]] tune or a [[jazz fusion]] tune) to help guide her use of extension notes, altered extensions, and added tones. In a band, the [[bandleader]] might request that certain voicings be used (e.g., {{music|b}}9/{{music|#}}11) or request that certain other voicings be avoided (e.g., {{music|b}}13), due to the bandleader's taste.\n\n===Voicings===\n\nChords are described here in terms of intervals relative to the root of the chord, arranged from smaller intervals to larger. This is a standard method used when describing jazz chords as it shows them hierarchically: Lower intervals (third, [[fifth (chord)|fifth]] and seventh) are more important in defining the function of the chord than the upper intervals or extensions (9th, 11th, 13th), which add color. Although it is possible to play the chords as described here literally, it is possible to use different orderings of the same notes, known as a voicings, or even by omitting certain notes.{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=C<sup>13({{music|sharp}}11)</sup>|max-width=}}For instance, the dominant seventh {{music|sharp}}11 or [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] dominant, C<sup>7{{music|sharp}}11</sup>, comprises the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, (5), 7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11, (13).\n\nBasing this chord on the pitch, C, results in the pitches:\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, G, B{{music|flat}}, D, F{{music|sharp}}, A.\n\nThe same chord type may also be voiced:\n\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, B{{music|flat}}, F{{music|sharp}}, A, D, F{{music|sharp}}.\n\nThis voicing omits both the root and the perfect fifth (G) and raises the major ninth (D) by an octave. The augmented eleventh (F{{music|sharp}}) is also played twice in two different registers. This is known as \"[[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]]\".\n\n===Improvisation===\n\n[[File:Notes bell curve.png|thumb|An arrangement of musical intervals according to how satisfying they may sound.]]\n\nJazz improvisation is partly about selecting intervals within the chord or melody being played at a particular place in a song. While there are no right or wrong choices if notes are played in correct context, the graphic suggests how choices can be anything from boring through interesting to 'wrong' sounding, but judgments are strongly a matter of taste and experience and vary depending on the musician. Notes farther from the chord can often be inserted between other notes that are on the chord, such as E-Eb-Db-C over a C7 chord.\n\n==Chord types==\n===Basic chord types===\n\nThe above chords, despite their differences, share the same harmonic function and can be used interchangeably.\n\n==== Major chords ====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u03947</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root, 3, 5, M7, (9).\nThe symbols '''<sup>M7</sup>''' and '''<sup>\u03947</sup>''' have the same meaning as '''maj<sup>7</sup>''' or just '''<sup>\u0394</sup>'''. Often melody notes or other pitches influence an improviser's choice of chord types. For example, if the melody note is the root of the chord, including a major seventh can cause dissonance.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major sixth chord on C i.e. C<sup>6</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major sixth chord]] contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, 6.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g a d>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major 6/9 chord on C i.e. C<sup>6/9</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[6/9 chord]] (C<sup>6/9</sup> or C<sup>6add9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, 6, 9.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Lydian chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u0394{{music|sharp}}11</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Lydian chord]] (C<sup>\u0394{{music|sharp}}11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, M7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11 (13).\nThe Lydian chord has a strange quirk, where if you put the root both above and below the augmented eleventh it creates an unpleasant dissonance of a [[tritone]]. This is not usually a problem in a jazz context, as chord-playing musicians often omit the root.\n\nThe interval of the sixth is used, even though it is described after other compound intervals and perhaps should also be a compound interval (i.e., 13th). However, a convention in jazz dictates that when describing the major sixth, generally use the simple interval, i.e., 6 is often used instead of the compound interval, i.e., 13. This helps avoid confusion with the [[dominant thirteenth chord]].\n\n====Basic dominant chords====\nThe term ''basic'' can be used to describe [[Dominant chord|dominant chords]] based on the major scale.{{citation needed|April 2020}} In many instances, dominant chords written as a basic chord (e.g., C<sup>13</sup>) can substitute for a more complex chord, as long as it remains part of the same group (i.e., dominant chords) and does not clash with the melody note.\n\nDominant chords are considered to sound unstable in a [[classical music]] harmony context, and so in a classical piece, these chords often resolve down a perfect fifth or up a perfect fourth (e.g. '''C<sup>7</sup>''' tends to resolve onto chords based on '''F''', such as F major or F minor). However, in a jazz context, particularly in music from the 1940s [[bebop]] era and later decades, dominant chords were no longer treated as \"unstable\" chords. Some bebop tunes use a dominant chord as the [[tonic (music)|tonic chord]] and also use dominant chords for the chords that would typically be minor chords in a [[Classical music|Classical]] piece or a [[Swing music|swing]] arrangement. For example, while a Classical piece and a swing arrangement might use the following chord sequence in the key of C major: \"{{nowrap|C \u2013 Am \u2013 Dm \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", a bebop [[bandleader]] might reharmonize the same progression as \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", making a sequence of dominant seventh chords, so long as the new dominant chord harmonies were compatible with the tune's melody. For more details, see [[chord progression]].\n\nMany of the chordal alterations used in jazz are derived from minor scale modes, as opposed to the major scale modes. (See [[musical mode]]). If the performer retains the 13th in the chord and/or avoids playing a {{music|flat}}13th, it can be substituted for a C<sup>13{{music|flat}}9</sup>. Likewise a C<sup>9</sup> can often be substituted for a Cmaj<sup>9{{music|sharp}}5</sup>, as long as the 9th is retained or the {{music|flat}}9th and {{music|sharp}}9th is avoided.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes>1\n   <c e g bes d>1\n   <c e g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant seventh, ninth, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. C<sup>7</sup>, C<sup>9</sup>, and C<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A [[dominant seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), (13).\n\nA [[dominant ninth chord]] (C<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, 9, (13).\n\nA [[dominant thirteenth chord]] (C<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), 13.\n\nThis symbol is often used if the 13th is found in the melody.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c f g>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Sus chord on C i.e. C<sup>sus4</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Suspended chord|sus, or suspended, chord]] (C<sup>7sus4</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, 4, 5, 7, (9), (13).\n\n====Minor seventh chords====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c es g bes>1\n   <c es g bes d>1\n   <c es g bes d f>1\n   <c es g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Minor seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. Cm<sup>7</sup>, Cm<sup>9</sup>, Cm<sup>11</sup>, Cm<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A minor seventh chord (C\u2212<sup>7</sup>, Cmin<sup>7</sup>, Cmi<sup>7</sup>, or Cm<sup>7</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), (13).\n\nA minor ninth chord (C\u2212<sup>9</sup>, Cmin<sup>9</sup>, Cmi<sup>9</sup>, or Cm<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, 9, (11), (13).\n\nA minor eleventh chord (C\u2212<sup>11</sup>, Cmin<sup>11</sup>, Cmi<sup>11</sup>, or Cm<sup>11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), 11, (13).\n\nA minor thirteenth chord (C\u2212<sup>13</sup>, Cmin<sup>13</sup>, Cmi<sup>13</sup>, or Cm<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), 13.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Complex dominant chords===\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Augmented seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\nThese chords can be voiced in a great variety of ways, including building the chord on the 7 (minor seventh).

In jazz chords and theory, most [[triad (music)|triad]]s that appear in [[lead sheet]]s or [[fake book]]s can have [[Seventh (chord)|sevenths]] added to them, using the performer's discretion and ear. For example, if a tune is in the key of C, if there is a G chord, the chord-playing performer usually [[Chord voicing|voices]] this chord as G<sup>7</sup>. While the notes of a G<sup>7</sup> chord are G\u2013B\u2013D\u2013F, jazz often omits the [[Fifth (chord)|fifth]] of the chord\u2014and even the [[Root (chord)|root]] if playing in a group. However, not all jazz pianists leave out the root when they play voicings: [[Bud Powell]], one of the best-known of the bebop pianists, and [[Horace Silver]], whose quintet included many of jazz's biggest names from the 1950s to the 1970s, included the root note in their voicings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chord-voicings/powell-voicings/|title=Bud Powell Chord Voicings - The Jazz Piano Site|work=The Jazz Piano Site|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/259793476/5-Ways-to-Play-Like-Horace-Silver|title=5 Ways to Play Like Horace Silver {{!}} Jazz {{!}} Piano|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n[[jazz improvisation|Improvising]] chord-playing musicians who omit the root and fifth are given the option to play other notes. For example, if a seventh chord, such as G<sup>7</sup>, appears in a lead sheet or fake book, many chord-playing performers add the [[ninth]], [[thirteenth]] or other notes to the chord, even though the lead sheet does not specify these additional notes. Jazz players can add these additional, upper notes\u2013seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth\u2013because they can create an important part of the jazz sound. Lead sheets and fake books often do not detail how to voice the chord because a lead sheet or fake book is only intended to provide basic guide to the harmony. An experienced \"[[comping]]\" performer playing [[electric guitar]] or [[piano]] may add or remove notes as chosen according to the style and desired sound of that musician, but must do so in a way that still emphasizes the correct musical context for other musicians and listeners.\n\nIn voicing jazz chords, performers focus first on the seventh and the major or minor third of the chord, with the latter indicating the [[major and minor|chord quality]], along with added [[extended chord|chord extensions]] (e.g., ninths, elevenths, or thirteenths, even if not indicated in the lead sheet or fake book) to add tone \"colour\" to the chord. As such, a [[jazz guitar]]ist or [[jazz piano]] player might \"voice\" a printed G<sup>7</sup> chord with the notes B\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A, which would be the third, sixth (thirteenth), flat seventh, and ninth of the chord. Jazz chord-playing musicians may also add [[altered chord|altered chord tones]] (e.g., {{music|b}}9, {{music|#}}9, {{music|#}}11, {{music|b}}13) and [[Added tone chord|added tones]]. An example of an [[altered dominant]] chord in the key of C, built on a G would be to voice the chord as \"B\u2013C{{music|#}}\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A{{music|b}}\"; this would be G<sup>7({{music|b}}9{{music|#}}11)</sup>.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n===Intervals===\nEach chord is described as a series of [[Interval (music)|intervallic]] relationships to the root of the chord. This provides an accurate and easily understandable basis for working out these chords in each key.\n\nThe terms used to describe intervals are as follows:\n*'''r''' = [[root (chord)|root]] of the chord (while the root is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the root is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|flat}}2''' = minor second = 1 [[semitone]] (half step) above the root\n*'''2''' = [[major second]] = 2 semitones above root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}2''' = [[augmented second]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}3''' = [[minor third]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''3''' = [[major third]] = 4 semitones above the root\n*'''4''' = [[perfect fourth]] = 5 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}4''' = [[Augmented Fourth|augmented fourth]] ([[tritone]]) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}5''' = [[diminished fifth]] (tritone) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''5''' = [[perfect fifth]] = 7 semitones above the root (while the fifth is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the fifth is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|sharp}}5''' = [[augmented fifth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}6''' = [[minor sixth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''6''' = [[major sixth]] = 9 semitones above the root\n*'''7''' = [[minor seventh]] = 10 semitones above the root\n*'''M7''' = [[major seventh]] = 11 semitones above the root\n\nAll [[Inversion (music)#Root position|root chords]] are described starting with the lowest note, and ascending in pitch. For instance, a chord described as\n\n:root, 3, 5.\n\ncontains the root, a major third above the root, and a perfect fifth above the root. It is a [[Major chord|major triad]]. If this chord were built on C (with C as the root), it would contain the notes\n\n:C, E, G.\n\n==== Compound intervals ====\n[[Interval (music)#Number|Compound intervals]] are intervals larger than an [[octave]]. They can also be described as an octave plus a simple interval. Note that this is not a complete list of compound intervals, only those that are commonly used in jazz chords.\n\n*'''{{music|flat}}9''' = compound minor second ([[minor ninth]]) = 1 semitone + an octave = 13 semitones above the root\n*'''9''' = compound major second ([[ninth]]) = 2 semitones + an octave = 14 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}9'''/'''{{music|flat}}10''' = compound [[augmented second]]/minor third (augmented ninth/minor tenth) = 3 semitones + an octave = 15 semitones above the root.\n*'''10''' = compound major third ([[tenth (music)|tenth]]) = 4 semitones + an octave = 16 semitones above the root\n*'''11''' = compound perfect fourth ([[eleventh]]) = 5 semitones + an octave = 17 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}11''' = compound augmented fourth  (augmented eleventh) = 6 semitones + an octave = 18 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}13''' = compound minor sixth (minor thirteenth) = 8 semitones + an octave = 20 semitones above the root\n*'''13''' = compound major sixth ([[thirteenth]]) = 9 semitones + an octave = 21 semitones above the root\n\n===Extensions===\n\nOptional extensions to the chords are written in parentheses, e.g. ({{music|sharp}}11). These notes are not necessary to define the function of the chord, but are included to add colour or fill out the sound according to the tastes of the performer. Extensions may be written into the chords when a specific colour or texture is warranted, or the chords in a lead sheet or fake book may simply state \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\". This does not mean that the chord-playing performer can only perform four-note [[dominant seventh]] chords. Chord-playing performers can use their ear, their sense of good taste acquired from listening to jazz, and their knowledge of the style of the tune being played (e.g., is it a [[bebop]] tune or a [[jazz fusion]] tune) to help guide her use of extension notes, altered extensions, and added tones. In a band, the [[bandleader]] might request that certain voicings be used (e.g., {{music|b}}9/{{music|#}}11) or request that certain other voicings be avoided (e.g., {{music|b}}13), due to the bandleader's taste.\n\n===Voicings===\n\nChords are described here in terms of intervals relative to the root of the chord, arranged from smaller intervals to larger. This is a standard method used when describing jazz chords as it shows them hierarchically: Lower intervals (third, [[fifth (chord)|fifth]] and seventh) are more important in defining the function of the chord than the upper intervals or extensions (9th, 11th, 13th), which add color. Although it is possible to play the chords as described here literally, it is possible to use different orderings of the same notes, known as a voicings, or even by omitting certain notes.{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=C<sup>13({{music|sharp}}11)</sup>|max-width=}}For instance, the dominant seventh {{music|sharp}}11 or [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] dominant, C<sup>7{{music|sharp}}11</sup>, comprises the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, (5), 7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11, (13).\n\nBasing this chord on the pitch, C, results in the pitches:\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, G, B{{music|flat}}, D, F{{music|sharp}}, A.\n\nThe same chord type may also be voiced:\n\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, B{{music|flat}}, F{{music|sharp}}, A, D, F{{music|sharp}}.\n\nThis voicing omits both the root and the perfect fifth (G) and raises the major ninth (D) by an octave. The augmented eleventh (F{{music|sharp}}) is also played twice in two different registers. This is known as \"[[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]]\".\n\n===Improvisation===\n\n[[File:Notes bell curve.png|thumb|An arrangement of musical intervals according to how satisfying they may sound.]]\n\nJazz improvisation is partly about selecting intervals within the chord or melody being played at a particular place in a song. While there are no right or wrong choices if notes are played in correct context, the graphic suggests how choices can be anything from boring through interesting to 'wrong' sounding, but judgments are strongly a matter of taste and experience and vary depending on the musician. Notes farther from the chord can often be inserted between other notes that are on the chord, such as E-Eb-Db-C over a C7 chord.\n\n==Chord types==\n===Basic chord types===\n\nThe above chords, despite their differences, share the same harmonic function and can be used interchangeably.\n\n==== Major chords ====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u03947</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root, 3, 5, M7, (9).\nThe symbols '''<sup>M7</sup>''' and '''<sup>\u03947</sup>''' have the same meaning as '''maj<sup>7</sup>''' or just '''<sup>\u0394</sup>'''. Often melody notes or other pitches influence an improviser's choice of chord types.

This is not usually a problem in a jazz context, as chord-playing musicians often omit the root.\n\nThe interval of the sixth is used, even though it is described after other compound intervals and perhaps should also be a compound interval (i.e., 13th). However, a convention in jazz dictates that when describing the major sixth, generally use the simple interval, i.e., 6 is often used instead of the compound interval, i.e., 13. This helps avoid confusion with the [[dominant thirteenth chord]].\n\n====Basic dominant chords====\nThe term ''basic'' can be used to describe [[Dominant chord|dominant chords]] based on the major scale.{{citation needed|April 2020}} In many instances, dominant chords written as a basic chord (e.g., C<sup>13</sup>) can substitute for a more complex chord, as long as it remains part of the same group (i.e., dominant chords) and does not clash with the melody note.\n\nDominant chords are considered to sound unstable in a [[classical music]] harmony context, and so in a classical piece, these chords often resolve down a perfect fifth or up a perfect fourth (e.g. '''C<sup>7</sup>''' tends to resolve onto chords based on '''F''', such as F major or F minor). However, in a jazz context, particularly in music from the 1940s [[bebop]] era and later decades, dominant chords were no longer treated as \"unstable\" chords. Some bebop tunes use a dominant chord as the [[tonic (music)|tonic chord]] and also use dominant chords for the chords that would typically be minor chords in a [[Classical music|Classical]] piece or a [[Swing music|swing]] arrangement. For example, while a Classical piece and a swing arrangement might use the following chord sequence in the key of C major: \"{{nowrap|C \u2013 Am \u2013 Dm \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", a bebop [[bandleader]] might reharmonize the same progression as \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", making a sequence of dominant seventh chords, so long as the new dominant chord harmonies were compatible with the tune's melody. For more details, see [[chord progression]].\n\nMany of the chordal alterations used in jazz are derived from minor scale modes, as opposed to the major scale modes. (See [[musical mode]]). If the performer retains the 13th in the chord and/or avoids playing a {{music|flat}}13th, it can be substituted for a C<sup>13{{music|flat}}9</sup>. Likewise a C<sup>9</sup> can often be substituted for a Cmaj<sup>9{{music|sharp}}5</sup>, as long as the 9th is retained or the {{music|flat}}9th and {{music|sharp}}9th is avoided.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes>1\n   <c e g bes d>1\n   <c e g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant seventh, ninth, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. C<sup>7</sup>, C<sup>9</sup>, and C<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A [[dominant seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), (13).\n\nA [[dominant ninth chord]] (C<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, 9, (13).\n\nA [[dominant thirteenth chord]] (C<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), 13.\n\nThis symbol is often used if the 13th is found in the melody.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c f g>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Sus chord on C i.e. C<sup>sus4</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Suspended chord|sus, or suspended, chord]] (C<sup>7sus4</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, 4, 5, 7, (9), (13).\n\n====Minor seventh chords====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c es g bes>1\n   <c es g bes d>1\n   <c es g bes d f>1\n   <c es g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Minor seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. Cm<sup>7</sup>, Cm<sup>9</sup>, Cm<sup>11</sup>, Cm<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A minor seventh chord (C\u2212<sup>7</sup>, Cmin<sup>7</sup>, Cmi<sup>7</sup>, or Cm<sup>7</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), (13).\n\nA minor ninth chord (C\u2212<sup>9</sup>, Cmin<sup>9</sup>, Cmi<sup>9</sup>, or Cm<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, 9, (11), (13).\n\nA minor eleventh chord (C\u2212<sup>11</sup>, Cmin<sup>11</sup>, Cmi<sup>11</sup>, or Cm<sup>11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), 11, (13).\n\nA minor thirteenth chord (C\u2212<sup>13</sup>, Cmin<sup>13</sup>, Cmi<sup>13</sup>, or Cm<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), 13.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Complex dominant chords===\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Augmented seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\nThese chords can be voiced in a great variety of ways, including building the chord on the 7 (minor seventh).

For expediency, musicians may use the abbreviation \"alt\"\u2014as in C<sup>7alt</sup>\u2014to describe the family of dominant chords with [[alteration (music)|altered tones]] (including the {{music|flat}}5, {{music|sharp}}5, {{music|flat}}9, {{music|sharp}}9, or {{music|flat}}13). Coincidentally, all altered tones mentioned above are present in the [[melodic minor scale]] whose root is a half-step above the root of the [[altered chord|alt chord]] (i.e., E{{music|flat}} melodic minor for D<sup>7alt</sup>) In the previous dominant chords, it was noted that the perfect fifth is often omitted. When the fifth is augmented, the fifth is played by chord-playing musicians.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes dis>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant {{music|sharp}}9/{{music|sharp}}5 chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}9{{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA dominant {{music|sharp}}9/{{music|sharp}}5 chord (C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5{{music|sharp}}9)</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, {{music|sharp}}5, 7, {{music|sharp}}9.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes des>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant {{music|flat}}9/{{music|sharp}}5 chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|flat}}9/{{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\nA dominant {{music|flat}}9/{{music|sharp}}5 chord (C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5{{music|flat}}9)</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, {{music|sharp}}5, 7, {{music|flat}}9.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n\n*Nettles, Barrie & Graf, Richard (1997).
