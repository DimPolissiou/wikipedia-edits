After serving as [[President of the United States]] (1789 to 1797), he briefly was in charge of a new army in 1798. \n\nWashington, despite his youth,  played a major role in the frontier wars against the French and Indians in the 1750s and 1760s. He played the leading military role in the [[American Revolution]].  When the war broke out with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, Congress appointed him the first commander-in-chief of the new Continental Army on June 14. The task he took on was enormous, balancing regional demands, competition among his subordinates, morale among the rank and file, attempts by Congress to manage the army's affairs too closely, requests by state governors for support, and an endless need for resources with which to feed, clothe, equip, arm, and move the troops.  He was not usually in command of the many state militia units.\n\nIn the early years of the war Washington was often in the middle of the action, first directing the [[Siege of Boston]] to its successful conclusion, but then [[New York and New Jersey campaign|losing New York City and almost losing New Jersey]] before winning surprising and decisive victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] at the end of the 1776 campaign season.  At the end of the year in both 1775 and 1776, he had to deal with expiring enlistments, since the Congress had only authorized the army's existence for single years.   With the 1777 establishment of a more permanent army structure and the introduction of three-year enlistments, Washington built a reliable stable of experienced troops, although hard currency and supplies of all types were difficult to come by.  In 1777 Washington was again defeated in [[Philadelphia campaign|the defense of Philadelphia]], but sent critical support to [[Horatio Gates]] that made the [[Battles of Saratoga|defeat of Burgoyne at Saratoga]] possible.  Following a difficult winter at [[Valley Forge]] and the [[Franco-American alliance|entry of France into the war]] in 1778, Washington followed the British army as it withdrew from Philadelphia back to New York, and fought an [[Battle of Monmouth|ultimately inconclusive battle]] at Monmouth Court House in New Jersey.\n\nWashington's activities from late 1778 to 1780 were more diplomatic and organizational, as his army remained outside New York, watching [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton's]] army that occupied the city.  Washington strategized with the French on how best to cooperate in actions against the British, leading to ultimately unsuccessful attempts to dislodge the British from [[Battle of Rhode Island|Newport, Rhode Island]] and [[Siege of Savannah|Savannah, Georgia]].  His attention was also drawn to the frontier war, which prompted [[Sullivan Expedition|the 1779 Continental Army expedition]] of [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] into upstate New York.  When General Clinton sent the turncoat General Benedict Arnold to raid in Virginia, Washington began to detach elements of his army to face the growing threat there.  The arrival of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] in Virginia after [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|campaigning in the south]] presented Washington with an opportunity to strike a decisive blow.  Washington's army and the French army moved south to face Cornwallis, and a cooperative French navy under [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse]] successfully [[Battle of the Chesapeake|disrupted British attempts]] to control of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], completing the entrapment of Cornwallis, who surrendered after the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781.  Although Yorktown marked the end of significant hostilities in North America, the British still occupied New York and other cities, so Washington had to maintain the army in the face of a bankrupt Congress and troops that were at times mutinous over conditions and pay.  The army was formally disbanded after peace in 1783, and Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief on December 23, 1783.\n\n==Military experience==\n{{See also|Military career of George Washington|George Washington in the French and Indian War}}\nBorn into a well-to-do Virginia family near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] in {{OldStyleDateDY||1732|1731}}, Washington was schooled locally until the age of 15.  The early death of his father when he was 11 eliminated the possibility of schooling in England, and his mother rejected attempts to place him in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Freeman, pp. 1:1\u2013199</ref>  Thanks to the connection by marriage of his half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]] to the wealthy Fairfax family, Washington was appointed surveyor of [[Culpeper County, Virginia|Culpeper County]] in 1749; he was just 17 years old.  Washington's brother had purchased an interest in the [[Ohio Company]], a land acquisition and settlement company whose objective was the settlement of Virginia's frontier areas, including the [[Ohio Country]], territory north and west of the [[Ohio River]].<ref>Chernow, ch. 1</ref>  Its investors also included Virginia's Royal Governor, [[Robert Dinwiddie]], who appointed Washington a major in the provincial militia in February 1753.<ref>Anderson, p. 30</ref><ref>Freeman, p. 1:268</ref>\n\n[[File:FortDuquesne.jpg|thumb|right|Washington was in the vanguard of British forces that occupied [[Fort Duquesne]], recently abandoned by the French, in 1758.]]\nWashington [[George Washington in the French and Indian War|played a key role]] in the outbreak of the [[French and Indian War]], and then led the defense of Virginia between 1755 and 1758 as colonel of the [[Virginia Regiment]].  Although Washington never received a commission in the British Army, he gained valuable military, political, and leadership skills,<ref>Chernow, ch. 8; Freeman and Harwell, pp. 135\u2013139; Flexner (1974), pp. 32\u201336;  Higginbotham (1985), ch. 1</ref> and received significant public exposure in the colonies and abroad.<ref>Joseph Ellis, ''His Excellency: George Washington'' (2004), p. 14</ref><ref name=OM45>O'Meara, p. 45</ref>  He closely observed British military tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution.  He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats.  He developed a command presence\u2014given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question.<ref>Ellis, pp. 38,69</ref><ref>Fischer, p. 13</ref> Washington learned to organize, train, and drill, and discipline his companies and regiments.  From his observations, readings and conversations with professional officers, he learned the basics of battlefield tactics, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics.<ref>Higginbotham (1985), pp. 14\u201315</ref>\nHe gained an understanding of overall strategy, especially in locating strategic geographical points.<ref>Lengel, p. 80</ref>  He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars.<ref>Higginbotham (2004), pp. 22\u201325</ref> On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1,000 men, and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton and Philadelphia.<ref>Freeman and Harwell, pp. 136\u2013137</ref>\n\n==Political resistance==\n[[File:George Washington in 1772 at age 40.jpg|thumb|right|Washington in 1772]]In December 1758 Washington resigned his military commission, and spent the next 16 years as a wealthy Virginia plantation owner; as such he also served in the [[Virginia House of Burgesses]].  Although he expressed opposition to the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]], the first direct tax on the colonies, he did not take a leading role in the growing colonial resistance until protests of the [[Townshend Acts]] (enacted in 1767) became widespread.  In May 1769, Washington introduced a proposal, drafted by his friend [[George Mason]], calling for Virginia to boycott British goods until the Acts were repealed.<ref>Freeman and Harwell, pp. 174\u2013176</ref> Parliament repealed the Townshend Acts in 1770, and, for Washington at least, the crisis had passed. However, Washington regarded the passage of the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774 as \"an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges\".<ref>Randall (1998), p. 262</ref>  In July 1774, he chaired the meeting at which the \"[[Fairfax Resolves]]\" were adopted, which called for, among other things, the convening of a [[Continental Congress]]. In August, Washington attended the [[First Virginia Convention]], where he was selected as a delegate to the [[First Continental Congress]].<ref>Ferling (1998), p. 99</ref>  As tensions rose in 1774, he assisted in the training of county militias in Virginia and organized enforcement of the boycott of British goods instituted by the Congress.<ref>Lengel, p. 84</ref><ref>Ferling (1998), p. 108</ref>\n\n==Major roles==\nGeneral Washington, the Commander in Chief, assumed five main roles during the war.<ref> R. Don Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref><ref>Douglas Southall  Freeman, ''George Washington'' (1952) 5:478-501. </ref><ref>Marcus Cunliffe \"George Washington's Generalship\" in Billias, ed., ''George Washington's Generals'' pp 3-21.</ref>\n\n*First, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers it sent--they were decisive in the great victory at Yorktown in 1781.<ref>Robert Selig, ''March to victory: Washington, Rochambeau, and the Yorktown Campaign of 1781'' (2005) [https://history.army.mil/html/books/rochambeau/index.html online].</ref>\n*Second, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost many of his battles, but he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.  Washington worked hard to develop a successful espionage system to detect British locations and plans. In 1778, he formed the [[Culper Ring]] to spy on enemy movements in New York City. In 1780 it discovered [[Benedict Arnold]] was a traitor.<ref>Alexander Rose, ''Washington's Spies'' (2006).  pp 258\u201361.</ref> The British intelligence system was completely fooled in 1781, unaware that Washington and the French armies were moving from the Northeast to Yorktown, Virginia.<ref> Edward G. Lengel, ''General George Washington: A Military Life'' (2005) p 336.</ref>\n*Third, he was charged selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Gardner Bell|title=Commanding Generals and Chiefs of Staff, 1775-2005: Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xwyykzbi4pUC&pg=PA3|year=2005|pages=3\u20134}}</ref><ref>Douglas S. Freeman, and Richard Harwell, ''Washington'' (1968) p 42.</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref>\n*Fourth, he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them, who transformed Washington's army into a disciplined and effective force.<ref>Arnold Whitridge, \"Baron von Steuben, Washington's Drillmaster.\" ''History Today'' (July 1976) 26#7 pp 429-36.</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775-1783'' (1990) p 220.</ref>\n*Washington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>Lengel, ''General George Washington'' (2005) pp 365-71.</ref>\n\n===Intelligence===\n{{Further|Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War}}\nGeorge Washington was a skilled manager of intelligence. He utilized agents behind enemy lines, recruited both Tory and Patriot sources, interrogated travelers for intelligence information, and launched scores of agents on both intelligence and counterintelligence missions. He was adept at deception operations and tradecraft and was a skilled propagandist. He also practiced sound operational security.<ref> See [http://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-revolutionary-war/spying-and-espionage/george-washington-spymaster/  \"George Washington, Spymaster\" at ''George Washington's Mount Vernon''] </ref> His main failure was missing all the signals in 1780 that [[Benedict Arnold]] was increasingly disaffected and had Loyalist connections.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Washington: A Life'' (2010) pp 379-86.</ref>) \n\nAs an intelligence manager, Washington insisted that the terms of an agent's employment and his instructions be precise and in writing. He emphasized his desire for receiving written, rather than verbal, reports. He demanded repeatedly that intelligence reports be expedited, reminding his officers of those bits of intelligence he had received which had become valueless because of delay in getting them to him. He also recognized the need for developing many different sources so that their reports could be cross-checked, and so that the compromise of one source would not cut off the flow of intelligence from an important area.<ref>Alexander Rose, ''Washington's Spies: The Story of America's First Spy Ring'' (2007).</ref>\n\nWashington sought and obtained a \"secret service fund\" from the Continental Congress.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael E.

Washington appeared at the [[Second Continental Congress]] in a military uniform, signaling that he was prepared for war.<ref>Lengel, p. 86</ref> Congress created the [[Continental Army]] on June 14, 1775, and discussed who should lead it.  Washington had the prestige, military experience, charisma and military bearing of a military leader and was known as a strong patriot; he was also popular in his home province.  There was no other serious competition for the post, although Washington did nothing to actively pursue the appointment.  Massachusetts delegate [[John Adams]] nominated Washington, believing that appointing a southerner to lead what was then primarily an army of northerners would help unite the colonies. Washington reluctantly accepted, declaring \"with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the Command I [am] honored with.\"<ref>Ellis, pp. 68\u201372</ref><ref>Ellis,</ref>\n\n[[File:SiegeBoston.jpg|thumb|left|British forces evacuate the city at the end of the [[Siege of Boston]].]]\nWashington assumed command of the colonial forces outside Boston on July 3, 1775, during the ongoing [[siege of Boston]], after stopping in [[New York City]] to begin organizing military companies for its defense.<ref>Schecter, p. 61</ref>  His first steps were to establish procedures and to weld what had begun as militia regiments into an effective fighting force.<ref>Lengel, pp. 105\u2013109</ref>  He was assisted in this effort by his adjutant, Brigadier General [[Horatio Gates]], and Major General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], both of whom had significant experience serving in the British Army.<ref>Lengel, p. 94, 109\u2013111</ref>\n\nWhen inventory returns exposed a dangerous shortage of gunpowder, Washington asked for new sources. British arsenals were raided (including some in the West Indies) and some manufacturing was attempted; a barely adequate supply (about 2.5 million pounds) was obtained by the end of 1776, mostly from France.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Orlando W|title=The Supply of Gunpowder in 1776|journal=American Historical Review|issue=Vol. 30, No. 2|date=January 1925|pages=271\u2013281|jstor=1836657}}</ref>  In search of heavy weapons, he sent [[Henry Knox]] on [[Noble train of artillery|an expedition]] to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] to retrieve cannons that [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|had been captured there]].<ref>McCullough, p. 84</ref>  He resisted repeated calls from Congress to launch attacks against the British in Boston, calling war councils that supported the decisions against such action.<ref>McCullough, pp. 53, 86</ref>  Before the [[Continental Navy]] was established in November 1775 he, without Congressional authorization, began arming a \"secret navy\" to prey on poorly protected British transports and supply ships.<ref>Nelson, p. 86</ref>  When Congress authorized an [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Quebec]], believing [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|that province's]] people would also rise against British military control, Washington reluctantly went along with it,<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 94</ref> even authorizing [[Benedict Arnold]] to [[Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec|lead a force]] from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] to [[Quebec City]] through the wilderness of present-day [[Maine]].<ref>Lengel, p. 113</ref>\n\nAs the siege dragged on, the matter of expiring enlistments became a matter of serious concern.<ref>Lengel, p. 114</ref>  Washington tried to convince Congress that enlistments longer than one year were necessary to build an effective fighting force, but he was rebuffed in this effort.

Congress insisted that he defend it and recognizing the city's importance as a naval base and gateway to the [[Hudson River]], Washington delegated the task of fortifying New York to Charles Lee in February 1776.<ref>Lengel, p. 179</ref>  The faltering military campaign in Quebec also led to calls for additional troops there, and Washington detached six regiments northward under [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] in April.<ref>Johnston, p. 63</ref>  The wider theaters of war had also introduced regional frictions into the army.  Somewhat surprised that regional differences would be a problem, on August 1 he read a speech to the army, in which he threatened to punish \"any officers or soldiers so lost to virtue and a love of their country\" that might exacerbate the regional differences.<ref name=Flexner93>Flexner (1968), p. 93</ref>  The mixing of forces from different regions also brought more widespread camp diseases, especially [[dysentery]] and [[smallpox]].<ref name=Flexner93/>\n\nWashington had to deal with his first major command controversy while in New York, which was partially a product of regional friction.  New England troops serving in northern New York under General [[Philip Schuyler]], a scion of an old [[patroon]] family of New York, objected to his aristocratic style, and their Congressional representatives lobbied Washington to replace Schuyler with General Gates.  Washington tried to resolve the issue by giving Gates command of the forces in Quebec, but the collapse of the Quebec expedition brought renewed complaints.<ref>Flexner (1968), p. 99</ref>  Despite Gates' experience, Washington personally preferred Schuyler. To avoid a potentially messy situation, General Washington gave Schuyler overall command of the northern department, but assigned Gates as second in command with combat authority.  The episode exposed Washington to Gates' desire for advancement, possibly at his expense, and to the latter's influence in Congress.<ref>Flexner (1968), p. 100</ref>\n\nGeneral Howe's army, reinforced by thousands of additional troops from Europe and a fleet under the command of his brother, Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]], began arriving the entrance of [[New York Harbor]] (at [[the Narrows]]), in early July, and made an unopposed landing on [[Staten Island]].<ref>Fischer, p. 34</ref>  Without intelligence about Howe's intentions, Washington was forced to divide his still poorly trained forces, principally between Manhattan and Long Island.<ref>Fischer, pp. 83\u201389</ref>  The Howes, who were politically ambivalent about the conflict, had been authorized to act as peace commissioners, and attempted to establish contact with Washington.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  However, they refused to address their letters to \"General George Washington\", and his representatives refused to accept them.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\n[[File:Retreat from long island.jpg|thumb|left|Washington leads the retreat from Long Island.]]\nIn August, the British finally launched their [[New York and New Jersey campaigns|campaign to capture New York City]].  They first landed on Long Island in force, and flanked Washington's forward positions in the [[Battle of Long Island]].  General Howe refused to act on a significant tactical advantage that could have resulted in the capture of the remaining Continental troops on Long Island, but he chose instead to besiege the fortified positions to which they had retreated.<ref>Fischer, pp. 89\u2013102</ref>  Although Washington has been criticized by many historians for sending additional troops to reinforce the redoubts on Long Island, it was clear to both Washington and the Howes that the Americans had successfully blocked the [[East River]] against major shipping by sinking ships in the channel, and that he was consequently not risking the entrapment of additional men.<ref>Flexner (1968), p. 113</ref>  In the face of a siege he seemed certain to lose, Washington then decided to withdraw.  In what some historians call one of his greatest military feats, he executed a nighttime withdrawal from Long Island across the [[East River]] to Manhattan to save those troops and [[materiel]].<ref name=F1027/>\n\nThe Howe brothers then paused to consolidate their position, and the admiral engaged in a [[Staten Island Peace Conference|fruitless peace conference]] with Congressional representatives on September 11.  Four days later the British [[Landing at Kip's Bay|landed on Manhattan]], a bombardment from the river scattering inexperienced militia into a panicked retreat, and forcing Washington to retreat further.<ref name=F1027>Fischer, pp. 102\u2013107</ref>  After Washington stopped the British advance up Manhattan [[Battle of Harlem Heights|at Harlem Heights]] on September 16, Howe again made a flanking maneuver, landing troops [[Battle of Pell's Point|at Pell's Point]] in a bid to cut off Washington's avenue of retreat.  To defend against this move, Washington withdrew most of his army to [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], where [[Battle of White Plains|after a short battle]] on October 28 he retreated further north.  This isolated the remaining Continental Army troops in upper Manhattan, so Howe returned to Manhattan and [[Battle of Fort Washington|captured]] [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]] in mid November, taking almost 3,000 prisoners. Four days later, [[Fort Lee Historic Park|Fort Lee]], across the Hudson River from Fort Washington, was also taken.  Washington brought much of his army across the Hudson into New Jersey, but was immediately forced to retreat by the aggressive British advance.<ref>Fischer, pp. 107\u2013125</ref>\n\nDuring the campaign a general lack of organization, shortages of supplies, fatigue, sickness, and above all, lack of confidence in the American leadership resulted in a melting away of untrained regulars and frightened militia.  Washington grumbled, \"The honor of making a brave defense does not seem to be sufficient stimulus, when the success is very doubtful, and the falling into the Enemy's hands probable.\"<ref>Fischer, p. 101</ref>  Washington was fortunate that General Howe was more focused on gaining control of New York than on destroying Washington's army.<ref>Gruber, p. 133</ref>  Howe's overly rigid adherence to his plans meant that he was unable to capitalize on the opportunities that arose during the campaign for a decisive action against Washington.<ref>Billias, p. 55</ref>\n\n==Counterattack in New Jersey==\n[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware (1851 painting)|Washington Crossing the Delaware]],'' by [[Emanuel Leutze]], 1851]]\n{{Main|Battle of Trenton|Battle of the Assunpink Creek|Battle of Princeton}}\n\nAfter the loss of New York, Washington's army was in two pieces.  One detachment remained north of New York to protect the Hudson River corridor, while Washington retreated across New Jersey into Pennsylvania, chased by General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles, Earl Cornwallis]].<ref>Schecter, pp. 259\u2013263</ref>  Spirits were low, popular support was wavering, and Congress had abandoned Philadelphia, fearing a British attack.<ref>Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142</ref>  Washington ordered General Gates to bring troops from Fort Ticonderoga, and also ordered General Lee's troops, which he had left north of New York City, to join him.<ref>Fischer, p. 150</ref>  Lee, whose relationship with Washington was at times difficult, made excuses and only traveled as far as [[Morristown, New Jersey]].  When Lee strayed too far from his army on December 12, his exposed position was betrayed by Loyalists, and a British company led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]] surrounded the inn where he was staying and took him prisoner.  Lee's command was taken over by John Sullivan, who finished marching the army to Washington's camp across the river from [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]].<ref>Schecter, pp. 262\u2013266</ref>\n\nThe capture of Lee resulted an important point in negotiations between the sides concerning the treatment of prisoners.  Since Lee had previously served in the British Army, he was treated as a [[deserter]], and threatened with military punishments appropriate to that charge.  Even though he and Lee did not get on well, Washington threatened to treat captured British officers in the same manner Lee and other high-profile prisoners were treated.<ref>Lengel, p. 289</ref>  This resulted in an improvement in Lee's captivity, and he was eventually exchanged for [[Richard Prescott]] in 1778.<ref>Leckie, p. 471</ref>\n\nDespite the loss of troops due to desertion and expiring enlistments, Washington was heartened by a rise in militia enlistments in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.<ref>Fischer, pp. 196\u2013200</ref>  These militia companies were active in circumscribing the furthest outposts of the British, limiting their ability to scout and forage.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 228\u2013230</ref>  Although Washington did not coordinate this resistance, he took advantage of it to organize an attack on an outpost of [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]]s in Trenton.<ref>Fischer, p. 201</ref>  On the night of December&nbsp;25\u201326, 1776, Washington led his forces [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|across the Delaware River]] and [[Battle of Trenton|surprised the Hessian garrison]] the following morning, capturing 1,000 men.<ref>Ketchum pp. 250\u2013275</ref>\n\n[[File:George Washington at Princeton.jpg|thumb|left|upright|100px|''George Washington at Princeton'' by [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1779]]\nThis action significantly boosted the army's morale, but it also brought Cornwallis out of New York.  He reassembled an army of more than 6,000 men, and marched most of them against a position Washington had taken south of Trenton. Leaving a garrison of 1,200 at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], Cornwallis then [[Battle of the Assunpink Creek|attacked Washington's position]] on January 2, 1777, and was three times repulsed before darkness set in.<ref>Fischer, pp. 209\u2013307</ref>  During the night Washington evacuated the position, masking his army's movements by instructing the camp guards to maintain the appearance of a much larger force.<ref>Ketchum p. 294</ref>  Washington then circled around Cornwallis's position with the intention of attacking the Princeton garrison.<ref>Schecter, p. 267</ref>\n\nOn January 3, [[Hugh Mercer]], leading the American advance guard, encountered British soldiers from Princeton under the command of [[Charles Mawhood]]. The British troops engaged Mercer and in [[Battle of Princeton|the ensuing battle]], Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent reinforcements under General [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]], which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton. The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle, and American morale rose with the victory.<ref>Schecter, p. 268</ref>\n\nThese unexpected victories drove the British back to the New York City area, and gave a dramatic boost to Revolutionary morale.<ref>Leckie, pp. 333\u2013335</ref>  During the winter, Washington, based in winter quarters at Morristown, loosely coordinated a low-level [[Forage War|militia war]] against British positions in New Jersey, combining the actions of New Jersey and Pennsylvania militia companies with careful use of Continental Army resources to harry and harass the British and German troops quartered in New Jersey.<ref>Fischer, pp. 354\u2013382</ref>\n\nWashington's mixed performance in the 1776 campaigns had not led to significant criticism in Congress.<ref name=Ferling125/>  Before fleeing Philadelphia for [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] in December, Congress granted Washington powers that have ever since been described as \"dictatorial\".<ref>Ketchum, p. 211</ref>  The successes in New Jersey nearly deified Washington in the eyes of some Congressmen, and the body became much more deferential to him as a result.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 126</ref>  John Adams complained of the \"superstitious veneration\" that Washington was receiving.<ref name=Ferling125>Ferling (2010), p. 125</ref>  Washington's performance also received international notice: [[Frederick the Great]], one of the greatest military minds, wrote that \"the achievements of Washington [at Trenton and Princeton] were the most brilliant of any recorded in the history of military achievements.\"<ref>Leckie, p. 333</ref>  The French foreign minister, a strong supporter of the American cause, renewed the delivery of French supplies.<ref>Leckie, p. 335</ref>\n\n==Philadelphia and Valley Forge==\n{{main|Philadelphia campaign|Saratoga campaign}}\n\n===Early maneuvers===\nIn May 1777, uncertain whether General Howe would move north toward Albany or south toward Philadelphia, Washington moved his army to the [[Middlebrook encampment]] in New Jersey's [[Watchung Mountains]].  When Howe then moved his army southwest from New Brunswick, Washington correctly interpreted this as a move to draw him out of his strong position, and refused to move.  Only after Howe apparently retreated back toward the shore did Washington follow, but Howe's attempt to separate him from his mountain defenses was foiled in the [[Battle of Short Hills]] in late June.<ref>Leckie, pp. 344\u2013346</ref>  Howe, who had already decided to campaign against Philadelphia, then withdrew from New Jersey, embarked much of his army on ships in late July, and sailed away, leaving Washington mystified as to his destination.<ref>Leckie, p. 346</ref>\n\n[[File:Gen. Sir William Howe.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]]]]\nWashington's difficulty in discerning Howe's motives was due to the presence of a British army moving south from Quebec toward Fort Ticonderoga under the command of General [[John Burgoyne]].  Howe's departure was in part prompted by the successful [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|capture of the fort]] by Burgoyne in early July.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 128</ref>  Although there had been an expectation on Burgoyne's part that Howe would support [[Saratoga campaign|his campaign]] to gain control of the Hudson, Howe was to disappoint Burgoyne, with disastrous consequences to the British.<ref>Leckie, p. 377</ref>  When Washington learned of the abandonment of Ticonderoga (which he had been told by General [[Anthony Wayne]] \"can never be carried, without much loss of blood\"),<ref>Furneaux, p. 58</ref> he was shocked.  Concerned that Howe was heading up the Hudson, he ordered Arnold,<ref name=\"Leckie, p. 387\">Leckie, p. 387</ref> along with [[Daniel Morgan]] and his corps of riflemen, north to assist General Gates with the defense of the Hudson.<ref>Ellis, p. 105</ref>\n\nWashington had had some difficulty with General Arnold in the spring.  Congress had adopted a per-state scheme for the promotion of general officers, which resulted in the promotion of several officers to [[major general]] ahead of other officers with more experience or seniority.  Combined with the commissioning of foreign officers to high ranks, this had led to the resignation of [[John Stark]].  Arnold, who had distinguished himself in the Canadian campaign, had also threatened to resign.<ref>Randall (1990), pp. 331\u2013336</ref><ref>Leckie, p. 386</ref>  Washington wrote to Congress on behalf of Arnold and other officers who were disgruntled by this promotion scheme, stating that \"two or three other very good officers\" might be lost because of it.  Washington had also laid the seeds for conflict between Arnold and Gates when he gave Arnold command of forces in [[Rhode Island]] in late 1776; because of this move Gates came to view Arnold as a competitor for advancement, and the previously positive relationship between Gates and Arnold cooled.<ref>Martin, p. 307</ref>  However, Arnold put aside his complaints when the news of Ticonderoga's fall arrived, and agreed to serve.<ref name=\"Leckie, p. 387\"/>\n\nCongress, at the urging of its diplomatic representatives in Europe, had also issued military commissions to a number of European soldiers of fortune in early 1777.  Two of those recommended by [[Silas Deane]], the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] and [[Thomas Conway]], would prove to be important in Washington's activities.<ref>Leckie, p. 341</ref><ref>Ferling (2010), p. 149</ref>  Lafayette, just twenty years old, was at first told that Deane had exceeded his authority in offering him a major general's commission, but offered to volunteer in the army at his own expense.<ref>Leckie, pp. 342\u2013343</ref>  Washington and Lafayette took an instant liking to one another when they met, and Lafayette became one of Washington's most trusted generals and confidants.<ref>Lengel, p. xxix</ref>  Conway, on the other hand, did not think highly of Washington's leadership, and proved to be a source of trouble in the 1777 campaign season and its aftermath.<ref>Lengel, pp. xxii, xxv</ref>\n\n===Fall of Philadelphia===\nWhen Washington learned that Howe's fleet was sailing north in [[Chesapeake Bay]], he hurried his army south of Philadelphia to defend the city against Howe's threat.<ref>Leckie, p. 348</ref>  General Howe turned Washington's flank at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, and marched unopposed into Philadelphia on September 26 after some further maneuvers.  Washington's failure to defend the capital brought on a storm of criticism from Congress, which fled the city for [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], and from other army officers.  In part to silence his critics, Washington planned an elaborate assault on an exposed British base in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]].<ref>Leckie, pp. 356\u2013358</ref><ref>Lengel, p. 253</ref>  The October 4 [[Battle of Germantown]] failed in part due to the complexity of the assault, and the inexperience of the militia forces employed in it. Over 400 of Washington's men were captured, including Colonel [[George Mathews (Georgia)|George Mathews]] and the entire [[9th Virginia Regiment]].<ref name=Jenkins>Jenkins, Charles F. (1904) ''The Guide Book to Historic Germantown'', Innes & Sons, 1904.Jenkins, Charles F.

Historian Robert Leckie observes that the battle was a near thing, and that a small number of changes might have resulted in a decisive victory for Washington.<ref>Leckie, p. 365</ref>\n\n[[File:The March to Valley Forge William Trego.png|thumb|right|Washington's army as it marches toward [[Valley Forge]]]]\nMeanwhile, Burgoyne, out of reach from help from Howe, was trapped and forced to surrender his entire army on October 17, ten days after the [[Battle of Bemis Heights]].<ref>Leckie, pp. 414\u2013416</ref>  The victory made a hero of General Gates, who received the adulation of Congress.<ref>Lengel, p. 277</ref>  While this was taking place Washington presided from a distance over the loss of control of the Delaware River to the British, and marched his army to its winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]] in December.<ref>Lengel, pp. 263\u2013267</ref>  Washington chose Valley Forge, over recommendations that he camp either closer or further from Philadelphia, because it was close enough to monitor British army movements, and protected rich farmlands to the west from the enemy's foraging expeditions.<ref>Leckie, p. 434</ref>\n\n===Valley Forge===\nWashington's army stayed at Valley Forge for the next six months.<ref>Leckie, pp. 435, 469</ref> Over the winter, 2,500 men (out of 10,000) died from disease and exposure.  The army's difficulties were exacerbated by a number of factors, including a quartermaster's department that had been badly mismanaged by one of Washington's political opponents, [[Thomas Mifflin]], and the preference of farmers and merchants to sell their goods to the British for hard currency instead of the nearly worthless Continental currency.<ref name=L435/><ref>Fleming, pp. 89\u201391</ref>  Profiteers also sought to benefit at the army's expense, charging it 1,000 times what they charged civilians for the same goods.  Congress authorized Washington to seize supplies needed for the army, but he was reluctant to use such authority, since it smacked of the tyranny the war was supposedly being fought over.<ref name=L435>Leckie, p. 435</ref>\n\nDuring the winter he introduced a full-scale training program supervised by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff.  Despite the hardships the army suffered, this program was a remarkable success, and Washington's army emerged in the spring of 1778 a much more disciplined force.<ref>Leckie, pp. 438\u2013444</ref>\n\nWashington himself had to face discontent at his leadership from a variety of sources.  His loss of Philadelphia prompted some members of Congress to discuss removing him from command.<ref>Chernow, p. 316</ref>  They were prodded along by Washington's detractors in the military, who included Generals Gates, Mifflin, and Conway.<ref name=Chernow320>Chernow, p. 320</ref>  Gates in particular was viewed by Conway and Congressmen [[Benjamin Rush]] and [[Richard Henry Lee]] as a desirable replacement for Washington.<ref>Fleming, pp. 93\u201397, 121</ref><ref>Leckie, p. 450</ref>  Although there is no evidence of a formal conspiracy, the episode is known as the [[Conway Cabal]] because the scale of the discontent within the army was exposed by a critical letter from Conway to Gates, some of whose contents were relayed to Washington.<ref>Leckie, pp. 445\u2013449</ref>  Washington exposed the criticisms to Congress, and his supporters, within Congress and the army, rallied to support him.<ref>Chernow, pp. 317\u2013320</ref>  Gates eventually apologized for his role in the affair, and Conway resigned.<ref>Fleming, p. 202</ref><ref>Leckie, p. 451</ref>  Washington's position and authority were not seriously challenged again.  Biographer Ron Chernow points out that Washington's handling of the episode demonstrated that he was \"a consummate political infighter\" who maintained his temper and dignity while his opponents schemed.<ref name=Chernow320/>\n\n==French entry into the war==\nThe victory at Saratoga (and to some extent Washington's near success at Germantown) were influential in convincing France to enter the war openly as an [[Franco-American alliance|American ally]].  French entry into the war changed its dynamics, for the British were no longer sure of command of the seas and had to worry about an invasion of their home islands and other colonial territories across the globe. The British, now under the command of General Sir [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]], evacuated Philadelphia in 1778 and returned to New York City, with Washington attacking them along the way at the [[Battle of Monmouth]]; this was the last major battle in the north.  Prior to the battle Washington gave command of the advance forces to Charles Lee, who had been exchanged earlier in the year.  Lee, despite firm instructions from Washington, refused Lafayette's suggestion to launch an organized attack on the British rear, and then retreated when the British turned to face him. When Washington arrived at the head of the main army, he and Lee had an angry exchange of words, and Washington ordered Lee off the command.  Washington, with his army's tactics and ability to execute improved by the training programs of the previous winter, was able to recover, and fought the British to a draw.  Lee was court martialed and eventually dismissed from the army.<ref>Leckie, pp. 467\u2013489</ref>\n\n[[File:George Washington at Monmouth, 06-28-1778 - 06-28-1778 - NARA - 532864 - cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Washington at the [[Battle of Monmouth]]]]\nNot long after Clinton's return to New York, a French fleet arrived off the North American coast.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:45</ref>  Washington was involved in the discussion on how to best use this force, and an attack was planned against the British outpost at [[Newport, Rhode Island]].<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:50\u201352</ref>  Despite the presence of two of Washington's most reliable subordinates, Lafayette and Greene, [[Battle of Rhode Island|the attempt at cooperation]] was a dismal failure.<ref>Leckie, p. 492</ref><ref>Freeman, p. 5:52</ref>  British and Indian forces organized and supported by Sir [[Frederick Haldimand]] in Quebec began to [[Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga|raid frontier settlements]] in 1778, and [[Savannah, Georgia]] was [[Capture of Savannah|captured]] late in the year.<ref>Leckie, pp. 492\u2013493</ref>\n\nDuring the comparatively mild winter of 1778\u201379, Washington and Congress discussed options for the 1779 campaign season.  The possibility of a Franco-American campaign against Quebec, first proposed for 1778, had a number of adherents in Congress, and was actively supported by Lafayette in Washington's circle.<ref>Ferling (2010), pp. 169\u2013171</ref>  Despite known weaknesses in Quebec's provincial defenses, Washington was adamantly opposed to the idea, citing the lack of troops and supplies with which to conduct such an operation, the nation's fragile financial state, and French imperial ambitions to recover the territory.<ref>Ferling (2010), pp. 186\u2013188</ref>  Under pressure from Congress to answer the frontier raids, Washington countered with the proposal of a major expedition against the [[Iroquois]].  This was approved, and in the summer of 1779 a sizable force under Major General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] made [[Sullivan Expedition|a major expedition]] into the northwestern frontier of New York in reprisal for the frontier raids.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 194</ref><ref>Leckie, pp. 493\u2013495</ref>  The expedition successfully drove the Iroquois out of New York, but otherwise had little effect on the frequency and severity of frontier raids.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 195</ref>\n\n[[File:WayneAtStonyPoint1779.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Anthony Wayne]] leading forces at the 1779 [[Battle of Stony Point]]]]\nWashington's opponent in New York, however, was not inactive.  Clinton engaged in a number of amphibious raids against coastal communities from [[Tryon's raid|Connecticut]] to [[Chesapeake raid|Chesapeake Bay]], and probed at Washington's defenses in the Hudson River valley.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 196</ref>  Coming up the river in force, he captured the key outpost of [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]], but advanced no further.  When Clinton weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organized a counterstrike.  General [[Anthony Wayne]] led a force that, solely using the bayonet, [[Battle of Stony Point|recaptured Stony Point]].<ref>Leckie, p. 502</ref>  The Americans chose not to hold the post, but the operation was a boost to American morale and a blow to British morale.  American morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when the second major attempt at Franco-American cooperation, [[Siege of Savannah|an attempt to retake Savannah]], failed with heavy casualties.<ref>Leckie, pp. 503\u2013504</ref>\n\n==British southern strategy ==\nThe winter of 1779\u201380 was one of the coldest in recorded colonial history.  New York Harbor froze over, and the winter camps of the Continental Army were deluged with snow, resulting in hardships exceeding those experienced at Valley Forge.<ref>Leckie, p. 504</ref>  The war was declining in popularity, and the inflationary issuance of paper currency by Congress and the states alike harmed the economy, and the ability to provision the army.  The paper currency also hit the army's morale, since it was how the troops were paid.<ref>Leckie, p. 505</ref>  Congress fixed the rate between paper and gold dollars at 40-to-1 in March 1780, but many merchants refused to accept the Continental currency at the official exchange rate.  One Loyalist wrote, \"Mock-money and mock-states shall melt away // And the mock troops disband for want of pay.\"<ref>Leckie, p. 506</ref>\n\n[[File:Sirhenryclinton2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]]]]\nThe British in late 1779 embarked on a new strategy based on the assumption that most Southerners were Loyalists at heart.  General Clinton withdrew the British garrison from Newport, and marshalled a force of more than 10,000 men that in the first half of 1780 successfully [[Siege of Charleston|besieged Charleston, South Carolina]].  In June 1780 he captured over 5,000 Continental soldiers and militia in the single worst defeat of the war for the Americans.<ref>Leckie, pp. 496, 507\u2013517</ref>  Washington had at the end of March pessimistically dispatched several regiments troops southward from his army, hoping they might have some effect in what he saw as a looming disaster.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:155</ref>  He also ordered troops stationed in Virginia and North Carolina south,<ref>Leckie, p. 528</ref> but these were either captured at Charleston, or scattered later at [[Battle of Waxhaws|Waxhaws]] and [[Battle of Camden|Camden]].  Camden saw the ignominious defeat of General Gates, who had been appointed to the southern command by Congress without Washington's advice or knowledge beforehand.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:172</ref>  Gates famously abandoned his army and retreated {{convert|180|mi|km}} by horse after his battle lines were broken.<ref>Leckie, pp. 533\u2013538</ref>  The debacle ended Gates' career as a field officer,<ref>Grizzard, p. 128</ref> but he eluded formal inquiries into his behavior because of his political connections.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:423</ref>\n\nWashington's army suffered from numerous problems in 1780: it was undermanned, underfunded, and underequipped.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:152\u2013155</ref>  Because of these shortcomings Washington resisted calls for major expeditions, preferring to remain focused on the principal British presence in New York.  Knowledge of discontent within the ranks in New Jersey prompted the British in New York to make two attempts to reach the principal army base at Morristown.  These attempts were defeated, with significant militia support, in battles at [[Battle of Connecticut Farms|Connecticut Farms]] and [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|Springfield]].<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:169\u2013173</ref>\n\n==Arnold's treason==\nThe British withdrew from Philadelphia, in June 1778, and Washington appointed Major General [[Benedict Arnold]] as military commander of the city.<ref>Willard M. Wallace, \"Benedict Arnold: Traitorous Patriot.\" in George Athan Billias, ed., ''George Washington\u2019s Generals'' (1964): 163-93.</ref>  Historian John Shy states:\n:Washington then made one of the worst decisions of his career, appointing Arnold as military governor of the rich, politically divided city.  No one could have been less qualified for the position. Arnold had amply demonstrated his tendency to become embroiled in disputes, as well as his lack of political sense. Above all, he needed tact, patience, and fairness in dealing with a people deeply marked by months of enemy occupation.<ref> John Shy, \"Arnold, Benedict,\" ''American National Biography'' (1999) https://doi.org/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.0200008</ref>\n\nSeptember 1780 brought a new shock to Washington.  British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] had been arrested outside New York, and papers he carried exposed treason by Arnold.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:190-222.</ref> Washington greatly respected Arnold for his military skills, and with his serious injuries saw he was not ready for a combat command so he gave him a role in Philadelphia.<ref>Chernow, p. 338</ref> During his administration there, Arnold entertained lavishly in high society yet had made many political enemies. He married vivacious [[Peggy Shippen]], who had been courted by British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]]. After the wedding she kept in contact with Andr\u00e9, who in 1779 became the head of British spy operations in New York City. Arnold in 1779 began secret negotiations with General Clinton. Andr\u00e9 was his contact, and Peggy passed the messages.  Arnold pleaded with Washington, who appointed him commander of West Point, the major Patriot strong point in New York. He agreed to surrender it to the British for \u00a320,000.<ref>Leckie, pp. 549\u2013569</ref>  Arnold was alerted to Andr\u00e9's arrest and escaped with only to spare.  Everyone  on both sides admired Andr\u00e9 and despised Arnold; Washington offered to exchange Andr\u00e9 for Arnold, but Clinton could not go that far.  Andr\u00e9 was hanged as a spy, and Arnold became a brigadier general in the British Army.<ref>Leckie, pp. 578\u2013581</ref>  Washington organized an attempt to kidnap Arnold from New York City; it was frustrated when Arnold was sent on a raiding expedition to Virginia.<ref>Chernow, pp. 382-87</ref>\n\n==Yorktown==\n{{main|Yorktown campaign}}\n[[File:Bataille de Yorktown by Auguste Couder.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Washington and the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] at Yorktown]]\nThe early months of 1781 continued to be difficult for the American cause.  Troops [[Pennsylvania Line Mutiny|mutinied in Pennsylvania]], inspiring troops in New Jersey to also do so.  Washington was uninvolved in resolving the Pennsylvania troops' demands, but he sent troops under General [[Robert Howe (Continental Army officer)|Robert Howe]] that harshly put down the New Jersey mutiny, hanging two men.<ref>Ward, pp. 625\u2013626</ref>\n\nGeneral Arnold's raiding expedition to Virginia was a notable success, ravaging the countryside and destroying military and economic infrastructure and supplies.  He was ineffectually opposed by Virginia militia and Continental recruits under Baron von Steuben.<ref>Ward, pp. 868\u2013870</ref>  Washington ordered Lafayette and additional Continental troops south, and convinced French Admiral [[Charles Ren\u00e9 Dominique Sochet, Chevalier Destouches|Destouches]] to send his Newport-based fleet to the Chesapeake.  Destouches was however opposed by the British fleet of Admiral [[Marriot Arbuthnot]] at the [[Battle of Cape Henry]] in March 1781, and was unable to gain entry to the bay.  General Clinton thereafter sent more troops to Virginia under General [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]], who resumed raiding operations in central Virginia.<ref>Ward, p. 870</ref>\n\nIn the early months of 1781 the French foreign minister, the [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|comte de Vergennes]], realized that the war, now being conducted on a global stage, could not last much longer without decisive action in North America.<ref>Ferling, p. 207</ref>  To this end, the French army at Newport was ordered to join Washington's outside New York, and the [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Comte de Grasse]], commander of that year's West Indies fleet, was ordered to assist in operations in North America.  France also gave six million [[French livre|livres]] to the United States to assist in the war effort.<ref>Dull, p. 329</ref>\n\nIn May 1781 Washington and the French army command met at [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]] after the French instructions arrived.  They discussed options for joint operations, with Washington arguing for an assault on New York, and Rochambeau for operations in Virginia against General Phillips.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:285\u2013292</ref>  Rochambeau agreed to bring his army to New York, and dispatches were sent to the West Indies outlining the options to de Grasse.<ref>Leckie, pp. 637\u2013638</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]]]]\nGeneral Clinton had turned over command of the southern army to General Cornwallis.  After the defeat of Gates at Camden, he had nominally gained control over South Carolina, although there was significant militia skirmishing, led by partisan fighters like [[Francis Marion]] and [[Thomas Sumter]].<ref>Leckie, p. 527</ref>  Cornwallis then attempted to extend British authority into North Carolina, but one wing of his army was defeated in the October 1780 [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and another was defeated in the January 1781 [[Battle of Cowpens]].  Kings Mountain in particular proved a decisive blow to further attempts to recruit Loyalists, and force Cornwallis had been instructed to rely upon.<ref>Ward, pp. 737\u2013762</ref>  In the wake of Camden, Washington had selected Nathanael Greene to replace Gates at the head of the southern Continental forces, and Greene waged an effect partisan campaign against Cornwallis.  When he finally reached sufficient strength, Greene offered Cornwallis open battle at [[Hillsboro, North Carolina]] in March.  Although he lost the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], Greene inflicted significant casualties on Cornwallis while retaining his own army intact.<ref>Ward, pp. 748,763\u2013794</ref>\n\nCornwallis moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] to regroup, and then made the controversial decision to bring his army into Virginia, which he saw as the supply base for Greene's army.<ref>Ward, pp. 795\u2013797</ref>  Joining with the army of Phillips, he maneuvered against the growing Continental presence led by Lafayette, while continuing to raid and destroy economic and military targets in the state.<ref>Ward, pp. 872\u2013876</ref>  Eventually his decision to enter Virginia reached Clinton, who was surprised at the move.  After a series of confusing and sometimes contradictory suggestions, Clinton in late July issued firm orders to Cornwallis to establish a fortified deep-water port in Virginia.  Cornwallis informed Clinton that he would do so at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]].<ref>Ward, pp. 875\u2013878</ref><ref>Wickwire, pp. 349\u2013351</ref>\n\n===Siege and victory===\n{{main|Siege of Yorktown}}\nAdmiral de Grasse received the dispatches of Washington and Rochambeau in mid-July.  He immediately sent dispatches north indicating that he would be sailing for the Chesapeake Bay to assist in operations there.<ref>Linder, p. 14</ref>  When Washington learned of this decision, he reluctantly abandoned the idea of attacking New York.<ref>Leckie, p. 639</ref>  In a brilliant but risky strategic move, he marched 6,000 soldiers from New York to Virginia, leaving the New York highlands only lightly defended.<ref>Ward, pp. 880\u2013884</ref>  Washington would in later years claim that early preparations to operate against New York were intended to deceive Clinton, but the documentary record of 1781 did not support him.<ref>Chernow, p. 404</ref>  Later operations, as the march got underway, did involve deliberate deception. As part of the march troops appeared to establish camps and other works on the west side of the Hudson, as if preparing for an attack on New York.<ref>Chernow, p. 407</ref>  By the time Clinton saw through the deception, Washington had already crossed the Delaware.<ref>Leckie, p. 642</ref>\n\nDe Grasse sailed north with his entire fleet (28 [[ships of the line]]), while his British counterpart, [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]] (not expecting de Grasse to take his entire fleet) sent only 15 ships in pursuit.<ref>Larrabee, pp. 156, 175</ref>  In early September, while the French and Continental armies marched south, de Grasse and the British fleet (enlarged by the inclusion of ships from New York to 19 ships) met in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]].  The French victory was strategically vital, for it denied the British control of the Chesapeake and set the stage for the encirclement of Cornwallis at Yorktown.<ref>Leckie, pp. 646\u2013648</ref>\n\n[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|340px|''[[Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]]'', by [[John Trumbull]], 1820]]\nUpon his arrival at Yorktown Washington had command of 5,700 Continentals, 3,200 militia and 7,800 French regulars.<ref>Ward, pp. 886\u2013887</ref>  On September 28 the Franco-American army blockaded Yorktown, and began digging siege trenches on October 6.  By the 9th guns had been emplaced on the first parallel, and began firing on the entrenched British camp.  Work proceeded rapidly thereafter on the second parallel, only {{convert|300|yd|m}} from the British defenses.  On the 14th two outer redoubts of the British defenses were stormed, and the entirety of the British camp was with range of the French and American cannons.  After a failed attempt to escape across the York River, Cornwallis opened negotiations on October 17.  Two days later terms were agreed, and his 8,000 men paraded in surrender.<ref>Ward, pp. 888\u2013895</ref>  Despite the size of the contending forces, and the importance of the siege, there were only 260 allied and 550 British casualties.<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775\u20131783'' (2005)  p. 301</ref>  One of the American casualties was Washington's stepson and aide-de-camp [[John Parke Custis]], who died of a camp disease during the siege.<ref>Chernow, p. 421</ref>\n\nThe disaster at Yorktown broke the morale of the governing class in London and paralyzed Britain's national will to make war.  The war party in Britain lost control of Parliament, and the new government opened peace talks.  These came to fruition in 1783 with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], in which Britain recognized American independence.<ref>John Brooke, ''King George III'' (1972) pp. 353\u2013354</ref>\n\n==Waiting for peace==\nFollowing Yorktown, Washington's army returned to New York, while Rochambeau's remained in Virginia.  Washington, concerned that Congress \"may think our work too nearly closed\", worked to make sure that the army would be prepared for a campaign in 1782.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:401\u2013404</ref>  Although British ship movements caused Washington some concerns during the winter of 1781\u20132, he was able to enjoy relative comfort in Philadelphia.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:406\u2013408</ref>  He returned to his headquarters in [[Newburgh, New York]] in March 1782, where he had to deal with greedy military supply contractors.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:410\u2013411</ref>  The execution of militia officer [[Joshua Huddy]] by Loyalists occasioned an exchange between Washington and Clinton, and led to the so-called \"[[Asgill Affair]]\", after [[Sir Charles Asgill, 2nd Baronet|the officer]] selected to be executed in retaliation for Huddy's hanging.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:412\u2013414</ref>  Despite the onset of peace negotiations in the second half of 1782, Washington remained vigilant, treating with suspicion assertions on the part of General Clinton's replacement, [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Sir Guy Carleton]], that he had suspended \"all hostilities\".<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:420\u2013421</ref>  To boost morale, Washington introduced the [[Badge of Military Merit]], to be awarded for \"unusual gallantry\" or \"extraordinary fidelity and essential service\".  The badge, a purple-colored cloth in the shape of a heart, is a precursor to the modern American [[Purple Heart]].<ref>Chernow, p. 429</ref>\n\n[[File:TreatyOfParisDraftLastPage.jpg|thumb|left|Page of draft peace treaty signed September 3, 1783]]\nIn 1783 Washington continued to keep the army ready at Newburgh, although some of his officers [[Newburgh Conspiracy|made veiled threats]] to Congress about long-overdue pay.  Washington diffused this hint at mutiny with an address to the troops on March 15 recommending patience.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:431\u2013435</ref>  On March 26 he was informed that France and Spain had made peace with Britain, one of the last preconditions for a final peace.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:439</ref>  Thereafter he was occupied with the logistics of prisoner exchanges, and pressed Congress to ensure soldiers being furloughed or discharged received at least some of their back pay.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:441</ref>  He met once with General Carleton to discuss the return of runaway slaves, a contentious point on which Carleton refused to budge.  (Carleton announced in the meeting, to Washington's apparent chagrin, that 6,000 Negroes had already been sent to Nova Scotia, and refused to assist the efforts of slave hunters.)<ref>Chernow, p. 441</ref>  In June [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|troops in Pennsylvania mutinied]], marching on Philadelphia and surrounding the State House where Congress sat.

He has been characterized, according to historian [[Edward G. Lengel]], in many different ways: \"charismatic hero, master of guerrilla warfare, incompetent or infallible battlefield commander, strategic genius, nationalist visionary, fanatical micromanager, and lucky dog\".<ref>Lengel, p. 365</ref>  Although he has frequently been said to engage in the [[Fabian strategy]] of wearing his opponent down, the truth is more nuanced.  On a number of occasions his subordinates convinced him to hold off on plans of attack they saw as rash.<ref>Lengel, p. 366</ref>  Washington only really adopted a Fabian strategy between late 1776 and the middle of 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By August 1777, however, Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence and stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth and Yorktown.<ref>Buchanan, p. 226</ref>\n\nWashington is often characterized as complaining about undisciplined militia forces, but he understood that they were a vital part of the nation's defenses, since [[regular army]] troops could not be everywhere.<ref>Higginbotham (1985), p. 59</ref>  He was also at times critical of the mercenary spirit and \"the dearth of public spirit\" that often underlay difficulties in recruiting for the army.<ref>Higginbotham (1985), pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\nOne of Washington's important contributions as commander-in-chief was to establish the precedent that elected civilian officials, rather than military officers, possessed ultimate [[Civilian control of the military|authority over the military]]. Throughout the war, he deferred to the authority of Congress and state officials, and he relinquished his considerable military power once the fighting was over.

After serving as [[President of the United States]] (1789 to 1797), he briefly was in charge of a new army in 1798. \n\nWashington, despite his youth,  played a major role in the frontier wars against the French and Indians in the 1750s and 1760s. He played the leading military role in the [[American Revolution]].  When the war broke out with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, Congress appointed him the first commander-in-chief of the new Continental Army on June 14. The task he took on was enormous, balancing regional demands, competition among his subordinates, morale among the rank and file, attempts by Congress to manage the army's affairs too closely, requests by state governors for support, and an endless need for resources with which to feed, clothe, equip, arm, and move the troops.  He was not usually in command of the many state militia units.\n\nIn the early years of the war Washington was often in the middle of the action, first directing the [[Siege of Boston]] to its successful conclusion, but then [[New York and New Jersey campaign|losing New York City and almost losing New Jersey]] before winning surprising and decisive victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] at the end of the 1776 campaign season.  At the end of the year in both 1775 and 1776, he had to deal with expiring enlistments, since the Congress had only authorized the army's existence for single years.   With the 1777 establishment of a more permanent army structure and the introduction of three-year enlistments, Washington built a reliable stable of experienced troops, although hard currency and supplies of all types were difficult to come by.  In 1777 Washington was again defeated in [[Philadelphia campaign|the defense of Philadelphia]], but sent critical support to [[Horatio Gates]] that made the [[Battles of Saratoga|defeat of Burgoyne at Saratoga]] possible.  Following a difficult winter at [[Valley Forge]] and the [[Franco-American alliance|entry of France into the war]] in 1778, Washington followed the British army as it withdrew from Philadelphia back to New York, and fought an [[Battle of Monmouth|ultimately inconclusive battle]] at Monmouth Court House in New Jersey.\n\nWashington's activities from late 1778 to 1780 were more diplomatic and organizational, as his army remained outside New York, watching [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton's]] army that occupied the city.  Washington strategized with the French on how best to cooperate in actions against the British, leading to ultimately unsuccessful attempts to dislodge the British from [[Battle of Rhode Island|Newport, Rhode Island]] and [[Siege of Savannah|Savannah, Georgia]].  His attention was also drawn to the frontier war, which prompted [[Sullivan Expedition|the 1779 Continental Army expedition]] of [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] into upstate New York.  When General Clinton sent the turncoat General Benedict Arnold to raid in Virginia, Washington began to detach elements of his army to face the growing threat there.  The arrival of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] in Virginia after [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|campaigning in the south]] presented Washington with an opportunity to strike a decisive blow.  Washington's army and the French army moved south to face Cornwallis, and a cooperative French navy under [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse]] successfully [[Battle of the Chesapeake|disrupted British attempts]] to control of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], completing the entrapment of Cornwallis, who surrendered after the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781.  Although Yorktown marked the end of significant hostilities in North America, the British still occupied New York and other cities, so Washington had to maintain the army in the face of a bankrupt Congress and troops that were at times mutinous over conditions and pay.  The army was formally disbanded after peace in 1783, and Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief on December 23, 1783.\n\n==Military experience==\n{{See also|Military career of George Washington|George Washington in the French and Indian War}}\nBorn into a well-to-do Virginia family near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] in {{OldStyleDateDY||1732|1731}}, Washington was schooled locally until the age of 15.  The early death of his father when he was 11 eliminated the possibility of schooling in England, and his mother rejected attempts to place him in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Freeman, pp. 1:1\u2013199</ref>  Thanks to the connection by marriage of his half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]] to the wealthy Fairfax family, Washington was appointed surveyor of [[Culpeper County, Virginia|Culpeper County]] in 1749; he was just 17 years old.  Washington's brother had purchased an interest in the [[Ohio Company]], a land acquisition and settlement company whose objective was the settlement of Virginia's frontier areas, including the [[Ohio Country]], territory north and west of the [[Ohio River]].<ref>Chernow, ch. 1</ref>  Its investors also included Virginia's Royal Governor, [[Robert Dinwiddie]], who appointed Washington a major in the provincial militia in February 1753.<ref>Anderson, p. 30</ref><ref>Freeman, p. 1:268</ref>\n\n[[File:FortDuquesne.jpg|thumb|right|Washington was in the vanguard of British forces that occupied [[Fort Duquesne]], recently abandoned by the French, in 1758.]]\nWashington [[George Washington in the French and Indian War|played a key role]] in the outbreak of the [[French and Indian War]], and then led the defense of Virginia between 1755 and 1758 as colonel of the [[Virginia Regiment]].

He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats.  He developed a command presence\u2014given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question.<ref>Ellis, pp. 38,69</ref><ref>Fischer, p. 13</ref> Washington learned to organize, train, and drill, and discipline his companies and regiments.  From his observations, readings and conversations with professional officers, he learned the basics of battlefield tactics, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics.<ref>Higginbotham (1985), pp. 14\u201315</ref>\nHe gained an understanding of overall strategy, especially in locating strategic geographical points.<ref>Lengel, p. 80</ref>  He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars.<ref>Higginbotham (2004), pp. 22\u201325</ref> On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1,000 men, and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton and Philadelphia.<ref>Freeman and Harwell, pp. 136\u2013137</ref>\n\n==Political resistance==\n[[File:George Washington in 1772 at age 40.jpg|thumb|right|Washington in 1772]]In December 1758 Washington resigned his military commission, and spent the next 16 years as a wealthy Virginia plantation owner; as such he also served in the [[Virginia House of Burgesses]].  Although he expressed opposition to the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]], the first direct tax on the colonies, he did not take a leading role in the growing colonial resistance until protests of the [[Townshend Acts]] (enacted in 1767) became widespread.  In May 1769, Washington introduced a proposal, drafted by his friend [[George Mason]], calling for Virginia to boycott British goods until the Acts were repealed.<ref>Freeman and Harwell, pp. 174\u2013176</ref> Parliament repealed the Townshend Acts in 1770, and, for Washington at least, the crisis had passed. However, Washington regarded the passage of the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774 as \"an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges\".<ref>Randall (1998), p. 262</ref>  In July 1774, he chaired the meeting at which the \"[[Fairfax Resolves]]\" were adopted, which called for, among other things, the convening of a [[Continental Congress]]. In August, Washington attended the [[First Virginia Convention]], where he was selected as a delegate to the [[First Continental Congress]].<ref>Ferling (1998), p. 99</ref>  As tensions rose in 1774, he assisted in the training of county militias in Virginia and organized enforcement of the boycott of British goods instituted by the Congress.<ref>Lengel, p. 84</ref><ref>Ferling (1998), p. 108</ref>\n\n==Major roles==\nGeneral Washington, the Commander in Chief, assumed five main roles during the war.<ref> R. Don Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref><ref>Douglas Southall  Freeman, ''George Washington'' (1952) 5:478-501. </ref><ref>Marcus Cunliffe \"George Washington's Generalship\" in Billias, ed., ''George Washington's Generals'' pp 3-21.</ref>\n\n*First, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers it sent--they were decisive in the great victory at Yorktown in 1781.<ref>Robert Selig, ''March to victory: Washington, Rochambeau, and the Yorktown Campaign of 1781'' (2005) [https://history.army.mil/html/books/rochambeau/index.html online].</ref>\n*Second, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost many of his battles, but he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.  Washington worked hard to develop a successful espionage system to detect British locations and plans. In 1778, he formed the [[Culper Ring]] to spy on enemy movements in New York City. In 1780 it discovered [[Benedict Arnold]] was a traitor.<ref>Alexander Rose, ''Washington's Spies'' (2006).  pp 258\u201361.</ref> The British intelligence system was completely fooled in 1781, unaware that Washington and the French armies were moving from the Northeast to Yorktown, Virginia.<ref> Edward G. Lengel, ''General George Washington: A Military Life'' (2005) p 336.</ref>\n*Third, he was charged selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Gardner Bell|title=Commanding Generals and Chiefs of Staff, 1775-2005: Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xwyykzbi4pUC&pg=PA3|year=2005|pages=3\u20134}}</ref><ref>Douglas S. Freeman, and Richard Harwell, ''Washington'' (1968) p 42.</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref>\n*Fourth, he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them, who transformed Washington's army into a disciplined and effective force.<ref>Arnold Whitridge, \"Baron von Steuben, Washington's Drillmaster.\" ''History Today'' (July 1976) 26#7 pp 429-36.</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775-1783'' (1990) p 220.</ref>\n*Washington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>Lengel, ''General George Washington'' (2005) pp 365-71.</ref>\n\n===Intelligence===\n{{Further|Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War}}\nGeorge Washington was a skilled manager of intelligence. He utilized agents behind enemy lines, recruited both Tory and Patriot sources, interrogated travelers for intelligence information, and launched scores of agents on both intelligence and counterintelligence missions. He was adept at deception operations and tradecraft and was a skilled propagandist. He also practiced sound operational security.<ref> See [http://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-revolutionary-war/spying-and-espionage/george-washington-spymaster/  \"George Washington, Spymaster\" at ''George Washington's Mount Vernon''] </ref> His main failure was missing all the signals in 1780 that [[Benedict Arnold]] was increasingly disaffected and had Loyalist connections.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Washington: A Life'' (2010) pp 379-86.</ref>) \n\nAs an intelligence manager, Washington insisted that the terms of an agent's employment and his instructions be precise and in writing. He emphasized his desire for receiving written, rather than verbal, reports. He demanded repeatedly that intelligence reports be expedited, reminding his officers of those bits of intelligence he had received which had become valueless because of delay in getting them to him. He also recognized the need for developing many different sources so that their reports could be cross-checked, and so that the compromise of one source would not cut off the flow of intelligence from an important area.<ref>Alexander Rose, ''Washington's Spies: The Story of America's First Spy Ring'' (2007).</ref>\n\nWashington sought and obtained a \"secret service fund\" from the Continental Congress.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael E.

In accounting for the sums in his journals, he did not identify the recipients: \"The names of persons who are employed within the Enemy's lines or who may fall within their power cannot be inserted.\"  He instructed his generals to \"leave no stone unturned, nor do not stick to expense\" in gathering intelligence, and urged that those employed for intelligence purposes be those \"upon whose firmness and fidelity we may safely rely.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Intelligence in the War of Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lvMFrQr0LwC|page=36}}</ref>\n\n==Boston==\n{{main|Boston campaign}}\nAfter the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] near Boston in April 1775, the colonies went to war.  Washington appeared at the [[Second Continental Congress]] in a military uniform, signaling that he was prepared for war.<ref>Lengel, p. 86</ref> Congress created the [[Continental Army]] on June 14, 1775, and discussed who should lead it.  Washington had the prestige, military experience, charisma and military bearing of a military leader and was known as a strong patriot; he was also popular in his home province.  There was no other serious competition for the post, although Washington did nothing to actively pursue the appointment.  Massachusetts delegate [[John Adams]] nominated Washington, believing that appointing a southerner to lead what was then primarily an army of northerners would help unite the colonies. Washington reluctantly accepted, declaring \"with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the Command I [am] honored with.\"<ref>Ellis, pp. 68\u201372</ref><ref>Ellis,</ref>\n\n[[File:SiegeBoston.jpg|thumb|left|British forces evacuate the city at the end of the [[Siege of Boston]].]]\nWashington assumed command of the colonial forces outside Boston on July 3, 1775, during the ongoing [[siege of Boston]], after stopping in [[New York City]] to begin organizing military companies for its defense.<ref>Schecter, p. 61</ref>  His first steps were to establish procedures and to weld what had begun as militia regiments into an effective fighting force.<ref>Lengel, pp. 105\u2013109</ref>  He was assisted in this effort by his adjutant, Brigadier General [[Horatio Gates]], and Major General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], both of whom had significant experience serving in the British Army.<ref>Lengel, p. 94, 109\u2013111</ref>\n\nWhen inventory returns exposed a dangerous shortage of gunpowder, Washington asked for new sources. British arsenals were raided (including some in the West Indies) and some manufacturing was attempted; a barely adequate supply (about 2.5 million pounds) was obtained by the end of 1776, mostly from France.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Orlando W|title=The Supply of Gunpowder in 1776|journal=American Historical Review|issue=Vol. 30, No. 2|date=January 1925|pages=271\u2013281|jstor=1836657}}</ref>  In search of heavy weapons, he sent [[Henry Knox]] on [[Noble train of artillery|an expedition]] to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] to retrieve cannons that [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|had been captured there]].<ref>McCullough, p. 84</ref>  He resisted repeated calls from Congress to launch attacks against the British in Boston, calling war councils that supported the decisions against such action.<ref>McCullough, pp. 53, 86</ref>  Before the [[Continental Navy]] was established in November 1775 he, without Congressional authorization, began arming a \"secret navy\" to prey on poorly protected British transports and supply ships.<ref>Nelson, p. 86</ref>  When Congress authorized an [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Quebec]], believing [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|that province's]] people would also rise against British military control, Washington reluctantly went along with it,<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 94</ref> even authorizing [[Benedict Arnold]] to [[Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec|lead a force]] from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] to [[Quebec City]] through the wilderness of present-day [[Maine]].<ref>Lengel, p. 113</ref>\n\nAs the siege dragged on, the matter of expiring enlistments became a matter of serious concern.<ref>Lengel, p. 114</ref>  Washington tried to convince Congress that enlistments longer than one year were necessary to build an effective fighting force, but he was rebuffed in this effort.

Congress insisted that he defend it and recognizing the city's importance as a naval base and gateway to the [[Hudson River]], Washington delegated the task of fortifying New York to Charles Lee in February 1776.<ref>Lengel, p. 179</ref>  The faltering military campaign in Quebec also led to calls for additional troops there, and Washington detached six regiments northward under [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] in April.<ref>Johnston, p. 63</ref>  The wider theaters of war had also introduced regional frictions into the army.  Somewhat surprised that regional differences would be a problem, on August 1 he read a speech to the army, in which he threatened to punish \"any officers or soldiers so lost to virtue and a love of their country\" that might exacerbate the regional differences.<ref name=Flexner93>Flexner (1968), p. 93</ref>  The mixing of forces from different regions also brought more widespread camp diseases, especially [[dysentery]] and [[smallpox]].<ref name=Flexner93/>\n\nWashington had to deal with his first major command controversy while in New York, which was partially a product of regional friction.  New England troops serving in northern New York under General [[Philip Schuyler]], a scion of an old [[patroon]] family of New York, objected to his aristocratic style, and their Congressional representatives lobbied Washington to replace Schuyler with General Gates.  Washington tried to resolve the issue by giving Gates command of the forces in Quebec, but the collapse of the Quebec expedition brought renewed complaints.<ref>Flexner (1968), p. 99</ref>  Despite Gates' experience, Washington personally preferred Schuyler. To avoid a potentially messy situation, General Washington gave Schuyler overall command of the northern department, but assigned Gates as second in command with combat authority.  The episode exposed Washington to Gates' desire for advancement, possibly at his expense, and to the latter's influence in Congress.<ref>Flexner (1968), p. 100</ref>\n\nGeneral Howe's army, reinforced by thousands of additional troops from Europe and a fleet under the command of his brother, Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]], began arriving the entrance of [[New York Harbor]] (at [[the Narrows]]), in early July, and made an unopposed landing on [[Staten Island]].<ref>Fischer, p. 34</ref>  Without intelligence about Howe's intentions, Washington was forced to divide his still poorly trained forces, principally between Manhattan and Long Island.<ref>Fischer, pp. 83\u201389</ref>  The Howes, who were politically ambivalent about the conflict, had been authorized to act as peace commissioners, and attempted to establish contact with Washington.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  However, they refused to address their letters to \"General George Washington\", and his representatives refused to accept them.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\n[[File:Retreat from long island.jpg|thumb|left|Washington leads the retreat from Long Island.]]\nIn August, the British finally launched their [[New York and New Jersey campaigns|campaign to capture New York City]].  They first landed on Long Island in force, and flanked Washington's forward positions in the [[Battle of Long Island]].  General Howe refused to act on a significant tactical advantage that could have resulted in the capture of the remaining Continental troops on Long Island, but he chose instead to besiege the fortified positions to which they had retreated.<ref>Fischer, pp. 89\u2013102</ref>  Although Washington has been criticized by many historians for sending additional troops to reinforce the redoubts on Long Island, it was clear to both Washington and the Howes that the Americans had successfully blocked the [[East River]] against major shipping by sinking ships in the channel, and that he was consequently not risking the entrapment of additional men.<ref>Flexner (1968), p. 113</ref>  In the face of a siege he seemed certain to lose, Washington then decided to withdraw.  In what some historians call one of his greatest military feats, he executed a nighttime withdrawal from Long Island across the [[East River]] to Manhattan to save those troops and [[materiel]].<ref name=F1027/>\n\nThe Howe brothers then paused to consolidate their position, and the admiral engaged in a [[Staten Island Peace Conference|fruitless peace conference]] with Congressional representatives on September 11.  Four days later the British [[Landing at Kip's Bay|landed on Manhattan]], a bombardment from the river scattering inexperienced militia into a panicked retreat, and forcing Washington to retreat further.<ref name=F1027>Fischer, pp. 102\u2013107</ref>  After Washington stopped the British advance up Manhattan [[Battle of Harlem Heights|at Harlem Heights]] on September 16, Howe again made a flanking maneuver, landing troops [[Battle of Pell's Point|at Pell's Point]] in a bid to cut off Washington's avenue of retreat.  To defend against this move, Washington withdrew most of his army to [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], where [[Battle of White Plains|after a short battle]] on October 28 he retreated further north.  This isolated the remaining Continental Army troops in upper Manhattan, so Howe returned to Manhattan and [[Battle of Fort Washington|captured]] [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]] in mid November, taking almost 3,000 prisoners. Four days later, [[Fort Lee Historic Park|Fort Lee]], across the Hudson River from Fort Washington, was also taken.  Washington brought much of his army across the Hudson into New Jersey, but was immediately forced to retreat by the aggressive British advance.<ref>Fischer, pp. 107\u2013125</ref>\n\nDuring the campaign a general lack of organization, shortages of supplies, fatigue, sickness, and above all, lack of confidence in the American leadership resulted in a melting away of untrained regulars and frightened militia.  Washington grumbled, \"The honor of making a brave defense does not seem to be sufficient stimulus, when the success is very doubtful, and the falling into the Enemy's hands probable.\"<ref>Fischer, p. 101</ref>  Washington was fortunate that General Howe was more focused on gaining control of New York than on destroying Washington's army.<ref>Gruber, p. 133</ref>  Howe's overly rigid adherence to his plans meant that he was unable to capitalize on the opportunities that arose during the campaign for a decisive action against Washington.<ref>Billias, p. 55</ref>\n\n==Counterattack in New Jersey==\n[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware (1851 painting)|Washington Crossing the Delaware]],'' by [[Emanuel Leutze]], 1851]]\n{{Main|Battle of Trenton|Battle of the Assunpink Creek|Battle of Princeton}}\n\nAfter the loss of New York, Washington's army was in two pieces.  One detachment remained north of New York to protect the Hudson River corridor, while Washington retreated across New Jersey into Pennsylvania, chased by General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles, Earl Cornwallis]].<ref>Schecter, pp. 259\u2013263</ref>  Spirits were low, popular support was wavering, and Congress had abandoned Philadelphia, fearing a British attack.<ref>Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142</ref>  Washington ordered General Gates to bring troops from Fort Ticonderoga, and also ordered General Lee's troops, which he had left north of New York City, to join him.<ref>Fischer, p. 150</ref>  Lee, whose relationship with Washington was at times difficult, made excuses and only traveled as far as [[Morristown, New Jersey]].  When Lee strayed too far from his army on December 12, his exposed position was betrayed by Loyalists, and a British company led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]] surrounded the inn where he was staying and took him prisoner.  Lee's command was taken over by John Sullivan, who finished marching the army to Washington's camp across the river from [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]].<ref>Schecter, pp. 262\u2013266</ref>\n\nThe capture of Lee resulted an important point in negotiations between the sides concerning the treatment of prisoners.  Since Lee had previously served in the British Army, he was treated as a [[deserter]], and threatened with military punishments appropriate to that charge.  Even though he and Lee did not get on well, Washington threatened to treat captured British officers in the same manner Lee and other high-profile prisoners were treated.<ref>Lengel, p. 289</ref>  This resulted in an improvement in Lee's captivity, and he was eventually exchanged for [[Richard Prescott]] in 1778.<ref>Leckie, p. 471</ref>\n\nDespite the loss of troops due to desertion and expiring enlistments, Washington was heartened by a rise in militia enlistments in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.<ref>Fischer, pp. 196\u2013200</ref>  These militia companies were active in circumscribing the furthest outposts of the British, limiting their ability to scout and forage.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 228\u2013230</ref>  Although Washington did not coordinate this resistance, he took advantage of it to organize an attack on an outpost of [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]]s in Trenton.<ref>Fischer, p. 201</ref>  On the night of December&nbsp;25\u201326, 1776, Washington led his forces [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|across the Delaware River]] and [[Battle of Trenton|surprised the Hessian garrison]] the following morning, capturing 1,000 men.<ref>Ketchum pp. 250\u2013275</ref>\n\n[[File:George Washington at Princeton.jpg|thumb|left|upright|100px|''George Washington at Princeton'' by [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1779]]\nThis action significantly boosted the army's morale, but it also brought Cornwallis out of New York.  He reassembled an army of more than 6,000 men, and marched most of them against a position Washington had taken south of Trenton. Leaving a garrison of 1,200 at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], Cornwallis then [[Battle of the Assunpink Creek|attacked Washington's position]] on January 2, 1777, and was three times repulsed before darkness set in.<ref>Fischer, pp. 209\u2013307</ref>  During the night Washington evacuated the position, masking his army's movements by instructing the camp guards to maintain the appearance of a much larger force.<ref>Ketchum p. 294</ref>  Washington then circled around Cornwallis's position with the intention of attacking the Princeton garrison.<ref>Schecter, p. 267</ref>\n\nOn January 3, [[Hugh Mercer]], leading the American advance guard, encountered British soldiers from Princeton under the command of [[Charles Mawhood]]. The British troops engaged Mercer and in [[Battle of Princeton|the ensuing battle]], Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent reinforcements under General [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]], which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton. The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle, and American morale rose with the victory.<ref>Schecter, p. 268</ref>\n\nThese unexpected victories drove the British back to the New York City area, and gave a dramatic boost to Revolutionary morale.<ref>Leckie, pp. 333\u2013335</ref>  During the winter, Washington, based in winter quarters at Morristown, loosely coordinated a low-level [[Forage War|militia war]] against British positions in New Jersey, combining the actions of New Jersey and Pennsylvania militia companies with careful use of Continental Army resources to harry and harass the British and German troops quartered in New Jersey.<ref>Fischer, pp. 354\u2013382</ref>\n\nWashington's mixed performance in the 1776 campaigns had not led to significant criticism in Congress.<ref name=Ferling125/>  Before fleeing Philadelphia for [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] in December, Congress granted Washington powers that have ever since been described as \"dictatorial\".<ref>Ketchum, p. 211</ref>  The successes in New Jersey nearly deified Washington in the eyes of some Congressmen, and the body became much more deferential to him as a result.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 126</ref>  John Adams complained of the \"superstitious veneration\" that Washington was receiving.<ref name=Ferling125>Ferling (2010), p. 125</ref>  Washington's performance also received international notice: [[Frederick the Great]], one of the greatest military minds, wrote that \"the achievements of Washington [at Trenton and Princeton] were the most brilliant of any recorded in the history of military achievements.\"<ref>Leckie, p. 333</ref>  The French foreign minister, a strong supporter of the American cause, renewed the delivery of French supplies.<ref>Leckie, p. 335</ref>\n\n==Philadelphia and Valley Forge==\n{{main|Philadelphia campaign|Saratoga campaign}}\n\n===Early maneuvers===\nIn May 1777, uncertain whether General Howe would move north toward Albany or south toward Philadelphia, Washington moved his army to the [[Middlebrook encampment]] in New Jersey's [[Watchung Mountains]].  When Howe then moved his army southwest from New Brunswick, Washington correctly interpreted this as a move to draw him out of his strong position, and refused to move.  Only after Howe apparently retreated back toward the shore did Washington follow, but Howe's attempt to separate him from his mountain defenses was foiled in the [[Battle of Short Hills]] in late June.<ref>Leckie, pp. 344\u2013346</ref>  Howe, who had already decided to campaign against Philadelphia, then withdrew from New Jersey, embarked much of his army on ships in late July, and sailed away, leaving Washington mystified as to his destination.<ref>Leckie, p. 346</ref>\n\n[[File:Gen. Sir William Howe.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]]]]\nWashington's difficulty in discerning Howe's motives was due to the presence of a British army moving south from Quebec toward Fort Ticonderoga under the command of General [[John Burgoyne]].  Howe's departure was in part prompted by the successful [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|capture of the fort]] by Burgoyne in early July.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 128</ref>  Although there had been an expectation on Burgoyne's part that Howe would support [[Saratoga campaign|his campaign]] to gain control of the Hudson, Howe was to disappoint Burgoyne, with disastrous consequences to the British.<ref>Leckie, p. 377</ref>  When Washington learned of the abandonment of Ticonderoga (which he had been told by General [[Anthony Wayne]] \"can never be carried, without much loss of blood\"),<ref>Furneaux, p. 58</ref> he was shocked.  Concerned that Howe was heading up the Hudson, he ordered Arnold,<ref name=\"Leckie, p. 387\">Leckie, p. 387</ref> along with [[Daniel Morgan]] and his corps of riflemen, north to assist General Gates with the defense of the Hudson.<ref>Ellis, p. 105</ref>\n\nWashington had had some difficulty with General Arnold in the spring.  Congress had adopted a per-state scheme for the promotion of general officers, which resulted in the promotion of several officers to [[major general]] ahead of other officers with more experience or seniority.  Combined with the commissioning of foreign officers to high ranks, this had led to the resignation of [[John Stark]].  Arnold, who had distinguished himself in the Canadian campaign, had also threatened to resign.<ref>Randall (1990), pp. 331\u2013336</ref><ref>Leckie, p. 386</ref>  Washington wrote to Congress on behalf of Arnold and other officers who were disgruntled by this promotion scheme, stating that \"two or three other very good officers\" might be lost because of it.  Washington had also laid the seeds for conflict between Arnold and Gates when he gave Arnold command of forces in [[Rhode Island]] in late 1776; because of this move Gates came to view Arnold as a competitor for advancement, and the previously positive relationship between Gates and Arnold cooled.<ref>Martin, p. 307</ref>  However, Arnold put aside his complaints when the news of Ticonderoga's fall arrived, and agreed to serve.<ref name=\"Leckie, p. 387\"/>\n\nCongress, at the urging of its diplomatic representatives in Europe, had also issued military commissions to a number of European soldiers of fortune in early 1777.  Two of those recommended by [[Silas Deane]], the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] and [[Thomas Conway]], would prove to be important in Washington's activities.<ref>Leckie, p. 341</ref><ref>Ferling (2010), p. 149</ref>  Lafayette, just twenty years old, was at first told that Deane had exceeded his authority in offering him a major general's commission, but offered to volunteer in the army at his own expense.<ref>Leckie, pp. 342\u2013343</ref>  Washington and Lafayette took an instant liking to one another when they met, and Lafayette became one of Washington's most trusted generals and confidants.<ref>Lengel, p. xxix</ref>  Conway, on the other hand, did not think highly of Washington's leadership, and proved to be a source of trouble in the 1777 campaign season and its aftermath.<ref>Lengel, pp. xxii, xxv</ref>\n\n===Fall of Philadelphia===\nWhen Washington learned that Howe's fleet was sailing north in [[Chesapeake Bay]], he hurried his army south of Philadelphia to defend the city against Howe's threat.<ref>Leckie, p. 348</ref>  General Howe turned Washington's flank at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, and marched unopposed into Philadelphia on September 26 after some further maneuvers.  Washington's failure to defend the capital brought on a storm of criticism from Congress, which fled the city for [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], and from other army officers.  In part to silence his critics, Washington planned an elaborate assault on an exposed British base in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]].<ref>Leckie, pp. 356\u2013358</ref><ref>Lengel, p. 253</ref>  The October 4 [[Battle of Germantown]] failed in part due to the complexity of the assault, and the inexperience of the militia forces employed in it. Over 400 of Washington's men were captured, including Colonel [[George Mathews (Georgia)|George Mathews]] and the entire [[9th Virginia Regiment]].<ref name=Jenkins>Jenkins, Charles F.

Historian Robert Leckie observes that the battle was a near thing, and that a small number of changes might have resulted in a decisive victory for Washington.<ref>Leckie, p. 365</ref>\n\n[[File:The March to Valley Forge William Trego.png|thumb|right|Washington's army as it marches toward [[Valley Forge]]]]\nMeanwhile, Burgoyne, out of reach from help from Howe, was trapped and forced to surrender his entire army on October 17, ten days after the [[Battle of Bemis Heights]].<ref>Leckie, pp. 414\u2013416</ref>  The victory made a hero of General Gates, who received the adulation of Congress.<ref>Lengel, p. 277</ref>  While this was taking place Washington presided from a distance over the loss of control of the Delaware River to the British, and marched his army to its winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]] in December.<ref>Lengel, pp. 263\u2013267</ref>  Washington chose Valley Forge, over recommendations that he camp either closer or further from Philadelphia, because it was close enough to monitor British army movements, and protected rich farmlands to the west from the enemy's foraging expeditions.<ref>Leckie, p. 434</ref>\n\n===Valley Forge===\nWashington's army stayed at Valley Forge for the next six months.<ref>Leckie, pp. 435, 469</ref> Over the winter, 2,500 men (out of 10,000) died from disease and exposure.  The army's difficulties were exacerbated by a number of factors, including a quartermaster's department that had been badly mismanaged by one of Washington's political opponents, [[Thomas Mifflin]], and the preference of farmers and merchants to sell their goods to the British for hard currency instead of the nearly worthless Continental currency.<ref name=L435/><ref>Fleming, pp. 89\u201391</ref>  Profiteers also sought to benefit at the army's expense, charging it 1,000 times what they charged civilians for the same goods.  Congress authorized Washington to seize supplies needed for the army, but he was reluctant to use such authority, since it smacked of the tyranny the war was supposedly being fought over.<ref name=L435>Leckie, p. 435</ref>\n\nDuring the winter he introduced a full-scale training program supervised by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff.  Despite the hardships the army suffered, this program was a remarkable success, and Washington's army emerged in the spring of 1778 a much more disciplined force.<ref>Leckie, pp. 438\u2013444</ref>\n\nWashington himself had to face discontent at his leadership from a variety of sources.  His loss of Philadelphia prompted some members of Congress to discuss removing him from command.<ref>Chernow, p. 316</ref>  They were prodded along by Washington's detractors in the military, who included Generals Gates, Mifflin, and Conway.<ref name=Chernow320>Chernow, p. 320</ref>  Gates in particular was viewed by Conway and Congressmen [[Benjamin Rush]] and [[Richard Henry Lee]] as a desirable replacement for Washington.<ref>Fleming, pp. 93\u201397, 121</ref><ref>Leckie, p. 450</ref>  Although there is no evidence of a formal conspiracy, the episode is known as the [[Conway Cabal]] because the scale of the discontent within the army was exposed by a critical letter from Conway to Gates, some of whose contents were relayed to Washington.<ref>Leckie, pp. 445\u2013449</ref>  Washington exposed the criticisms to Congress, and his supporters, within Congress and the army, rallied to support him.<ref>Chernow, pp. 317\u2013320</ref>  Gates eventually apologized for his role in the affair, and Conway resigned.<ref>Fleming, p. 202</ref><ref>Leckie, p. 451</ref>  Washington's position and authority were not seriously challenged again.  Biographer Ron Chernow points out that Washington's handling of the episode demonstrated that he was \"a consummate political infighter\" who maintained his temper and dignity while his opponents schemed.<ref name=Chernow320/>\n\n==French entry into the war==\nThe victory at Saratoga (and to some extent Washington's near success at Germantown) were influential in convincing France to enter the war openly as an [[Franco-American alliance|American ally]].  French entry into the war changed its dynamics, for the British were no longer sure of command of the seas and had to worry about an invasion of their home islands and other colonial territories across the globe. The British, now under the command of General Sir [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]], evacuated Philadelphia in 1778 and returned to New York City, with Washington attacking them along the way at the [[Battle of Monmouth]]; this was the last major battle in the north.  Prior to the battle Washington gave command of the advance forces to Charles Lee, who had been exchanged earlier in the year.  Lee, despite firm instructions from Washington, refused Lafayette's suggestion to launch an organized attack on the British rear, and then retreated when the British turned to face him. When Washington arrived at the head of the main army, he and Lee had an angry exchange of words, and Washington ordered Lee off the command.  Washington, with his army's tactics and ability to execute improved by the training programs of the previous winter, was able to recover, and fought the British to a draw.  Lee was court martialed and eventually dismissed from the army.<ref>Leckie, pp. 467\u2013489</ref>\n\n[[File:George Washington at Monmouth, 06-28-1778 - 06-28-1778 - NARA - 532864 - cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Washington at the [[Battle of Monmouth]]]]\nNot long after Clinton's return to New York, a French fleet arrived off the North American coast.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:45</ref>  Washington was involved in the discussion on how to best use this force, and an attack was planned against the British outpost at [[Newport, Rhode Island]].<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:50\u201352</ref>  Despite the presence of two of Washington's most reliable subordinates, Lafayette and Greene, [[Battle of Rhode Island|the attempt at cooperation]] was a dismal failure.<ref>Leckie, p. 492</ref><ref>Freeman, p. 5:52</ref>  British and Indian forces organized and supported by Sir [[Frederick Haldimand]] in Quebec began to [[Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga|raid frontier settlements]] in 1778, and [[Savannah, Georgia]] was [[Capture of Savannah|captured]] late in the year.<ref>Leckie, pp. 492\u2013493</ref>\n\nDuring the comparatively mild winter of 1778\u201379, Washington and Congress discussed options for the 1779 campaign season.  The possibility of a Franco-American campaign against Quebec, first proposed for 1778, had a number of adherents in Congress, and was actively supported by Lafayette in Washington's circle.<ref>Ferling (2010), pp. 169\u2013171</ref>  Despite known weaknesses in Quebec's provincial defenses, Washington was adamantly opposed to the idea, citing the lack of troops and supplies with which to conduct such an operation, the nation's fragile financial state, and French imperial ambitions to recover the territory.<ref>Ferling (2010), pp. 186\u2013188</ref>  Under pressure from Congress to answer the frontier raids, Washington countered with the proposal of a major expedition against the [[Iroquois]].  This was approved, and in the summer of 1779 a sizable force under Major General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] made [[Sullivan Expedition|a major expedition]] into the northwestern frontier of New York in reprisal for the frontier raids.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 194</ref><ref>Leckie, pp. 493\u2013495</ref>  The expedition successfully drove the Iroquois out of New York, but otherwise had little effect on the frequency and severity of frontier raids.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 195</ref>\n\n[[File:WayneAtStonyPoint1779.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Anthony Wayne]] leading forces at the 1779 [[Battle of Stony Point]]]]\nWashington's opponent in New York, however, was not inactive.  Clinton engaged in a number of amphibious raids against coastal communities from [[Tryon's raid|Connecticut]] to [[Chesapeake raid|Chesapeake Bay]], and probed at Washington's defenses in the Hudson River valley.<ref>Ferling (2010), p. 196</ref>  Coming up the river in force, he captured the key outpost of [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]], but advanced no further.  When Clinton weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organized a counterstrike.  General [[Anthony Wayne]] led a force that, solely using the bayonet, [[Battle of Stony Point|recaptured Stony Point]].<ref>Leckie, p. 502</ref>  The Americans chose not to hold the post, but the operation was a boost to American morale and a blow to British morale.  American morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when the second major attempt at Franco-American cooperation, [[Siege of Savannah|an attempt to retake Savannah]], failed with heavy casualties.<ref>Leckie, pp. 503\u2013504</ref>\n\n==British southern strategy ==\nThe winter of 1779\u201380 was one of the coldest in recorded colonial history.  New York Harbor froze over, and the winter camps of the Continental Army were deluged with snow, resulting in hardships exceeding those experienced at Valley Forge.<ref>Leckie, p. 504</ref>  The war was declining in popularity, and the inflationary issuance of paper currency by Congress and the states alike harmed the economy, and the ability to provision the army.  The paper currency also hit the army's morale, since it was how the troops were paid.<ref>Leckie, p. 505</ref>  Congress fixed the rate between paper and gold dollars at 40-to-1 in March 1780, but many merchants refused to accept the Continental currency at the official exchange rate.  One Loyalist wrote, \"Mock-money and mock-states shall melt away // And the mock troops disband for want of pay.\"<ref>Leckie, p. 506</ref>\n\n[[File:Sirhenryclinton2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]]]]\nThe British in late 1779 embarked on a new strategy based on the assumption that most Southerners were Loyalists at heart.  General Clinton withdrew the British garrison from Newport, and marshalled a force of more than 10,000 men that in the first half of 1780 successfully [[Siege of Charleston|besieged Charleston, South Carolina]].  In June 1780 he captured over 5,000 Continental soldiers and militia in the single worst defeat of the war for the Americans.<ref>Leckie, pp. 496, 507\u2013517</ref>  Washington had at the end of March pessimistically dispatched several regiments troops southward from his army, hoping they might have some effect in what he saw as a looming disaster.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:155</ref>  He also ordered troops stationed in Virginia and North Carolina south,<ref>Leckie, p. 528</ref> but these were either captured at Charleston, or scattered later at [[Battle of Waxhaws|Waxhaws]] and [[Battle of Camden|Camden]].  Camden saw the ignominious defeat of General Gates, who had been appointed to the southern command by Congress without Washington's advice or knowledge beforehand.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:172</ref>  Gates famously abandoned his army and retreated {{convert|180|mi|km}} by horse after his battle lines were broken.<ref>Leckie, pp. 533\u2013538</ref>  The debacle ended Gates' career as a field officer,<ref>Grizzard, p. 128</ref> but he eluded formal inquiries into his behavior because of his political connections.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:423</ref>\n\nWashington's army suffered from numerous problems in 1780: it was undermanned, underfunded, and underequipped.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:152\u2013155</ref>  Because of these shortcomings Washington resisted calls for major expeditions, preferring to remain focused on the principal British presence in New York.  Knowledge of discontent within the ranks in New Jersey prompted the British in New York to make two attempts to reach the principal army base at Morristown.  These attempts were defeated, with significant militia support, in battles at [[Battle of Connecticut Farms|Connecticut Farms]] and [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|Springfield]].<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:169\u2013173</ref>\n\n==Arnold's treason==\nThe British withdrew from Philadelphia, in June 1778, and Washington appointed Major General [[Benedict Arnold]] as military commander of the city.<ref>Willard M. Wallace, \"Benedict Arnold: Traitorous Patriot.\" in George Athan Billias, ed., ''George Washington\u2019s Generals'' (1964): 163-93.</ref>  Historian John Shy states:\n:Washington then made one of the worst decisions of his career, appointing Arnold as military governor of the rich, politically divided city.  No one could have been less qualified for the position. Arnold had amply demonstrated his tendency to become embroiled in disputes, as well as his lack of political sense. Above all, he needed tact, patience, and fairness in dealing with a people deeply marked by months of enemy occupation.<ref> John Shy, \"Arnold, Benedict,\" ''American National Biography'' (1999) https://doi.org/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.0200008</ref>\n\nSeptember 1780 brought a new shock to Washington.  British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] had been arrested outside New York, and papers he carried exposed treason by Arnold.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:190-222.</ref> Washington greatly respected Arnold for his military skills, and with his serious injuries saw he was not ready for a combat command so he gave him a role in Philadelphia.<ref>Chernow, p. 338</ref> During his administration there, Arnold entertained lavishly in high society yet had made many political enemies. He married vivacious [[Peggy Shippen]], who had been courted by British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]]. After the wedding she kept in contact with Andr\u00e9, who in 1779 became the head of British spy operations in New York City. Arnold in 1779 began secret negotiations with General Clinton. Andr\u00e9 was his contact, and Peggy passed the messages.  Arnold pleaded with Washington, who appointed him commander of West Point, the major Patriot strong point in New York. He agreed to surrender it to the British for \u00a320,000.<ref>Leckie, pp. 549\u2013569</ref>  Arnold was alerted to Andr\u00e9's arrest and escaped with only to spare.  Everyone  on both sides admired Andr\u00e9 and despised Arnold; Washington offered to exchange Andr\u00e9 for Arnold, but Clinton could not go that far.  Andr\u00e9 was hanged as a spy, and Arnold became a brigadier general in the British Army.<ref>Leckie, pp. 578\u2013581</ref>  Washington organized an attempt to kidnap Arnold from New York City; it was frustrated when Arnold was sent on a raiding expedition to Virginia.<ref>Chernow, pp. 382-87</ref>\n\n==Yorktown==\n{{main|Yorktown campaign}}\n[[File:Bataille de Yorktown by Auguste Couder.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Washington and the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] at Yorktown]]\nThe early months of 1781 continued to be difficult for the American cause.  Troops [[Pennsylvania Line Mutiny|mutinied in Pennsylvania]], inspiring troops in New Jersey to also do so.  Washington was uninvolved in resolving the Pennsylvania troops' demands, but he sent troops under General [[Robert Howe (Continental Army officer)|Robert Howe]] that harshly put down the New Jersey mutiny, hanging two men.<ref>Ward, pp. 625\u2013626</ref>\n\nGeneral Arnold's raiding expedition to Virginia was a notable success, ravaging the countryside and destroying military and economic infrastructure and supplies.  He was ineffectually opposed by Virginia militia and Continental recruits under Baron von Steuben.<ref>Ward, pp. 868\u2013870</ref>  Washington ordered Lafayette and additional Continental troops south, and convinced French Admiral [[Charles Ren\u00e9 Dominique Sochet, Chevalier Destouches|Destouches]] to send his Newport-based fleet to the Chesapeake.  Destouches was however opposed by the British fleet of Admiral [[Marriot Arbuthnot]] at the [[Battle of Cape Henry]] in March 1781, and was unable to gain entry to the bay.  General Clinton thereafter sent more troops to Virginia under General [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]], who resumed raiding operations in central Virginia.<ref>Ward, p. 870</ref>\n\nIn the early months of 1781 the French foreign minister, the [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|comte de Vergennes]], realized that the war, now being conducted on a global stage, could not last much longer without decisive action in North America.<ref>Ferling, p. 207</ref>  To this end, the French army at Newport was ordered to join Washington's outside New York, and the [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Comte de Grasse]], commander of that year's West Indies fleet, was ordered to assist in operations in North America.  France also gave six million [[French livre|livres]] to the United States to assist in the war effort.<ref>Dull, p. 329</ref>\n\nIn May 1781 Washington and the French army command met at [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]] after the French instructions arrived.  They discussed options for joint operations, with Washington arguing for an assault on New York, and Rochambeau for operations in Virginia against General Phillips.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:285\u2013292</ref>  Rochambeau agreed to bring his army to New York, and dispatches were sent to the West Indies outlining the options to de Grasse.<ref>Leckie, pp. 637\u2013638</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]]]]\nGeneral Clinton had turned over command of the southern army to General Cornwallis.  After the defeat of Gates at Camden, he had nominally gained control over South Carolina, although there was significant militia skirmishing, led by partisan fighters like [[Francis Marion]] and [[Thomas Sumter]].<ref>Leckie, p. 527</ref>  Cornwallis then attempted to extend British authority into North Carolina, but one wing of his army was defeated in the October 1780 [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and another was defeated in the January 1781 [[Battle of Cowpens]].  Kings Mountain in particular proved a decisive blow to further attempts to recruit Loyalists, and force Cornwallis had been instructed to rely upon.<ref>Ward, pp. 737\u2013762</ref>  In the wake of Camden, Washington had selected Nathanael Greene to replace Gates at the head of the southern Continental forces, and Greene waged an effect partisan campaign against Cornwallis.  When he finally reached sufficient strength, Greene offered Cornwallis open battle at [[Hillsboro, North Carolina]] in March.  Although he lost the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], Greene inflicted significant casualties on Cornwallis while retaining his own army intact.<ref>Ward, pp. 748,763\u2013794</ref>\n\nCornwallis moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] to regroup, and then made the controversial decision to bring his army into Virginia, which he saw as the supply base for Greene's army.<ref>Ward, pp. 795\u2013797</ref>  Joining with the army of Phillips, he maneuvered against the growing Continental presence led by Lafayette, while continuing to raid and destroy economic and military targets in the state.<ref>Ward, pp. 872\u2013876</ref>  Eventually his decision to enter Virginia reached Clinton, who was surprised at the move.  After a series of confusing and sometimes contradictory suggestions, Clinton in late July issued firm orders to Cornwallis to establish a fortified deep-water port in Virginia.  Cornwallis informed Clinton that he would do so at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]].<ref>Ward, pp. 875\u2013878</ref><ref>Wickwire, pp. 349\u2013351</ref>\n\n===Siege and victory===\n{{main|Siege of Yorktown}}\nAdmiral de Grasse received the dispatches of Washington and Rochambeau in mid-July.  He immediately sent dispatches north indicating that he would be sailing for the Chesapeake Bay to assist in operations there.<ref>Linder, p. 14</ref>  When Washington learned of this decision, he reluctantly abandoned the idea of attacking New York.<ref>Leckie, p. 639</ref>  In a brilliant but risky strategic move, he marched 6,000 soldiers from New York to Virginia, leaving the New York highlands only lightly defended.<ref>Ward, pp. 880\u2013884</ref>  Washington would in later years claim that early preparations to operate against New York were intended to deceive Clinton, but the documentary record of 1781 did not support him.<ref>Chernow, p. 404</ref>  Later operations, as the march got underway, did involve deliberate deception. As part of the march troops appeared to establish camps and other works on the west side of the Hudson, as if preparing for an attack on New York.<ref>Chernow, p. 407</ref>  By the time Clinton saw through the deception, Washington had already crossed the Delaware.<ref>Leckie, p. 642</ref>\n\nDe Grasse sailed north with his entire fleet (28 [[ships of the line]]), while his British counterpart, [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]] (not expecting de Grasse to take his entire fleet) sent only 15 ships in pursuit.<ref>Larrabee, pp. 156, 175</ref>  In early September, while the French and Continental armies marched south, de Grasse and the British fleet (enlarged by the inclusion of ships from New York to 19 ships) met in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]].  The French victory was strategically vital, for it denied the British control of the Chesapeake and set the stage for the encirclement of Cornwallis at Yorktown.<ref>Leckie, pp. 646\u2013648</ref>\n\n[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|340px|''[[Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]]'', by [[John Trumbull]], 1820]]\nUpon his arrival at Yorktown Washington had command of 5,700 Continentals, 3,200 militia and 7,800 French regulars.<ref>Ward, pp. 886\u2013887</ref>  On September 28 the Franco-American army blockaded Yorktown, and began digging siege trenches on October 6.  By the 9th guns had been emplaced on the first parallel, and began firing on the entrenched British camp.  Work proceeded rapidly thereafter on the second parallel, only {{convert|300|yd|m}} from the British defenses.  On the 14th two outer redoubts of the British defenses were stormed, and the entirety of the British camp was with range of the French and American cannons.  After a failed attempt to escape across the York River, Cornwallis opened negotiations on October 17.  Two days later terms were agreed, and his 8,000 men paraded in surrender.<ref>Ward, pp. 888\u2013895</ref>  Despite the size of the contending forces, and the importance of the siege, there were only 260 allied and 550 British casualties.<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775\u20131783'' (2005)  p. 301</ref>  One of the American casualties was Washington's stepson and aide-de-camp [[John Parke Custis]], who died of a camp disease during the siege.<ref>Chernow, p. 421</ref>\n\nThe disaster at Yorktown broke the morale of the governing class in London and paralyzed Britain's national will to make war.  The war party in Britain lost control of Parliament, and the new government opened peace talks.  These came to fruition in 1783 with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], in which Britain recognized American independence.<ref>John Brooke, ''King George III'' (1972) pp. 353\u2013354</ref>\n\n==Waiting for peace==\nFollowing Yorktown, Washington's army returned to New York, while Rochambeau's remained in Virginia.  Washington, concerned that Congress \"may think our work too nearly closed\", worked to make sure that the army would be prepared for a campaign in 1782.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:401\u2013404</ref>  Although British ship movements caused Washington some concerns during the winter of 1781\u20132, he was able to enjoy relative comfort in Philadelphia.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:406\u2013408</ref>  He returned to his headquarters in [[Newburgh, New York]] in March 1782, where he had to deal with greedy military supply contractors.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:410\u2013411</ref>  The execution of militia officer [[Joshua Huddy]] by Loyalists occasioned an exchange between Washington and Clinton, and led to the so-called \"[[Asgill Affair]]\", after [[Sir Charles Asgill, 2nd Baronet|the officer]] selected to be executed in retaliation for Huddy's hanging.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:412\u2013414</ref>  Despite the onset of peace negotiations in the second half of 1782, Washington remained vigilant, treating with suspicion assertions on the part of General Clinton's replacement, [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Sir Guy Carleton]], that he had suspended \"all hostilities\".<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:420\u2013421</ref>  To boost morale, Washington introduced the [[Badge of Military Merit]], to be awarded for \"unusual gallantry\" or \"extraordinary fidelity and essential service\".

Washington diffused this hint at mutiny with an address to the troops on March 15 recommending patience.<ref>Freeman, pp. 5:431\u2013435</ref>  On March 26 he was informed that France and Spain had made peace with Britain, one of the last preconditions for a final peace.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:439</ref>  Thereafter he was occupied with the logistics of prisoner exchanges, and pressed Congress to ensure soldiers being furloughed or discharged received at least some of their back pay.<ref>Freeman, p. 5:441</ref>  He met once with General Carleton to discuss the return of runaway slaves, a contentious point on which Carleton refused to budge.  (Carleton announced in the meeting, to Washington's apparent chagrin, that 6,000 Negroes had already been sent to Nova Scotia, and refused to assist the efforts of slave hunters.)<ref>Chernow, p. 441</ref>  In June [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|troops in Pennsylvania mutinied]], marching on Philadelphia and surrounding the State House where Congress sat.

On November 21, the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|British evacuated New York City]], and Washington and Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] took possession of the city, ending large-scale British occupation of American territory.<ref>Chernow, pp. 448\u2013450</ref>  (Britain continued to occupy frontier forts that had been ceded to the United States until the mid-1790s.)<ref>Chernow, pp. 729\u2013730</ref>\n\n==Resignation and post-war career==\n[[File:General George Washington Resigning his Commission.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''[[General George Washington Resigning His Commission]]'', by [[John Trumbull]]]]\nWashington's contribution to victory in the war was not that of a great battlefield tactician.  He has been characterized, according to historian [[Edward G. Lengel]], in many different ways: \"charismatic hero, master of guerrilla warfare, incompetent or infallible battlefield commander, strategic genius, nationalist visionary, fanatical micromanager, and lucky dog\".<ref>Lengel, p. 365</ref>  Although he has frequently been said to engage in the [[Fabian strategy]] of wearing his opponent down, the truth is more nuanced.  On a number of occasions his subordinates convinced him to hold off on plans of attack they saw as rash.<ref>Lengel, p. 366</ref>  Washington only really adopted a Fabian strategy between late 1776 and the middle of 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By August 1777, however, Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence and stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth and Yorktown.<ref>Buchanan, p. 226</ref>\n\nWashington is often characterized as complaining about undisciplined militia forces, but he understood that they were a vital part of the nation's defenses, since [[regular army]] troops could not be everywhere.<ref>Higginbotham (1985), p. 59</ref>  He was also at times critical of the mercenary spirit and \"the dearth of public spirit\" that often underlay difficulties in recruiting for the army.<ref>Higginbotham (1985), pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\nOne of Washington's important contributions as commander-in-chief was to establish the precedent that elected civilian officials, rather than military officers, possessed ultimate [[Civilian control of the military|authority over the military]]. Throughout the war, he deferred to the authority of Congress and state officials, and he relinquished his considerable military power once the fighting was over.  This principle was especially visible in his handling of the Newburgh conspiracy, and in his \"Farewell Orders\".<ref>Higginbotham (1985), pp. 100\u2013105</ref>  The latter document was written at his final wartime headquarters, a house on the outskirts of Princeton owned by the widow Berrien (later to be called [[Rockingham (house)|Rockingham]]), but was sent to be read to the assembled troops at West Point on November 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mgw3&fileName=mgw3b/gwpage016.db&recNum=347|title=George Washington Papers at the Library of Congress, 1741\u20131799: Series 3b Varick Transcripts|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=May 22, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821112926/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mgw3&fileName=mgw3b%2Fgwpage016.db&recNum=347|archive-date=August 21, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> At [[Fraunces Tavern]] in New York City on December 4, he formally bade his officers farewell.<ref>Chernow, p. 451</ref> On December 23, 1783, [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief]] to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], and retired to his home at [[Mount Vernon]].<ref>Chernow, pp. 455\u2013457</ref>\n\nAfter the war Washington chaired the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] that drafted the [[United States Constitution]], and was then elected the first [[President of the United States]], serving two terms.<ref>See e.g. Ferling (2010), chapters 3\u201311</ref>  He briefly engaged in additional military service during [[Quasi-War|a threatened war with France]] in 1798, and died in December 1799.<ref>Lengel, pp. 360\u2013364</ref>  He is widely recognized as the \"Father of his country\".<ref>Grizzard, pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\nIn 2012, a poll conducted by the British National Army Museum recognized Washington as \"Britain's Greatest Military Enemy.\" He beat out [[Ataturk]], Irish independence hero [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Erwin Rommel]], and [[Napoleon]].<ref>https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/04/16/george-washington-voted-britains-greatest-military-enemy</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|George Washington}}\n* [[List of George Washington articles]]\n* [[List of Washington's Headquarters during the Revolutionary War]]\n* [[Bibliography of George Washington]]\n* [[Haym Solomon]]\n* [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n===Cited sources===\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* Billias, George Athan,  ed., ''George Washington\u2019s Generals'' (1964). \n*{{Cite book|last=Billias|first=George Athan|title=George Washington's Opponents|year=1969|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York|oclc=11709}}\n*{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=John|title=The Road to Valley Forge: How Washington Built the Army That Won the Revolution|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-471-44156-4|oclc=231991487|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780471441564}}\n*{{cite book|last=Chernow|first=Ron|authorlink=Ron Chernow|title=[[Washington: A Life]]|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-266-7|oclc=535490473}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dull|first=Jonathan R|title=The French Navy and American Independence: A Study of Arms and Diplomacy, 1774\u20131787|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1975|ref=Dull|isbn=978-0-691-06920-3|oclc=1500030}}\n*{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph J.

Therefore, only a ruler has this prerogative.

Initially, Muslims were required to fulfil this responsibility even if the enemy was 10 times stronger. Afterwards, the Quran reduced the burden of this responsibility.<ref name=\"jihad\" /> As in Quran:\n\n{{quote|Prophet! Rouse the believers to wage war.

In the times of Muhammad, when large-scale conversions took place in the later phase, the Quran reduced the Muslim to enemy ratio to 1:2. It seems that Muslims should not only consolidate their moral character, but it is also imperative for them to build their military might if they want to wage ''Jihad'' when the need arises. The Quran gave a similar directive to Muslims of Muhammad's times in the following words:<ref name=\"jihad\" />\n\n{{quote|Muster against them all the men and cavalry at your disposal so that you can strike terror into the enemies of Allah and of the believers and others besides them who may be unknown to you, though Allah knows them.

Many also consider that it must also not be undertaken to conquer territories and rule them or to acquire fame or to appease the emotions of communal support, partisanship and animosity. On the contrary, it should be undertaken only for the cause of Allah as is evident from the words.<ref name=\"jihad\" /> As in Quran:\n\n{{quote|Those who believe, fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Satan. So fight you against the friends of Satan. Ever feeble indeed is the plot of Satan. |Quran|{{Quran-usc|4|76}}||}}\n\nMuhammad, in various instances, also explained very forcefully this purport of the Quran:\n* Abu Musa Ash'ari narrates that once a person came to Muhammad and said that some people fight for the spoils of war, some for fame and some to show off their valour; he then asked Muhammad: \"Which of them fight in the way of Allah\". Muhammad replied: \"Only that person fights in the way of Allah who sets foot in the battlefield to raise high the name of Allah\". [[Sahih Bukhari]] 2810\n* Abu Hurayrah  narrates from Muhammad: \"I swear by the Almighty that a person who is wounded in the way of Allah \u2013 and Allah knows full well who is actually wounded in His way \u2013 he would be raised on the Day of Judgement such that his colour be the colour of blood with the fragrance of musk around him\". Sahih Bukhari 2803\n* Ibn Jabr narrates from Muhammad: \"A person whose feet become dust ridden because of [striving] in the way of Allah will never be touched by the flames of Hell\". Sahih Bukhari 2811\n* Sahal Ibn Sa'ad says that Muhammad once said: \"To reside in a border area for a day to protect [people] against an enemy [invasion] is better than this world and everything it has\". Sahih Bukhari 2892.\n\nSimilarly, as a reward for participation in such a strive, the Quran states:\n\n{{quote|Consider not those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead. Nay, they are alive with their Lord, and they will be provided for. They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty and rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind [not yet martyred] that on them too no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers..|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|3|169|171}}||}}\n\n; Opportunities for plunder and reward in heaven\n[[Sura 4]] verses 71\u201376 urge Muslims to liberate the oppressed and also warns those who stay behind and fail to fight that they shall miss out on plunder, but those who fight and slain shall go to heaven:\n\n{{quote|O you who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth (on an expedition) in parties or go forth all together. There is certainly among you he who would linger behind (from fighting in Allah's Cause). If a misfortune befalls you, he says, \"Indeed Allah has favoured me in that I was not present among them.\" But if a bounty (victory and booty) comes to you from Allah, he would surely say \u2013 as if there had never been ties of affection between you and him \u2013 \"Oh! I wish I had been with them; then I would have achieved a great success ( a good share of booty).\" Let those (believers) who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the Cause of Allah, and whoso fights in the Cause of Allah, and is killed or gets a victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward. And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors, and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.\" Those who believe, fight in the Cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Taghut (Satan, etc.).

But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you against the one which outrages till it complies with the command of Allah.

But if non-Muslims disregard these sanctities, Muslims are asked to retaliate in equal measure.<ref>[[Amin Ahsan Islahi]], [[Tadabbur-i-Quran]], 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), pp. 479\u201380</ref> It is stated in Quran:\n\n{{quote|A sacred month for a sacred month; [similarly] other sacred things too are subject to retaliation.

Have fear of Allah and [keep in mind that] Allah is with those who remain within the bounds [stipulated by religion].|Quran|{{Quran-usc|2|194}}||}}\n\nObservance of treaties and pacts is stressed in the Quran. When some Muslims were still in Mecca, and they could not migrate to Medina, the Quran stated:\n\n{{quote|And to those who accepted faith but did not migrate [to Madinah], you owe no duty of protection to them until they migrate; but if they seek your help in religion, it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance; and Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|72}}||}}\n\nSimilar reports are attributed to Muhammad:\n*Abu Sa'id narrates from Muhammad: \"On the [[Day of Judgment]], to proclaim the traitorous actions of a traitor and the betrayal of a person who betrayed his words, a flag shall be hoisted which would be as high as [the extent of his] traitorous behaviour\", and Muhammad also said: \"Remember that no traitor and betrayer of promises is greater than the one who is the leader and ruler of people\". [[Sahih Muslim]] 1738\n\nThe basic principle in fighting in the Quran is that other communities should be treated as one's own. Fighting is justified for legitimate self-defence, to aid other Muslims and after a violation in the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist.<ref name=\"Boundaries_Princeton\"/><ref name=\"Crone\"/><ref>Micheline R.

The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion, [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]]:\n\n{{quote|Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kills a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food.

When no hope remained, they asked Muhammad to appoint [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]] as an arbitrator to decide their fate. Their request was accepted. Since, at that time, no specific punishment had been revealed in the Quran about the fate of the Jews, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]] announced his verdict in accordance with the [[Torah]]. As per the Torah, the punishment in such situations was that all men should be put to death; the women and children should be made slaves and the wealth of the whole nation should be distributed among the conquerors.<ref>[[Deuteronomy]], [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=20 20:10\u201314]</ref><ref>[[Caesar E.

The punishment mentioned in these verses is a show of leniency to them because they were originally adherents to monotheism. The story holds that they did not benefit from this leniency because, after Muhammad's death, they once again resorted to [[fraud]] and treachery.<ref>Sahih Bukhari, 2730</ref><ref>[[Abu Yusuf]], Kitab al-kharaj, Fasl fi'l-Fay wa al-Khiraj, (1302 AH), p. 42</ref><ref>[[Ahmad Ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri]], Futuhu'l-Buldan, (Qumm: Manshurat al-Arummiyyah, 1404 AH), p. 73</ref><ref>[[Ibn Athir]], Al-Kamil fi'l-Tarikh, 1st ed., vol. 2, (Beirut: Dar Beirut, 1965), p. 112</ref> Consequently, the Jews of [[Khaybar|Khyber]] and the Christians of [[Najran]] were exiled once and for all from the Arabian peninsula by [[Umar]].

When word of a particularly wealthy caravan escorted by Ab\u016b Sufy\u0101n, head of the Umayyad clan, reached Muhammad, a raiding party of about 300 Muslims, to be led by Muhammad himself, was organized. By filling the wells on the caravan route near Medina with sand, the Muslims lured Ab\u016b Sufy\u0101n's army to battle at Badr, near Medina, in March 624. Despite the superior numbers of the Meccan forces (about 1,000 men), the Muslims scored a complete victory, and many prominent Meccans were killed. The success at Badr was recorded in the Qur\u02be\u0101n as a divine sanction of the new religion: \"It was not you who slew them, it was God\u2026in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself\" (8:17).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48575/Battle-of-Badr |title = Battle of Badr &#124; Summary}}</ref>\n\n===== Surprise attack=====\n \nThe [[Qur'an]] commands Muslims to make a proper declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations.

Proponents of [[Sahaba|Companions]] of Muhammad as being \"the witness\" translate the following verse only for the Companions<ref name=\"jihad\" /> while others translate it for the whole [[Ummah|Muslim nation]].<ref>[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], [[The Meaning of the Qur'an (tafsir)]], commentary on verse 2:143.

As in Quran:<ref name=\"jihad\" />\n\n{{quote|And strive in His cause as ye ought to strive, (with sincerity and under discipline). He has chosen you, and has imposed no difficulties on you in religion; it is the religion of your father Abraham.

As one of Islamic jurist writes:\n\n{{quote|Among ''Kafayah'' obligations, the third category is that for which the existence of a ruler is necessary e.g., ''Jihad'' and execution of punishments. Therefore, only a ruler has this prerogative. Because, indeed, no one else has the right to punish another person.|Sayyid Sabiq|Fiqhu'l-Sunnah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Fikr, 1980), p. 30}}\n\n===Subduing the enemy===\nThese verses told Muslims that they should not merely fight the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Quraish]] if they resist them in offering [[Hajj]], but the Quran goes on to say that they should continue to fight them until persecution is uprooted and Islam prevails in the whole of [[Arabia]]. Initially, Muslims were required to fulfil this responsibility even if the enemy was 10 times stronger. Afterwards, the Quran reduced the burden of this responsibility.<ref name=\"jihad\" /> As in Quran:\n\n{{quote|Prophet! Rouse the believers to wage war. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will subdue two hundred: if a hundred, they will subdue a thousand of the disbelievers: for these are a people without understanding.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|65}}||}}\n\n{{quote|[From] now, God has lightened your [task] for He knows that there is now weakness amongst you: But [ever so], if there are a hundred of you, patient and persevering, they will subdue two hundred, and if a thousand, they will subdue two thousand, with the leave of God: for God is with those who patiently persevere.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|66}}||}}\n\nSome interpret above verses that ''Jihad'' never becomes obligatory unless the military might of the Muslims reaches a certain level. In the times of Muhammad, when large-scale conversions took place in the later phase, the Quran reduced the Muslim to enemy ratio to 1:2. It seems that Muslims should not only consolidate their moral character, but it is also imperative for them to build their military might if they want to wage ''Jihad'' when the need arises. The Quran gave a similar directive to Muslims of Muhammad's times in the following words:<ref name=\"jihad\" />\n\n{{quote|Muster against them all the men and cavalry at your disposal so that you can strike terror into the enemies of Allah and of the believers and others besides them who may be unknown to you, though Allah knows them. And remember whatever you spend for the cause of Allah shall be repaid to you. You shall not be wronged.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|60}}||}}\n\nOther scholars consider the later command of ratio 1:2 only for a particular time.<ref>[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]].''[[Tafhim al-Quran]]''.

In the battles of [[Battle of Badr|Badr]], [[Uhud]] and [[Tabuk, Saudi Arabia|Tabuk]], the response was much more and each Muslim was required to present his services as a combatant.<ref name=\"jihad\" /> As in Quran:\n\n{{quote|Not equal are those of the believers who sit [at home] without any [genuine] excuse and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.

Many also consider that it must also not be undertaken to conquer territories and rule them or to acquire fame or to appease the emotions of communal support, partisanship and animosity. On the contrary, it should be undertaken only for the cause of Allah as is evident from the words.<ref name=\"jihad\" /> As in Quran:\n\n{{quote|Those who believe, fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Satan. So fight you against the friends of Satan. Ever feeble indeed is the plot of Satan. |Quran|{{Quran-usc|4|76}}||}}\n\nMuhammad, in various instances, also explained very forcefully this purport of the Quran:\n* Abu Musa Ash'ari narrates that once a person came to Muhammad and said that some people fight for the spoils of war, some for fame and some to show off their valour; he then asked Muhammad: \"Which of them fight in the way of Allah\". Muhammad replied: \"Only that person fights in the way of Allah who sets foot in the battlefield to raise high the name of Allah\". [[Sahih Bukhari]] 2810\n* Abu Hurayrah  narrates from Muhammad: \"I swear by the Almighty that a person who is wounded in the way of Allah \u2013 and Allah knows full well who is actually wounded in His way \u2013 he would be raised on the Day of Judgement such that his colour be the colour of blood with the fragrance of musk around him\". Sahih Bukhari 2803\n* Ibn Jabr narrates from Muhammad: \"A person whose feet become dust ridden because of [striving] in the way of Allah will never be touched by the flames of Hell\". Sahih Bukhari 2811\n* Sahal Ibn Sa'ad says that Muhammad once said: \"To reside in a border area for a day to protect [people] against an enemy [invasion] is better than this world and everything it has\". Sahih Bukhari 2892.\n\nSimilarly, as a reward for participation in such a strive, the Quran states:\n\n{{quote|Consider not those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead. Nay, they are alive with their Lord, and they will be provided for. They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty and rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind [not yet martyred] that on them too no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers..|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|3|169|171}}||}}\n\n; Opportunities for plunder and reward in heaven\n[[Sura 4]] verses 71\u201376 urge Muslims to liberate the oppressed and also warns those who stay behind and fail to fight that they shall miss out on plunder, but those who fight and slain shall go to heaven:\n\n{{quote|O you who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth (on an expedition) in parties or go forth all together. There is certainly among you he who would linger behind (from fighting in Allah's Cause). If a misfortune befalls you, he says, \"Indeed Allah has favoured me in that I was not present among them.\" But if a bounty (victory and booty) comes to you from Allah, he would surely say \u2013 as if there had never been ties of affection between you and him \u2013 \"Oh! I wish I had been with them; then I would have achieved a great success ( a good share of booty).\" Let those (believers) who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the Cause of Allah, and whoso fights in the Cause of Allah, and is killed or gets a victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward. And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors, and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.\" Those who believe, fight in the Cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Taghut (Satan, etc.). So fight you against the friends of Shaitan (Satan); Ever feeble indeed is the plot of Shaitan (Satan). |Quran (translator: [[Muhsin Khan]])|{{Quran-usc-range|4|71|76}}||}}\n\nMost Muslim scholars consider it an eternal directive and believe that all types of oppression should be considered under this directive.<ref name=\"jihad\" /><ref>''Concept of Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb'', [http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503544498 Islam online (English), ask scholar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206011857/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE |date=6 December 2007 }}, Islamonline.net.</ref> Similarly, if a group of Muslims commit unwarranted aggression against some of their brothers and does not desist from it even after all attempts of reconciliation, such a group according to the Quran should be fought with:\n\n{{quote|And if two parties or groups among the believers start fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you against the one which outrages till it complies with the command of Allah. Then if it complies, make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable. The believers are brothers to one another. So make reconciliation between your brothers, and fear Allah that you may receive mercy.|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|49|9|10}}||}}\n\n===Regulation of warfare===\n{{Main|Islamic military jurisprudence|Islamic ethics}}\n\n[[Sharia|Islamic Law]], based upon the Quran and practices of Muhammad has set down a set of laws to be observed during the lesser Jihad.\n\nQuran forbids fighting in the sacred month and similarly within the boundaries of [[Haram]] (the area around the Grand Mosque of Mecca). But if non-Muslims disregard these sanctities, Muslims are asked to retaliate in equal measure.<ref>[[Amin Ahsan Islahi]], [[Tadabbur-i-Quran]], 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), pp. 479\u201380</ref> It is stated in Quran:\n\n{{quote|A sacred month for a sacred month; [similarly] other sacred things too are subject to retaliation. So if anyone transgresses against you, you should also pay back in equal coins. Have fear of Allah and [keep in mind that] Allah is with those who remain within the bounds [stipulated by religion].|Quran|{{Quran-usc|2|194}}||}}\n\nObservance of treaties and pacts is stressed in the Quran. When some Muslims were still in Mecca, and they could not migrate to Medina, the Quran stated:\n\n{{quote|And to those who accepted faith but did not migrate [to Madinah], you owe no duty of protection to them until they migrate; but if they seek your help in religion, it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance; and Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|72}}||}}\n\nSimilar reports are attributed to Muhammad:\n*Abu Sa'id narrates from Muhammad: \"On the [[Day of Judgment]], to proclaim the traitorous actions of a traitor and the betrayal of a person who betrayed his words, a flag shall be hoisted which would be as high as [the extent of his] traitorous behaviour\", and Muhammad also said: \"Remember that no traitor and betrayer of promises is greater than the one who is the leader and ruler of people\". [[Sahih Muslim]] 1738\n\nThe basic principle in fighting in the Quran is that other communities should be treated as one's own. Fighting is justified for legitimate self-defence, to aid other Muslims and after a violation in the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist.<ref name=\"Boundaries_Princeton\"/><ref name=\"Crone\"/><ref>Micheline R.

The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion, [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]]:\n\n{{quote|Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kills a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man.

The punishment mentioned in these verses is a show of leniency to them because they were originally adherents to monotheism. The story holds that they did not benefit from this leniency because, after Muhammad's death, they once again resorted to [[fraud]] and treachery.<ref>Sahih Bukhari, 2730</ref><ref>[[Abu Yusuf]], Kitab al-kharaj, Fasl fi'l-Fay wa al-Khiraj, (1302 AH), p. 42</ref><ref>[[Ahmad Ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri]], Futuhu'l-Buldan, (Qumm: Manshurat al-Arummiyyah, 1404 AH), p. 73</ref><ref>[[Ibn Athir]], Al-Kamil fi'l-Tarikh, 1st ed., vol. 2, (Beirut: Dar Beirut, 1965), p. 112</ref> Consequently, the Jews of [[Khaybar|Khyber]] and the Christians of [[Najran]] were exiled once and for all from the Arabian peninsula by [[Umar]]. This exile actually fulfilled the following declaration of the Quran about them:<ref name=\"jihad\" />\n\n{{quote|And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world; and in the Hereafter, theirs shall be the torment of the Fire.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|59|3}}||}}\n\nIn contrast, when the [[polytheism|polytheists]] of Arabia had been similarly subdued, it was proclaimed in [[At-Tawba]] that in future no pact would be made with them. They would be given a final respite of four months and then they would be humiliated in retribution for their deeds and would in no way be able to escape from this punishment. After this time limit, the declaration is made in the Quran:<ref name=\"jihad\" />\n\n{{quote|And a declaration should be made from Allah and His Messenger to these people on the day of the great Hajj that Allah is free from [all] obligations to these Idolaters and so is His Messenger.

And give tidings [O Muhammad] of a painful torment to these disbelievers. Except those of these Idolaters with whom you have a treaty, and who have not shown treachery in it nor have supported anyone against you. So fulfil their treaty to the end of their term. Indeed, Allah loves those who abide by the limits. Then when the sacred months [after the [[Hajj]]] have passed, kill these Idolaters wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush.

When word of a particularly wealthy caravan escorted by Ab\u016b Sufy\u0101n, head of the Umayyad clan, reached Muhammad, a raiding party of about 300 Muslims, to be led by Muhammad himself, was organized. By filling the wells on the caravan route near Medina with sand, the Muslims lured Ab\u016b Sufy\u0101n's army to battle at Badr, near Medina, in March 624. Despite the superior numbers of the Meccan forces (about 1,000 men), the Muslims scored a complete victory, and many prominent Meccans were killed. The success at Badr was recorded in the Qur\u02be\u0101n as a divine sanction of the new religion: \"It was not you who slew them, it was God\u2026in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself\" (8:17).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48575/Battle-of-Badr |title = Battle of Badr &#124; Summary}}</ref>\n\n===== Surprise attack=====\n \nThe [[Qur'an]] commands Muslims to make a proper declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations.

{"title_page": "Running in Ancient Greece", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{citation style|date=October 2015}}\n{{essay|date=August 2016}}\n}}\n\nIn [[Ancient Greece]], the history of [[running]] can be traced back to 776 BC. Running was important to members of ancient [[Greece|Greek]] society, and is consistently highlighted in documents referencing the [[Olympic Games]]. The Olympic Games hosted a large variety of running events, each with their own set of rules. The ancient [[Greeks]] developed difficult training programs with specialized trainers in preparation for the Games. The training and competitive attitude of Greek athletes gives insight into how scientifically advanced [[Greece]] was for the time period.\n\nThe people of Greece generally enjoyed sporting events, particularly foot racing, and wealthy admirers would often give large gifts to successful athletes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Though foot races were physically challenging, if successful, athletes could become very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The ancient [[Greeks]] developed running as a sport into a sophisticated field of science and philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nIn the ancient sources, training is often discussed. However, details about how the training of runners compared to the training of other types of athletes are not clearly addressed. In ancient Greece, athletes might not have been as specialized as they are today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It is likely that a single athlete would have trained for, and competed in, many different events resulting in less distinction being drawn between training for different events.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Many philosophers had ideas about how athletes should train, which provides historians with numerous insights. For example, [[Plato]] argued that the whole body should be trained to increase strength and speed for running and wrestling (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 113). The lengths and types of foot races are widely written. Also discussed in a variety of sources is the use of [[music]] in athletic training, and the diet of athletes.hi\n\n==Early Olympic Games==\n[[File:The_Death_Of_Ladas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|''The Death of Ladas, The Greek Runner, Who Died When Receiving The Crown Of Victory In The Temple Of Olympia''. George Murray, 1899.]]\nThe earliest [[Olympic Games]] involved well trained warriors competing in a variety of events. The warriors did not have any specialized training for the Olympics. Each ''[[poleis]]'' in ancient Greece had its own training program for soldiers, which was the only preparation they had. However, to train for war, the [[ancient Greeks]] would exercise the whole body, which is a principle that many later ancient Greek athletes lived by. The first Olympians believed that in order to have a harmonious body, the entire body must be trained, which would result in fierce warriors and strong athletes. [[Aristotle]] later said that the training of the whole body infuses it with courage (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 113).\n\n==Types of foot races==\nThere were many lengths and types of foot races in ancient Greece. The standard distance that these races were measured in was the ''[[stadia (length)|stade]]'' (where one [[stadia (length)|stadia]] is approximately 185 meters). The one-stade race was the most prestigious; the mythical founder of the Olympic Games could allegedly run it in one breath. Other running events included a two-stade race, and the ''[[Dolichos (race)|Dolichos]]'', which was a long-distance race that was 20 or 24 stades long, or about two and a half miles. For races longer than one stade, runners would have to turn 180 degrees around a post at each of the two ends of the stadium (Flaceliere 106).\n\nIn the Olympics, there was a race in armor, the ''[[Hoplitodromos]]'', which reflected the games' origins as a means of training for warfare. The torch-[[relay race]] was added to entertain the crowds. This event was run the night before the [[ancient Olympic Games]] began (Olympic Sports&nbsp;- Foot Races). Today we honor this tradition with the Olympic torch. One event that was not ever in the ancient Olympic Games is the [[marathon]]. What is called a marathon today gets its name from the {{convert|280|mi|km|0|adj=on}} distance covered by the runner [[Pheidippides]] over the course of three to four days from [[Athens]] to [[Sparta]] and then back to [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] in 490 BCE. He was sent to gain the help of the Spartans against the attack of the [[Persia]]n army in [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grogan|first=R.|title=Run, Philippides, Run! The Story of the Battle of Marathon|journal=Br. J. Sports Med.|year=1981|volume=15|issue=3|pages=186\u2013189}}</ref> In 1896, at the first modern Olympics, the very first modern-day marathon was run. To honor the history of Greek running, Greece chose a course that would mimic the route run by Pheidippides. The race course covered {{convert|24.85|mi|km|1}}. The route started at a bridge in the town of Marathon and ended in the Olympic stadium reference [[perseus project]]. Another event in the [[ancient Olympic Games]] was the [[pentathlon]]. The pentathlon was a combination of five events: [[discus]], [[javelin]], [[jumping]], [[running]] and [[wrestling]]. This race reflected the ancient Greek belief that one's body should be strong as a whole and not just in one area. [[Aristotle]] describes a man's ultimate physical beauty as a body capable of enduring all challenges. This is why he viewed the athletes in the [[pentathlon]] as the most beautiful of them all.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Training==\nAs [[ancient Greece]] developed, sports also developed. [[Track and field athletics|Athletics]] in ancient Greece became a very scientific and philosophical field of study and practice. Many philosophers had their own ideas about how athletes should train. By the fourth century BCE, sports in ancient Greece became so competitive and advanced that specialized coaches developed for each particular sport. These coaches were known as gymnastis. Along with specialized coaches, a new system of training was developed\u2014the tetras. This was a four-day cycle of varying training. The tetras had the following structure:\n* Day One - the day of preparations. It consisted of toning and short, high-intensity workouts.\n* Day Two - the day of intensity. It involved the athlete going through long, strenuous exercises.\n* Day Three - the day of resting. On this day athletes would do short mild workouts and primarily rest.\n* Day Four - the day of medium intensity. Athletes mainly practiced wrestling on this day, focusing more on tactics than strength.\n\nThis was the basic training structure practiced throughout ancient Greece. In order to create the optimal training structure for any given day, however, the trainers would consider many factors such as the place, the time, upcoming events, and the athlete's physical and mental condition. The training also differed depending on whether it was done indoors or outdoors. Based on these factors, the trainer would adjust the workout (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 113).\n\n===Trainers and philosophers===\n[[Hippocrates]], an ancient Greek physician, believed that athletes who walked after exercising would have a stronger and more rested body. Because of his beliefs, ancient Greek athletes ended each workout with a low-intensity cool down. Aristotle observed that athletes who have a rest day should not rest completely but do a mild, low-intensity workout instead. These practices are still in use today because of how well-founded the early principles had been (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 112).\n\nThe ancient Greeks also valued rest after exercising. After a workout, athletes used their [[aryballos]], a special bottle of oil, and a [[strigil]], which is a curved stick. They would rub the oil on their skin and then scrape it off using the [[strigil]]. In this way, they would clean themselves (The Olympic Games 5). After exercising, they also often had a bath and a massage. Massages would consist of gentle movements and stretching of their arms and legs (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 112).\n\nTrainers and philosophers had many ideas about specific ways of training. One practice that developed had athletes exercise with {{convert|3|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} weights in each hand. This practice helped improve arm strength, which is beneficial for running, throwing the javelin, swimming, and martial arts. Lucian, an ancient Greek philosopher, postulated another principle. He believed athletes should always train in \"exuberated conditions.\" His idea was that training should take place outdoors in the sun every day of the year. He thought that the body should be beautiful, tanned, and lean to perform its best. During workouts, he believed athletes should work as hard as possible. When training in the gymnasium, his idea was that one should not run or exercise on the stone floor but on sand instead to add difficulty. An exercise he invented involved a long jump where athletes would run and jump high into the air wearing weighted suspenders. Another exercise he developed was for athletes to jump over [[hurdles]] with lead weights in their hands (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 114).\n\n===Tribes===\nIn ancient Greece, a group of athletes and coaches who trained together would have been referred to as a tribe. In a single tribe, there may have been many athletes who trained in the same sport or different sports. A certain length of time before the Olympic Games, a coach would be selected for each event that the tribe wanted to compete in. For instance, the coach for the relay race with lit torches would be selected. He would then decide which athletes in his tribe would be the best suited for that event, and, therefore, they would be chosen to compete. If more than one coach selected a particular athlete, then that athlete would compete in multiple events (Stefanovi\u0107 et al.113).\n\n===Age categories===\nThe ancient Greeks divided athletes into three age categories, similar to what is done today. Each age category would have its separate set of coaches. The training programs for each age level varied, growing increasingly strenuous the older the athletes were. Certain coaches were selected to scout for young boys who looked particularly strong and fit. These boys would be selected to start training with the young men as soon as they were old enough (Stefanovi\u0107 et al.113).\n\n===Diet===\nAlong with developing training programs and stretching exercises, the ancient Greeks also introduced special [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]] to athletes. Most people in ancient Greece only ate meat during religious festivals. Only the rich could have afforded it on a regular basis, but meat was still just a minor part of their diet. [[Fruits]], [[vegetables]], and [[Food grain|grain]]s grew very well in Greece and were the primary part of everyone's diet up until fifth century BCE. At that time, trainers recognized that meat was key in building muscle. At this same point in history, sports were becoming increasingly popular and athletes were given large gifts by rich admirers. Because of these gifts, athletes were able to afford lots of meat. Today, scientific advancements allow trainers to prescribe specific diets to athletes, but, even in ancient times without modern scientific knowledge, the Greeks were able to recognize food's beneficial effects on an athlete's diet (Briers 12-13).\n\n===Music===\nAncient Greeks believed that training and music should be experienced together because they both pleased man's spirit. Music was used both in training and in competition. Each gymnasium had at least one [[aulos]] player. The [[aulos]] player's job was to produce rhythmical music in order to help the athletes, particularly when warming up. The athletes were supposed to focus primarily on accurately performing the exercises according to their trainer's advice; however, music was a key part of their warm up (Stefanovi\u0107 et al.112).\n\n===Over-training===\nAlthough many people in ancient Greece liked sports, not all philosophers thought that intense training was good. Aristotle believed that fitness should be a part of children's education, but that over-training was bad. In ancient Greece, there were 4 main parts to education: reading, writing, gymnastic exercises, and music. Aristotle thought that an appropriate amount of exercise was a key part of education; however, he recognized how much some athletes over-trained. Aristotle referred to the excessive training that many competitive athletes did as \u201cevil\u201d (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 113).\n\n==Effects of ancient Olympics on the modern world==\nThe [[ancient Greeks]] pioneered athletics thousands of years ago, with trial and error as their only method for gaining knowledge. With pure reason, men like Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Plato developed such advanced ideas that the modern world has been able to make only some significant advancements. These ancient Greek philosophers postulated many ideas on how to train that are now the basis of many modern athletic events. Trainers also made many advancements such as their discovery that meat was beneficial for building muscle. Not only did the ancient Greeks develop the theory of how to train, but they founded the prestigious Olympic Games. The [[ancient Olympic Games]] were ended in 393 CE by [[Theodosius I]] while trying to make [[Christianity]] the [[state religion]] (Craig 87). Today the Olympic Games have been restored with over 12,000 athletes who compete at the Summer and Winter Olympics in 31 different sports and nearly 400 events (Craig 102).

Running was important to members of ancient [[Greece|Greek]] society, and is consistently highlighted in documents referencing the [[Olympic Games]]. The Olympic Games hosted a large variety of running events, each with their own set of rules. The ancient [[Greeks]] developed difficult training programs with specialized trainers in preparation for the Games. The training and competitive attitude of Greek athletes gives insight into how scientifically advanced [[Greece]] was for the time period.\n\nThe people of Greece generally enjoyed sporting events, particularly foot racing, and wealthy admirers would often give large gifts to successful athletes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Though foot races were physically challenging, if successful, athletes could become very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The ancient [[Greeks]] developed running as a sport into a sophisticated field of science and philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nIn the ancient sources, training is often discussed. However, details about how the training of runners compared to the training of other types of athletes are not clearly addressed. In ancient Greece, athletes might not have been as specialized as they are today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It is likely that a single athlete would have trained for, and competed in, many different events resulting in less distinction being drawn between training for different events.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Many philosophers had ideas about how athletes should train, which provides historians with numerous insights. For example, [[Plato]] argued that the whole body should be trained to increase strength and speed for running and wrestling (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 113). The lengths and types of foot races are widely written. Also discussed in a variety of sources is the use of [[music]] in athletic training, and the diet of athletes.\n\n==Early Olympic Games==\n[[File:The_Death_Of_Ladas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|''The Death of Ladas, The Greek Runner, Who Died When Receiving The Crown Of Victory In The Temple Of Olympia''. George Murray, 1899.]]\nThe earliest [[Olympic Games]] involved well trained warriors competing in a variety of events. The warriors did not have any specialized training for the Olympics. Each ''[[poleis]]'' in ancient Greece had its own training program for soldiers, which was the only preparation they had. However, to train for war, the [[ancient Greeks]] would exercise the whole body, which is a principle that many later ancient Greek athletes lived by. The first Olympians believed that in order to have a harmonious body, the entire body must be trained, which would result in fierce warriors and strong athletes. [[Aristotle]] later said that the training of the whole body infuses it with courage (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 113).\n\n==Types of foot races==\nThere were many lengths and types of foot races in ancient Greece. The standard distance that these races were measured in was the ''[[stadia (length)|stade]]'' (where one [[stadia (length)|stadia]] is approximately 185 meters). The one-stade race was the most prestigious; the mythical founder of the Olympic Games could allegedly run it in one breath. Other running events included a two-stade race, and the ''[[Dolichos (race)|Dolichos]]'', which was a long-distance race that was 20 or 24 stades long, or about two and a half miles. For races longer than one stade, runners would have to turn 180 degrees around a post at each of the two ends of the stadium (Flaceliere 106).\n\nIn the Olympics, there was a race in armor, the ''[[Hoplitodromos]]'', which reflected the games' origins as a means of training for warfare. The torch-[[relay race]] was added to entertain the crowds. This event was run the night before the [[ancient Olympic Games]] began (Olympic Sports&nbsp;- Foot Races). Today we honor this tradition with the Olympic torch. One event that was not ever in the ancient Olympic Games is the [[marathon]]. What is called a marathon today gets its name from the {{convert|280|mi|km|0|adj=on}} distance covered by the runner [[Pheidippides]] over the course of three to four days from [[Athens]] to [[Sparta]] and then back to [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] in 490 BCE. He was sent to gain the help of the Spartans against the attack of the [[Persia]]n army in [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grogan|first=R.|title=Run, Philippides, Run! The Story of the Battle of Marathon|journal=Br. J. Sports Med.|year=1981|volume=15|issue=3|pages=186\u2013189}}</ref> In 1896, at the first modern Olympics, the very first modern-day marathon was run. To honor the history of Greek running, Greece chose a course that would mimic the route run by Pheidippides. The race course covered {{convert|24.85|mi|km|1}}. The route started at a bridge in the town of Marathon and ended in the Olympic stadium reference [[perseus project]]. Another event in the [[ancient Olympic Games]] was the [[pentathlon]]. The pentathlon was a combination of five events: [[discus]], [[javelin]], [[jumping]], [[running]] and [[wrestling]]. This race reflected the ancient Greek belief that one's body should be strong as a whole and not just in one area. [[Aristotle]] describes a man's ultimate physical beauty as a body capable of enduring all challenges. This is why he viewed the athletes in the [[pentathlon]] as the most beautiful of them all.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Training==\nAs [[ancient Greece]] developed, sports also developed. [[Track and field athletics|Athletics]] in ancient Greece became a very scientific and philosophical field of study and practice. Many philosophers had their own ideas about how athletes should train. By the fourth century BCE, sports in ancient Greece became so competitive and advanced that specialized coaches developed for each particular sport. These coaches were known as gymnastis. Along with specialized coaches, a new system of training was developed\u2014the tetras. This was a four-day cycle of varying training. The tetras had the following structure:\n* Day One - the day of preparations. It consisted of toning and short, high-intensity workouts.\n* Day Two - the day of intensity. It involved the athlete going through long, strenuous exercises.\n* Day Three - the day of resting. On this day athletes would do short mild workouts and primarily rest.\n* Day Four - the day of medium intensity. Athletes mainly practiced wrestling on this day, focusing more on tactics than strength.\n\nThis was the basic training structure practiced throughout ancient Greece. In order to create the optimal training structure for any given day, however, the trainers would consider many factors such as the place, the time, upcoming events, and the athlete's physical and mental condition. The training also differed depending on whether it was done indoors or outdoors. Based on these factors, the trainer would adjust the workout (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 113).\n\n===Trainers and philosophers===\n[[Hippocrates]], an ancient Greek physician, believed that athletes who walked after exercising would have a stronger and more rested body. Because of his beliefs, ancient Greek athletes ended each workout with a low-intensity cool down. Aristotle observed that athletes who have a rest day should not rest completely but do a mild, low-intensity workout instead. These practices are still in use today because of how well-founded the early principles had been (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 112).\n\nThe ancient Greeks also valued rest after exercising. After a workout, athletes used their [[aryballos]], a special bottle of oil, and a [[strigil]], which is a curved stick. They would rub the oil on their skin and then scrape it off using the [[strigil]]. In this way, they would clean themselves (The Olympic Games 5). After exercising, they also often had a bath and a massage. Massages would consist of gentle movements and stretching of their arms and legs (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 112).\n\nTrainers and philosophers had many ideas about specific ways of training. One practice that developed had athletes exercise with {{convert|3|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} weights in each hand. This practice helped improve arm strength, which is beneficial for running, throwing the javelin, swimming, and martial arts. Lucian, an ancient Greek philosopher, postulated another principle. He believed athletes should always train in \"exuberated conditions.\" His idea was that training should take place outdoors in the sun every day of the year. He thought that the body should be beautiful, tanned, and lean to perform its best. During workouts, he believed athletes should work as hard as possible. When training in the gymnasium, his idea was that one should not run or exercise on the stone floor but on sand instead to add difficulty. An exercise he invented involved a long jump where athletes would run and jump high into the air wearing weighted suspenders. Another exercise he developed was for athletes to jump over [[hurdles]] with lead weights in their hands (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 114).\n\n===Tribes===\nIn ancient Greece, a group of athletes and coaches who trained together would have been referred to as a tribe. In a single tribe, there may have been many athletes who trained in the same sport or different sports. A certain length of time before the Olympic Games, a coach would be selected for each event that the tribe wanted to compete in. For instance, the coach for the relay race with lit torches would be selected. He would then decide which athletes in his tribe would be the best suited for that event, and, therefore, they would be chosen to compete. If more than one coach selected a particular athlete, then that athlete would compete in multiple events (Stefanovi\u0107 et al.113).\n\n===Age categories===\nThe ancient Greeks divided athletes into three age categories, similar to what is done today. Each age category would have its separate set of coaches. The training programs for each age level varied, growing increasingly strenuous the older the athletes were. Certain coaches were selected to scout for young boys who looked particularly strong and fit. These boys would be selected to start training with the young men as soon as they were old enough (Stefanovi\u0107 et al.113).\n\n===Diet===\nAlong with developing training programs and stretching exercises, the ancient Greeks also introduced special [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]] to athletes. Most people in ancient Greece only ate meat during religious festivals. Only the rich could have afforded it on a regular basis, but meat was still just a minor part of their diet. [[Fruits]], [[vegetables]], and [[Food grain|grain]]s grew very well in Greece and were the primary part of everyone's diet up until fifth century BCE. At that time, trainers recognized that meat was key in building muscle. At this same point in history, sports were becoming increasingly popular and athletes were given large gifts by rich admirers. Because of these gifts, athletes were able to afford lots of meat. Today, scientific advancements allow trainers to prescribe specific diets to athletes, but, even in ancient times without modern scientific knowledge, the Greeks were able to recognize food's beneficial effects on an athlete's diet (Briers 12-13).\n\n===Music===\nAncient Greeks believed that training and music should be experienced together because they both pleased man's spirit. Music was used both in training and in competition. Each gymnasium had at least one [[aulos]] player. The [[aulos]] player's job was to produce rhythmical music in order to help the athletes, particularly when warming up. The athletes were supposed to focus primarily on accurately performing the exercises according to their trainer's advice; however, music was a key part of their warm up (Stefanovi\u0107 et al.112).\n\n===Over-training===\nAlthough many people in ancient Greece liked sports, not all philosophers thought that intense training was good. Aristotle believed that fitness should be a part of children's education, but that over-training was bad. In ancient Greece, there were 4 main parts to education: reading, writing, gymnastic exercises, and music. Aristotle thought that an appropriate amount of exercise was a key part of education; however, he recognized how much some athletes over-trained. Aristotle referred to the excessive training that many competitive athletes did as \u201cevil\u201d (Stefanovi\u0107 et al. 113).\n\n==Effects of ancient Olympics on the modern world==\nThe [[ancient Greeks]] pioneered athletics thousands of years ago, with trial and error as their only method for gaining knowledge. With pure reason, men like Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Plato developed such advanced ideas that the modern world has been able to make only some significant advancements. These ancient Greek philosophers postulated many ideas on how to train that are now the basis of many modern athletic events. Trainers also made many advancements such as their discovery that meat was beneficial for building muscle. Not only did the ancient Greeks develop the theory of how to train, but they founded the prestigious Olympic Games. The [[ancient Olympic Games]] were ended in 393 CE by [[Theodosius I]] while trying to make [[Christianity]] the [[state religion]] (Craig 87). Today the Olympic Games have been restored with over 12,000 athletes who compete at the Summer and Winter Olympics in 31 different sports and nearly 400 events (Craig 102).

This also helps to amplify his [[pansexuality]] and [[androgynous]] nature, which varies dependent on the plot situation and persona he has adopted. Aside from catalyzing the plot or subplot with his various personas, and despite his increasingly evident self-interest, he often serves to counsel the show's main characters, by humorously affirming or bluntly disregarding their opinions.\n\nWhen voicing the character, MacFarlane speaks in a [[Swish (slang)|swish]] accent intended to resemble [[Paul Lynde]] (who played Uncle Arthur in ''[[Bewitched]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television/interviews/2007/seth_macfarlane_01.htm|title=A Chat with Seth MacFarlane|work=Bullz-eye.com|date=2007-05-21|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> In 2014, Roger was voted \"Gayest Cartoon Character of All Time\" in a first-ever March Madness style competition held by [[Logo TV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/08/roger-gayest-cartoon_n_5112731.html |title=Roger Of 'American Dad' Crowned LOGO's 'Gayest Cartoon Of All Time' |last=Nichols |first=James |date=2014-04-08 |website=www.huffingtonpost.com |publisher=The Huffington Post |access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Character==\nRoger is selfish, cynical, cruel, and thin-skinned.

However, according to the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 4)#Episodes|Frannie 911]]\", Roger is not this unpleasant by choice; his species of alien must let all unpleasantries out, for if they don't, it will turn into poison and kill them.\n\n=== History ===\nAlso according to \"Frannie 911\", Roger has been on earth for over 60 years, having [[Roswell UFO incident|arrived in 1947]] as a result of being tricked,<ref name=\"americandadscripts1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americandadscripts.com/S03E09_Frannie-911.php|title=American Dad Scripts|publisher=American Dad Scripts|accessdate=2013-06-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104200526/http://www.americandadscripts.com/S03E09_Frannie-911.php|archivedate=2013-01-04}}</ref> led to believe he was \"The Decider\" in whose hands the fate of mankind rested, when in fact he was serving the role of a [[crash test dummy]]. Earlier, after causing his aunt's spaceship to crash, Roger lived with a family of pioneer fur trappers that died travelling on the [[Oregon Trail]] in the episode \"OreTron Trail\". There is also the possibility, he or another member of his race came to earth in early antiquity, as in the first episode of the 13th season a stone carving is shown depicting an alien looking like Roger squatting above a pyramid with two Egyptians presumably praising him and hieroglyph characters surrounding them. In the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 9)|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]\" however, it is evidenced that Roger remains on Earth by will, the episode revealing that he can simply call for his people's spaceship to return him to his birth planet if he so desires.\n\nDetails on Roger's actual family and pre-Earth life have yet to be shown on the series. Although in the episode \"[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]\", a brief clip revealed that prior to Roger's life on Earth, he was involved in a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] romantic relationship with another member of his alien race, Zing; however, Roger [[adultery|cheated]] on Zing, blatantly making out with a human male in front of him. It's also been revealed that Roger has lived on Earth for many years prior to his life spent with the Smith family.\n\nRoger came into contact with the Smith family when he saved Stan's life back when Roger was a fugitive of [[Area 51]] (four years prior to the show's beginnings). Feeling he owed Roger a life debt because of this, Stan rescued him from government capture and allowed him to live in his home. Stan has allowed this in defiance of his employer, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Roger now covertly lives in the Smith home. Roger uses the Smith's attic as his hideout/room/bar.\n\n=== Roger's disguises ===\nAfter Stan took Roger in for saving his life, he felt that it would endanger him and the rest of his family if it were to be discovered that Roger is an alien and living with them. Consequently, Stan forbade him from leaving the house when the series first began, even in disguise. Confined to the house in the first couple of seasons, Roger was miserable and malcontent.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> However, Roger is able to skillfully use disguises to exist in the outside world, which has become a major [[plot device]] in later episodes. Adding to this, he's created countless [[alter ego]]s to go along with them.<ref name=\"avclub3\" />\n\nRoger has, however, abused this practice, leading numerous lives and outrageously deceiving numerous people. In fact, some of Roger's characters are in [[prison]], while others are widely despised, and others somehow have full-fledged human families and are even married; several of his characters somehow have birth children while others are graduates of [[Howard University]]. Roger also uses several of these personas to act in a criminal manner, as several of his alter egos have been seen to engage in robbery, sexual assault, police corruption, identity theft, drug trafficking, child abuse and with one persona even admitting to being wanted \"for a series of prostitute murders\".\n\nAs the series has progressed, Roger's personas have developed their own lives that even he can be unaware of and his control has been shown to be tenuous at best. In \"The Horse Whisperer\" he realizes seconds before walking into a room (to see a horse therapist) that he is the one inside; In another episode both he and Stan express surprise that a character introduced by Roger ''wasn't'' one of his personas.\n\nDespite his numerous disguises consisting of only a different set of garment and hair with no effort to disguise his gray skin, [[non-human]] face and body features (with some exceptions, like additional body weight, facial hair or wrinkles), Roger has been capable of deceiving virtually every single person he interacts with without ever being discovered as an alien; not even by Stan's colleagues from [[CIA]], who according to him, have \"an entire floor\" looking for Roger. The Smith family is the only exception; however, for each member of the family there is one individual alter ego they can not recognize as Roger.

This also helps to amplify his [[pansexuality]] and [[androgynous]] nature, which varies dependent on the plot situation and persona he has adopted. Aside from catalyzing the plot or subplot with his various personas, and despite his increasingly evident self-interest, he often serves to counsel the show's main characters, by humorously affirming or bluntly disregarding their opinions.\n\nWhen voicing the character, MacFarlane speaks in a [[Swish (slang)|swish]] accent intended to resemble [[Paul Lynde]] (who played Uncle Arthur in ''[[Bewitched]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television/interviews/2007/seth_macfarlane_01.htm|title=A Chat with Seth MacFarlane|work=Bullz-eye.com|date=2007-05-21|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> In 2014, Roger was voted \"Gayest Cartoon Character of All Time\" in a first-ever March Madness style competition held by [[Logo TV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/08/roger-gayest-cartoon_n_5112731.html |title=Roger Of 'American Dad' Crowned LOGO's 'Gayest Cartoon Of All Time' |last=Nichols |first=James |date=2014-04-08 |website=www.huffingtonpost.com |publisher=The Huffington Post |access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Character==\nRoger is selfish, cynical, cruel, and thin-skinned.

However, according to the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 4)#Episodes|Frannie 911]]\", Roger is not this unpleasant by choice; his species of alien must let all unpleasantries out, for if they don't, it will turn into poison and kill them.\n\n=== History ===\nAlso according to \"Frannie 911\", Roger has been on earth for over 60 years, having [[Roswell UFO incident|arrived in 1947]] as a result of being tricked,<ref name=\"americandadscripts1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americandadscripts.com/S03E09_Frannie-911.php|title=American Dad Scripts|publisher=American Dad Scripts|accessdate=2013-06-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104200526/http://www.americandadscripts.com/S03E09_Frannie-911.php|archivedate=2013-01-04}}</ref> led to believe he was \"The Decider\" in whose hands the fate of mankind rested, when in fact he was serving the role of a [[crash test dummy]]. Earlier, after causing his aunt's spaceship to crash, Roger lived with a family of pioneer fur trappers that died travelling on the [[Oregon Trail]] in the episode \"OreTron Trail\". There is also the possibility, he or another member of his race came to earth in early antiquity, as in the first episode of the 13th season a stone carving is shown depicting an alien looking like Roger squatting above a pyramid with two Egyptians presumably praising him and hieroglyph characters surrounding them. In the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 9)|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]\" however, it is evidenced that Roger remains on Earth by will, the episode revealing that he can simply call for his people's spaceship to return him to his birth planet if he so desires.\n\nDetails on Roger's actual family and pre-Earth life have yet to be shown on the series. Although in the episode \"[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]\", a brief clip revealed that prior to Roger's life on Earth, he was involved in a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] romantic relationship with another member of his alien race, Zing; however, Roger [[adultery|cheated]] on Zing, blatantly making out with a human male in front of him. It's also been revealed that Roger has lived on Earth for many years prior to his life spent with the Smith family.\n\nRoger came into contact with the Smith family when he saved Stan's life back when Roger was a fugitive of [[Area 51]] (four years prior to the show's beginnings). Feeling he owed Roger a life debt because of this, Stan rescued him from government capture and allowed him to live in his home. Stan has allowed this in defiance of his employer, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Roger now covertly lives in the Smith home. Roger uses the Smith's attic as his hideout/room/bar.\n\n=== Roger's disguises ===\nAfter Stan took Roger in for saving his life, he felt that it would endanger him and the rest of his family if it were to be discovered that Roger is an alien and living with them. Consequently, Stan forbade him from leaving the house when the series first began, even in disguise. Confined to the house in the first couple of seasons, Roger was miserable and malcontent.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> However, Roger is able to skillfully use disguises to exist in the outside world, which has become a major [[plot device]] in later episodes. Adding to this, he's created countless [[alter ego]]s to go along with them.<ref name=\"avclub3\" />\n\nRoger has, however, abused this practice, leading numerous lives and outrageously deceiving numerous people. In fact, some of Roger's characters are in [[prison]], while others are widely despised, and others somehow have full-fledged human families and are even married; several of his characters somehow have birth children while others are graduates of [[Howard University]]. Roger also uses several of these personas to act in a criminal manner, as several of his alter egos have been seen to engage in robbery, sexual assault, police corruption, identity theft, drug trafficking, child abuse and with one persona even admitting to being wanted \"for a series of prostitute murders\".\n\nAs the series has progressed, Roger's personas have developed their own lives that even he can be unaware of and his control has been shown to be tenuous at best. In \"The Horse Whisperer\" he realizes seconds before walking into a room (to see a horse therapist) that he is the one inside; In another episode both he and Stan express surprise that a character introduced by Roger ''wasn't'' one of his personas.\n\nDespite his numerous disguises consisting of only a different set of garment and hair with no effort to disguise his gray skin, [[non-human]] face and body features (with some exceptions, like additional body weight, facial hair or wrinkles), Roger has been capable of deceiving virtually every single person he interacts with without ever being discovered as an alien; not even by Stan's colleagues from [[CIA]], who according to him, have \"an entire floor\" looking for Roger. The Smith family is the only exception; however, for each member of the family there is one individual alter ego they can not recognize as Roger. On top of that, Roger has been sent to the hospital several times over the course of the series, and medical personnel, for some reason, have never found out that he's not a human.<ref>{{Citation|title=\"American Dad!\" Roger Passes the Bar (TV Episode 2014)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3910988/|accessdate=2017-06-21}}</ref>\n\n==Potential film adaptation==\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con 2013]] on July 20, Mike Barker revealed that an \u201cAmerican Dad!\u201d film centering on Roger and set on his birth planet may take place in the future.

Stoicism is a philosophy of personal [[ethics]] informed by its system of [[logic]] and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to [[eudaimonia]] (happiness, or blessedness) for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.\n\nThe Stoics are especially known for teaching that \"virtue is the only good\" for human beings, and that external things\u2014such as health, wealth, and pleasure\u2014are not good or bad in themselves (''[[adiaphora]]''), but have value as \"material for virtue to act upon\".  Alongside [[Aristotelian ethics]], the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to Western [[virtue ethics]].<ref>Sharpe, Matthew. \"[http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30059463/sharpe-stoicvirtue-2013.pdf Stoic Virtue Ethics].\" ''Handbook of Virtue Ethics'', 2013, 28\u201341.</ref> The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called ''[[prohairesis]]'') that is \"in accordance with [[nature (philosophy)|nature]]\". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.<ref>John Sellars. ''Stoicism'', 2006, p. 32.</ref> To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.\n\nMany Stoics\u2014such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Epictetus]]\u2014emphasized that because \"virtue is sufficient for [[Philosophy of happiness|happiness]]\", a [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase \"stoic calm\", though the phrase does not include the \"radical ethical\" Stoic views that only a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]] can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.<ref name=\"Stoicism\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref>\n\nStoicism flourished throughout the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Roman Greece|Greek]] world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. It experienced a decline after [[Christianity]] became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance]] ([[Neostoicism]]) and in the contemporary era ([[modern Stoicism]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Lawrence C.|author-link=Lawrence C.

Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.\n\nStoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (''[[logos]]''). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: \"''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' that is in agreement with Nature.\"<ref name=\"Russell\">Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy,'' p. 254</ref> This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; \"to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy,\"<ref name=\"Russell1\">Russell, Bertrand.

Zeno's most influential follower was [[Chrysippus]], who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism.

Later, [[Chrysippus]] developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see [[Syllogism]]). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th&nbsp;century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. [[Susanne Bobzien]] wrote, \"The many close similarities between Chrysippus's philosophical logic and that of [[Gottlob Frege]] are especially striking.\"<ref name=SEP>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ''Ancient Logic''] by [[Susanne Bobzien]].

But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.\n\nThey held that there were four [[Stoic categories|categories]].\n* '''[[Substance theory|substance]] (\u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd)'''\n::The primary matter, formless substance, (''ousia'') that things are made of\n* '''[[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd)'''\n::The way matter is organized to form an individual object; in Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath), which informs the matter\n*'''somehow disposed (\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd)'''\n::Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture{{Rquote|right|Make for yourself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to you, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell yourself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole.|Marcus Aurelius|''[[Meditations]]'', iii. 11}}\n*'''Somehow disposed in relation to something (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03af \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd)'''\n::Characteristics related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects\n\nStoics outlined what we have control over categories of our own action, thoughts and reaction. The opening paragraph of The Enchiridion states the categories as: \"Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in a word, whatever are not our own actions.\" These suggest a space that is within our own control.\n\n===Epistemology===\nThe Stoics propounded that [[knowledge]] can be attained through the use of [[reason]]. [[Truth]] can be distinguished from [[fallacy]]\u2014even if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the [[sense]]s constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the [[mind]], where they leave an impression in the [[imagination]] ([[phantasiai]]) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma).<ref>{{cite book | last = Diogenes La\u00ebrtius | author-link = Diogenes La\u00ebrtius | year = 2000 | title = Lives of eminent philosophers | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, MA}} VII.49</ref>\n\nThe mind has the ability to judge (\u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, ''synkatathesis'')\u2014approve or reject\u2014an impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled [[belief]] or opinion (''[[doxa]]''). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction (''[[katalepsis]]''). [[Certain]] and true knowledge (''[[episteme]]''), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind.\n\n==Physics==\n{{main|Stoic physics}}\n{{See also|De Mundo}}\nAccording to the Stoics, the [[Universe]] is a material reasoning substance, known as God or [[Nature]], which was divided into two classes: the active and the passive. The passive substance is matter, which \"lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion\".<ref>Seneca, ''Epistles'', lxv. 2.</ref> The active substance, which can be called [[Destiny|Fate]] or Universal Reason (''Logos''), is an intelligent [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter:\n{{quote|The universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul; it is this same world's guiding principle, operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future; then fire and the principle of aether; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition, such as water, earth, and air; then the sun, the moon, the stars; and the universal existence in which all things are contained.|sign=Chrysippus|source=in Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', i. 39}}\n\nEverything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The [[soul]]s of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate:\n\n{{quote|Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the structure of the web.|sign=Marcus Aurelius|source=''[[Meditations]]'', iv. 40}}\n\nIndividual souls are perishable by nature, and can be \"transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the ''seminal reason'' (\"[[logos spermatikos]]\") of the Universe\".<ref>Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', iv. 21.</ref> Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe, it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason, that is, to live a life according to [[Natural law|Nature]].\n\nStoic theology is a [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] and [[naturalistic pantheism]]: God is never fully transcendent but always [[Immanence|immanent]], and identified with [[Nature]]. [[Abrahamic religions]] personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic [[cosmology]], which is very similar to the [[Hindu cosmology|Hindu conception of existence]], there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the [[space]] and [[Universe]] have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed (\"[[Ekpyrosis|ekpyr\u014dsis]]\", ''conflagration'') and [[Palingenesis|re-created again]],<ref>[[Michael Lapidge]], ''Stoic Cosmology'', in: John M. Rist, ''The Stoics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1978, pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all [[existence]] as cyclic, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also [[Eternal return]]).\n\nStoicism, just like [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe.<ref name=\"ferg\" /> According to the Stoics, the ''[[logos]]'' was the active [[reason]] or ''[[anima mundi]]'' pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal reason'' (\"[[logos spermatikos]]\"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos'', which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.<ref>Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37\u201338. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.</ref>\n\nThe first philosophers to explicitly describe [[Nominalism|nominalist]] arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.<ref>John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84\u201385: \"[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ...

The word \"stoic\" has since come to mean \"unemotional\" or indifferent to pain because Stoic ethics taught freedom from \"passion\" by following \"reason\". The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute \"[[asceticism|ask\u0113sis]]\", that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm.<ref>{{cite book | last = Graver | first = Margaret | title = Stoicism and Emotion | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-226-30558-5 |oclc=430497127}}</ref> Logic, reflection, and concentration were the methods of such self-discipline, temperance is split into self-control, discipline and modesty.\n\nBorrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: \"Follow where reason leads.\" {{citation needed|date=June 2017}} One must therefore strive to be free of the [[Stoic passions|passions]], bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of \"passion\" was \"anguish\" or \"suffering\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/passion |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |title=Passion |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref> that is, \"passively\" reacting to external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made between ''pathos'' (plural ''pathe'') which is normally translated as ''passion'', ''propathos'' or instinctive reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and ''eupathos'', which is the mark of the Stoic sage (''sophos''). The ''eupatheia'' are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment.\n\nThe idea was to be free of [[suffering]] through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}; literally, \"without passion\") or [[Inner peace|peace of mind]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Seddon | first = Keith | title = Epictetus' Handbook and the Tablet of Cebes | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-415-32451-9 |page=217 |oclc=469313282}}</ref> where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense\u2014being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] or having \"clear judgment\" and the maintenance of [[equanimity]] in the face of life's highs and lows.\n\nFor the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature\u2014the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people.\n\nThe four [[cardinal virtues]] (''[[Arete (moral virtue)|aretai]]'') of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of [[Plato]] (''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' IV. 426\u2013435):\n* [[Wisdom]] (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \"''sophia''\")\n* [[Courage]] (\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \"''andreia''\")\n* [[Justice]] (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 \"''dikaiosyne''\")\n* [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] (\u03c3\u03c9\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 ''\"[[sophrosyne]]''\")\n\nFollowing Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and [[evil]] are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature.\n\nThe Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.<ref name=\"marietta153\">Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pp. 153\u201354.

Oxford University Press</ref>\n\n===The doctrine of \"things indifferent\"===\n{{main|Adiaphora}}\n{{see also|Eudaimonia}}\nIn philosophical terms, things that are indifferent are outside the application of [[Moral absolutism|moral law]]\u2014that is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends. Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law, or that do not affect [[morality]], are called morally indifferent. The doctrine of things indifferent ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1}}, ''[[adiaphora]]'') arose in the Stoic school as a [[corollary]] of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1}} ''[[kathekon]]ta'', \"convenient actions\", or actions in accordance with nature; and \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ''hamartemata'', mistakes). As a result of this [[dichotomy]], a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent.\n\nEventually three sub-classes of \"things indifferent\" developed: things to prefer because they assist life according to nature; things to avoid because they hinder it; and things indifferent in the narrower sense. The principle of ''adiaphora'' was also common to the Cynics. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] revived the doctrine of things indifferent during the [[Renaissance]].\n\n===Spiritual exercise===\n[[File:L'Image et le Pouvoir - Buste cuirass\u00e9 de Marc Aur\u00e8le ag\u00e9 - 3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Marcus Aurelius]], the Stoic Roman emperor]]\nPhilosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims; it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or \"[[asceticism|ask\u0113sis]]\"). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included [[History of logic#Stoics|logic]], [[Socratic dialogue]] and [[Introspection|self-dialogue]], [[memento mori|contemplation of death]], [[mortality salience]], training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of [[Buddhist meditation]]), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions e.g. with [[diary|journaling]]. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.\n\nIn his ''[[Meditations]]'', Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices. For example, in Book II.I:\n\n<blockquote>Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of the ignorance of real good and ill...I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together...</blockquote>\n\nPrior to Aurelius, Epictetus in his ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]],'' distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination.<ref>Davidson, A.I. (1995) ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'', in ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', Hadot, P. Oxford Blackwells, pp. 9\u201310</ref> According to French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]], Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively.<ref>Hadot, P.

Three such [[Seneca's Consolations|consolations]] by Seneca have survived.\n\nStoics commonly employ \u2018The View from Above\u2019, reflecting on society and otherness in a guided visualization, aiming to gain a \"bigger picture\", to see ourselves in context relevant to others, to see others in the context of the world, to see ourselves in the context of the world to help determine our role and the importance of happenings.\n\nMarcus Aurelius, ''[[Meditations]]'', in Book 7.48 it is stated;\n\n<blockquote>A fine reflection from Plato. One who would converse about human beings should look on all things earthly as though from some point far above, upon herds, armies, and agriculture, marriages and divorces, births and deaths, the clamour of law courts, deserted wastes, alien peoples of every kind, festivals, lamentations, and markets, this intermixture of everything and ordered combination of opposites.</blockquote>\n\n==Social philosophy==\nA distinctive feature of Stoicism is its [[cosmopolitanism]]; according to the Stoics, all people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another. In the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'', [[Epictetus]] comments on man's relationship with the world: \"Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy.\"<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii. 5. 26</ref> This sentiment echoes that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said, \"I am not an [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] or a [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]], but a citizen of the world.\"<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i. 9. 1</ref>\n\nThey held that external differences, such as rank and wealth, are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as [[Cato the Younger]] and Epictetus.\n\nIn particular, they were noted for their urging of [[clemency]] toward [[slave]]s. Seneca exhorted, \"Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies.\"<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 47|''Moral letters to Lucilius'', Letter 47: ''On master and slave'']], 10, circa AD 65.</ref>\n\n==Influence on Christianity==\n{{See also|Neostoicism}}\n[[Image:Justus Lipsius.png|right|thumb|[[Justus Lipsius]], founder of Neostoicism]]\nIn his introduction to the 1964 [[Penguin Classics]] edition of ''Meditations'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact Stoicism had on Christianity. He claimed the author of the Fourth Gospel declared Christ to be the Logos, which \"had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/24 24] |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}</ref> In St. Ambrose of Milan's ''Duties'', \"The voice is the voice of a Christian bishop, but the precepts are those of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3401.htm|title=On the Duties of the Clergy|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/26 26] |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}</ref> Regarding what he called \"the Divine Spirit\", Stanisforth wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nCleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated\u2014in the Christian as in the Stoic mind\u2014with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.<ref name=\"Marcus Aurelius 1964 25\">{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/25 25] |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRegarding the [[Trinity]], Staniforth wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nAgain in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.<ref name=\"Marcus Aurelius 1964 25\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Paul of Tarsus|apostle Paul]] met with Stoics during his stay in Athens, reported in {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16\u201318|NKJV}}. In his [[Pauline epistles|letters]], Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new [[Gentile]] converts in their understanding of Christianity.<ref>Kee, Howard and Franklin W.

Stoicism is a philosophy of personal [[ethics]] informed by its system of [[logic]] and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to [[eudaimonia]] (happiness, or blessedness) for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.\n\nThe Stoics are especially known for teaching that \"virtue is the only good\" for human beings, and that external things\u2014such as health, wealth, and pleasure\u2014are not good or bad in themselves (''[[adiaphora]]''), but have value as \"material for virtue to act upon\".  Alongside [[Aristotelian ethics]], the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to Western [[virtue ethics]].<ref>Sharpe, Matthew. \"[http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30059463/sharpe-stoicvirtue-2013.pdf Stoic Virtue Ethics].\" ''Handbook of Virtue Ethics'', 2013, 28\u201341.</ref> The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called ''[[prohairesis]]'') that is \"in accordance with [[nature (philosophy)|nature]]\". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.<ref>John Sellars. ''Stoicism'', 2006, p. 32.</ref> To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.\n\nMany Stoics\u2014such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Epictetus]]\u2014emphasized that because \"virtue is sufficient for [[Philosophy of happiness|happiness]]\", a [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase \"stoic calm\", though the phrase does not include the \"radical ethical\" Stoic views that only a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]] can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.<ref name=\"Stoicism\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref>\n\nStoicism flourished throughout the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Roman Greece|Greek]] world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. It experienced a decline after [[Christianity]] became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance]] ([[Neostoicism]]) and in the contemporary era ([[modern Stoicism]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Lawrence C.|author-link=Lawrence C.

Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.\n\nStoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (''[[logos]]'').

Zeno's most influential follower was [[Chrysippus]], who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism.

Later, [[Chrysippus]] developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see [[Syllogism]]). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th&nbsp;century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. [[Susanne Bobzien]] wrote, \"The many close similarities between Chrysippus's philosophical logic and that of [[Gottlob Frege]] are especially striking.\"<ref name=SEP>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ''Ancient Logic''] by [[Susanne Bobzien]].

But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.\n\nThey held that there were four [[Stoic categories|categories]].\n* '''[[Substance theory|substance]] (\u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd)'''\n::The primary matter, formless substance, (''ousia'') that things are made of\n* '''[[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd)'''\n::The way matter is organized to form an individual object; in Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath), which informs the matter\n*'''somehow disposed (\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd)'''\n::Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture{{Rquote|right|Make for yourself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to you, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell yourself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole.|Marcus Aurelius|''[[Meditations]]'', iii. 11}}\n*'''Somehow disposed in relation to something (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03af \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd)'''\n::Characteristics related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects\n\nStoics outlined what we have control over categories of our own action, thoughts and reaction. The opening paragraph of The Enchiridion states the categories as: \"Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in a word, whatever are not our own actions.\" These suggest a space that is within our own control.\n\n===Epistemology===\nThe Stoics propounded that [[knowledge]] can be attained through the use of [[reason]]. [[Truth]] can be distinguished from [[fallacy]]\u2014even if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the [[sense]]s constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the [[mind]], where they leave an impression in the [[imagination]] ([[phantasiai]]) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma).<ref>{{cite book | last = Diogenes La\u00ebrtius | author-link = Diogenes La\u00ebrtius | year = 2000 | title = Lives of eminent philosophers | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, MA}} VII.49</ref>\n\nThe mind has the ability to judge (\u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, ''synkatathesis'')\u2014approve or reject\u2014an impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled [[belief]] or opinion (''[[doxa]]''). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction (''[[katalepsis]]''). [[Certain]] and true knowledge (''[[episteme]]''), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind.\n\n==Physics==\n{{main|Stoic physics}}\n{{See also|De Mundo}}\nAccording to the Stoics, the [[Universe]] is a material reasoning substance, known as God or [[Nature]], which was divided into two classes: the active and the passive. The passive substance is matter, which \"lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion\".<ref>Seneca, ''Epistles'', lxv. 2.</ref> The active substance, which can be called [[Destiny|Fate]] or Universal Reason (''Logos''), is an intelligent [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter:\n{{quote|The universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul; it is this same world's guiding principle, operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future; then fire and the principle of aether; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition, such as water, earth, and air; then the sun, the moon, the stars; and the universal existence in which all things are contained.|sign=Chrysippus|source=in Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', i. 39}}\n\nEverything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The [[soul]]s of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate:\n\n{{quote|Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the structure of the web.|sign=Marcus Aurelius|source=''[[Meditations]]'', iv. 40}}\n\nIndividual souls are perishable by nature, and can be \"transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the ''seminal reason'' (\"[[logos spermatikos]]\") of the Universe\".<ref>Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', iv. 21.</ref> Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe, it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason, that is, to live a life according to [[Natural law|Nature]].\n\nStoic theology is a [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] and [[naturalistic pantheism]]: God is never fully transcendent but always [[Immanence|immanent]], and identified with [[Nature]]. [[Abrahamic religions]] personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic [[cosmology]], which is very similar to the [[Hindu cosmology|Hindu conception of existence]], there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the [[space]] and [[Universe]] have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed (\"[[Ekpyrosis|ekpyr\u014dsis]]\", ''conflagration'') and [[Palingenesis|re-created again]],<ref>[[Michael Lapidge]], ''Stoic Cosmology'', in: John M. Rist, ''The Stoics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1978, pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all [[existence]] as cyclic, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also [[Eternal return]]).\n\nStoicism, just like [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe.<ref name=\"ferg\" /> According to the Stoics, the ''[[logos]]'' was the active [[reason]] or ''[[anima mundi]]'' pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal reason'' (\"[[logos spermatikos]]\"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos'', which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.<ref>Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37\u201338. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.</ref>\n\nThe first philosophers to explicitly describe [[Nominalism|nominalist]] arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.<ref>John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84\u201385: \"[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ...

The word \"stoic\" has since come to mean \"unemotional\" or indifferent to pain because Stoic ethics taught freedom from \"passion\" by following \"reason\". The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute \"[[asceticism|ask\u0113sis]]\", that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm.<ref>{{cite book | last = Graver | first = Margaret | title = Stoicism and Emotion | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-226-30558-5 |oclc=430497127}}</ref> Logic, reflection, and concentration were the methods of such self-discipline, temperance is split into self-control, discipline and modesty.\n\nBorrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: \"Follow where reason leads.\" {{citation needed|date=June 2017}} One must therefore strive to be free of the [[Stoic passions|passions]], bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of \"passion\" was \"anguish\" or \"suffering\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/passion |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |title=Passion |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref> that is, \"passively\" reacting to external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made between ''pathos'' (plural ''pathe'') which is normally translated as ''passion'', ''propathos'' or instinctive reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and ''eupathos'', which is the mark of the Stoic sage (''sophos''). The ''eupatheia'' are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment.\n\nThe idea was to be free of [[suffering]] through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}; literally, \"without passion\") or [[Inner peace|peace of mind]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Seddon | first = Keith | title = Epictetus' Handbook and the Tablet of Cebes | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-415-32451-9 |page=217 |oclc=469313282}}</ref> where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense\u2014being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] or having \"clear judgment\" and the maintenance of [[equanimity]] in the face of life's highs and lows.\n\nFor the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature\u2014the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people.\n\nThe four [[cardinal virtues]] (''[[Arete (moral virtue)|aretai]]'') of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of [[Plato]] (''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' IV. 426\u2013435):\n* [[Wisdom]] (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \"''sophia''\")\n* [[Courage]] (\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \"''andreia''\")\n* [[Justice]] (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 \"''dikaiosyne''\")\n* [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] (\u03c3\u03c9\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 ''\"[[sophrosyne]]''\")\n\nFollowing Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and [[evil]] are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature.\n\nThe Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.<ref name=\"marietta153\">Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pp. 153\u201354.

Oxford University Press</ref>\n\n===The doctrine of \"things indifferent\"===\n{{main|Adiaphora}}\n{{see also|Eudaimonia}}\nIn philosophical terms, things that are indifferent are outside the application of [[Moral absolutism|moral law]]\u2014that is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends. Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law, or that do not affect [[morality]], are called morally indifferent. The doctrine of things indifferent ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1}}, ''[[adiaphora]]'') arose in the Stoic school as a [[corollary]] of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1}} ''[[kathekon]]ta'', \"convenient actions\", or actions in accordance with nature; and \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ''hamartemata'', mistakes). As a result of this [[dichotomy]], a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent.\n\nEventually three sub-classes of \"things indifferent\" developed: things to prefer because they assist life according to nature; things to avoid because they hinder it; and things indifferent in the narrower sense. The principle of ''adiaphora'' was also common to the Cynics. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] revived the doctrine of things indifferent during the [[Renaissance]].\n\n===Spiritual exercise===\n[[File:L'Image et le Pouvoir - Buste cuirass\u00e9 de Marc Aur\u00e8le ag\u00e9 - 3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Marcus Aurelius]], the Stoic Roman emperor]]\nPhilosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims; it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or \"[[asceticism|ask\u0113sis]]\"). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included [[History of logic#Stoics|logic]], [[Socratic dialogue]] and [[Introspection|self-dialogue]], [[memento mori|contemplation of death]], [[mortality salience]], training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of [[Buddhist meditation]]), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions e.g. with [[diary|journaling]]. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.\n\nIn his ''[[Meditations]]'', Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices. For example, in Book II.I:\n\n<blockquote>Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of the ignorance of real good and ill...I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together...</blockquote>\n\nPrior to Aurelius, Epictetus in his ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]],'' distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination.<ref>Davidson, A.I. (1995) ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'', in ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', Hadot, P. Oxford Blackwells, pp. 9\u201310</ref> According to French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]], Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively.<ref>Hadot, P.

Three such [[Seneca's Consolations|consolations]] by Seneca have survived.\n\nStoics commonly employ \u2018The View from Above\u2019, reflecting on society and otherness in a guided visualization, aiming to gain a \"bigger picture\", to see ourselves in context relevant to others, to see others in the context of the world, to see ourselves in the context of the world to help determine our role and the importance of happenings.\n\nMarcus Aurelius, ''[[Meditations]]'', in Book 7.48 it is stated;\n\n<blockquote>A fine reflection from Plato. One who would converse about human beings should look on all things earthly as though from some point far above, upon herds, armies, and agriculture, marriages and divorces, births and deaths, the clamour of law courts, deserted wastes, alien peoples of every kind, festivals, lamentations, and markets, this intermixture of everything and ordered combination of opposites.</blockquote>\n\n==Social philosophy==\nA distinctive feature of Stoicism is its [[cosmopolitanism]]; according to the Stoics, all people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another. In the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'', [[Epictetus]] comments on man's relationship with the world: \"Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy.\"<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii. 5. 26</ref> This sentiment echoes that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said, \"I am not an [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] or a [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]], but a citizen of the world.\"<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i. 9. 1</ref>\n\nThey held that external differences, such as rank and wealth, are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as [[Cato the Younger]] and Epictetus.\n\nIn particular, they were noted for their urging of [[clemency]] toward [[slave]]s. Seneca exhorted, \"Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies.\"<ref>[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 47|''Moral letters to Lucilius'', Letter 47: ''On master and slave'']], 10, circa AD 65.</ref>\n\n==Influence on Christianity==\n{{See also|Neostoicism}}\n[[Image:Justus Lipsius.png|right|thumb|[[Justus Lipsius]], founder of Neostoicism]]\nIn his introduction to the 1964 [[Penguin Classics]] edition of ''Meditations'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact Stoicism had on Christianity. He claimed the author of the Fourth Gospel declared Christ to be the Logos, which \"had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/24 24] |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}</ref> In St. Ambrose of Milan's ''Duties'', \"The voice is the voice of a Christian bishop, but the precepts are those of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3401.htm|title=On the Duties of the Clergy|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/26 26] |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}</ref> Regarding what he called \"the Divine Spirit\", Stanisforth wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nCleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated\u2014in the Christian as in the Stoic mind\u2014with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.<ref name=\"Marcus Aurelius 1964 25\">{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/25 25] |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRegarding the [[Trinity]], Staniforth wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nAgain in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.<ref name=\"Marcus Aurelius 1964 25\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Paul of Tarsus|apostle Paul]] met with Stoics during his stay in Athens, reported in {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16\u201318|NKJV}}. In his [[Pauline epistles|letters]], Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new [[Gentile]] converts in their understanding of Christianity.<ref>Kee, Howard and Franklin W.

''Backgrounds of Early Christianity''. 2003, p. 368.</ref> But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature or God, a sense of the innate depravity\u2014or \"persistent evil\"\u2014of humankind,<ref name=\"ferg\" /> and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. Both encourage ''Ascesis'' with respect to the passions and inferior emotions, such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed.\n\nStoic writings such as ''[[Meditations]]'' by [[Marcus Aurelius]] have been highly regarded by many Christians throughout the centuries.

'Soney' Vaughs''' (April 16, 1937 \u2013 July 2, 2016) was an American [[civil rights]] activist, filmmaker, and motorcycle builder.  Vaughs designed the two [[Chopper (motorcycle)|chopper motorcycles]] used for the 1969 film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', while an [[Associate Producer]] on the film.<ref name=\"auto\">Choppers Magazine #8, Roth (ed), 1967</ref>  He also produced and directed the documentary ''What Will the Harvest Be?'' (1965) and ''Not So Easy'' (1972).<ref name =\"IMDB\"/>\n\nVaughs was born in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, on April 16, 1937, as the only child of an unmarried mother.  He was educated at the [[Boston Latin School]], and earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at [[Boston University]].  He joined the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in 1953, and afterward earned his master's degree at the [[University of Mexico]], in [[Mexico City]], majoring in [[Latin American Studies]].  He moved to Los Angeles in 1961, where he became involved in the [[custom motorcycle]] scene, and rode several [[Harley-Davidson]] [[Harley-Davidson Knucklehead engine|'Knucklehead']] '[[Chopper (motorcycle)|choppers]]'.  In 1963, Vaughs was recruited to join the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) by Bob Zelner, while on a fundraising tour for the organization.<ref name=\"The real story\">The Chopper: the Real Story, d'Orleans, 2014.  Gestalten, Berlin, {{ISBN|978-3-89955-524-0}}</ref>  Vaughs drove his 1953 [[Chevrolet]] half-ton [[pickup truck]] to the East Coast to join the SNCC activities there.

Vaughs said, \"I may have been na\u00efve thinking I could be an example to the black folks who were living in the South, but that's why I rode my chopper in Alabama.  I'd visit people in their dirt-floor shacks, living like [[slavery]] had never ended.  I wanted to be a visible example to them; a free black man on my motorcycle.\"<ref name=\"The real story\"/>\n\nIn 1964, Vaughs filmed interviews with [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr]], [[Stokeley Carmichael]], and [[Julian Bond]], among others, on the rise of the [[Black Power]] movement in the US.  The resulting documentary was 'What Will the Harvest Be?', which was aired in 1965 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]].  Vaughs was denied entry into the cameraman's union while working at KABC, and sued successfully to break the 'color barrier' for union membership.\n[[File:Captain America chopper at EMP right side.JPG|thumb|The [[Captain America (motorcycle)|Captain America]] bike]] \nIn 1967, while working at [[KABC-TV|KABC]] in Los Angeles, Vaughs interviewed [[Peter Fonda]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Vaughs and Fonda shared an interest in motorcycles, and Fonda introduced Vaughs to [[Dennis Hopper]], which led Vaughs to join a new film project as [[Associate Producer]], a \"Western type movie with motorcycles\".<ref name=\"The real story\"/>  Vaughs claims to have come up with the name for the film, 'Easy Rider', after the [[Mae West]] song, ''[[I Wonder Where My Easy Rider's Gone]]''?\n[[File:1969-typeBillyBike.jpg|thumb|The Billy bike]]\nVaughs purchased four [[Harley-Davidson]] '[[Panhead]]' motorcycles at an [[LA County Sheriff's Department|LA County Sherriff]]'s auction in 1967, and coordinated with motorcycle builder [[Ben Hardy (motorcycle builder)|Ben Hardy]], and mechanic Larry Marcus, to create the 'Captain America' and 'Billy' choppers for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thevintagent.blogspot.com//2014/11/peter-fonda-you-built-captain-america.html|title=The Vintagent|website=thevintagent.blogspot.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331201144/http://thevintagent.blogspot.com/2014/11/peter-fonda-you-built-captain-america.html|archivedate=March 31, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Two 'hero' choppers were built, and two stunt doubles for the ending scenes of the movie; while the stunt Captain America was destroyed in filming the final scene of the movie, the remaining three motorcycles were apparently stolen, and never recovered.

Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.\n\nPatriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"Henslin\"/>\n\nHistorically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.<ref>{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-02-865960-2}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}</ref> Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111\u2013114 |quote=Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies, 5 Volume Set|pages=1\u20133|last1=Pateman|chapter=Sexual Contract|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n''Patriarchy'' literally means \"the rule of the father\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Ferguson, Kathy E. |chapter=Patriarchy |editor=Tierney, Helen |title=Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Volume 2 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-31072-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 1048] |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&pg=PA1048 |url=https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Green, Fiona Joy |chapter=Patriarchal Ideology of Motherhood |editor=O'Reilly, Andrea |title= Encyclopedia of Motherhood, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-6846-1 |page=969 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcxqzal4bEYC&pg=PA969 }}</ref> and comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''patriarkh\u0113s''),<ref>{{cite web |title=patriarchy |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/patriarchy |website=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> \"father or chief of a race\",<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2Frxhs |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> which is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac (''patria''), \"lineage, descent\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2F |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> (from \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 ''pat\u0113r'', \"father\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1^\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpath%2Fr |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>) and \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 (''arkh\u014d''), \"rule, govern\".<ref>{{cite web |title=\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the term ''patriarchy'' has been used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family; however, since the late 20th century it has also been used to refer to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men,<ref name=\"Cannell & Green\">{{cite book |last1=Cannell |first1=Fenella |last2=Green |first2=Sarah |editor1-last=Kuper |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Kuper |editor2-first=Jessica |title=The Social Science Encyclopedia |date=1996 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-41-510829-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 592] |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Science_Encyclopedia.html?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC&q=patriarchy |chapter=Patriarchy |url=https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 }}</ref><ref name=\"Meagher\">{{Cite book |last=Meagher |first=Michelle |chapter=patriarchy |editor1-last=Ritzer |editor1-first=George |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first=J.

[[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of [[oppression]] of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth.

Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour, which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.\n\nOther proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles.

Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"Henslin\"/>\n\nHistorically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.<ref>{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-02-865960-2}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}</ref> Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111\u2013114 |quote=Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies, 5 Volume Set|pages=1\u20133|last1=Pateman|chapter=Sexual Contract|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n''Patriarchy'' literally means \"the rule of the father\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Ferguson, Kathy E. |chapter=Patriarchy |editor=Tierney, Helen |title=Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Volume 2 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-31072-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 1048] |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&pg=PA1048 |url=https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Green, Fiona Joy |chapter=Patriarchal Ideology of Motherhood |editor=O'Reilly, Andrea |title= Encyclopedia of Motherhood, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-6846-1 |page=969 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcxqzal4bEYC&pg=PA969 }}</ref> and comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''patriarkh\u0113s''),<ref>{{cite web |title=patriarchy |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/patriarchy |website=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> \"father or chief of a race\",<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2Frxhs |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> which is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac (''patria''), \"lineage, descent\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2F |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> (from \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 ''pat\u0113r'', \"father\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1^\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpath%2Fr |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>) and \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 (''arkh\u014d''), \"rule, govern\".<ref>{{cite web |title=\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the term ''patriarchy'' has been used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family; however, since the late 20th century it has also been used to refer to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men,<ref name=\"Cannell & Green\">{{cite book |last1=Cannell |first1=Fenella |last2=Green |first2=Sarah |editor1-last=Kuper |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Kuper |editor2-first=Jessica |title=The Social Science Encyclopedia |date=1996 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-41-510829-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 592] |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Science_Encyclopedia.html?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC&q=patriarchy |chapter=Patriarchy |url=https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 }}</ref><ref name=\"Meagher\">{{Cite book |last=Meagher |first=Michelle |chapter=patriarchy |editor1-last=Ritzer |editor1-first=George |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first=J.

She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Durso|first=Pamela R.|title=The Power of Woman: The Life and writings of Sarah Moore Grimk\u00e9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFTJJgK8esC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=2003|publisher=Mercer University Press|location=Macon, Ga.|isbn=978-0-86554-876-3|pages=130\u2013138|edition= 1st}}</ref>\n\n[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] used Grimk\u00e9's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought.

[[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of [[oppression]] of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.<ref name=\":0\" /> Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.\n\nInteractive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and [[capitalism]] interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.<ref name=\"Tong\">{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|last1=Rosemarie|first1=Tong|last2=Botts|first2=Tina Fernandes|date=2017-07-18|isbn=9780813350707|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=979993556}}</ref> According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the [[Division of labour|labour division]] to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a [[gender]].

She asks whether a \"good mother\" trains her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person, or whether she resists patriarchal ideologies and [[Socialization|socializes]] her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Gerda Lerner]], in her 1986 ''The Creation of Patriarchy'', makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] and seen as natural and invisible.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSome feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust [[social system]] that is harmful to both men and women.<ref>{{cite book|author1=David A.

Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour, which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.\n\nOther proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this basis, \"the existence of a [[Sexual division of labour|sexual division of labor]] in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological.\"<ref name=\"Lewontin\" />{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent \"sexual division\".<ref name=\"Lewontin\" />\n\nSome [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than [[social conditioning]]. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of [[Culture|human culture]]. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, \"The [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all.\"<ref name=\"Goldberg, Steven\">{{cite book | last = Goldberg | first = Steven | title = The inevitability of patriarchy | publisher = W.
