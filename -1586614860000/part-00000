He at once endeavoured to bring down [[Arnold of Brescia]], the leader of the anti-papal faction in Rome. Disorder within the city led to the murder of a cardinal, prompting Adrian, shortly before [[Palm Sunday]] 1155, to take the unheard-of step of putting Rome under [[interdict]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> effectively closing all the churches in Rome.<ref name=\":2\"/> This act had a huge impact on daily life in Rome:<blockquote>Exceptions were made for the baptism of infants and the absolution of the dying: otherwise all sacraments and services were forbidden. No masses could be said, no masses solemnised: even dead bodies might not be buried in consecrated grounds. In the days where religion still constituted an integral part of every man's life, the effect of such a moral blockade was immeasurable.<ref name=\":2\"/></blockquote>This act also had a huge potential economic impact: the interdict greatly diminished the seasonal influx of pilgrims, thus damaging the local economy. Without Easter services the pilgrims would not visit; thereupon, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] (City Council of Rome) exiled Arnold, and the pope, with the cooperation of the newly arrived King [[Frederick Barbarossa]] of Germany, procured Arnold's execution.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\n==Byzantine alliance==\nIn 1155, [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] reconquered southern Italy, landing his forces in the region of [[Apulia]]. Making contact with local rebels who were hostile to the Sicilian crown, Byzantine forces quickly overran the [[coastland]]s and began striking inland. Pope Adrian IV watched these developments with some satisfaction. The Papacy was never on good terms with the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]], except when under duress by the threat of direct military action. For Adrian, having the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] on its southern border was preferable to having to deal constantly with the troublesome Normans. Therefore, negotiations were hurriedly carried out, and an alliance was formed between Adrian and Manuel. Adrian undertook to raise a body of mercenary troops from [[Campania]]. Meanwhile, Manuel dreamed of restoration of the [[Roman Empire]]; this was, however, at the cost of a potential union between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and the Catholic Church. Negotiations for union of the eastern and western churches, which had been in a state of [[Schism (religion)|schism]] since 1054, soon got under way. The combined Papal-Byzantine forces joined with the rebels against the [[Normans]] in [[Southern Italy]], achieving a string of rapid successes as a number of cities yielded either to the threat of force or to the lure of gold.\n\nBut just as the war seemed decided in the allies' favour, things started to go wrong. The Greek commander Michael Palaeologus alienated some of his allies by his arrogance, and this stalled the campaign as rebel Count [[Robert II of Bassunvilla|Robert of Loritello]] refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign lost some of its momentum. Worse was to come: Michael was soon recalled to [[Constantinople]]. Although his arrogance had slowed the campaign, he was a brilliant general in the field, and his loss was a major blow to the allied campaign. The turning point was the battle for [[Brindisi]], where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries who were serving in the allied armies demanded impossible increases in their pay; when these were refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon Adrian's Byzantine allies were left hopelessly outnumbered. The naval battle was decided in the Sicilians' favour, and the Byzantine commander was captured. The defeat at Brindisi put an end to the restored Byzantine reign in Italy,<ref name=ua/> and by 1158 the [[Byzantine Army]] had left Italy.\n\nHopes for a lasting alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]] had also come up against insuperable problems. Pope Adrian IV's conditions for a union between the eastern and western churches included recognition of his religious authority over Christians everywhere; the Emperor in turn required recognition of his secular authority. Neither East nor West could accept such conditions. Adrian's secular powers were too valuable to be surrendered and Manuel's subjects could never have accepted the authority of the distant [[bishop of Rome]]. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church, Adrian never felt able to honour Manuel with the title of [[augustus (honorific)|augustus]]. Ultimately, a deal proved elusive, and the two churches remained divided.\n\n==Adrian IV and the Norman invasion of Ireland==\n[[File:Medieval, Incomplete papal bulla of Pope Adrian IV (FindID 618216).jpg|thumb|A [[Bulla (seal)|bulla]] of Adrian IV]]\nIn 1155, three years after the [[Synod of Kells]], the papal bull ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' was published, urging King [[Henry II of England]] to [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invade Ireland]] to bring its church under the Roman system and to conduct a general reform of governance and society throughout the island. The authenticity of this grant, the historian Edmund Curtis says, is one of \"''the great questions of history''.\" He states that the matter was discussed at a royal council at [[Winchester]], but that Henry's mother, the [[Empress Matilda]], had protested, and the expedition was put off to another time.<ref name=ua/>\n\nIn Ireland however, nothing seems to have been known of it, and no provision appears to have been made to defend against the prospect of Angevin Norman aggression, despite their westward expansion throughout England and [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=Edmund |title=A History of Ireland from Earliest Times to 1922 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=38\u201339 |isbn=978-0-415-27949-9}}</ref> Ernest F.

According to protocol, the King should have met the Pope outside the camp to hold the bridle of the Pope's horse while he dismounted; Barbarossa did not do this, saying it was not his duty to act as papal [[Groom (profession)|groom]].<ref name=\":2\"/> In turn, Adrian refused the King the traditional [[kiss of peace]] until this service was delivered. In the end, Barbarossa gave in and ordered his camp moved a little further south where, on 11 June, the procedure was repeated - this time with Barbarossa undertaking the groom duties - and conversations about the coronation began.<ref name=\":2\" /> Adrian crowned Frederick on 18 June in Rome.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Tomb of Pope Adrian IV.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of Adrian IV]]\nAt the [[diet of Besan\u00e7on]] in October 1157, the legates presented to Frederick I a letter from Adrian IV which alluded to the ''beneficia'' or \"benefits\" conferred upon the Emperor. The German chancellor translated this ''beneficia'' in the feudal sense of the presentation of property from a lord to a vassal ([[benefice]]). Frederick was infuriated by the suggestion that he was dependent on the Pope, and in the storm which ensued the legates were glad to escape with their lives. The incident at length closed with a letter from the Pope, declaring that by ''beneficium'' he meant merely ''bonum factum'' or \"a good deed,\" i.e. the [[coronation]]. The breach subsequently became wider, and the Emperor was about to be [[excommunication|excommunicated]] when Adrian died at [[Anagni]] on 1 September 1159,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> reputedly by choking on a fly in his wine, but more likely from [[Peritonsillar abscess|quinsy]].\n\nHis biography was first written by [[Boso Breakspeare|Cardinal Boso]] in his extension to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]''.<ref name=\"boso\">{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Boso (Breakspear)}}.

Meanwhile, Manuel dreamed of restoration of the [[Roman Empire]]; this was, however, at the cost of a potential union between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and the Catholic Church. Negotiations for union of the eastern and western churches, which had been in a state of [[Schism (religion)|schism]] since 1054, soon got under way. The combined Papal-Byzantine forces joined with the rebels against the [[Normans]] in [[Southern Italy]], achieving a string of rapid successes as a number of cities yielded either to the threat of force or to the lure of gold.\n\nBut just as the war seemed decided in the allies' favour, things started to go wrong. The Greek commander Michael Palaeologus alienated some of his allies by his arrogance, and this stalled the campaign as rebel Count [[Robert II of Bassunvilla|Robert of Loritello]] refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign lost some of its momentum. Worse was to come: Michael was soon recalled to [[Constantinople]]. Although his arrogance had slowed the campaign, he was a brilliant general in the field, and his loss was a major blow to the allied campaign. The turning point was the battle for [[Brindisi]], where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries who were serving in the allied armies demanded impossible increases in their pay; when these were refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon Adrian's Byzantine allies were left hopelessly outnumbered. The naval battle was decided in the Sicilians' favour, and the Byzantine commander was captured. The defeat at Brindisi put an end to the restored Byzantine reign in Italy,<ref name=ua/> and by 1158 the [[Byzantine Army]] had left Italy.\n\nHopes for a lasting alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]] had also come up against insuperable problems. Pope Adrian IV's conditions for a union between the eastern and western churches included recognition of his religious authority over Christians everywhere; the Emperor in turn required recognition of his secular authority. Neither East nor West could accept such conditions. Adrian's secular powers were too valuable to be surrendered and Manuel's subjects could never have accepted the authority of the distant [[bishop of Rome]]. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church, Adrian never felt able to honour Manuel with the title of [[augustus (honorific)|augustus]]. Ultimately, a deal proved elusive, and the two churches remained divided.\n\n==Adrian IV and the Norman invasion of Ireland==\n[[File:Medieval, Incomplete papal bulla of Pope Adrian IV (FindID 618216).jpg|thumb|A [[Bulla (seal)|bulla]] of Adrian IV]]\nIn 1155, three years after the [[Synod of Kells]], the papal bull ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' was published, urging King [[Henry II of England]] to [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invade Ireland]] to bring its church under the Roman system and to conduct a general reform of governance and society throughout the island. The authenticity of this grant, the historian Edmund Curtis says, is one of \"''the great questions of history''.\" He states that the matter was discussed at a royal council at [[Winchester]], but that Henry's mother, the [[Empress Matilda]], had protested, and the expedition was put off to another time.<ref name=ua/>\n\nIn Ireland however, nothing seems to have been known of it, and no provision appears to have been made to defend against the prospect of Angevin Norman aggression, despite their westward expansion throughout England and [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=Edmund |title=A History of Ireland from Earliest Times to 1922 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=38\u201339 |isbn=978-0-415-27949-9}}</ref> Ernest F.

It is notable that decisions of [[Pope Alexander III]], [[Pope Lucius III]], and King [[Henry VIII]] in proclaiming the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]] were predicated on this document.<ref>{{cite book |last=O\u2019Hegarty |first=P.

According to protocol, the King should have met the Pope outside the camp to hold the bridle of the Pope's horse while he dismounted; Barbarossa did not do this, saying it was not his duty to act as papal [[Groom (profession)|groom]].<ref name=\":2\"/> In turn, Adrian refused the King the traditional [[kiss of peace]] until this service was delivered. In the end, Barbarossa gave in and ordered his camp moved a little further south where, on 11 June, the procedure was repeated - this time with Barbarossa undertaking the groom duties - and conversations about the coronation began.<ref name=\":2\" /> Adrian crowned Frederick on 18 June in Rome.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Tomb of Pope Adrian IV.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of Adrian IV]]\nAt the [[diet of Besan\u00e7on]] in October 1157, the legates presented to Frederick I a letter from Adrian IV which alluded to the ''beneficia'' or \"benefits\" conferred upon the Emperor. The German chancellor translated this ''beneficia'' in the feudal sense of the presentation of property from a lord to a vassal ([[benefice]]). Frederick was infuriated by the suggestion that he was dependent on the Pope, and in the storm which ensued the legates were glad to escape with their lives. The incident at length closed with a letter from the Pope, declaring that by ''beneficium'' he meant merely ''bonum factum'' or \"a good deed,\" i.e. the [[coronation]]. The breach subsequently became wider, and the Emperor was about to be [[excommunication|excommunicated]] when Adrian died at [[Anagni]] on 1 September 1159,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> reputedly by choking on a fly in his wine, but more likely from [[Peritonsillar abscess|quinsy]].\n\nHis biography was first written by [[Boso Breakspeare|Cardinal Boso]] in his extension to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]''.<ref name=\"boso\">{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Boso (Breakspear)}}. Henry Birt says that Boso was a [[cardinal-nephew]] of Adrian IV, but Arthur Ua Clerigh finds no evidence. More recent sources say that this is incorrect (B.

She was the second daughter of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]], [[Rebekah]]'s brother, making Jacob her first cousin.<ref name=\"jvl\" /> Jacob had traveled a great distance to find Laban. Rebekah had sent him there to be safe from his angry twin brother, [[Esau]].\n\nDuring Jacob's stay, he fell in love with Rachel and agreed to work seven years for Laban in return for her hand in marriage. On the night of the wedding, the bride was veiled and Jacob did not notice that [[Leah]], Rachel's older sister, had been substituted for Rachel. Whereas \"Rachel was lovely in form and beautiful\", \"Leah had tender eyes\".<ref>\"Leah had tender eyes\" ({{lang-he|\u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4 \u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea}}) (Genesis 29:17). It is debated as to whether the adjective \"tender\" (\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea) should be taken to mean \"delicate and soft\" or \"weary\". Some translations say that it may have meant blue or light colored eyes. Some say that Leah spent most of her time weeping and praying to God to change her destined mate. Thus the Torah describes her eyes as \"soft\" from weeping.</ref> Later Jacob confronted Laban, who excused his own deception by insisting that the older sister should marry first. He assured Jacob that after his wedding week was finished, he could take Rachel as a wife as well, and work another seven years as payment for her. When God \"saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb\" (Gen 29:31), and she gave birth to four sons.\n\nRachel, like [[Sarah]] and Rebecca, remained unable to conceive. According to Tikva Frymer-Kensky, \"The infertility of the matriarchs has two effects: it heightens the drama of the birth of the eventual son, marking [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], and [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] as special; and it emphasizes that pregnancy is an act of God.\"<ref name=\"Frymer\">[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rachel-bible Frymer-Kensky, Tikva. \"Rachel: Bible.\" Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 20 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. (Viewed on August 6, 2014)]</ref>\n\nRachel became jealous of [[Leah]] and gave Jacob her maidservant, [[Bilhah]], to be a surrogate mother for her. Bilhah gave birth to two sons that Rachel named and raised ([[Dan (biblical figure)|Dan]] and [[Naphtali]]). Leah responds by offering her handmaid [[Zilpah]] to Jacob, and names and raises the two sons ([[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and [[Asher]]) that Zilpah bears. According to some commentaries, Bilhah and Zilpah are actually half-sisters of Leah and Rachel.<ref name=\"loj\">Ginzberg, Louis (1909) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj108.htm ''The Legends of the Jews''], Volume I, Chapter VI: Jacob, at [http://www.sacred-texts.com/index.htm sacred-texts.com]</ref> After Leah conceived again, Rachel was finally blessed with a son, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]],<ref name=\"jvl\" /> who would become Jacob's favorite child.\n\n==Children==\nRachel's son [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] was destined to be the leader of Israel's tribes between exile and nationhood. This role is exemplified in the Biblical story of Joseph, who prepared the way in Egypt for his family's exile there.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=441&letter=J&search=Joseph \"Joseph\"] at [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com jewishencyclopedia.com]</ref>\n\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 066.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] of Rachel sitting on the [[Teraphim|idols]] (1726\u20131728)]]\n\nAfter Joseph's birth, Jacob decided to return to the land of [[Canaan]] with his family.<ref name=\"jvl\" /> Fearing that Laban would deter him, he fled with his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and twelve children without informing his father-in-law. Laban pursued him and accused him of stealing his [[Teraphim|idols]]. Indeed, Rachel had taken her father's idols, hidden them inside her camel's seat cushion, and sat upon them. Laban had neglected to give his daughters their inheritance ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 31:14\u201316}}).<ref name=\"Frymer\" />\n\nNot knowing that the idols were in his wife's possession, Jacob pronounced a curse on whoever had them: \"With whoever you will find your gods, he will not live\" ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 31:32}}). Laban proceeded to search the tents of Jacob and his wives, but when he came to Rachel's tent, she told her father, \"Let not my lord be angered that I cannot rise up before you, for the way of women is upon me\" ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 31:35}}). Laban left her alone, but the curse Jacob had pronounced came true shortly thereafter.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Rachel's Tomb, near Bethlehem, 1891.jpg|thumb|Rachel's Tomb, near Bethlehem, 1891]]\n\nNear [[Ephrath]], Rachel went into a difficult [[childbirth|labor]] with her second son, [[Benjamin]].

[[Rashi]] explains that Ben Yamin either means \"son of the right\" (i.e., \"south\"), since Benjamin was the only one of Jacob's sons born in Canaan, which is to the south of [[Paddan Aram]]; or it could mean \"son of my days\", as Benjamin was born in Jacob's old age.\n\nRachel was buried on the road to [[Efrat]], just outside [[Bethlehem]],<ref name=\"je\">[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=57&letter=R&search=rachel \"Rachel\"] at [http://jewishencyclopedia.com http://jewishencyclopedia.com]</ref> and not in the ancestral tomb at [[Machpelah]].

The Book of Esther details Mordecai's lineage as \"Mordecai the son of [[Jair|Yair]], the son of [[List of minor biblical figures#Shimi|Shimi]], the son of [[Kish (Bible)|Kish]], a man of the right (''ish yemini'')\" (Esther 2:5). The designation of ''ish yemini'' refers to his membership in the [[Israelites|Tribe]] of Benjamin (''ben yamin'', son of the right). The rabbis comment that Esther's ability to remain silent in the palace of [[Ahasuerus]], resisting the king's pressure to reveal her ancestry, was inherited from her ancestor Rachel, who remained silent even when Laban brought out Leah to marry Jacob.\n* After the tribes of [[Ephraim]] and Benjamin were exiled by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], Rachel was remembered as the classic mother who mourns and intercedes for her children.<ref name=\"Frymer\" /> [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 31:15, speaks of 'Rachel weeping for her children' ([[KJV]]). This is interpreted in [[Judaism]] as Rachel crying for an end to her descendants' sufferings and exiles following the destruction by the Babylonians of the [[First Temple]] in ancient [[Jerusalem]]. According to the [[Midrash]], Rachel spoke before God: \"If I, a mere mortal, was prepared not to humiliate my sister and was willing to take a rival into my home, how could You, the eternal, compassionate God, be jealous of [[idolatry|idols]], which have no true existence, that were brought into Your home (the [[Temple in Jerusalem]])? Will You cause my children to be exiled on this account?\" God accepted her plea and promised that, eventually, the exile would end and the Jews would return to their land.<ref>Weisberg, Chana, [http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article.asp?AID=439609 \"Rachel - Biblical Women\"] at [http://www.chabad.org chabad.org]</ref>\n* In the second chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (part of the [[New Testament]]), this reference from Jeremiah is interpreted as a prediction of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] by [[Herod the Great]] in his attempt to kill the young [[Jesus]].

She was the second daughter of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]], [[Rebekah]]'s brother, making Jacob her first cousin.<ref name=\"jvl\" /> Jacob had traveled a great distance to find Laban. Rebekah had sent him there to be safe from his angry twin brother, [[Esau]].\n\nDuring Jacob's stay, he fell in love with Rachel and agreed to work seven years for Laban in return for her hand in marriage. On the night of the wedding, the bride was veiled and Jacob did not notice that [[Leah]], Rachel's older sister, had been substituted for Rachel. Whereas \"Rachel was lovely in form and beautiful\", \"Leah had tender eyes\".<ref>\"Leah had tender eyes\" ({{lang-he|\u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4 \u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea}}) (Genesis 29:17). It is debated as to whether the adjective \"tender\" (\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea) should be taken to mean \"delicate and soft\" or \"weary\". Some translations say that it may have meant blue or light colored eyes. Some say that Leah spent most of her time weeping and praying to God to change her destined mate. Thus the Torah describes her eyes as \"soft\" from weeping.</ref> Later Jacob confronted Laban, who excused his own deception by insisting that the older sister should marry first. He assured Jacob that after his wedding week was finished, he could take Rachel as a wife as well, and work another seven years as payment for her. When God \"saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb\" (Gen 29:31), and she gave birth to four sons.\n\nRachel, like [[Sarah]] and Rebecca, remained unable to conceive. According to Tikva Frymer-Kensky, \"The infertility of the matriarchs has two effects: it heightens the drama of the birth of the eventual son, marking [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], and [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] as special; and it emphasizes that pregnancy is an act of God.\"<ref name=\"Frymer\">[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rachel-bible Frymer-Kensky, Tikva. \"Rachel: Bible.\" Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 20 March 2009.

Bilhah gave birth to two sons that Rachel named and raised ([[Dan (biblical figure)|Dan]] and [[Naphtali]]). Leah responds by offering her handmaid [[Zilpah]] to Jacob, and names and raises the two sons ([[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and [[Asher]]) that Zilpah bears. According to some commentaries, Bilhah and Zilpah are actually half-sisters of Leah and Rachel.<ref name=\"loj\">Ginzberg, Louis (1909) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj108.htm ''The Legends of the Jews''], Volume I, Chapter VI: Jacob, at [http://www.sacred-texts.com/index.htm sacred-texts.com]</ref> After Leah conceived again, Rachel was finally blessed with a son, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]],<ref name=\"jvl\" /> who would become Jacob's favorite child.\n\n==Children==\nRachel's son [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] was destined to be the leader of Israel's tribes between exile and nationhood.

Laban pursued him and accused him of stealing his [[Teraphim|idols]]. Indeed, Rachel had taken her father's idols, hidden them inside her camel's seat cushion, and sat upon them. Laban had neglected to give his daughters their inheritance ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 31:14\u201316}}).<ref name=\"Frymer\" />\n\nNot knowing that the idols were in his wife's possession, Jacob pronounced a curse on whoever had them: \"With whoever you will find your gods, he will not live\" ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 31:32}}). Laban proceeded to search the tents of Jacob and his wives, but when he came to Rachel's tent, she told her father, \"Let not my lord be angered that I cannot rise up before you, for the way of women is upon me\" ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 31:35}}).

The Book of Esther details Mordecai's lineage as \"Mordecai the son of [[Jair|Yair]], the son of [[List of minor biblical figures#Shimi|Shimi]], the son of [[Kish (Bible)|Kish]], a man of the right (''ish yemini'')\" (Esther 2:5). The designation of ''ish yemini'' refers to his membership in the [[Israelites|Tribe]] of Benjamin (''ben yamin'', son of the right). The rabbis comment that Esther's ability to remain silent in the palace of [[Ahasuerus]], resisting the king's pressure to reveal her ancestry, was inherited from her ancestor Rachel, who remained silent even when Laban brought out Leah to marry Jacob.\n* After the tribes of [[Ephraim]] and Benjamin were exiled by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], Rachel was remembered as the classic mother who mourns and intercedes for her children.<ref name=\"Frymer\" /> [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 31:15, speaks of 'Rachel weeping for her children' ([[KJV]]). This is interpreted in [[Judaism]] as Rachel crying for an end to her descendants' sufferings and exiles following the destruction by the Babylonians of the [[First Temple]] in ancient [[Jerusalem]]. According to the [[Midrash]], Rachel spoke before God: \"If I, a mere mortal, was prepared not to humiliate my sister and was willing to take a rival into my home, how could You, the eternal, compassionate God, be jealous of [[idolatry|idols]], which have no true existence, that were brought into Your home (the [[Temple in Jerusalem]])? Will You cause my children to be exiled on this account?\" God accepted her plea and promised that, eventually, the exile would end and the Jews would return to their land.<ref>Weisberg, Chana, [http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article.asp?AID=439609 \"Rachel - Biblical Women\"] at [http://www.chabad.org chabad.org]</ref>\n* In the second chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (part of the [[New Testament]]), this reference from Jeremiah is interpreted as a prediction of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] by [[Herod the Great]] in his attempt to kill the young [[Jesus]].

She is a [[lyric soprano]] and has a [[vocal range]] of three octaves.<ref name=\"Classic Rock Magazine 2009, p. 92\">Classic Rock Magazine, August 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nTurunen studied singing at [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Karlsruhe]]. She is a professional classical [[lied]] singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]], which she founded with [[Tuomas Holopainen]] and [[Emppu Vuorinen]] in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, \"operatic\" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed \"opera metal\", inspired many other metal bands and performers.\n\nTurunen was dismissed from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band's [[End of an Era (album)|End of an Era]] concert) for personal reasons. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called ''[[Henk\u00e4ys ikuisuudesta]]''. In 2007, Turunen released ''[[My Winter Storm]]'', an album featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the [[Storm World Tour]]. Turunen released her third album, ''[[What Lies Beneath (Tarja album)|What Lies Beneath]]'', in 2010. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and the [[Wacken Open Air]], before starting the [[What Lies Beneath World Tour]], which lasted until April 2012. Her first live DVD ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was filmed during this tour on 30 and 31 March 2012 in [[Rosario, Argentina]]. ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was released in August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarja-act1.com/?p=341#more-341 |title=Tarja Turunen \u2013 Live Album 'ACT I\" available August 24th 2012 |website=Tarja-act1.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref> Turunen started the [[Colours in the Dark World Tour]] in October 2013 to promote her new album [[Colours in the Dark (album)|''Colours in the Dark'']].

She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song \"Enkeli taivaan\" (the Finnish version of \"[[Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"|From Heaven Above to Earth I Come]]\") in the Kitee church hall at age three.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} She joined the [[church choir]] and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt [[comprehensive school]], Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, \"Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.\"{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} Her music teacher, [[Plamen Dimov (musician)|Plamen Dimov]], later explained that, \"If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times\".{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At school she had a tough time, since some girls [[Bullying|bullied]] her because they envied her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in [[Savonlinna]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=43}}\n\nFor several years Turunen performed various songs including [[soul music]] by [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42, 43}} Later she listened to songs from the [[Crossover (music)#Classical crossover|classical crossover]] singer [[Sarah Brightman]], especially the song \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]\", and decided to focus on that genre of music.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At eighteen, she moved to [[Kuopio]] to study at the [[Sibelius Academy]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=44}}\n\n===1996\u20132005: With Nightwish===\n[[File:NightwishJune2005.jpg|thumb|alt=Five band members taking their bows at the end of a performance|Turunen with Nightwish at the Himos Festival in [[J\u00e4ms\u00e4]], Finland, on June 25, 2005]]\n\nIn December 1996, former classmate [[Tuomas Holopainen]] invited Turunen to join his new acoustic mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, [[Emppu Vuorinen]] used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=45, 46}} Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came to the conclusion that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a [[Heavy metal music|metal band]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=54}}\n\nNightwish recorded a second demo with \"more bombastic, dramatic\" songs in September 1997.

On the Nightwish album ''[[Oceanborn]]'' (1998), her classical vocal training was much more noticeable. For the song \"[[Passion and the Opera]]\", Turunen performed a [[staccato]] [[coloratura]] reminiscent of the aria \"[[Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Hell's vengeance boils in my heart]]\", sung by the soprano role Queen of the Night in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] opera [[The Magic Flute]].{{sfn|Della Ciopa|2010|p=77}} \"Sleeping Sun\" required a well-trained breathing technique.

She is a professional classical [[lied]] singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]], which she founded with [[Tuomas Holopainen]] and [[Emppu Vuorinen]] in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, \"operatic\" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed \"opera metal\", inspired many other metal bands and performers.\n\nTurunen was dismissed from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band's [[End of an Era (album)|End of an Era]] concert) for personal reasons. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called ''[[Henk\u00e4ys ikuisuudesta]]''. In 2007, Turunen released ''[[My Winter Storm]]'', an album featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the [[Storm World Tour]]. Turunen released her third album, ''[[What Lies Beneath (Tarja album)|What Lies Beneath]]'', in 2010. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and the [[Wacken Open Air]], before starting the [[What Lies Beneath World Tour]], which lasted until April 2012.

She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song \"Enkeli taivaan\" (the Finnish version of \"[[Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"|From Heaven Above to Earth I Come]]\") in the Kitee church hall at age three.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} She joined the [[church choir]] and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt [[comprehensive school]], Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, \"Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.\"{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} Her music teacher, [[Plamen Dimov (musician)|Plamen Dimov]], later explained that, \"If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times\".{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At school she had a tough time, since some girls [[Bullying|bullied]] her because they envied her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in [[Savonlinna]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=43}}\n\nFor several years Turunen performed various songs including [[soul music]] by [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42, 43}} Later she listened to songs from the [[Crossover (music)#Classical crossover|classical crossover]] singer [[Sarah Brightman]], especially the song \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]\", and decided to focus on that genre of music.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At eighteen, she moved to [[Kuopio]] to study at the [[Sibelius Academy]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=44}}\n\n===1996\u20132005: With Nightwish===\n[[File:NightwishJune2005.jpg|thumb|alt=Five band members taking their bows at the end of a performance|Turunen with Nightwish at the Himos Festival in [[J\u00e4ms\u00e4]], Finland, on June 25, 2005]]\n\nIn December 1996, former classmate [[Tuomas Holopainen]] invited Turunen to join his new acoustic mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, [[Emppu Vuorinen]] used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=45, 46}} Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came to the conclusion that the music had to be massive too.

On the Nightwish album ''[[Oceanborn]]'' (1998), her classical vocal training was much more noticeable. For the song \"[[Passion and the Opera]]\", Turunen performed a [[staccato]] [[coloratura]] reminiscent of the aria \"[[Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Hell's vengeance boils in my heart]]\", sung by the soprano role Queen of the Night in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] opera [[The Magic Flute]].{{sfn|Della Ciopa|2010|p=77}} \"Sleeping Sun\" required a well-trained breathing technique. Turunen explained in an interview that when they recorded ''Oceanborn'', she had serious doubts, fearing that she was not yet advanced enough in her studies to have mastered the required techniques.<ref>\"Mystic Art\"-Magazin, 10-11/2000</ref>{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=77}}\n\nA challenge of a different kind was the cover version of Gary Moore's \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" (2001), as it required a deeper voice, far below the vocal range of an average soprano. In an interview with ''Breakout'' magazine, she reported that in the studio, the band members were shaken by a paroxysm of laughter as she tried to warm up for the vocal lines.<ref>''Breakout'' Magazine, 5/2001, p. 6-8</ref> As a side benefit of her efforts, Turunen gradually expanded her vocal range considerably into the lower range, which manifested even more on the following albums.\n\nFor the album ''[[Century Child]]'' (2002), she experimented with a more \"rock\" sounding voice, where she maintained the classical singing technique, but, for example, sang with less vibrato. Turunen was not satisfied that she had successfully transitioned to this new style until the album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'' (2004).<ref name=\"Metal Temple\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/musicians/tarja_turunen.htm?keep_has_js=1&keep_session=1770859|title=Interview with Tarja Turunen from Nightwish|publisher=Metal Temple |date=October 5, 2004 |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|I feel very comfortable with ''Once'' because I have tried to change my singing style with Nightwish already since ''Century Child'' because Tuomas requested that, the songs requested that ...

The club is widely known for playing in the first-division [[association football]] league [[Bundesliga]] alongside its more famous cousins, [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], for two seasons between 1999 and 2001, while the club's [[bobsleigh]] department has captured several world and Olympic titles. The football team plays in the [[3. Liga]] (third tier).\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nOriginally part of the gymnastics and sports club TSV Hachinger, SpVgg Unterhaching was established as an independent football club on 1 January 1925. Their first promotion to a higher division came in 1931 and they went on to be promoted to the A-Klasse a year later. However, the club was dissolved in 1933 as it was regarded as \"politically unreliable\" by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and was not re-established until after the end of World War II in 1945 to resume play in the amateur fourth division B-Klasse.\n\n===A rise through the ranks===\n[[File:Unterhaching Performance Chart.png|200px|thumb|Historical chart of Unterhaching league performance]]\nUnterhaching's football team was only an anonymous local amateur team with no significant successes until a climb through league ranks that began in 1976 with promotion from B-Klasse to A-Klasse play. A first-place finished earned the club quick promotion to the Bezirksliga in 1977. Continued good play put the team into the fourth-division [[Landesliga Bayern-S\u00fcd]] in 1979 and then the [[Oberliga Bayern]] (III), the highest amateur division at the time, by 1981.\n\nUnterhaching finished first there in 1983 to earn an appearance in the playoff round for the [[2. Bundesliga]], but failed to advance. They suffered a similar fate in 1988 when they next appeared in the promotion round.\n\nThe club finally emerged from the Oberliga to play in the 2. Bundesliga in 1989, but were quickly relegated after a 20th-place finish. Promoted a second time in 1992, they were once again sent down after a marginally better 18th-place result. Unterhaching next appeared in the second division in 1995 after a first-place finish in the new [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1994\u20132012)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]] (III).\n\n===Unterhaching in Bundesliga===\nWith their return to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1995\u201396 season the club would begin a period that would see them earn their best ever results. They finished 4th that season, then slipped to 6th and 11th-place results in their next two campaigns before securing promotion to the top-flight [[Bundesliga]] after a 2nd-place finish in 1999 season.\n\nThey went on to surprise everyone with a respectable 10th-place result in their inaugural Bundesliga season and also famously played the spoiler's role in deciding who would win the championship that year. Their first Bundesliga win came in just their second match of the season, with a 2\u20130 victory over [[MSV Duisburg]] at home. While struggling in away matches, Unterhaching remained undefeated at home in nine games before losing 0\u20132 to their stronger neighbours, [[Bayern Munich]]. Prior to this loss, they had earned wins at home in matches against highly favoured teams like [[VfB Stuttgart]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]], beating them 2\u20130 and 1\u20130 respectively. They earned their first away win in the Bundesliga by beating VfB Stuttgart 2\u20130 once again.\n\nOn the final matchday of the season, visiting [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] needed only a draw in Unterhaching to secure their first national title, but instead went down to defeat to the determined home side. Things took a sinister turn for Leverkusen when [[Michael Ballack]] scored an [[own goal]] that put home side ahead in the 20th minute. Their title hopes ended when Haching midfielder [[Markus Oberleitner]] made the score 2\u20130 in the 72nd minute. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich beat [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] 3\u20131 at home and were able to overtake Leverkusen on goal difference to snatch away the title. With a 10th-place result, Unterhaching finished ahead of long-established sides Borussia Dortmund and [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]]. They ended the season with the league's fifth best home record with 10 wins and 5 draws in 17 matches having lost only to Bayern Munich and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]].\n\nGoalkeeper [[Gerhard Tremmel]], defenders [[Alexander Strehmel]] and [[Jochen Seitz]], midfielders [[Markus Oberleitner]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Breitenreiter]] and striker [[Altin Rraklli]] were among the most memorable players of a team that impressed by its discipline. Breitenreiter and Rraklli scored 13 Bundesliga goals between them that season.\n\nHowever, the start of the [[2000\u201301 Bundesliga|2000\u201301 season]] was a nightmare for Unterhaching as they would win only one and draw two of their first eight matches. While the team went undefeated in its next six matches, they were unable to maintain that form and at the mid-season break were only out of the relegation zone on goal difference. The second half of the season was just as dismal, and although they earned wins over local rivals [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], their campaign would end with a 16th-place result and relegation.\n\nAs the season drew to a close Unterhaching was once again in a position to help Bayern Munich win another title. Needing only to hold second-place [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] to a draw in their final match to ensure Bayern's win, Unterhaching held 2\u20130 and 3\u20132 advantages before finally succumbing 3\u20135 to Schalke. Bayern then had to make their own way to the championship with at least a draw against [[Hamburger SV]] which they only narrowly managed on a [[Patrik Andersson]] equalizer (1\u20131) deep into stoppage time.\n\nIronically, in the middle of their poor season, SpVgg Unterhaching would emerge as winners of the last ever [[DFB-Hallenpokal]], an indoor football tournament staged during the winter break of the Bundesliga season from 1987 to 2001.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe club's struggles continued after their relegation to the [[2. Bundesliga]]. Needing an away win in their final match of the season in order to avoid being sent down to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III), they instead went down to a 0\u20133 defeat to [[Karlsruher SC]] and finished in 15th place. They re-bounded the following season, taking the Regionalliga title, and making their way back to second division competition. Subsequently, Haching has delivered poor results in the 2. Bundesliga, narrowly avoiding being relegated again in both 2004 and 2006 before finally dropping into the Regionalliga in 2007, finishing 16th in the table due to [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena]]'s 2\u20131 win against [[FC Augsburg]].\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, the club was never really in contention for a 2. Bundesliga return but did qualify for the new [[3. Liga]]. In its first season in the new, nationwide 3. Liga, the club was close to promotion, but a loss 3\u20134-loss against Carl Zeiss Jena on the 37th matchday earned them a fall from second to fourth place, and a prolonged stay in the third league.\n\nIn 2009\u201310 the club started well, but went down the table during winter. 2008\u201309's successful coach [[Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl]] got replaced by the 1990-world champion [[Klaus Augenthaler]], who led the team to a finish on a secure 11th place.\n\nThe club finished one place above the relegation zone in the 3. Liga in 2013\u201314, coming 17th but was relegated to the tier four [[Regionalliga Bayern]] at the end of the 2014\u201315 season. It qualified for the [[2015\u201316 DFB-Pokal]] where it knocked-out [[FC Ingolstadt 04]] and [[RB Leipzig]] before losing to [[Bayer Leverkusen]] in the third round.<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/alle_spiele/dfb-pokal-2015-2016/ DFB-Pokal 2015/2016 \u00bb Spielplan] {{in lang|de}} Weltfussball.de.

The club's fan base is local in character, although it has developed a small following as one of Germany's \"Kult\" teams.\n\nUntil 1960, Haching played their home matches at the Jahnstra\u00dfe football field and moved then to the Gr\u00fcnauer Allee stadium, which has about 4,000 standing places and where they played before the Sportpark stadium opened in April 1992. The Gr\u00fcnauer Allee stadium is now home ground of the club's reserve squad, Haching II, which is currently playing in the fourth-division Oberliga Bayern.\nThe Gr\u00fcnauer Allee stadium is also the home ground of Fortuna Unterhaching, established in 1992 and playing close to the bottom end of the German league system. During winter, Fortuna Unterhaching shares the artificial football pitch owned by SpVgg Unterhaching.\n\n==Bobsleigh==\n[[Image:Christoph Langen bei der Olympia-Einkleidung Erding 2014 (Martin Rulsch) 02.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Christoph Langen&nbsp;\u2013 SpVgg Unterhaching's most successful sportsperson.]]\n\nIn 1975, local entrepreneur and club sponsor Anton Schrobenhauser (\u2020 1982) founded the bobsleigh department, which he presided over until 1979.

The club is widely known for playing in the first-division [[association football]] league [[Bundesliga]] alongside its more famous cousins, [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], for two seasons between 1999 and 2001, while the club's [[bobsleigh]] department has captured several world and Olympic titles. The football team plays in the [[3. Liga]] (third tier).\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nOriginally part of the gymnastics and sports club TSV Hachinger, SpVgg Unterhaching was established as an independent football club on 1 January 1925. Their first promotion to a higher division came in 1931 and they went on to be promoted to the A-Klasse a year later. However, the club was dissolved in 1933 as it was regarded as \"politically unreliable\" by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and was not re-established until after the end of World War II in 1945 to resume play in the amateur fourth division B-Klasse.\n\n===A rise through the ranks===\n[[File:Unterhaching Performance Chart.png|200px|thumb|Historical chart of Unterhaching league performance]]\nUnterhaching's football team was only an anonymous local amateur team with no significant successes until a climb through league ranks that began in 1976 with promotion from B-Klasse to A-Klasse play. A first-place finished earned the club quick promotion to the Bezirksliga in 1977. Continued good play put the team into the fourth-division [[Landesliga Bayern-S\u00fcd]] in 1979 and then the [[Oberliga Bayern]] (III), the highest amateur division at the time, by 1981.\n\nUnterhaching finished first there in 1983 to earn an appearance in the playoff round for the [[2. Bundesliga]], but failed to advance. They suffered a similar fate in 1988 when they next appeared in the promotion round.\n\nThe club finally emerged from the Oberliga to play in the 2. Bundesliga in 1989, but were quickly relegated after a 20th-place finish. Promoted a second time in 1992, they were once again sent down after a marginally better 18th-place result. Unterhaching next appeared in the second division in 1995 after a first-place finish in the new [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1994\u20132012)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]] (III).\n\n===Unterhaching in Bundesliga===\nWith their return to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1995\u201396 season the club would begin a period that would see them earn their best ever results. They finished 4th that season, then slipped to 6th and 11th-place results in their next two campaigns before securing promotion to the top-flight [[Bundesliga]] after a 2nd-place finish in 1999 season.\n\nThey went on to surprise everyone with a respectable 10th-place result in their inaugural Bundesliga season and also famously played the spoiler's role in deciding who would win the championship that year. Their first Bundesliga win came in just their second match of the season, with a 2\u20130 victory over [[MSV Duisburg]] at home. While struggling in away matches, Unterhaching remained undefeated at home in nine games before losing 0\u20132 to their stronger neighbours, [[Bayern Munich]]. Prior to this loss, they had earned wins at home in matches against highly favoured teams like [[VfB Stuttgart]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]], beating them 2\u20130 and 1\u20130 respectively. They earned their first away win in the Bundesliga by beating VfB Stuttgart 2\u20130 once again.\n\nOn the final matchday of the season, visiting [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] needed only a draw in Unterhaching to secure their first national title, but instead went down to defeat to the determined home side. Things took a sinister turn for Leverkusen when [[Michael Ballack]] scored an [[own goal]] that put home side ahead in the 20th minute. Their title hopes ended when Haching midfielder [[Markus Oberleitner]] made the score 2\u20130 in the 72nd minute. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich beat [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] 3\u20131 at home and were able to overtake Leverkusen on goal difference to snatch away the title. With a 10th-place result, Unterhaching finished ahead of long-established sides Borussia Dortmund and [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]]. They ended the season with the league's fifth best home record with 10 wins and 5 draws in 17 matches having lost only to Bayern Munich and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]].\n\nGoalkeeper [[Gerhard Tremmel]], defenders [[Alexander Strehmel]] and [[Jochen Seitz]], midfielders [[Markus Oberleitner]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Breitenreiter]] and striker [[Altin Rraklli]] were among the most memorable players of a team that impressed by its discipline. Breitenreiter and Rraklli scored 13 Bundesliga goals between them that season.\n\nHowever, the start of the [[2000\u201301 Bundesliga|2000\u201301 season]] was a nightmare for Unterhaching as they would win only one and draw two of their first eight matches. While the team went undefeated in its next six matches, they were unable to maintain that form and at the mid-season break were only out of the relegation zone on goal difference. The second half of the season was just as dismal, and although they earned wins over local rivals [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], their campaign would end with a 16th-place result and relegation.\n\nAs the season drew to a close Unterhaching was once again in a position to help Bayern Munich win another title. Needing only to hold second-place [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] to a draw in their final match to ensure Bayern's win, Unterhaching held 2\u20130 and 3\u20132 advantages before finally succumbing 3\u20135 to Schalke. Bayern then had to make their own way to the championship with at least a draw against [[Hamburger SV]] which they only narrowly managed on a [[Patrik Andersson]] equalizer (1\u20131) deep into stoppage time.\n\nIronically, in the middle of their poor season, SpVgg Unterhaching would emerge as winners of the last ever [[DFB-Hallenpokal]], an indoor football tournament staged during the winter break of the Bundesliga season from 1987 to 2001.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe club's struggles continued after their relegation to the [[2. Bundesliga]]. Needing an away win in their final match of the season in order to avoid being sent down to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III), they instead went down to a 0\u20133 defeat to [[Karlsruher SC]] and finished in 15th place. They re-bounded the following season, taking the Regionalliga title, and making their way back to second division competition. Subsequently, Haching has delivered poor results in the 2. Bundesliga, narrowly avoiding being relegated again in both 2004 and 2006 before finally dropping into the Regionalliga in 2007, finishing 16th in the table due to [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena]]'s 2\u20131 win against [[FC Augsburg]].\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, the club was never really in contention for a 2. Bundesliga return but did qualify for the new [[3. Liga]]. In its first season in the new, nationwide 3. Liga, the club was close to promotion, but a loss 3\u20134-loss against Carl Zeiss Jena on the 37th matchday earned them a fall from second to fourth place, and a prolonged stay in the third league.\n\nIn 2009\u201310 the club started well, but went down the table during winter. 2008\u201309's successful coach [[Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl]] got replaced by the 1990-world champion [[Klaus Augenthaler]], who led the team to a finish on a secure 11th place.\n\nThe club finished one place above the relegation zone in the 3. Liga in 2013\u201314, coming 17th but was relegated to the tier four [[Regionalliga Bayern]] at the end of the 2014\u201315 season. It qualified for the [[2015\u201316 DFB-Pokal]] where it knocked-out [[FC Ingolstadt 04]] and [[RB Leipzig]] before losing to [[Bayer Leverkusen]] in the third round.<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/alle_spiele/dfb-pokal-2015-2016/ DFB-Pokal 2015/2016 \u00bb Spielplan] {{in lang|de}} Weltfussball.de.

The club's fan base is local in character, although it has developed a small following as one of Germany's \"Kult\" teams.\n\nUntil 1960, Haching played their home matches at the Jahnstra\u00dfe football field and moved then to the Gr\u00fcnauer Allee stadium, which has about 4,000 standing places and where they played before the Sportpark stadium opened in April 1992. The Gr\u00fcnauer Allee stadium is now home ground of the club's reserve squad, Haching II, which is currently playing in the fourth-division Oberliga Bayern.\nThe Gr\u00fcnauer Allee stadium is also the home ground of Fortuna Unterhaching, established in 1992 and playing close to the bottom end of the German league system. During winter, Fortuna Unterhaching shares the artificial football pitch owned by SpVgg Unterhaching.\n\n==Bobsleigh==\n[[Image:Christoph Langen bei der Olympia-Einkleidung Erding 2014 (Martin Rulsch) 02.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Christoph Langen&nbsp;\u2013 SpVgg Unterhaching's most successful sportsperson.]]\n\nIn 1975, local entrepreneur and club sponsor Anton Schrobenhauser (\u2020 1982) founded the bobsleigh department, which he presided over until 1979.

His comments on the stories after reading them again for the first time in many years, and his recollection of the events surrounding their creation, amount to the author's only autobiographical comments to his readers.\n\n== Content ==\n\n* Introduction\n* \"The Small Rain\" \u2013 First published in March 1959 in the ''Cornell Writer'', No. 2, pp.&nbsp;14\u201332.\n* \"Mortality and Mercy in Vienna\" (available only in some editions) \u2013 First published in ''Epoch'' (Cornell University), Spring 1959, Vol IX, No. 4, pp.&nbsp;195\u2013213.\n**The story takes its title from ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' Act I Scene 1 Line 44.\n* \"Low-lands\" \u2013 First published in ''New World Writing'', No. 16, Philadelphia: Lippincott, on 16 March 1960, pp.&nbsp;85\u2013108.\n* \"Entropy\" \u2013 First published in the ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' 22, No. 2, in Spring 1960, pp.&nbsp;27\u201392.\n* \"Under the Rose\" \u2013 First published in ''The Noble Savage 3'' in May 1961, pp.&nbsp;233\u2013251.\n* \"The Secret Integration\" \u2013 First published December 26, 1964 in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' 237 No. 45, pp.&nbsp;36\u201337, 39, 42\u201344, 46\u201349, 51.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== \"The Small Rain\" ===\n\nThis was Pynchon's first published story. It centers around Nathan Levine, a lazy Specialist 3/C in the Army stationed at [[New Orleans]] who, along with several of his companions in the battalion are assigned to help with the cleanup at a small island named Creole, which has just been hit by a hurricane. He picks up dead bodies back at the island and after the horrific day of work, he heads back thinking about how to go forward with his life, if at all.\n\n=== \"Low-lands\" ===\nDennis Flange, a lawyer at Wasp and Winsome, Attorneys at Law, calls into the office, telling them he's not coming in. What he's going to do instead is sit at home and drink wine with the neighborhood garbage man, Rocco Squarcione. As they sit and talk, Dennis's wife, Cindy, comes home and is noticeably frustrated by Dennis's afternoon activities. To make matters worse, an old rowdy college \"friend\" of the Flanges, named [[Pig Bodine]], shows up in a stolen MG to see his old friend. At this, Cindy orders the three men off the premises. They all get in Rocco's garbage truck, and head down to the dump, patrolled by an old man named Bolingbroke. There, Dennis waxes philosophical about the dump, thinking of it as an allegory for his life up to that point, and possibly his life in the future. Rocco leaves for home, and Bolingbroke, Bodine, and Dennis turn in for the night, swapping [[nautical fiction|sea stories]] as they doze off. Then, in the middle of the night, Dennis hears a woman's voice calling \"Anglo! Anglo with the golden hair!\". Realizing this is him, Dennis runs off into the dump looking for the woman. Remembering that Bolingbroke said that [[Romani people|gypsies]] were in the area, Dennis wonders if the woman he's looking for is a gypsy. Then he sees her. She is the most beautiful woman he's ever seen... and is also three feet tall. She takes him to her home, tunneling deep into the dump, where she asks him to marry her. He declines, saying he's already married. To this, she starts crying, thinking Dennis won't take her. He then thinks she looks like a child, and that he always wanted children, but Cindy was too busy. He then tells her he'll stay... for a while.\n\n=== \"Entropy\"===\nA weekend-long lease-breaking party devolves into disarray as Meatball Mulligan entertains a revolving door of cronies, servicemen, and jazz musicians while, in a hothouse room, Callisto and his lover Aubade ponder the everpresent condition of enclosed systems creating disorder while trying to nurse a baby bird back to health. The temperature outside remains 37 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day, fueling apocalyptic paranoia in Callisto, who pontificates on the discoveries of the [[Laws of Thermodynamics]], the [[Clausius theorem]], and [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)#Gibbs Entropy Formula|Gibbs]] and [[Boltzmann]], finally deciding that [[entropy]] is an adequate metaphor to apply to American consumerist society, \"a similar tendency from the least to the most probable, from differentiation to sameness, from ordered individuality to a kind of chaos.\"  \nMeanwhile, Meatball juggles his attention between conversations about communication theory and personal relationships, keeping the musicians from smoking marijuana in his place, and the unexpected entrances of three coed philosophy majors lugging gallons of Chianti and, later, five sailors searching for a whorehouse.  As the musicians discuss music theory, the girls and sailors chant drunken songs together, and childish chicanery break out all over, Meatball debates whether to hide in a closet until the party subsides its second wind or try to calm everyone down, one by one.  He decides on the latter, patching up each out-of-control situation until the party tapers down to a din.  Callisto's bird fails to improve under the unchanging conditions, which causes Aubade to smash out a window of the hothouse with her bare hands, displacing the constant temperature of inside and outside and leaving the story in a state of hovering uncertainty of where the next moment will lead.\n\n=== \"Under the Rose\" ===\nTwo English spies, named Porpentine and Goodfellow, are sitting in a cafe in Upper [[Egypt]]. Their mission is to find out what their nemesis, Moldweorp, is up to in the area. Porpentine theorizes his plan is to assassinate the Consul-General, and so they travel to [[Cairo]] to intercept him, along with Goodfellow's new girlfriend, named Victoria Wren, her family, and a man named Bongo-Shaftsbury. During the trip, Bongo-Shaftsbury attempts to attack Victoria's younger sister Mildred, but Porpentine stops him. He then realizes that the man is a spy working for Moldweorp, and Bongo-Shaftsbury is put under guard. Upon reaching Cairo, the two men check into their hotels. The next morning, they head to the opera house where the Consul-General is a guest. Upon reaching their destination, they realize their hunch was correct, and Moldweorp and his spies are swarming the place. After Porpentine foils the assassination attempt, a chase across the streets of Cairo ensues. They reach the [[Sphinx]], and exit their cabs, running across the desert. Porpentine and Goodfellow catch Moldweorp, and they talk a moment. Porpentine tells Goodfellow to return to the cab. He does, and a shot rings out. Turning around, he sees his companion face-down in the hot desert sand, as Moldweorp walks away. Sixteen years later, Goodfellow surveys a motorcade containing [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], upon hearing rumors of a possible assassination. He's joined by his new girlfriend, a barmaid this time, who thinks of him as just a simple-minded Englishman, no good in bed but liberal with his money.\n\n=== \"The Secret Integration\" ===\nGrover Snodd and his friends Tim Santora, Carl Barrington, [[ETAOIN SHRDLU|Etienne Cherdlu]], and Hogan Slothrop, neighborhood kids from Mingeborough, New York, meet up at Grover's house one Saturday afternoon to discuss activities for the weekend.  Their \"Inner [[Military junta|Junta]]\" talk about planning elaborate practical jokes, collecting milk money from schoolkids.  The meeting adjourns and the five of them depart, through a lush section of forest they dub King Yjro's Woods, then down a stream aboard a refurbished flat-bottomed boat they christened the ''S.S. Leak'', to an abandoned manor known as \"The Big House\".\n\nHere they solidify plans to infiltrate and disrupt a [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meeting with smoke bombs and sodium/water explosions when Hogan, an 8-year-old [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] member, gets a call to sit with another member who is alone and afraid.  He and Tim abandon the group and go to the hotel where Mr. Carl McAfee, a Negro musician from Mississippi, was staying.\n\nMr. McAfee eyes the situation with the kids and, chalking it up to a bad joke, sends them away and calls room service for a fifth of whiskey.  Hogan steadfastly claims his seriousness and the kids stay to keep him company.  After failing to shoo them away, Grover calls the hotel and asks to show up with Etienne.  McAfee can't afford to pay for the bottle of whiskey, much less the room he's staying in, and breaks down into screaming and crying in his bed, passing out in-between fits. The police are called in to escort Mr. McAfee out as a vagrant, despite protests from the kids and Hogan's insistence that the man is sick, not a criminal.  The timeline gets flipped here and, after the Junta had successfully completed a few of their practical jokes, talk about Carl Barrington's family moving into the neighborhood had taken over the parents.\n\nIn response to the word \"integration\" being thrown around, Grover, the boy genius, offers the calculus definition.  Later it is realized that the parents were discussing the other meaning for \"integration\", white and black kids in the same schools, was what was really meant.  Carl's family, who is Negro, is a sort of trigger for the gentrification of the area, an easy target, an explanation for the racist remarks made by Tim's mother and reflected around the neighborhood, and gives light to the mockery of Hogan's dispatch to Mr. McAfee's aid.\n\nCarl, although accepted by the boys as a legitimate member of the Junta, could only be related to by grownups as an \"imaginary playmate\", someone who is talked about and reflected through safe White suburban eyes, then left to harmlessly evaporate at day's end.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[Baedeker]]'s guide to Egypt for 1899\n*[[John Buchan#Fiction|John Buchan's spy fiction]]\n*Edmund Wilson's ''[[To the Finland Station]]''\n*Machiavelli's ''[[The Prince]]''\n*[[John le Carr\u00e9]]\n*[[Surrealism]]\n*Regional guide to [[The Berkshire Hills]] (1939), [[American Guide Series]], [[Federal Writers' Project]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://thomaspynchon.com/pynchon-cover-art/slow-learner/ ''Slow Learner'' Cover Art Over Time at ThomasPynchon.com]\n\n{{Thomas Pynchon}}\n\n[[Category:1984 short story collections]]\n[[Category:Short story collections by Thomas Pynchon]]\n[[Category:Little, Brown and Company books]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the 2015 film|Slow Learners}}\n{{for|[[Developmental disorder]]|Learning disability}}\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name         = Slow Learner\n| image        = Image:SlowLearner1stEdition.JPG\n| caption      = First edition\n| author       = [[Thomas Pynchon]]\n| country      = United States\n| language     = English\n| genre        = [[Short stories]]\n| publisher    = [[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]]\n| release_date = 1984\n| media_type   = Print\n| isbn         = 0-316-72442-4\n| dewey        = 813/.54 19\n| congress     = PS3566.Y55 S5 1984\n| oclc         = 10348691\n| preceded_by  = [[Gravity's Rainbow]]\n| followed_by  = [[Vineland]]\n}}\n'''''Slow Learner''''' is the 1984 published collection of five early [[short story|short stories]] by the American novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]], originally published in various sources between 1959 and 1964.\n\nThe book is also notable for its introduction, written by Pynchon.  His comments on the stories after reading them again for the first time in many years, and his recollection of the events surrounding their creation, amount to the author's only autobiographical comments to his readers.\n\n== Content ==\n\n* Introduction\n* \"The Small Rain\" \u2013 First published in March 1959 in the ''Cornell Writer'', No. 2, pp.&nbsp;14\u201332.\n* \"Mortality and Mercy in Vienna\" (available only in some editions) \u2013 First published in ''Epoch'' (Cornell University), Spring 1959, Vol IX, No. 4, pp.&nbsp;195\u2013213.\n**The story takes its title from ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' Act I Scene 1 Line 44.\n* \"Low-lands\" \u2013 First published in ''New World Writing'', No. 16, Philadelphia: Lippincott, on 16 March 1960, pp.&nbsp;85\u2013108.\n* \"Entropy\" \u2013 First published in the ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' 22, No. 2, in Spring 1960, pp.&nbsp;27\u201392.\n* \"Under the Rose\" \u2013 First published in ''The Noble Savage 3'' in May 1961, pp.&nbsp;233\u2013251.\n* \"The Secret Integration\" \u2013 First published December 26, 1964 in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' 237 No. 45, pp.&nbsp;36\u201337, 39, 42\u201344, 46\u201349, 51.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== \"The Small Rain\" ===\n\nThis was Pynchon's first published story. It centers around Nathan Levine, a lazy Specialist 3/C in the Army stationed at [[New Orleans]] who, along with several of his companions in the battalion are assigned to help with the cleanup at a small island named Creole, which has just been hit by a hurricane. He picks up dead bodies back at the island and after the horrific day of work, he heads back thinking about how to go forward with his life, if at all.\n\n=== \"Low-lands\" ===\nDennis Flange, a lawyer at Wasp and Winsome, Attorneys at Law, calls into the office, telling them he's not coming in. What he's going to do instead is sit at home and drink wine with the neighborhood garbage man, Rocco Squarcione. As they sit and talk, Dennis's wife, Cindy, comes home and is noticeably frustrated by Dennis's afternoon activities. To make matters worse, an old rowdy college \"friend\" of the Flanges, named [[Pig Bodine]], shows up in a stolen MG to see his old friend. At this, Cindy orders the three men off the premises. They all get in Rocco's garbage truck, and head down to the dump, patrolled by an old man named Bolingbroke. There, Dennis waxes philosophical about the dump, thinking of it as an allegory for his life up to that point, and possibly his life in the future. Rocco leaves for home, and Bolingbroke, Bodine, and Dennis turn in for the night, swapping [[nautical fiction|sea stories]] as they doze off. Then, in the middle of the night, Dennis hears a woman's voice calling \"Anglo! Anglo with the golden hair!\". Realizing this is him, Dennis runs off into the dump looking for the woman. Remembering that Bolingbroke said that [[Romani people|gypsies]] were in the area, Dennis wonders if the woman he's looking for is a gypsy. Then he sees her. She is the most beautiful woman he's ever seen... and is also three feet tall. She takes him to her home, tunneling deep into the dump, where she asks him to marry her. He declines, saying he's already married. To this, she starts crying, thinking Dennis won't take her. He then thinks she looks like a child, and that he always wanted children, but Cindy was too busy. He then tells her he'll stay... for a while.\n\n=== \"Entropy\"===\nA weekend-long lease-breaking party devolves into disarray as Meatball Mulligan entertains a revolving door of cronies, servicemen, and jazz musicians while, in a hothouse room, Callisto and his lover Aubade ponder the everpresent condition of enclosed systems creating disorder while trying to nurse a baby bird back to health.

{"title_page": "Flute Sonata (Poulenc)", "text_new": "The '''''Sonate pour fl\u00fbte et piano''''' ('''Flute Sonata'''), [[FP (Poulenc)|FP]] 164, by [[Francis Poulenc]], is a three-movement work for [[flute]] and [[piano]],  written in 1957. \n\nThe sonata was commissioned by the American [[Library of Congress]] and is dedicated to the memory of [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], an American patron of chamber music. Poulenc preferred composing for woodwinds above strings. He premiered the piece with the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. The work was an immediate success, and was quickly taken up in the US, Britain and elsewhere and has been recorded many times. Critics have noted Poulenc's characteristic \"trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment\" in the piece. In 1976, thirteen years after Poulenc's death, the composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] made a well-regarded orchestrated version of the work that has also been recorded.\n\nThe flute sonata became one of Poulenc's best-known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire. It has a claim to be the most played of any work for flute and piano.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015). Notes to Nimbus CD NI 5933</ref> In April 1956, when he was still working on the opera, he was approached by [[Harold Spivacke]] of the American [[Library of Congress]] with a request to write a piece for two pianos or alternatively a chamber piece for up to six instruments.<ref>Schmidt (2001), p. 408</ref> Poulenc was too busy to accept, but Spivacke persisted. Poulenc told him, \"Much more at home with wind instruments than strings, I admit I am tempted by this combination\", as he had always preferred winds \u2013 with their similarities to the human voice \u2013 to stringed instruments.{{refn|Poulenc wrote: \"nothing could be further from human breath than the stroke of a bow\". He thought little of his own sonatas for cello and for violin.<ref>Mellers, pp. 160\u2013161</ref>|group=n}} In August he agreed to go ahead.<ref name=ib>Battioni, Isabelle (2000). Notes to Naxos CD 8.553611</ref> The sonata was commissioned in memory of a musical benefactor, [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], to whom Poulenc dedicated the work.<ref name=nimbus/> \n\nPoulenc spent the winter of 1956\u201357 in [[Cannes]], where he composed the sonata between December and March.<ref name=mm> MacDonald, Malcolm (2013). Notes to Opus Arte CD OACD9012D</ref> When he had completed the first two of the three movements, he wrote to his friend [[Pierre Bernac]]:\n{{blockindent|In working on this Flute Sonata I have the feeling of going back a long way, but with a more settled technique. It's a sonata of [[Claude Debussy|Debussyan]] dimensions. It's the French sense of balance [''la mesure fran\u00e7aise'']. Finding the form for your language is the most difficult thing. It's what [[Anton Webern|Webern]] has in the highest degree \u2026 and what [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]] has not yet found.<ref>Nichols, p. 251</ref>|}}\n\nOn 18 June 1957, the public premiere was given at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]] by the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]], for whom it had been written, with the composer at the piano.<ref name=hype>Mawer, Deborah (2001).

Another critic stated that the sonata was \"the best of Poulenc, and even a little better\".<ref name=js>Siegel, Joseph (2000). Notes to 4Tay CD 4019</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe sonata is in three movements, taking a total of 12 minutes in performance.<ref>Poulenc, p. 1</ref> The score was published in France and Britain shortly after the premiere. In 1994 a new edition by Carl B. Schmidt and Patricia Harper was issued, correcting discrepancies and errors in the earlier published score.<ref name=js/> The musicologist [[Malcolm MacDonald (music critic)|Malcolm MacDonald]] writes of the sonata:\n\n{{block indent|The work is infused with Poulenc\u2019s trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment, which are manifested in different ways in each of its three movements. The first \u2026 makes clear the composer\u2019s elegiac intentions; the second is a haunting cantilena for the flute. Very fast and very tricky for the players, the skittish and vivacious \u2026 finale brings the work to a close in cheerful and sardonic style.<ref name=mm/>}}\n\n===''Allegretto malincolico''===\nThe movement starts in {{music|time|2|4}} (\u266a= 82) with an opening four-bar phrase with a descending theme, beginning with a broken [[Triad (music)|triad]] of [[Thirty-second note |demisemiquavers]] around high E and declining to the G above [[C (musical note)#Middle C |middle C]]. The piano's right-hand part interweaves [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[sixteenth note|semiquavers]] over a [[pedal point|pedal]] in the left hand.<ref name=m156>Mellers, p. 156</ref> This is followed by an upward scale by both flute and piano leading to a contrasting theme, also descending.<ref>Rifkin,  pp. 141\u2013142</ref> MacDonald comments that the opening \"makes clear the composer\u2019s elegiac intentions\", and other analysts write of the \"poignancy\" of the principal theme, despite the seemingly vivacious tempo.<ref name=nimbus/><ref name=mm/><ref name=m163>Mellers, p. 163</ref> A counter-theme in F major gives the flute upwardly-leaping arpeggios, before the opening theme returns in A minor. [[Wilfrid Mellers]] comments that the reappearance of the first theme in an unexpected key makes it clear that Poulenc is not following [[sonata form]] but is using \"a subtle ternary structure\".<ref name=m163/> After a slightly faster middle section there is a recapitulation of a kind with, in Mellers's words, \"enharmonic ambiguities that justify the 'malinconico' of the directive\", and:\n\n{{blockindent|Fragments of the first section's airborne melody intermingle with ecstatic spurtings of the middle theme. A coda to the coda is explicitly based on [[blue note|blue]] false relations between major and minor thirds.<ref>Mellers, p. 164</ref>|}}\n\nThe flute part is technically demanding in this movement, with frequent trills and demisemiquaver tonguing.<ref name=hype/>\n\n===''Cantilena: Assez lent''===\nThis movement  (\u266a= 52) is much slower and quieter. In its song-like tune Poulenc acknowledged there were echoes of Sister Constance in ''Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites'' but the effect here is purely lyrical \u2013 an \"infinite melody\" (''m\u00e9lodie infinie'') \u2013 with none of the drama of the opera.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 45</ref> The movement begins with two [[quarter note|quavers]] on the piano, which are echoed by the flute during the course of the next two bars.<ref>Poulenc, p. 10</ref> The smooth [[Scale (music)|scalic]] lines of the opening section are succeeded by contrasting vigorous dotted rhythmic material in the middle section with the flute going up to a top B, before the tranquil opening theme returns to bring the movement to a close.<ref name=hype/>\n\nAsked about the term \"cantilena\", Poulenc replied that it \"is not a fixed form like passacaglia for example, it is a free form \u2026 I could have called it an interlude (\"interm\u00e8de\") or a romance\".<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 46</ref>\n\n===''Presto giocoso''===\nThis movement (\u2669=160\u2013168) is predominantly extrovert and fast; the beat is a strongly marked {{music|time|3|4}}. The shape is roughly that of a rondo with choruses and verses, but Poulenc treats the form freely. In Mellers's phrase, \"The flute flickers, the piano bounces, in a helter skelter gallop\".<ref>Mellers, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The fast music culminates in a long trill on high G, followed by a brief silence from which there comes, unexpectedly, a quotation from the dotted rhythm \"''m\u00e9lancolique''\" theme of the first movement's middle section, in its original key of F sharp minor.<ref name=m165>Mellers, p. 165</ref> The music gathers speed again and the sonata sprints to a double fortissimo finish, \"strictement en mesure sans ralentir\" (\"strictly in time without any slowing down\").<ref>Poulenc, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe finale is sometimes compared to the exuberant finales of Poulenc's early chamber works, particularly the [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|Trio]] (1926), but the Poulenc scholar Claude Car\u00e9 finds more in common between this movement and the ''[[Concert champ\u00eatre]]'' (1927\u201328).<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 48\u201349</ref> The composer is reported to have said that the movement should be played as quickly as possible because \"it isn't any good\" (he probably would have liked more time to work on it)<ref name=nimbus/> but others have found it \"masterly\"<ref name=m165/> and \"a perfect conclusion\".<ref name=nimbus/>\n\n==Later concert performances and recordings==\nPoulenc considered giving the American premiere together with Rampal during a planned US tour, but the tour did not take place and Rampal gave the American premiere in February 1958 with his regular accompanist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]].<ref>Schmidt (2002), p. 464</ref> Poulenc was pleased to accompany other flautists in the sonata. In January 1959 he accompanied [[Gareth Morris]] in the British premiere, in an all-Poulenc programme that included the world premiere of his ''\u00c9l\u00e9gie in memory of Dennis Brain'' for horn and piano.<ref>\"[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/1341c32439144c329b0ff1b9569f02d6?page=35 Third Programme]\", ''Radio Times'', 14 February 1959, p. 31</ref> Later in that year Poulenc played the piano part with [[Maxence Larrieu]] in [[Avignon]], Rampal in Paris and [[Christian Lard\u00e9]] in [[Menton]]. in 2015, the pianist and scholar [[David Owen Norris]] called the sonata \"probably the world's most played piece for flute and piano\".<ref name=bal>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0381qw0 \"Building a Library\"], BBC Radio 3, 14 November 2015.

The difficulty is the entirely pianistic nature of the accompaniment, extremely difficult to translate into orchestral terms. ... Another difficulty is that Francis, though there are things I love in his music, has passages that are strangely clumsy and that I long to rewrite, but of course I can't add or subtract anything and I should only spoil the whole thing \u2026 I have to think all the time of how he would have wanted it to sound.<ref name=lb>Berkeley, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>|}}\nThe musicologist [[Roger Covell]] wrote of Berkeley's orchestration, \"It is hard to imagine the job being done better \u2026 this sonata-concerto has Poulenc's characteristic and attractive mixture of flippancy and tenderness\".<ref>Covell, Roger. \"Classical\", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 May 1986, p. 56</ref> ''[[The Musical Times]]'' commented in 1978 that \"the orchestration does complete justice to the composer.

In its song-like tune Poulenc acknowledged there were echoes of Sister Constance in ''Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites'' but the effect here is purely lyrical \u2013 an \"infinite melody\" (''m\u00e9lodie infinie'') \u2013 with none of the drama of the opera.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 45</ref> The movement begins with two [[quarter note|quavers]] on the piano, which are echoed by the flute during the course of the next two bars.<ref>Poulenc, p. 10</ref> The smooth [[Scale (music)|scalic]] lines of the opening section are succeeded by contrasting vigorous dotted rhythmic material in the middle section with the flute going up up a top B, before the tranquil opening theme returns to bring the movement to a close.<ref name=hype/>\n\nAsked about the term \"cantilena\", Poulenc replied that it \"is not a fixed form like passacaglia for example, it is a free form \u2026 I could have called it an interlude (\"interm\u00e8de\") or a romance\".<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 46</ref>\n\n===''Presto giocoso''===\nThis movement (\u2669=160\u2013168) is predominantly extrovert and fast; the beat is a strongly marked {{music|time|3|4}}. The shape is roughly that of a rondo with choruses and verses, but Poulenc treats the form freely. In Mellers's phrase, \"The flute flickers, the piano bounces, in a helter skelter gallop\".<ref>Mellers, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The fast music culminates in a long trill on high G, followed by a brief silence from which there comes, unexpectedly, a quotation from the dotted rhythm \"''m\u00e9lancolique''\" theme of the first movement's middle section, in its original key of F sharp minor.<ref name=m165>Mellers, p. 165</ref> The music gathers speed again and the sonata sprints to a double fortissimo finish, \"strictement en mesure sans ralentir\" (\"strictly in time without any slowing down\").<ref>Poulenc, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe finale is sometimes compared to the exuberant finales of Poulenc's early chamber works, particularly the [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|Trio]] (1926), but the Poulenc scholar Claude Car\u00e9 finds more in common between this movement and the ''[[Concert champ\u00eatre]]'' (1927\u201328).<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 48\u201349</ref> The composer is reported to have said that the movement should be played as quickly as possible because \"it isn't any good\" (he probably would have liked more time to work on it)<ref name=nimbus/> but others have found it \"masterly\"<ref name=m165/> and \"a perfect conclusion\".<ref name=nimbus/>\n\n==Later concert performances and recordings==\nPoulenc considered giving the American premiere together with Rampal during a planned US tour, but the tour did not take place and Rampal gave the American premiere in February 1958 with his regular accompanist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]].<ref>Schmidt (2002), p. 464</ref> Poulenc was pleased to accompany other flautists in the sonata. In January 1959 he accompanied [[Gareth Morris]] in the British premiere, in an all-Poulenc programme that included the world premiere of his ''\u00c9l\u00e9gie in memory of Dennis Brain'' for horn and piano.<ref>\"[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/1341c32439144c329b0ff1b9569f02d6?page=35 Third Programme]\", ''Radio Times'', 14 February 1959, p. 31</ref> Later in that year Poulenc played the piano part with [[Maxence Larrieu]] in [[Avignon]], Rampal in Paris and [[Christian Lard\u00e9]] in [[Menton]]. in 2015, the pianist and scholar [[David Owen Norris]] called the sonata \"probably the world's most played piece for flute and piano\".<ref name=bal>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0381qw0 \"Building a Library\"], BBC Radio 3, 14 November 2015.

The difficulty is the entirely pianistic nature of the accompaniment, extremely difficult to translate into orchestral terms. ... Another difficulty is that Francis, though there are things I love in his music, has passages that are strangely clumsy and that I long to rewrite, but of course I can't add or subtract anything and I should only spoil the whole thing \u2026 I have to think all the time of how he would have wanted it to sound.<ref name=lb>Berkeley, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>|}}\nThe musicologist [[Roger Covell]] wrote of Berkeley's orchestration, \"It is hard to imagine the job being done better \u2026 this sonata-concerto has Poulenc's characteristic and attractive mixture of flippancy and tenderness\".<ref>Covell, Roger. \"Classical\", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 May 1986, p. 56</ref> ''[[The Musical Times]]'' commented in 1978 that \"the orchestration does complete justice to the composer.
