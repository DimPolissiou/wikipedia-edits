The Chinese Character Dictionary (\u6f22\u5927\u5b57\u5c55) contained \"''bubuida'' (\ubd80\ubdd4\ub2e4)\" or \"''bubuiem'' (\ubd80\ubdd4\uc6c0), ''Dong'' (\u8463)\" in hanja, which meant \"mix\" or \"''bibida''\" in Korean. <ref name=\":0\" />  In the late 19th century the two names were recorded for the recipe being ''bubiban'' (\u634a\u6392 \u98ef) and ''koldongban'' (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef), with the recipe being written in pure Korean. Other various recordings after this include(in Hanja) ''koldongban'' (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef, \u6c68\u8463\u98ef), ''hondonban'' (\u6df7\u6c8c\u98ef), and ''bubiban'' (\u634a\u6392\u98ef) and also ''banyuban'' (\u76e4\u904a\u98ef); them in Hangeul, ''bubiumbap'' (\ubd80\ubdd4\uc6c0\ubc25), ''bubiembap'' (\ubd80\ube44\uc74c\ubc25), ''bubuimbap'' (\ubd80\ubde4\ubc25), ''bubeimbap'' (\ubd80\ube38\ubc25), ''bubuinbap'' (\ubd80\ubdd8\ubc25), and ''bubimbap'' (\ubd80\ube54\ubc25).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Culture ==\nBibimbap is an extensively customizable food with a variety of ingredients that can be used in its creation. It has existed in Korea for centuries and even has a place in society today. It came from early rural Koreans taking leftover vegetables, sometimes having meat, with rice and mixing them in a bowl. This was cheap and didn't require all of the time and space of a traditional meal.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Chung|first1=Kyung Rhan|last2=Yang|first2=Hye-Jeong|last3=Jang|first3=Dai-Ja|last4=Kwon|first4=Dae Young|date=2015|title=Historical and biological aspects of bibimbap, a Korean ethnic food|journal=Journal of Ethnic Foods|volume=2|issue=2|page=74|doi=10.1016/j.jef.2015.05.002|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nBibimbap was originally based in Hanja records under a Chinese name due to the Chinese roots in Korea before separation.There are two separate ancient writings that suggest the original reasoning behind the creation and use of bibimbap. The first one, \"People's Unofficial Story of Jeonju\" (\u5168\u5dde\u91ce\u53f2), tells of Jeonju bibimbap being used in occasions such as parties that included government officials of provincial offices. The second being, \"Lannokgi\" (\u862d\u7da0\u8a18), which told of bibimbap being made by the wives, of farmers, who had no time to prepare meals the traditional way with many side dishes, and instead they were able to throw most of the ingredients in a bowl sometimes adding whatever they happened to be cultivating.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBibimbap had very few ancient records relevant to its usage prior to King Sejong due to the illiterate state of society before then. It is mostly recorded in Chinese texts under many different names.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[division of Korea]] in the 20th century caused a cultural divide in the creation of bibimbap with two types related to both North and South Korea. The most famous regions for traditional bibimbap happen to be Pyongyang for its vegetable bibimbap in the North and Jeonju for its Jeonju Bibimbap.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the late 20th century, ''bibimbap'' started to become widespread in many countries in the West, due to its simplicity, cheap cost, and delicious taste. Many airlines connecting to South Korea via Incheon International Airport began to serve it, and it was accepted more globally as a popular Korean dish.<ref name=\"Jang et al 2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Jang|first1=Dai Ja|last2=Lee|first2=Ae Ja|last3=Kang|first3=Soon-A|last4=Lee|first4=Seung Min|last5=Kwon|first5=Dae Young|year=2016|title=Does siwonhan-mat represent delicious in Korean foods?|journal=Journal of Ethnic Foods|volume=3|issue=2|pages=159\u2013162|doi=10.1016/j.jef.2016.06.002|doi-access=free}}</ref> Bibimbap has also been described as a symbol of the Korean culture to non-Koreans due to Korea becoming more acceptable to foreigners and multicultural traditions.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Shen|first1=Shawn|date=2017|title=The Bibimbap Migration Theory?

The Chinese Character Dictionary (\u6f22\u5927\u5b57\u5c55) contained \"''bubuida'' (\ubd80\ubdd4\ub2e4)\" or \"''bubuiem'' (\ubd80\ubdd4\uc6c0), ''Dong'' (\u8463)\" in hanja, which meant \"mix\" or \"''bibida''\" in Korean. <ref name=\":0\" />  In the late 19th century the two names were recorded for the recipe being ''bubiban'' (\u634a\u6392 \u98ef) and ''koldongban'' (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef), with the recipe being written in pure Korean. Other various recordings after this include(in Hanja) ''koldongban'' (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef, \u6c68\u8463\u98ef), ''hondonban'' (\u6df7\u6c8c\u98ef), and ''bubiban'' (\u634a\u6392\u98ef) and also ''banyuban'' (\u76e4\u904a\u98ef); them in Hangeul, ''bubiumbap'' (\ubd80\ubdd4\uc6c0\ubc25), ''bubiembap'' (\ubd80\ube44\uc74c\ubc25), ''bubuimbap'' (\ubd80\ubde4\ubc25), ''bubeimbap'' (\ubd80\ube38\ubc25), ''bubuinbap'' (\ubd80\ubdd8\ubc25), and ''bubimbap'' (\ubd80\ube54\ubc25).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Culture ==\nBibimbap is an extensively customizable food with a variety of ingredients that can be used in its creation. It has existed in Korea for centuries and even has a place in society today. It came from early rural Koreans taking leftover vegetables, sometimes having meat, with rice and mixing them in a bowl. This was cheap and didn't require all of the time and space of a traditional meal.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Chung|first1=Kyung Rhan|last2=Yang|first2=Hye-Jeong|last3=Jang|first3=Dai-Ja|last4=Kwon|first4=Dae Young|date=2015|title=Historical and biological aspects of bibimbap, a Korean ethnic food|journal=Journal of Ethnic Foods|volume=2|issue=2|page=74|doi=10.1016/j.jef.2015.05.002|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nBibimbap was originally based in Hanja records under a Chinese name due to the Chinese roots in Korea before separation.There are two separate ancient writings that suggest the original reasoning behind the creation and use of bibimbap. The first one, \"People's Unofficial Story of Jeonju\" (\u5168\u5dde\u91ce\u53f2), tells of Jeonju bibimbap being used in occasions such as parties that included government officials of provincial offices. The second being, \"Lannokgi\" (\u862d\u7da0\u8a18), which told of bibimbap being made by the wives, of farmers, who had no time to prepare meals the traditional way with many side dishes, and instead they were able to throw most of the ingredients in a bowl sometimes adding whatever they happened to be cultivating.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBibimbap had very few ancient records relevant to its usage prior to King Sejong due to the illiterate state of society before then. It is mostly recorded in Chinese texts under many different names.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[division of Korea]] in the 20th century caused a cultural divide in the creation of bibimbap with two types related to both North and South Korea. The most famous regions for traditional bibimbap happen to be Pyongyang for its vegetable bibimbap in the North and Jeonju for its Jeonju Bibimbap.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the late 20th century, ''bibimbap'' started to become widespread in many countries in the West, due to its simplicity, cheap cost, and delicious taste. Many airlines connecting to South Korea via Incheon International Airport began to serve it, and it was accepted more globally as a popular Korean dish.<ref name=\"Jang et al 2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Jang|first1=Dai Ja|last2=Lee|first2=Ae Ja|last3=Kang|first3=Soon-A|last4=Lee|first4=Seung Min|last5=Kwon|first5=Dae Young|year=2016|title=Does siwonhan-mat represent delicious in Korean foods?|journal=Journal of Ethnic Foods|volume=3|issue=2|pages=159\u2013162|doi=10.1016/j.jef.2016.06.002|doi-access=free}}</ref> Bibimbap has also been described as a symbol of the Korean culture to non-Koreans due to Korea becoming more acceptable to foreigners and multicultural traditions.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Shen|first1=Shawn|date=2017|title=The Bibimbap Migration Theory?

Furthermore, the ingredients have low calorie content, hence offer a healthy diet. The combination of vegetables, rice, fermented sauces and meat provides adequate fiber, carbohydrates and protein content. By harmonizing together various ingredients, bibimbap emerges as a unique meal that symbolizes the harmony and balance in the Korean culture.<ref name=\"Jang et al 2016\"/>\n\n== Variations ==\n[[Image:Korean cuisine-Jeonju bibimbap-01.jpg|thumb|right|''Jeonju bibimbap'']]\n[[File:North Korean Bibimbap \ube44\ube54\ubc25 (12330376074).jpg|thumb|Bibimbap from [[Pyongyang]]]]\n\n=== Jeonju bibimbap ===\nJeonju is the name of a province in South Korea known for its long standing food preparation style which has been praised and passed down throughout the past thousands of years.

The bowl is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes. Before the rice is placed in the bowl, the bottom of the bowl is coated with [[sesame oil]], making the layer of the rice touching the bowl cook to a crisp, golden brown (\ub204\ub989\uc9c0).
