It was released on April 29, 2011 by [[Island Records]]. Produced during the pregnancy of her twins Emme and Max, ''Love?'' was cited by Lopez as her most personal album to date, taking inspiration from the birth of her twins and her own experiences with love. Recording for the album began in 2009, with an original release date for the project set for January 2010 by [[Epic Records]] to coincide with Lopez's film ''[[The Back-up Plan]]''. However following the lack of success with lead single \"[[Louboutins (song)|Louboutins]]\", Lopez and Epic Records parted ways, leaving the fate of ''Love?'' in uncertainty. In 2010, Lopez signed a new record deal with Island Records, allowing proceedings for the release to be kept. The album includes a mixture of previously recorded material which leaked online in 2009 and 2010 during recording sessions, along with new songs with [[Tricky Stewart]], [[The-Dream]] and [[RedOne]] commissioned by Island Records, primarily a [[dance-pop]]<ref name=\"Markovitz\"/>  album, ''Love?'' also marks a return to Lopez's [[pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] roots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.stylist.co.uk/people/jennifer-lopez-back-to-her-roots |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140726185009/http://m.stylist.co.uk/people/jennifer-lopez-back-to-her-roots |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-07-26 |title=Jennifer Lopez: Back to her Roots - People - Stylist Magazine |publisher=M.stylist.co.uk |accessdate=2014-07-25 }}</ref>\n\nUpon its release, ''Love?'' garnered mixed reviews from music critics. While some were critical of it, others disagreed, praising it as a great dance album. Commercially, ''Love?'' debuted at number five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming her sixth album to peak within the top 10 in the United States, and her highest peak since 2005's ''[[Rebirth (Jennifer Lopez album)|Rebirth]]''. Internationally, ''Love?'' experienced moderate success, peaking within the top 10 in twenty-four different countries and also reaching the top five of several music markets. The album sold 346,000 copies in the United States.\n\nThe album's first single under Island Records is \"[[On the Floor]]\" and features [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]]. It reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped over thirty international charts, while the second and third singles from ''Love?'', being \"[[I'm Into You]]\" featuring rapper [[Lil Wayne]] and \"[[Papi (song)|Papi]]\", both topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]], each becoming moderate hits. ''Love?'' has become her third consecutive album to have all singles reach number one on that chart, earning her a milestone for eleven number ones at the time tying her with [[Katy Perry]] and [[Kristine W]].\n\n== Background ==\n''Love?'' follows the footsteps of her least commercially successful album, ''[[Brave (Jennifer Lopez album)|Brave]]'' (2007), which just missed the top ten of the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], at position 12.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90034494?Jennifer%20Lopez%20goes%20up%20against%20Britney%20Spears%20with%20new%20album |title=Jennifer Lopez goes up against Britney Spears with new album |publisher=Allheadlinenews.com (AHN) / (CNS) |last=Jones |first=Anthony |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707113435/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90034494?Jennifer%20Lopez%20goes%20up%20against%20Britney%20Spears%20with%20new%20album |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Its beginnings date from late 2007 and early 2008, during Lopez's pregnancy with twins Emme and Max.

It was released on April 29, 2011 by [[Island Records]]. Produced during the pregnancy of her twins Emme and Max, ''Love?'' was cited by Lopez as her most personal album to date, taking inspiration from the birth of her twins and her own experiences with love. Recording for the album began in 2009, with an original release date for the project set for January 2010 by [[Epic Records]] to coincide with Lopez's film ''[[The Back-up Plan]]''. However following the lack of success with lead single \"[[Louboutins (song)|Louboutins]]\", Lopez and Epic Records parted ways, leaving the fate of ''Love?'' in uncertainty. In 2010, Lopez signed a new record deal with Island Records, allowing proceedings for the release to be kept. The album includes a mixture of previously recorded material which leaked online in 2009 and 2010 during recording sessions, along with new songs with [[Tricky Stewart]], [[The-Dream]] and [[RedOne]] commissioned by Island Records, primarily a [[dance-pop]]<ref name=\"Markovitz\"/>  album, ''Love?'' also marks a return to Lopez's [[pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] roots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.stylist.co.uk/people/jennifer-lopez-back-to-her-roots |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140726185009/http://m.stylist.co.uk/people/jennifer-lopez-back-to-her-roots |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-07-26 |title=Jennifer Lopez: Back to her Roots - People - Stylist Magazine |publisher=M.stylist.co.uk |accessdate=2014-07-25 }}</ref>\n\nUpon its release, ''Love?'' garnered mixed reviews from music critics. While some were critical of it, others disagreed, praising it as a great dance album. Commercially, ''Love?'' debuted at number five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming her sixth album to peak within the top 10 in the United States, and her highest peak since 2005's ''[[Rebirth (Jennifer Lopez album)|Rebirth]]''. Internationally, ''Love?'' experienced moderate success, peaking within the top 10 in twenty-four different countries and also reaching the top five of several music markets. The album sold 346,000 copies in the United States.\n\nThe album's first single under Island Records is \"[[On the Floor]]\" and features [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]]. It reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped over thirty international charts, while the second and third singles from ''Love?'', being \"[[I'm Into You]]\" featuring rapper [[Lil Wayne]] and \"[[Papi (song)|Papi]]\", both topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]], each becoming moderate hits. ''Love?'' has become her third consecutive album to have all singles reach number one on that chart, earning her a milestone for eleven number ones at the time tying her with [[Katy Perry]] and [[Kristine W]].\n\n== Background ==\n''Love?'' follows the footsteps of her least commercially successful album, ''[[Brave (Jennifer Lopez album)|Brave]]'' (2007), which just missed the top ten of the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], at position 12.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90034494?Jennifer%20Lopez%20goes%20up%20against%20Britney%20Spears%20with%20new%20album |title=Jennifer Lopez goes up against Britney Spears with new album |publisher=Allheadlinenews.com (AHN) / (CNS) |last=Jones |first=Anthony |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707113435/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90034494?Jennifer%20Lopez%20goes%20up%20against%20Britney%20Spears%20with%20new%20album |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Its beginnings date from late 2007 and early 2008, during Lopez's pregnancy with twins Emme and Max.

This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]]. The limestone in the [[Bee Low Limestones|Bee Low]] and Woo Dale limestone formations around Buxton is of unusually high quality, with less than 3% [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] and less than 1% [[chert]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cementkilns.co.uk/cement_kiln_tunstead.html|title=Cement Kilns: Tunstead|website=www.cementkilns.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton.

Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]]. The limestone in the [[Bee Low Limestones|Bee Low]] and Woo Dale limestone formations around Buxton is of unusually high quality, with less than 3% [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] and less than 1% [[chert]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cementkilns.co.uk/cement_kiln_tunstead.html|title=Cement Kilns: Tunstead|website=www.cementkilns.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650.

They were accorded a warm reception by the villagers and were further told by the villagers that they were the first party to have visited the area since World War II. The Assam Rifles team assured the villagers that this virgin land was Indian territory and the people would be protected from enemy aggression. Till then the international border was not clearly demarcated. In 1972, the Demarcation of International Border with Burma was done, with the help of Lisu guides having a full knowledge of the region. During demarcation, cement International Border Pillars (IBP) were erected at regular intervals.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nInitially, the Indo-Burmese border had been drawn based on surveys conducted under the [[McMahon Line|Topographical Survey of British India]] as early as 1912, following the highest ridge from the [[Hkakabo Razi]] (alt. {{convert|5881|m|abbr=on}}; the highest point in Myanmar) at the junction with the Chinese border in the north, to the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh according to a \"combination of ridges, watershed and highest crests\".<ref>[[:File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg]]</ref> Later, during World War II, G.D.L. Millar's diary recalls the escape of a party of 150 European, Indian and Kachin officials and civilians fleeing the advance of the Japanese in May 1942. They went from Putao (Kachin) to Margherita (Assam) via the Chaukan Pass, and followed the valley of the Noa-dihing river. Millar records that over a hundred miles of the Chaukan Pass, \"there was no trace of man\" either Lisu or any other tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.528129|title=Forgotten Frontier(1945)|last=Tyson Geoffrey|date=17 August 2018|website=Archive.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> The border negotiations with China that [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War|led]] to the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], and the intrusion of Chinese troops into the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh, propelled the Government of India to secure its international borders in the [[North-East Frontier Agency|North East region]], defined as per the Topographical Survey of British India. The Assam Rifles Regiments who took control of the border area hired labourers from various tribes, including Lisus, to built the air strip at Vijoynagar. In 1969\u201370, 200 families were settled in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arunachalgovernor.gov.in/pr/pr030410.htm|title=The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh :: Governor visits remote Vijoynagar|website=Arunachalgovernor.gov.in|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> In 2010, the population was estimated at 5500 including Gorkhali Jawan(Ex-Assam Rifles Pensioners and Lisus/Yobin.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Via Myanmar-Ledo Road===\nSome groups of Lisus took the then [[Ledo Road]]. Some of them worked as coal miners under British. (One certificate that originally belonged to one Aphu Lisu is a British coal miner's certificate from 1918, preserved by the Lisu). The certificate bears the mark of the then governor who ruled the region from [[North Lakhimpur|Lakhimpur, Assam]] (the section of Ledo road between Ledo and Shingbwiyang was only opened in 1943. Most of the Lisu who lived in Assam went back to Burma. However, some are still found in the Kharangkhu area of Assam, Kharsang Circle of Arunachal Pradesh. While most have lost their mother tongue, some have preserved the language and culture almost intact.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://changlang.nic.in/changlang.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512100140/http://www.changlang.nic.in/changlang.html#people/ |archive-date=2008-05-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies|author=John McCoy, Timothy Light|publisher=BRILL|pages=915\u20136|year=1986|isbn=90-04-07850-9}}</ref>\n\n===Indian/Lisu issues===\nIn the early 1980s, the Lisu people living in India did not have Indian citizenship as they were considered refugees from Burma ([[Myanmar]]). In 1994, Indian citizenship was granted to them, but not Scheduled Tribe status. This is currently the subject of a claim to the Government.\n\nExcept for the arrival of a fleet of jeeps in the late 1970s, the area has been without roads and vehicles for 4 decades. The area is isolated, hence some describing the people as \"prisoners of geography\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2620/stories/20091009262006400.htm|title=Prisoners of geography|website=Frontline.in|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nLisu were evicted from their villages in 1964 under the command of A.S. Guarya, the late Governor General of Arunachal Pradesh. He settled Indian ex-servicemen in their villages. Those villages still retain their original names. The Lisu were chased out of their villages down to Gandhigram villages and other areas. These villages suffered from floods and lost much of their rice paddies and had to find new ground.\n\nIn fact, [[Namdapha]] was originally declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1972, then a National Park in 1983. The authorities demarcated the southern boundary near Gandhigram village. Since then the Lisus settling in the National Park are considered as \"encroachers\" as per the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbaindia.org/uploaded/Biodiversityindia/Legal/15.%20Wildlife%20(Protection)%20Act,%201972.pdf|title=THE WILDLIFE (PROTECTION) ACT, 1972 (No. 53 of 1972)|date=9 September 1972|website=Nbaindia.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> Between 1976 and 1981, a {{convert|157|km|adj=on}} road was made between Miao and Vijoynagar (MV road) by the Public Works Department following the left bank of the Noa-dihing river through [[Namdapha National Park]] but proved difficult to maintain due to extreme rainfall and frequent landslides.

Each family clan has its own name or surname. The largest families among the tribal clans are Putao Laemae pha (who speak some [[a sub-language of Bai languages|Bai]]), Bya pha, Tung pha, Ngwa Pha(Ngwazah), Naw pha (some of them are descended from [[Anung or Khingphang]] patriclans), Seu pha, Southern Laemae pha or Tsao jia pha (also known as a decedent of Yi tribe people), Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in primitive times. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAfter the Ming Dynasty, most Hua Lisu people had become a people that lived in villages high in the mountains or in mountain valleys. However, those who still lived in the Paoshan plains, standing on the side of the [[Qing Dynasty]], fought against the Kingdom of Ming. The Lisu [[knife ladder]] climbing festival was first held as a memorial event of victory over Ming in 1644 CE. The Lisu people adopted their own traditional dance so called \"che-ngoh-che\" along with the Lisu [[guitar]] which has no bars on the [[fretboard]] from Han Chinese. They also used a musical instrument called [[fulu jewlew]] possibly invented by Yi tribe people. It is a kind of [[flute]] that has about six or seven small [[bamboo]] tubes tied up together to a dried-hollow-[[gourd]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nSongs and dances differ according to the occasion. Weddings, homecomings, harvests, and other ceremonial events all have their corresponding music and dances.\n\nLisu villages are usually built close to water to provide easy access for washing and drinking.<ref name=\"Dessaint 1972\"/>  Their homes are usually built on the ground and have dirt floors and bamboo walls, although an increasing number of the more affluent Lisu are now building houses of wood or even concrete.<ref name=\"Hutheesing 1990\"/>\n\nLisu subsistence was based on paddy fields, mountain rice, fruit and vegetables.  However, they have typically lived in ecologically fragile regions that do not easily support subsistence. They also faced constant upheaval from both physical and social disasters (earthquakes and landslides; wars and governments). Therefore, they have typically been dependent on trade for survival.  This included work as porters and caravan guards. With the introduction of the [[opium]] poppy as a cash crop in the early 19th century, many Lisu populations were able to achieve economic stability.  This lasted for over 100 years, but opium production has all but disappeared in Thailand and China due to interdiction of production. Very few Lisu ever used opium, or its more common derivative [[heroin]], except for medicinal use by the elders to alleviate the pain of [[arthritis]].<ref>Durrenberger 1976</ref>\n\nThe Lisu practiced [[swidden]] (slash-and-burn) agriculture. In conditions of low population density where land can be fallowed for many years, swiddening is an environmentally sustainable form of [[horticulture]]. Despite decades of swiddening by hill tribes such as the Lisu, northern Thailand had a higher proportion of intact forest than any other part of Thailand. However, with road building by the state, logging (some legal, but mostly illegal) by Thai companies,<ref>Fox 2000</ref><ref>Fox et al. 1995</ref> enclosure of land in national parks, and influx of immigrants from the lowlands, swidden fields can not be fallowed, can not re-grow, and swiddening results in large swathes of deforested mountainsides. Under these conditions, Lisu and other swiddeners have been forced to turn to new methods of agriculture to sustain themselves.<ref>McCaskill and Kempe 1997</ref>\n\nPerhaps the best-known subgroup of the Lisu is the Flowery Lisu in Thailand, due to hill tribe tourism.  Lisu women are notable for their brightly colored dress.  They wear a multi-colored knee-length tunics of red, blue, or green with a wide black belt and blue or black pants. Sleeve shoulders and cuffs are decorated with a dense applique of narrow horizontal bands of blue, red and yellow. Men wear baggy pants, usually in bright colors but normally wear a more Western-type of shirt or top.\n\nAround 2002, as cellular phone signals reached deeper and deeper into the valleys of northern Thailand, the Lisu embraced the technology in unanticipated fashion: the Lisu purchased unlimited calling plans and started to sing and improvise to each other over mobile connections. Lisu people who still adhere to animistic beliefs sing the traditional chants of the story tellers, adding their own improvisations.\n\nThe Thai Lisu traditional costume shown here is much different from the main Lisu traditional costume being widely used in Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China and Putao, Danai, Myitkyina, Northern Myanmar.<ref name=\"Hutheesing 1990\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazing-people.com|title=Amazing People \u2013 doco stories & palces|website=Amazing-people.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n===Christianity===\n{{further|Lisu Church}}\nBeginning in the early 20th century, many Lisu people in India and Burma converted to [[Christianity]].

Another missionary who evangelized Lisu people in Myanmar was Thara Saw Ba Thaw (1889\u20131968). It is recorded that James Fraser and Saw Ba Thaw together created the [[Fraser alphabet|Lisu alphabet]] in 1914.<ref>The History of Church of Christ in Myanmar, (75 Jubilee Press, 2008), 11.</ref> There were many other missionaries who brought Christianity to Lisu people. David Fish researches,\n\n{{quote|There were over a hundred missionaries those who committed their life for spreading the Gospel among the Lisu people.

It is logged that by the effort of Morse family and missionaries, many Lisu and Rawang converted to Christianity from animism. Before [[World War II]], the Lisu tribes who live in Yunnan, China and Ah-Jhar river valley, Myanmar, were evangelized by missionaries from Tibetan Lisuland Mission and Lisuland Churches of Christ.

The missionaries created Lisu literature (the written language). With the help of missionaries, the development had occurred for many years. The researcher's father, U Li Ye Jar testified that within 50 years, the development of the Lisu will be at a high speed. Concerning the work of missionaries, David Fish studied,\n\n{{quote|J. Rusell Morse brought many kinds of fruit such as Washington, Orange, Ruby, King-Orange, and Grapefruit.

And the Lisu people had also learned the strategy of Church planting from them.<ref>Fish, David 23.</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, the missionaries learned the situation of Lisu culture, so they could rapidly spread Christianity. They used various kind of methods, including teaching [[hymns]], sending medicines and doctors, helping the needy, and providing the funds for domestic missionaries and evangelists. They also helped in developing their agriculture.\n\nThe Chinese government's Religious Affairs Bureau has proposed considering Christianity as the official religion of the Lisu.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Covell | first = Ralph|date=Spring 2008 | title = To Every Tribe | journal = Christian History & Biography | issue = 98 | pages = 27\u201328 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to OMF International estimates, as of 2008, there are now more than 700,000 Christian Lisu in Yunnan, and 450,000 in Burma.

The Lisu form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by China. In Burma (Myanmar), the Lisu are recognized as one of 135 ethnic groups and an estimated population of 600,000. Lisu live in northern Myanmar; [[Kachin State]] ([[Putao]], [[Myitkyina]], [[Tanai Township|Danai]], [[Waingmaw]], [[Bhamo]]), Shan state, ([[Momeik]]), ([[Namhsan]], [[Lashio]], [[Hopang]], and [[Kokang]]) and southern [[Shan State]] ([[Namsang]], [[Loilem]], [[Mongton]]) and, Sagaing Division ([[Katha Township|Katha]] and [[Hkamti Township|Khamti]]), [[Mandalay Division]] ([[Mogok]] and [[Pyin Oo Lwin]]). Approximately 55,000 live in [[Thailand]], where they are one of the 6 main [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill tribes]]. They mainly inhabit remote mountainous areas.\n\nThe Lisu tribe consists of more than 58 different clans. Each family clan has its own name or surname. The biggest family clans well known among the tribe clans are Laemae pha, Bya pha, Thorne pha, Ngwa Pha, Naw pha(Ngwazah), Seu pha, Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in the primitive time. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names.<ref>Hill Tribes, Lonely Planet, have a map.

In all government records, Lisu are Yobin, and sometimes used alternately. Lisu is one of the minority tribes of Arunachal Pradesh of India. They live mainly in Vijoynagar Circle in 11 villages. Gandhigram (or Shidi in Lisu) is the largest village. Lisus are found in Miao town and Injan village of Kharsang Circle [[Changlang District]]. The Lisu traditionally lived in the Yunnan Province of China and northern Myanmar. There are about 5,000 Lisu people in India.\n\n===Government discovering Lisu===\nOn 7 May 1961, the 7th Assam Rifles expedition team led by Major Sumer Singh entered the Noa-dihing river valley and reached the largest village in the valley, Shidi (now called Gandhigram). They were accorded a warm reception by the villagers and were further told by the villagers that they were the first party to have visited the area since World War II. The Assam Rifles team assured the villagers that this virgin land was Indian territory and the people would be protected from enemy aggression. Till then the international border was not clearly demarcated. In 1972, the Demarcation of International Border with Burma was done, with the help of Lisu guides having a full knowledge of the region. During demarcation, cement International Border Pillars (IBP) were erected at regular intervals.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nInitially, the Indo-Burmese border had been drawn based on surveys conducted under the [[McMahon Line|Topographical Survey of British India]] as early as 1912, following the highest ridge from the [[Hkakabo Razi]] (alt. {{convert|5881|m|abbr=on}}; the highest point in Myanmar) at the junction with the Chinese border in the north, to the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh according to a \"combination of ridges, watershed and highest crests\".<ref>[[:File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg]]</ref> Later, during World War II, G.D.L. Millar's diary recalls the escape of a party of 150 European, Indian and Kachin officials and civilians fleeing the advance of the Japanese in May 1942. They went from Putao (Kachin) to Margherita (Assam) via the Chaukan Pass, and followed the valley of the Noa-dihing river. Millar records that over a hundred miles of the Chaukan Pass, \"there was no trace of man\" either Lisu or any other tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.528129|title=Forgotten Frontier(1945)|last=Tyson Geoffrey|date=17 August 2018|website=Archive.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> The border negotiations with China that [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War|led]] to the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], and the intrusion of Chinese troops into the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh, propelled the Government of India to secure its international borders in the [[North-East Frontier Agency|North East region]], defined as per the Topographical Survey of British India. The Assam Rifles Regiments who took control of the border area hired labourers from various tribes, including Lisus, to built the air strip at Vijoynagar.

Some of them worked as coal miners under British. (One certificate that originally belonged to one Aphu Lisu is a British coal miner's certificate from 1918, preserved by the Lisu). The certificate bears the mark of the then governor who ruled the region from [[North Lakhimpur|Lakhimpur, Assam]] (the section of Ledo road between Ledo and Shingbwiyang was only opened in 1943. Most of the Lisu who lived in Assam went back to Burma. However, some are still found in the Kharangkhu area of Assam, Kharsang Circle of Arunachal Pradesh. While most have lost their mother tongue, some have preserved the language and culture almost intact.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://changlang.nic.in/changlang.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512100140/http://www.changlang.nic.in/changlang.html#people/ |archive-date=2008-05-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies|author=John McCoy, Timothy Light|publisher=BRILL|pages=915\u20136|year=1986|isbn=90-04-07850-9}}</ref>\n\n===Indian/Lisu issues===\nIn the early 1980s, the Lisu people living in India did not have Indian citizenship as they were considered refugees from Burma ([[Myanmar]]). In 1994, Indian citizenship was granted to them, but not Scheduled Tribe status. This is currently the subject of a claim to the Government.\n\nExcept for the arrival of a fleet of jeeps in the late 1970s, the area has been without roads and vehicles for 4 decades. The area is isolated, hence some describing the people as \"prisoners of geography\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2620/stories/20091009262006400.htm|title=Prisoners of geography|website=Frontline.in|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nLisu were evicted from their villages in 1964 under the command of A.S. Guarya, the late Governor General of Arunachal Pradesh. He settled Indian ex-servicemen in their villages. Those villages still retain their original names. The Lisu were chased out of their villages down to Gandhigram villages and other areas. These villages suffered from floods and lost much of their rice paddies and had to find new ground.\n\nIn fact, [[Namdapha]] was originally declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1972, then a National Park in 1983. The authorities demarcated the southern boundary near Gandhigram village. Since then the Lisus settling in the National Park are considered as \"encroachers\" as per the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbaindia.org/uploaded/Biodiversityindia/Legal/15.%20Wildlife%20(Protection)%20Act,%201972.pdf|title=THE WILDLIFE (PROTECTION) ACT, 1972 (No. 53 of 1972)|date=9 September 1972|website=Nbaindia.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> Between 1976 and 1981, a {{convert|157|km|adj=on}} road was made between Miao and Vijoynagar (MV road) by the Public Works Department following the left bank of the Noa-dihing river through [[Namdapha National Park]] but proved difficult to maintain due to extreme rainfall and frequent landslides.

Each family clan has its own name or surname. The largest families among the tribal clans are Putao Laemae pha (who speak some [[a sub-language of Bai languages|Bai]]), Bya pha, Tung pha, Ngwa Pha(Ngwazah), Naw pha (some of them are descended from [[Anung or Khingphang]] patriclans), Seu pha, Southern Laemae pha or Tsao jia pha (also known as a decedent of Yi tribe people), Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in primitive times. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAfter the Ming Dynasty, most Hua Lisu people had become a people that lived in villages high in the mountains or in mountain valleys. However, those who still lived in the Paoshan plains, standing on the side of the [[Qing Dynasty]], fought against the Kingdom of Ming. The Lisu [[knife ladder]] climbing festival was first held as a memorial event of victory over Ming in 1644 CE. The Lisu people adopted their own traditional dance so called \"che-ngoh-che\" along with the Lisu [[guitar]] which has no bars on the [[fretboard]] from Han Chinese. They also used a musical instrument called [[fulu jewlew]] possibly invented by Yi tribe people. It is a kind of [[flute]] that has about six or seven small [[bamboo]] tubes tied up together to a dried-hollow-[[gourd]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nSongs and dances differ according to the occasion. Weddings, homecomings, harvests, and other ceremonial events all have their corresponding music and dances.\n\nLisu villages are usually built close to water to provide easy access for washing and drinking.<ref name=\"Dessaint 1972\"/>  Their homes are usually built on the ground and have dirt floors and bamboo walls, although an increasing number of the more affluent Lisu are now building houses of wood or even concrete.<ref name=\"Hutheesing 1990\"/>\n\nLisu subsistence was based on paddy fields, mountain rice, fruit and vegetables.  However, they have typically lived in ecologically fragile regions that do not easily support subsistence. They also faced constant upheaval from both physical and social disasters (earthquakes and landslides; wars and governments). Therefore, they have typically been dependent on trade for survival.  This included work as porters and caravan guards. With the introduction of the [[opium]] poppy as a cash crop in the early 19th century, many Lisu populations were able to achieve economic stability.  This lasted for over 100 years, but opium production has all but disappeared in Thailand and China due to interdiction of production. Very few Lisu ever used opium, or its more common derivative [[heroin]], except for medicinal use by the elders to alleviate the pain of [[arthritis]].<ref>Durrenberger 1976</ref>\n\nThe Lisu practiced [[swidden]] (slash-and-burn) agriculture. In conditions of low population density where land can be fallowed for many years, swiddening is an environmentally sustainable form of [[horticulture]]. Despite decades of swiddening by hill tribes such as the Lisu, northern Thailand had a higher proportion of intact forest than any other part of Thailand. However, with road building by the state, logging (some legal, but mostly illegal) by Thai companies,<ref>Fox 2000</ref><ref>Fox et al. 1995</ref> enclosure of land in national parks, and influx of immigrants from the lowlands, swidden fields can not be fallowed, can not re-grow, and swiddening results in large swathes of deforested mountainsides. Under these conditions, Lisu and other swiddeners have been forced to turn to new methods of agriculture to sustain themselves.<ref>McCaskill and Kempe 1997</ref>\n\nPerhaps the best-known subgroup of the Lisu is the Flowery Lisu in Thailand, due to hill tribe tourism.  Lisu women are notable for their brightly colored dress.  They wear a multi-colored knee-length tunics of red, blue, or green with a wide black belt and blue or black pants. Sleeve shoulders and cuffs are decorated with a dense applique of narrow horizontal bands of blue, red and yellow. Men wear baggy pants, usually in bright colors but normally wear a more Western-type of shirt or top.\n\nAround 2002, as cellular phone signals reached deeper and deeper into the valleys of northern Thailand, the Lisu embraced the technology in unanticipated fashion: the Lisu purchased unlimited calling plans and started to sing and improvise to each other over mobile connections. Lisu people who still adhere to animistic beliefs sing the traditional chants of the story tellers, adding their own improvisations.\n\nThe Thai Lisu traditional costume shown here is much different from the main Lisu traditional costume being widely used in Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China and Putao, Danai, Myitkyina, Northern Myanmar.<ref name=\"Hutheesing 1990\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazing-people.com|title=Amazing People \u2013 doco stories & palces|website=Amazing-people.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n===Christianity===\n{{further|Lisu Church}}\nBeginning in the early 20th century, many Lisu people in India and Burma converted to [[Christianity]].

It is logged that by the effort of Morse family and missionaries, many Lisu and Rawang converted to Christianity from animism. Before [[World War II]], the Lisu tribes who live in Yunnan, China and Ah-Jhar river valley, Myanmar, were evangelized by missionaries from Tibetan Lisuland Mission and Lisuland Churches of Christ.

And the Lisu people had also learned the strategy of Church planting from them.<ref>Fish, David 23.</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, the missionaries learned the situation of Lisu culture, so they could rapidly spread Christianity. They used various kind of methods, including teaching [[hymns]], sending medicines and doctors, helping the needy, and providing the funds for domestic missionaries and evangelists. They also helped in developing their agriculture.\n\nThe Chinese government's Religious Affairs Bureau has proposed considering Christianity as the official religion of the Lisu.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Covell | first = Ralph|date=Spring 2008 | title = To Every Tribe | journal = Christian History & Biography | issue = 98 | pages = 27\u201328 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to OMF International estimates, as of 2008, there are now more than 700,000 Christian Lisu in Yunnan, and 450,000 in Burma. Only the Lisu of Thailand have remained unchanged by Christian influences. Christianity is now gradually becoming the dominant religion among the Lisu people.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lisu of China | work= OMF International | url= http://www.omf.org/omf/us/peoples_and_places/people_groups/lisu_of_china | accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref>OMF International (2007), p. 1-2</ref>\n\n===Animism/shamanism/ancestor worship===\nBefore Christianity was introduced to Lisu people, they were animists. Archibald Rose points that the religion of the Lisus appears to be a simple form of animism or nat-worship, sacrifices being offered to the spirits of the mountains.<ref>Archibald Rose and J. Goggin Brown, Lisu (Yawyin), Tribes of the Burma-China Frontier in ''Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' (No Place: The Baptists Mission Press, 1910), 265.</ref> Most important rituals are performed by [[shamans]]. The main Lisu festival corresponds to [[Chinese New Year]] and is celebrated with music, feasting and drinking, as are weddings; people wear large amounts of silver jewelry and wear their best clothes at these times as a means of displaying their success in the previous agricultural year. In each traditional village there is a [[sacred grove]] at the top of the village, where the sky spirit or, in China, the Old Grandfather Spirit, are propitiated with [[Sacrificial|offerings]]; each house has an ancestor [[altar]] at the back of the house.<ref>Durrenberger 1989</ref><ref>Bradley (1999), p. 89</ref><ref>Klein-Hutheesing 1990</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{further|Lisu language}}\nLinguistically, the Lisu belong to the [[Yi language|Yi]] or Nuosu branch of the Sino-Tibetan family.<ref>Bradley 2008</ref>\n\nThere are two scripts in use and the Chinese Department of Minorities publishes literature in both. The oldest and most widely used one is the [[Fraser alphabet]] developed about 1920 by [[James O. Fraser]] and the ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] evangelist Ba Thaw. The second script was developed by the Chinese government and is based on [[pinyin]].\n\nFraser's script for the Lisu language was used to prepare the first published works in Lisu which were a [[catechism]], portions of [[Bible|scripture]], and eventually, with much help from his colleagues, a complete [[New Testament]] in 1936. In 1992, the Chinese government officially recognized the Fraser alphabet as the official script of the Lisu language.<ref>{{cite web | title=Omniglot writing systems & languages of the world | work= Fraser alphabet| url= http://www.omniglot.com/writing/fraser.htm | accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>\n\nOnly a small portion of Lisu are actually able to read or write the script,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} with most learning to read and write the local language (Chinese, Thai, Burmese) through primary education.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Art of Not Being Governed]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | first = David | last = Bradley | authorlink =  |date=November 1999 | title = Hill Tribes Phrasebook | publisher = Lonely Planet  | location = | isbn = 0-86442-635-6}}\n* {{cite book | first = David | last = Bradley | year = 2008 | title = Southern Lisu Dictionary | publisher = STEDT | isbn = 978-0-944613-43-6}}\n* Bradley, David, 1997.
