The railroad is co-owned by [[KBN Incorporated]] and [[Independent Locomotive Service]] and is headquartered in [[Crookston, Minnesota]].\n\nAs of 2006, the Minnesota Northern Railroad employed 11 people and handled approximately 11,000 carloads per year. The primary commodities hauled included [[cereal|grain]], [[seed]]s, [[sugar]] and sugar by-products, [[coal]], [[fodder|animal feeds]], and [[fertilizer]]s.\n\nThe Minnesota Northern Railroad interchanges with the [[BNSF Railway]], the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], and the [[Northern Plains Railroad]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Minnesota Northern Railroad was created in December 1996 when the railroad\u2019s former owner, [[RailAmerica]], purchased {{convert|204|mi|km}} of track from the newly created [[Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway]]. Also included in the sale were {{convert|64|mi|km}} of [[trackage rights]] on the BNSF's Grand Forks Subdivision from [[Crookston, Minnesota]] to [[Erskine, Minnesota]] and the Canadian Pacific's Detroit Lakes Subdivision from [[Erskine, Minnesota]] to [[Thief River Falls, Minnesota]].\n\nThe {{convert|204|mi|km}} of track initially sold to the Minnesota Northern Railroad consisted of:\n* A {{convert|45|mi|km|adj=on}} portion of the P Line Subdivision from [[Perley, Minnesota]] to [[Crookston, Minnesota]]\n* The {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=on}} Fertile Subdivision from [[Crookston, Minnesota]] to [[Fertile, Minnesota]]\n* The {{convert|32|mi|km|adj=on}} Ada Subdivision from [[Crookston, Minnesota]] to [[Ada, Minnesota]]\n* The {{convert|92|mi|km|adj=on}} Warroad Subdivision from [[St. Hilaire, Minnesota]] to [[Warroad, Minnesota]]\n* A {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} spur of the Grand Forks Subdivision from [[Tilden Junction, Minnesota]] to [[Red Lake Falls, Minnesota]].\n\nShortly after the Minnesota Northern Railroad acquired its track, it abandoned the dilapidated Fertile Subdivision and most of the spur from Tilden Junction to Red Lake Falls. In addition, it acquired approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} of [[trackage rights]] over the [[BNSF Railway]] near [[Erskine, Minnesota]]. Later abandonments would include the portion of the Ada Subdivision from [[Beltrami, Minnesota]] to [[Ada, Minnesota]], the portion of the P Line Subdivision from [[Shelly, Minnesota]] to [[Perley, Minnesota]], and the portion of the Warroad Subdivision from [[Roseau, Minnesota]] to [[Warroad, Minnesota]].\n\nPrior to coming under the control of the [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway]], the {{convert|204|mi|km}} of track initially purchased by the Minnesota Northern Railroad belonged to the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]]. Before being owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, the P Line, Ada, and Warroad Subdivisions were owned by the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]. The Fertile Subdivision and spur from Tilden Junction to Red Lake Falls, meanwhile, had been owned by the [[Northern Pacific Railway]].\n\nThe portion of the Fertile Subdivision sold to the Minnesota Northern Railroad was once a part of the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific Railway\u2019s]] {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on}} mainline from [[Hawley, Minnesota]] to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].

The railroad is co-owned by [[KBN Incorporated]] and [[Independent Locomotive Service]] and is headquartered in [[Crookston, Minnesota]].\n\nAs of 2006, the Minnesota Northern Railroad employed 11 people and handled approximately 11,000 carloads per year. The primary commodities hauled included [[cereal|grain]], [[seed]]s, [[sugar]] and sugar by-products, [[coal]], [[fodder|animal feeds]], and [[fertilizer]]s.\n\nThe Minnesota Northern Railroad interchanges with the [[BNSF Railway]], the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], and the [[Northern Plains Railroad]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Minnesota Northern Railroad was created in December 1996 when the railroad\u2019s former owner, [[RailAmerica]], purchased {{convert|204|mi|km}} of track from the newly created [[Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway]]. Also included in the sale were {{convert|64|mi|km}} of [[trackage rights]] on the BNSF's Grand Forks Subdivision from [[Crookston, Minnesota]] to [[Erskine, Minnesota]] and the Canadian Pacific's Detroit Lakes Subdivision from [[Erskine, Minnesota]] to [[Thief River Falls, Minnesota]].\n\nThe {{convert|204|mi|km}} of track initially sold to the Minnesota Northern Railroad consisted of:\n* A {{convert|45|mi|km|adj=on}} portion of the P Line Subdivision from [[Perley, Minnesota]] to [[Crookston, Minnesota]]\n* The {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=on}} Fertile Subdivision from [[Crookston, Minnesota]] to [[Fertile, Minnesota]]\n* The {{convert|32|mi|km|adj=on}} Ada Subdivision from [[Crookston, Minnesota]] to [[Ada, Minnesota]]\n* The {{convert|92|mi|km|adj=on}} Warroad Subdivision from [[St. Hilaire, Minnesota]] to [[Warroad, Minnesota]]\n* A {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} spur of the Grand Forks Subdivision from [[Tilden Junction, Minnesota]] to [[Red Lake Falls, Minnesota]].\n\nShortly after the Minnesota Northern Railroad acquired its track, it abandoned the dilapidated Fertile Subdivision and most of the spur from Tilden Junction to Red Lake Falls. In addition, it acquired approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} of [[trackage rights]] over the [[BNSF Railway]] near [[Erskine, Minnesota]]. Later abandonments would include the portion of the Ada Subdivision from [[Beltrami, Minnesota]] to [[Ada, Minnesota]], the portion of the P Line Subdivision from [[Shelly, Minnesota]] to [[Perley, Minnesota]], and the portion of the Warroad Subdivision from [[Roseau, Minnesota]] to [[Warroad, Minnesota]].\n\nPrior to coming under the control of the [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway]], the {{convert|204|mi|km}} of track initially purchased by the Minnesota Northern Railroad belonged to the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]]. Before being owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, the P Line, Ada, and Warroad Subdivisions were owned by the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]. The Fertile Subdivision and spur from Tilden Junction to Red Lake Falls, meanwhile, had been owned by the [[Northern Pacific Railway]].\n\nThe portion of the Fertile Subdivision sold to the Minnesota Northern Railroad was once a part of the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific Railway\u2019s]] {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on}} mainline from [[Hawley, Minnesota]] to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. Though the line was an important route for passenger and freight trains to and from Winnipeg in its heyday, currently only a few portions have been spared from abandonment.

The federal government set up the Minnesota Territory in the remaining territory, effective 3 March 1849. The newly organized territorial legislature created nine counties across the territory in October of that year. One of those original counties, [[Kittson County, Minnesota|Pembina]], had its lower portion partitioned in 1858 by the newly organized Minnesota State legislature to create [[Polk County, Minnesota|Polk County]]. On 24 December 1896, the legislature partitioned the northern portion of Polk to create [[Red Lake County, Minnesota|Red Lake County]]. Then on 23 November 1910,<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota Place Names|url=http://mnplaces.mnhs.org/upham/county.cfm|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref> the northern part of Red Lake was sectioned off to create Pennington County, the penultimate Minnesota county to be created (followed by [[Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota|Lake of the Woods]] in 1922). The county was named for Edmund Pennington (1848-1926), a longtime Minnesota railroad executive, who was serving as president of the Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Sault Ste. Marie Railway when the county was formed. [[Thief River Falls, Minnesota|Thief River Falls]], the area's major settlement (platted in 1887), was specified as the county seat.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ShcLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA406#v=onepage&q&f=false Upham, Warren.

The federal government set up the Minnesota Territory in the remaining territory, effective 3 March 1849. The newly organized territorial legislature created nine counties across the territory in October of that year. One of those original counties, [[Kittson County, Minnesota|Pembina]], had its lower portion partitioned in 1858 by the newly organized Minnesota State legislature to create [[Polk County, Minnesota|Polk County]]. On 24 December 1896, the legislature partitioned the northern portion of Polk to create [[Red Lake County, Minnesota|Red Lake County]]. Then on 23 November 1910,<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota Place Names|url=http://mnplaces.mnhs.org/upham/county.cfm|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref> the northern part of Red Lake was sectioned off to create Pennington County, the penultimate Minnesota county to be created (followed by [[Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota|Lake of the Woods]] in 1922).

It is a part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Diocese of Pittsburgh]] and is administered and partially staffed by the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n[[File:Bishop Boyle Saint Patrick Church stained glass cropped.jpg|thumbnail|left|Bishop Boyle]]\nIn the 1920s, [[Bishop]] [[Hugh Charles Boyle]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Diocese of Pittsburgh]] started a program to expand diocesan involvement in education beyond the existing [[parish school]]s founded by the predominantly Catholic immigrant population of the city. Boyle invited the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]] (more commonly known as the ''Christian Brothers'') to found an all-male [[secondary school]] in [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]], the academic district of Pittsburgh. The first [[freshman]] class entered in 1927, and Central Catholic's success allowed Boyle to expand on the diocesan network of boys' schools with [[North Catholic High School|North Catholic]], [[Serra Catholic High School|Serra Catholic]], and [[South Hills Catholic High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.centralcatholichs.com/page.cfm?p=507|website=Central Catholic High School|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the school originally took students only from the central neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, the decline of regional equivalents such as North Catholic and South Catholic, following both schools' gradual switch to [[coeducation]], eventually attracted students from a wider geographic and socioeconomic range. Students attend from neighborhoods including [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield]] and [[Squirrel Hill (Pittsburgh)|Squirrel Hill]], to suburban communities such as [[Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania|Cranberry]], [[Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania|Jefferson Hills]], and [[Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania|Fox Chapel]]. The diocese also opened a sister school, [[Oakland Catholic High School|Oakland Catholic]], also in the Oakland area.\n\n==Academics==\nCentral Catholic's academic courses are divided into five levels:\n* Regular (Level 1; 4.0 scale),\n* Intermediate (Level 2; 4.4 scale),\n* Advanced (Level 3; 4.8 scale),\n* Honors (Level 4; 5.4 scale),\n* [[Advanced Placement]] (Level 5; 6.0 scale).\n[[File:Central-Catholic-High-School3.png|thumbnail|left|Central Catholic High School | Fatih, Scholarship, Service]]\nClass rank is based upon [[GPA]] weighted for level.

It is a part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Diocese of Pittsburgh]] and is administered and partially staffed by the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n[[File:Bishop Boyle Saint Patrick Church stained glass cropped.jpg|thumbnail|left|Bishop Boyle]]\nIn the 1920s, [[Bishop]] [[Hugh Charles Boyle]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Diocese of Pittsburgh]] started a program to expand diocesan involvement in education beyond the existing [[parish school]]s founded by the predominantly Catholic immigrant population of the city. Boyle invited the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]] (more commonly known as the ''Christian Brothers'') to found an all-male [[secondary school]] in [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]], the academic district of Pittsburgh. The first [[freshman]] class entered in 1927, and Central Catholic's success allowed Boyle to expand on the diocesan network of boys' schools with [[North Catholic High School|North Catholic]], [[Serra Catholic High School|Serra Catholic]], and [[South Hills Catholic High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.centralcatholichs.com/page.cfm?p=507|website=Central Catholic High School|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the school originally took students only from the central neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, the decline of regional equivalents such as North Catholic and South Catholic, following both schools' gradual switch to [[coeducation]], eventually attracted students from a wider geographic and socioeconomic range. Students attend from neighborhoods including [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield]] and [[Squirrel Hill (Pittsburgh)|Squirrel Hill]], to suburban communities such as [[Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania|Cranberry]], [[Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania|Jefferson Hills]], and [[Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania|Fox Chapel]]. The diocese also opened a sister school, [[Oakland Catholic High School|Oakland Catholic]], also in the Oakland area.\n\n==Academics==\nCentral Catholic's academic courses are divided into five levels:\n* Regular (Level 1; 4.0 scale),\n* Intermediate (Level 2; 4.4 scale),\n* Advanced (Level 3; 4.8 scale),\n* Honors (Level 4; 5.4 scale),\n* [[Advanced Placement]] (Level 5; 6.0 scale).\n[[File:Central-Catholic-High-School3.png|thumbnail|left|Central Catholic High School | Fatih, Scholarship, Service]]\nClass rank is based upon [[GPA]] weighted for level.

These designations have been applied to most [[United States|US]] military satellites since 1984, and replaced the earlier [[OPS (satellite)|OPS]] designation. It is comparable to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/[[Russia]]n [[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]] designation.\n{{As of|December 2018}}, USA designations have been assigned to 290 space missions. Note that there is not always a one-to-one mapping between launch vehicles and mission spacecraft. This can occasionally result in gaps when maintaining records that incorrectly make that assumption, such as the \"missing\" entries for USA-163 (which are, symmetrically, contemporary with confusion over \"splitting\" spacecraft tracks).<ref name=\"USA-163\">{{cite web |url=http://www.satobs.org/seesat/Jan-2002/0169.html |title=SeeSat-L - Milstar 5 on OIG |publisher=[[SeeSat-L]] |date=16 January 2002 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==List==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
