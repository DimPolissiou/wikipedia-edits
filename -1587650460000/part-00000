They advertise for [[Client (prostitution)|clients]] through the Internet and local classifieds. Most popular mainstream newspapers will carry such classifieds with brothel guides as an insert within [[Hong Kong Jockey Club#Racing activities|racing]] form guides.

margin:0 auto; padding:0 10px;\">\nTo understand the social bearings of domestic servitude as it obtains in Hong Kong, it must be observed that although the Chinese residents of Hong Kong are under British rule and live in close proximity to English social life, there has always been an impassable gulf between respectable English and Chinese society in Hong Kong. The two forms of social life have exercised a certain influence upon each other, but the result now visible is, that while Chinese social life has remained exactly what it is on the mainland of China, the social life of many foreigners in Hong Kong has comparatively degenerated, and not only accommodated itself in certain respects to habits peculiar to the system of \u2022patriarchalism, but caused a certain disrespectable but small class of Chinese to enter into a social alliance with foreigners, which, while detaching them from the restraining influence of the custom and public opinion of Chinese society, left them uninfluenced by the moral powers of foreign civilisation.{{sfn|Great Britain Parliament|1882|p=54}}\n\nThis exceptional class of Chinese residents here in Hong Kong consists principally of the women known in Hong Kong by the popular nickname \"ham-shui-mui\" (lit. salt water girls), applied to these members of the so-called Tan-ka or boat population, the Pariahs of Cantonese society. These Tan-ka people of the Canton river are the descendants of a tribe of aborigines pushed by advancing Chinese civilisation to live on boats on the Canton river, being for centuries forbidden by law to live on shore. The Emperor Yung Ching (A.D. 1730) allowed them to settle in villages in the immediate proximity of the river, but they were left by him, and remain to the present day excluded from competition for official honours, whilst custom forbids them to intermarry with the rest of the people. These Tan-ka people were the secret but trusty allies of foreigners from the time of the East India Company to the present day. They furnished pilots and supplies of provisions to British men-of-war and troop ships when doing so was by the Chinese Government declared treason, unsparingly visited with capital punishment. They invaded Hong Kong the moment the Colony was opened, and have ever since maintained here a monopoly, so to say, of the supply of Chinese pilots and ships' crews, of the fish trade, the cattle trade, and especially of the trade in women for the supply of foreigners and of brothels patronised by foreigners. Almost every so-called \"protected woman,\" i.e. kept mistress of foreigners here, belongs to this Tan-ka tribe, looked down upon and kept at a distance by all the other Chinese classes. It is among these Tan-ka women, and especially under the protection of those \"protected '' T;in-ka women, that private prostitution and the sale of girls for purposes of concubinage flourishes, being looked upon by them as their legitimate profession. Consequently, almost every \"protected woman '' keeps a nursery of purchased children or a few servant girls who are being reared with a view to their eventual disposal, according to their personal qualifications, either among foreigners here as kept women, or among Chinese residents as their concubines, or to be sold for export to Singapore, San Francisco, or Australia. Those protected women, moreover, generally act as protectors each to a few other Tan-ka women who live by sly prostitution. The latter, again, used to be preyed upon\u2014till quite recently His Excellency Governor Hcnnessy stopped this fiendish practice\u2014by informers paid with Government money, who would first debauch such women and then turn round against them charging them before the magistrate as keepers of unlicensed brothels, in which case a heavy fine would be inflicted, to pay which these women used to sell their own children, or sell themselves into bondage worse than slavery, to the keepers of the brothels licensed by Government. Whenever a sly brothel was broken up these keepers would crowd the sheriff's office of the police court or the visiting room to the Government Lock Hospital to drive their heartless bargains, which were invariably enforced with the weighty support of the Inspectors of brothels appointed by Government under the Contagious Diseases Ordinance. The more this Ordinance was enforced the more of this buying and selling of human flesh went on at the very doors of Government offices.\n\nIt is amongst these outcasts of Chinese society that the worst abuses of the Chinese system of domestic servitude exist, because that system is here unrestrained by the powers of traditional custom or popular opinion. This class of people, mustering perhaps here in Hong Kong not more than 2,000 persons, are entirely beyond the argument of this essay. They form a class of their own, readily recognised at a glance. They are disowned by Chinese society, whilst they are but parasites on foreign society. The system of buying and selling female children and of domestic servitude with which they must be identified is so glaring an abuse of legitimate Chinese domestic servitude that it calls for corrective measures entirely apart from any considerations connected with the general body of Chinese society.{{sfn|Great Britain Parliament1882|p=55}}\n</div></div>\n\n===Japanese prostitutes===\n{{main|Karayuki-san}}\nJapanese prostitutes called [[Karayuki-san]], many coming from poor villages in [[Kyushu]], started coming to Hong Kong in 1879, and constituted the majority of [[Japanese people in Hong Kong|Japanese residents]] of the territory in the 1880s and 1890s.

Before the [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1998, street prostitutes would offer a \"set course\" of services; after that, the set price dropped by half.{{sfn|Yang|2006|p=21}} Some girls will hang around the lobbies of hotels, and will even knock on the doors of the rooms of single men after being tipped off by the concierge.

Prices are lower than for girls who target the tourist hotels, variations in price being a product of location, with those working within the corridor formed by [[Nathan Road]] being on the whole higher than that found in the towns of the [[New Territories]].\n\n==Legal issues==\nProstitution in Hong Kong is legal, but subject to various restrictions, mainly intended to keep it away from the public eye.{{sfn|Yang|2006|p=53}} These restrictions are manifested in the form of prohibiting a whole host of activities surrounding prostitution, including soliciting and advertising for sex, working as pimps, running brothels and organised prostitution. For instance, by the Hong Kong legal code Chapter 200 Section 147, any person who \"solicits for any immoral purpose\" in a public place may receive a maximum penalty of HK$10,000 ($1,280) and six months' imprisonment. In practice, a woman on the street in certain areas well known for streetwalkers such as [[Sham Shui Po]] might well be arrested even if seen smiling at a male passer-by.{{sfn|Yang|2006|p=53}} Advertisement of sex services, including signboards, illuminated signs and posters, is also prohibited, and an offence may result in imprisonment for 12 months.<ref>Hong Kong legal code Chapter 200 Section 147A Prohibition of signs advertising prostitution.</ref> In a test case in 2005 involving [[sex141.com]] \u2013 an internet site created by two programmers who tailored on-line advertisements for prostitutes \u2013 its two principals were convicted of one count each of \"conspiring to live off the earnings of prostitution arising from the ads that appeared on their website\". They were each fined $100,000 ($12,800) and given a suspended sentence of eight months in prison.

This gives rise to the so-called \"one-woman brothel\" where one woman receives customers in her apartment. This is the most common form of legal prostitution in Hong Kong.{{sfn|Yang|2006|p=55}} The law prohibits prostitute girls below the age of 16 for [[vaginal sex]], below 21 for [[anal sex]] and boys below 21 for [[gross indecency]](\u56b4\u91cd\u7325\u893b).<ref>[http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s141.html CRIMES ORDINANCE Section 141 Permitting young person to resort to or be on premises or vessel for intercourse, prostitution, buggery or homosexual act].</ref> \n\n===Strategies to avoid the prohibition on brothels===\nBrothels are illegal, prostitution in private however is legal. So, many prostitutes in Hong Kong are \"one for one\" girls. To avoid the operation of an illegal brothel, triads will purchase apartments in certain apartment blocks &ndash; usually older tenements &ndash; for subdivision, and \"sublet\" them for amounts several times the prevailing rent for equivalent-sized units so that the letter of the law is complied with. The girls advertise their services on web sites or in local publications.<ref name=20131206smashed>Siu, Beatrice (6 December 2013) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&art_id=140355&sid=41064096&con_type=3&d_str=20131206&fc=8 Fancy $60m-a-year online sex ring smashed]. ''The Standard''.</ref>\n\nAnother avoidance strategy is to operate a karaoke establishment and provide girls as entertainment or companionship only; the girls then take customers to an hourly hotel in the same building and pay for the room separately. Informal, individual prostitution (mostly of Filipinas, Indonesians, Thais, and sometimes women from Latin America and the former Soviet Union) is almost always available at discos or hotel bars, especially in the [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] and [[Wan Chai]] districts (the latter famous as the setting for ''[[The World of Suzie Wong]]''). Occasionally the police raid the triad-run prostitution setups, but usually the only arrests made are for immigration violations.<ref name=20131205mingpao/>\n\n==Sex trafficking==\n{{see also|Sex trafficking in Hong Kong}}\nHong Kong is primarily a destination, transit, and to a much lesser extent, a source territory for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Victims include citizens from mainland China, [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], and other [[Southeast Asia]]n countries as well as countries in [[South Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[South America]]. Criminal syndicates or acquaintances sometimes lure women to Hong Kong from the Philippines, South America, and mainland China using false promises of lucrative employment and force them into [[Forced prostitution|prostitution]] to repay money owed for passage to Hong Kong. Traffickers sometimes psychologically coerce sex trafficking victims by threatening to reveal photos or recordings of the victims\u2019 sexual encounters to their families.<ref name=\"state18\">{{cite web |title=Hong Kong 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282669.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726234311/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282669.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2018 |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Hong Kong as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' territory.<ref name=\"state18\" />\n\n==Portrayal in media==\n===Films===\n* ''[[The World of Suzie Wong (film)|The World of Suzie Wong]]'' (1961)\n* ''[[The Call Girls (1977)|The Call Girls]]'' (\u61c9\u53ec\u540d\u518a) (1977)\n* ''[[Girls Without Tomorrow]]'' aka.

margin:0 auto; padding:0 10px;\">\nTo understand the social bearings of domestic servitude as it obtains in Hong Kong, it must be observed that although the Chinese residents of Hong Kong are under British rule and live in close proximity to English social life, there has always been an impassable gulf between respectable English and Chinese society in Hong Kong. The two forms of social life have exercised a certain influence upon each other, but the result now visible is, that while Chinese social life has remained exactly what it is on the mainland of China, the social life of many foreigners in Hong Kong has comparatively degenerated, and not only accommodated itself in certain respects to habits peculiar to the system of \u2022patriarchalism, but caused a certain disrespectable but small class of Chinese to enter into a social alliance with foreigners, which, while detaching them from the restraining influence of the custom and public opinion of Chinese society, left them uninfluenced by the moral powers of foreign civilisation.{{sfn|Great Britain Parliament|1882|p=54}}\n\nThis exceptional class of Chinese residents here in Hong Kong consists principally of the women known in Hong Kong by the popular nickname \"ham-shui-mui\" (lit. salt water girls), applied to these members of the so-called Tan-ka or boat population, the Pariahs of Cantonese society. These Tan-ka people of the Canton river are the descendants of a tribe of aborigines pushed by advancing Chinese civilisation to live on boats on the Canton river, being for centuries forbidden by law to live on shore. The Emperor Yung Ching (A.D. 1730) allowed them to settle in villages in the immediate proximity of the river, but they were left by him, and remain to the present day excluded from competition for official honours, whilst custom forbids them to intermarry with the rest of the people. These Tan-ka people were the secret but trusty allies of foreigners from the time of the East India Company to the present day. They furnished pilots and supplies of provisions to British men-of-war and troop ships when doing so was by the Chinese Government declared treason, unsparingly visited with capital punishment. They invaded Hong Kong the moment the Colony was opened, and have ever since maintained here a monopoly, so to say, of the supply of Chinese pilots and ships' crews, of the fish trade, the cattle trade, and especially of the trade in women for the supply of foreigners and of brothels patronised by foreigners. Almost every so-called \"protected woman,\" i.e. kept mistress of foreigners here, belongs to this Tan-ka tribe, looked down upon and kept at a distance by all the other Chinese classes. It is among these Tan-ka women, and especially under the protection of those \"protected '' T;in-ka women, that private prostitution and the sale of girls for purposes of concubinage flourishes, being looked upon by them as their legitimate profession. Consequently, almost every \"protected woman '' keeps a nursery of purchased children or a few servant girls who are being reared with a view to their eventual disposal, according to their personal qualifications, either among foreigners here as kept women, or among Chinese residents as their concubines, or to be sold for export to Singapore, San Francisco, or Australia. Those protected women, moreover, generally act as protectors each to a few other Tan-ka women who live by sly prostitution. The latter, again, used to be preyed upon\u2014till quite recently His Excellency Governor Hcnnessy stopped this fiendish practice\u2014by informers paid with Government money, who would first debauch such women and then turn round against them charging them before the magistrate as keepers of unlicensed brothels, in which case a heavy fine would be inflicted, to pay which these women used to sell their own children, or sell themselves into bondage worse than slavery, to the keepers of the brothels licensed by Government. Whenever a sly brothel was broken up these keepers would crowd the sheriff's office of the police court or the visiting room to the Government Lock Hospital to drive their heartless bargains, which were invariably enforced with the weighty support of the Inspectors of brothels appointed by Government under the Contagious Diseases Ordinance. The more this Ordinance was enforced the more of this buying and selling of human flesh went on at the very doors of Government offices.\n\nIt is amongst these outcasts of Chinese society that the worst abuses of the Chinese system of domestic servitude exist, because that system is here unrestrained by the powers of traditional custom or popular opinion. This class of people, mustering perhaps here in Hong Kong not more than 2,000 persons, are entirely beyond the argument of this essay. They form a class of their own, readily recognised at a glance. They are disowned by Chinese society, whilst they are but parasites on foreign society. The system of buying and selling female children and of domestic servitude with which they must be identified is so glaring an abuse of legitimate Chinese domestic servitude that it calls for corrective measures entirely apart from any considerations connected with the general body of Chinese society.{{sfn|Great Britain Parliament1882|p=55}}\n</div></div>\n\n===Japanese prostitutes===\n{{main|Karayuki-san}}\nJapanese prostitutes called [[Karayuki-san]], many coming from poor villages in [[Kyushu]], started coming to Hong Kong in 1879, and constituted the majority of [[Japanese people in Hong Kong|Japanese residents]] of the territory in the 1880s and 1890s.

Prices are lower than for girls who target the tourist hotels, variations in price being a product of location, with those working within the corridor formed by [[Nathan Road]] being on the whole higher than that found in the towns of the [[New Territories]].\n\n==Legal issues==\nProstitution in Hong Kong is legal, but subject to various restrictions, mainly intended to keep it away from the public eye.{{sfn|Yang|2006|p=53}} These restrictions are manifested in the form of prohibiting a whole host of activities surrounding prostitution, including soliciting and advertising for sex, working as pimps, running brothels and organised prostitution. For instance, by the Hong Kong legal code Chapter 200 Section 147, any person who \"solicits for any immoral purpose\" in a public place may receive a maximum penalty of HK$10,000 ($1,280) and six months' imprisonment. In practice, a woman on the street in certain areas well known for streetwalkers such as [[Sham Shui Po]] might well be arrested even if seen smiling at a male passer-by.{{sfn|Yang|2006|p=53}} Advertisement of sex services, including signboards, illuminated signs and posters, is also prohibited, and an offence may result in imprisonment for 12 months.<ref>Hong Kong legal code Chapter 200 Section 147A Prohibition of signs advertising prostitution.</ref> In a test case in 2005 involving [[sex141.com]] \u2013 an internet site created by two programmers who tailored on-line advertisements for prostitutes \u2013 its two principals were convicted of one count each of \"conspiring to live off the earnings of prostitution arising from the ads that appeared on their website\". They were each fined $100,000 ($12,800) and given a suspended sentence of eight months in prison.

This gives rise to the so-called \"one-woman brothel\" where one woman receives customers in her apartment. This is the most common form of legal prostitution in Hong Kong.{{sfn|Yang|2006|p=55}} The law prohibits prostitute girls below the age of 16 for [[vaginal sex]], below 21 for [[anal sex]] and boys below 21 for [[gross indecency]](\u56b4\u91cd\u7325\u893b).<ref>[http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s141.html CRIMES ORDINANCE Section 141 Permitting young person to resort to or be on premises or vessel for intercourse, prostitution, buggery or homosexual act].</ref> \n\n===Strategies to avoid the prohibition on brothels===\nBrothels are illegal, prostitution in private however is legal. So, many prostitutes in Hong Kong are \"one for one\" girls. To avoid the operation of an illegal brothel, triads will purchase apartments in certain apartment blocks &ndash; usually older tenements &ndash; for subdivision, and \"sublet\" them for amounts several times the prevailing rent for equivalent-sized units so that the letter of the law is complied with. The girls advertise their services on web sites or in local publications.<ref name=20131206smashed>Siu, Beatrice (6 December 2013) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&art_id=140355&sid=41064096&con_type=3&d_str=20131206&fc=8 Fancy $60m-a-year online sex ring smashed]. ''The Standard''.</ref>\n\nAnother avoidance strategy is to operate a karaoke establishment and provide girls as entertainment or companionship only; the girls then take customers to an hourly hotel in the same building and pay for the room separately. Informal, individual prostitution (mostly of Filipinas, Indonesians, Thais, and sometimes women from Latin America and the former Soviet Union) is almost always available at discos or hotel bars, especially in the [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] and [[Wan Chai]] districts (the latter famous as the setting for ''[[The World of Suzie Wong]]''). Occasionally the police raid the triad-run prostitution setups, but usually the only arrests made are for immigration violations.<ref name=20131205mingpao/>\n\n==Sex trafficking==\n{{see also|Human trafficking in Hong Kong}}\nHong Kong is primarily a destination, transit, and to a much lesser extent, a source territory for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Victims include citizens from mainland China, [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], and other [[Southeast Asia]]n countries as well as countries in [[South Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[South America]]. Criminal syndicates or acquaintances sometimes lure women to Hong Kong from the Philippines, South America, and mainland China using false promises of lucrative employment and force them into [[Forced prostitution|prostitution]] to repay money owed for passage to Hong Kong. Traffickers sometimes psychologically coerce sex trafficking victims by threatening to reveal photos or recordings of the victims\u2019 sexual encounters to their families.<ref name=\"state18\">{{cite web |title=Hong Kong 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282669.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726234311/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282669.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2018 |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Hong Kong as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' territory.<ref name=\"state18\" />\n==Portrayal in media==\n===Films===\n* ''[[The World of Suzie Wong (film)|The World of Suzie Wong]]'' (1961)\n* ''[[The Call Girls (1977)|The Call Girls]]'' (\u61c9\u53ec\u540d\u518a) (1977)\n* ''[[Girls Without Tomorrow]]'' aka.

It is the third [[List of North American light rail systems by ridership|busiest light-rail system in North America]]. The network is concentrated primarily in [[Downtown Toronto]] and in proximity to the city's [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront]]. Much of the streetcar route network dates from the 19th century. Most of Toronto's streetcar routes operate on street trackage shared with vehicular traffic, and streetcars stop on demand at frequent stops like buses.\n\nToronto's streetcars provide most of the downtown core's surface transit service. Four of the TTC's five most heavily used surface routes are streetcar routes. In 2016, ridership on the streetcar system totalled almost 65{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"apta\" />\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the Toronto Transit Commission}}\n\n===Early history (1861\u20131945)===\n[[File:Toronto Street Railway Co. horse-car 145 on King street. View from Church street.jpg|thumb|left|Horse-drawn [[Toronto Street Railway]] streetcars, 1890. By 1894, horse-drawn streetcars were replaced by electric streetcars.]]\n\nIn 1861, the [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] issued a thirty-year transit franchise (Resolution 14, By-law 353) for a [[horsecar|horse-drawn]] [[Tram|street railway]], after the [[Williams Omnibus Bus Line]] had become heavily loaded. Alexander Easton's [[Toronto Street Railway]] (TSR) opened the first street railway line in Canada on September 11, 1861, operating from [[Yorkville Town Hall]] to the [[St. Lawrence Market South|St. Lawrence Market]]. At the end of the TSR franchise, the City government ran the railway for eight months but ended up granting a new thirty-year franchise to the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) in 1891. The TRC was the first operator of horseless streetcars in Toronto. The first electric car ran on August 15, 1892, and the last horse car ran on August 31, 1894, to meet franchise requirements.\n\nThere came to be problems with interpretation of the franchise terms for the City. By 1912, the city limits had extended significantly, with the annexation of communities to the north (1912: [[North Toronto]]) and the east (1908: [[East Toronto|Town of East Toronto]]) and the west (1909: the City of West Toronto\u2014[[The Junction]]). After many attempts to force the TRC to serve these areas, the City created its own street railway operation, the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] to do so, and built several routes. Repeated court battles forced the TRC to build new cars, but they were of old design. When the TRC franchise ended in 1921, the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] was created, combining the city-operated [[Toronto Civic Railways]] lines into its new network.\n\nThe TTC began in 1921 as solely a streetcar operation, with the bulk of the routes acquired from the private TRC and merged with the publicly operated Toronto Civic Railways. In 1923, the TTC took over the Lambton, Davenport and Weston routes of the [[Toronto Suburban Railway]] (TSR) and integrated them into the streetcar system.<!-- REFs are in referenced article -->\n\n[[File:Township of York, opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremonies for the [[Rogers Road streetcar line|Roger Road line]], in [[York, Toronto|York]], 1924.

One of these routes was the former TSR Weston route.\n\nIn 1927, the TTC became the operator of three [[Interurban|radial]] lines of the former [[Toronto and York Radial Railway]]. The TTC connected these lines to the streetcar system in order to share equipment and facilities, such as carhouses, but the radials had their own separate management within the TTC's Radial Department. The last TTC-operated radial ([[North Yonge Railways]]) closed in 1948.<!-- REFs are in referenced articles -->\n\n===Plans for abandonment (1945\u20131989)<span id=\"Abandonment plans (1945\u20131989)\"></span>===\nAfter the [[World War II|Second World War]], many cities across North America and Europe<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Alvaro |last2=Fernandes |first2=Ruben |title=Urban public transport in Europe: Technology diffusion and market organisation |journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice |date=February 2012 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=269\u2013284 |doi=10.1016/j.tra.2011.09.002}}</ref> began to eliminate their streetcar systems in favour of buses. During the 1950s, the TTC continued to invest in streetcars and the TTC took advantage of [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|other cities' streetcar removals]] by purchasing extra PCC cars from [[Cleveland]], Birmingham, Kansas City, and Cincinnati.\n[[File:Trolley bus 1965 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|Streetcar and [[trolleybus]] routes/tracks in October 1965. In the next year, plans were announced to eliminate the streetcar system.]]\nIn 1966, the TTC announced plans to eliminate all streetcar routes by 1980. Streetcars were considered out of date, and their elimination in almost all other cities made it hard to buy new vehicles and maintain the existing ones. Metro Toronto chair [[William Allen (Canadian politician)|William Allen]] claimed in 1966 that \"streetcars are as obsolete as the horse and buggy\".<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Bragg |title=Our Streetcars are Near the End of the Line |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=November 13, 1967 |page=7}}</ref> Many streetcars were removed from service when [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] opened in February 1966.\n\nThe plan to abolish the streetcar system was strongly opposed by many people in the city, and a group named \"Streetcars for Toronto\" was formed to work against the plan. The group was led by Professor Andrew Biemiller and transit advocate [[Steve Munro]]. It had the support of city councillors [[William Kilbourn]] and Paul Pickett, and urban advocate [[Jane Jacobs]]. Streetcars for Toronto presented the TTC board with a report that found retaining the streetcar fleet would, in the long run, be cheaper than converting to buses. This combined with a strong public preference for streetcars over buses changed the decision of the TTC board.<ref name=\"RailwayAge2017-04-05\" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Craig |last=Cal |url=http://spacingtoronto.ca/2007/12/01/streetcars-for-toronto-35th-anniversary/ |title=Streetcars for Toronto \u2013 35th Anniversary |work=Spacing |date=December 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128071525/http://spacingtoronto.ca/2007/12/01/streetcars-for-toronto-35th-anniversary/ |archivedate=November 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe busiest north\u2013south and east\u2013west routes were replaced respectively by the Yonge\u2013University and the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line, and the northernmost streetcar lines, including the North Yonge and Oakwood routes, were replaced by [[Trolleybus|trolley buses]] (and later by diesel buses).

However, as that line was being built, the Province of Ontario persuaded the TTC to switch to using a new technology called the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro#Toronto|Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] (now Bombardier Innovia Metro) by promising to pay for any cost overruns (which eventually amounted to over $100{{nbsp}}million). Thus, the Scarborough RT (now [[Line 3 Scarborough]]) was born, and streetcar service did not return to Scarborough, instead stopping at the boundary.<ref name=\"TT-5002\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Toronto's Subway And The Scarborough RT |work=Transit Toronto |date=July 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017 |quote=Why was the Kennedy RT station renovated so soon after it was built?}}</ref>\n\n===Second period of expansion (1989\u20132000)===\n[[File:CLRVs on Spadina.jpg|thumb|left|A streetcar operating on route [[510 Spadina]]. Streetcar service on [[Spadina Avenue]] was reintroduced in 1990.]]\nThe TTC returned to building new streetcar routes in 1989. The first new line was route 604 Harbourfront, starting from [[Union station (TTC)|Union station]], travelling underneath Bay Street and rising to a dedicated centre median on [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queen's Quay]] (along the edge of [[Lake Ontario]]) to the foot of [[Spadina Avenue]]. This route was lengthened northward along Spadina Avenue in 1997, continuing to travel in a dedicated right-of-way in the centre of the street, and ending in an underground terminal at [[Spadina station]]. At this time, the route was renamed [[510 Spadina]] to fit with the numbering scheme of the other streetcar routes. This new streetcar service replaced the former route 77 Spadina bus, and since 1997 has provided the main north\u2013south transit service through [[Chinatown, Toronto|Toronto's Chinatown]] and the western boundary of [[University of Toronto]]'s main campus. The tracks along Queen's Quay were extended to Bathurst Street in 2000 to connect to the existing [[511 Bathurst|Bathurst route]], providing for a new [[509 Harbourfront]] route from Union Station to the refurbished [[Exhibition Loop]] at the [[Exhibition Place|Exhibition grounds]], where the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] is held.\n\n===21st century (2001\u2013present)===\nBy 2003, two-thirds of the city's streetcar tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using unwelded rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on loose gravel. The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10 to 15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over compacted gravel, and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to embed rail clips and rubber-encased rails. The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.<ref name=\"SteveMunro2009-10-25\">{{cite news |url=http://stevemunro.ca/2009/10/25/streetcar-track-replacement-plan-2010-2014/ |title=Streetcar Track Replacement Plan 2010\u20132014 |publisher=Steve Munro |first=Steve |last=Munro |author-link=Steve Munro |date=October 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"G&M2003-07-14\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/state-of-tracks-forces-streetcars-to-crawl/article22394719/ |title=State of tracks forces streetcars to crawl |work=The Globe and Mail |first=Gay |last=Abbate |date=July 14, 2003 |accessdate=July 14, 2003}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Streetcar arrives at Keele from Gunns Loop.JPG|thumb|A streetcar operating on a [[reserved track]] on route [[512 St. Clair]].

When the CLRVs were introduced, the TTC assigned route numbers in the 500 series. CLRVs have a single front rollsign showing various combinations of route number and destination, while PCC streetcars showed a route identifier (route name until the 1980s and later route number) and destination on two separate front rollsigns.<ref name=\"TT-4503\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4503.shtml |title=The Canadian Light Rail Vehicles (The CLRVs) |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=February 7, 2017 |accessdate=October 21, 2017 |quote=Some Torontonians also didn't like it when the streetcar route names like QUEEN and KING were removed from the front rollsigns, in favour of route numbers like 501 and 504, and some blamed the CLRV's single rollsign design for this change.}}</ref> The digital destination signs on the new Flexity Outlook streetcars show route number, route name and destination.<ref name=\"TT-4506a/\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4506.shtml |title=The Toronto Flexity Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=September 14, 2017 |accessdate=October 21, 2017 |quote=Photographer Patrick Duran captured this image of Flexity LRV #4416 operating in 501 QUEEN service eastbound at Queen and Bay on May 7, 2016.

The other exception to the 500 series numbering was the Harbourfront LRT streetcar. When introduced in 1990, this route was numbered 604, which was intended to group it with the old numbering scheme for [[Toronto subway|Toronto subway routes]]. In 1996, the TTC overhauled its rapid transit route numbers and stopped trying to market the Harbourfront route as \"rapid transit\". The number was changed to 510. The tracks were later extended in two directions to form the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront routes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transittoronto.org/streetcar/4107.shtml |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |title=Route 509 \u2013 The New Harbourfront Streetcar |accessdate=July 21, 2007 |date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDuring times when streetcar service on all or a portion of a route has been replaced temporarily by buses (e.g., for track reconstruction, major fire, special event, heavy snowfall, lack of available streetcars, disaster), the replacement bus service is typically identified by the same route number as the corresponding streetcar line.\n\n===Subway connections===\n[[File:Main Street TTC and streetcar.JPG|thumb|left|A streetcar at {{ttcs|Main Street}} station's streetcar connection. A number of [[Toronto subway]] stations provide connections to streetcars.]]\nThere are underground connections between streetcars and the [[Toronto subway|subway]] at {{ttcs|St. Clair West}}, Spadina, and Union stations, and streetcars enter {{ttcs|St. Clair}}, {{ttcs|Dundas West}}, {{ttcs|Bathurst}}, {{ttcs|Broadview}}, and {{ttcs|Main Street}} stations at street level. At the eight downtown stations, excepting Union, from {{ttcs|Queen's Park}} to {{ttcs|College}} on Line 1 Yonge\u2013University, streetcars stop on the street outside the station entrances. Union station serves as the hub for both the TTC and the [[GO Transit|GO Transit system]].\n\n===Dedicated rights-of-way and transit malls===\nThe majority of streetcar routes in Toronto operate in mixed traffic, generally reflecting the original track configurations of the streetcar system, a system that dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, newer trackage has largely been established within dedicated [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]], in order to allow streetcars to operate with fewer disruptions due to delays caused by automobile traffic. Most of the system's dedicated rights-of-way operate within the median of existing streets, separated from general traffic by raised curbs and controlled by specialized traffic signals at intersections. [[501 Queen|Queen streetcars]] have operated on such a right-of-way along [[the Queensway]] between Humber and Sunnyside loops since 1957. Since the 1990s, dedicated rights-of-way have been opened downtown along [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queens Quay]], [[Spadina Avenue]], [[St. Clair Avenue]] West, and Fleet Street.\n[[File:CLRVs 4049 and 4090 Eastbound on King.jpg|thumb|The majority of streetcar routes in Toronto operate in mixed traffic, reflecting the original track configurations of the streetcar system.]]\nShort sections of the track also operate in a tunnel (to connect with Spadina, Union, and St. Clair West subway stations). The most significant section of underground streetcar trackage is a tunnel underneath Bay Street connecting Queens Quay with Union Station; this section, which is approximately {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, includes one [[Queens Quay station|intermediate underground station]] at Bay Street and Queens Quay.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, the TTC reinstated a separated right-of-way \u2014 removed between 1928 and 1935<ref>[http://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4110.shtml Route 512 \u2013 The St Clair Streetcar]</ref> \u2014 on St. Clair Avenue, for the entire [[512 St. Clair]] route. A court decision obtained by local merchants in October 2005 had brought construction to a halt and put the project in doubt; the judicial panel then recused themselves, and the delay for a new decision adversely affected the construction schedule. A new judicial panel decided in February 2006 in favour of the city, and construction resumed in mid-2006. One-third of the St. Clair right-of-way was completed by the end of 2006 and streetcars began using it on February 18, 2007. The portion finished was from [[St. Clair station]] (Yonge Street) to [[Vaughan Road]]. The second phase started construction in mid-2007 from Dufferin Street to Caledonia Road. Service resumed using the second and third phases on December 20, 2009 extending streetcar service from St. Clair to Earlscourt Loop located just south and west of Lansdowne Avenue. The fourth and final phase from Earlscourt Loop to Gunns Loop (just west of Keele Street) is completed and full streetcar service over the entire route was finally restored on June 30, 2010.<ref>http://www3.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Construction/St_Clair_Avenue_West_Transit_Improvements_Project_-_Phase_4.jsp</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/ttc/article/830736--finally-st-clair-streetcar-fully-restored |location=Toronto |work=The Star |first=Tess |last=Kalinowski |title=Finally, St. Clair streetcar fully restored |date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Queens Quay & York Street - bollards & signage.jpg|thumb|Route [[509 Harbourfront]] is a TTC streetcar route that features dedicated right-of-way lanes.]]\n\nBetween September 2007 and March 2008, the tracks on Fleet Street between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] and the [[Exhibition Loop]] were converted to a dedicated right-of-way and opened for the [[511 Bathurst]] and the [[509 Harbourfront|509 Harbourfront streetcars]]. Streetcar track and overhead power line were also installed at the Fleet loop, which is located at the [[Queen's Wharf Lighthouse]].<ref>https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2007/09/03-fleet_stre.shtml</ref><ref>https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml</ref>\n\nThe [[Distillery Loop and Cherry Street branch|eastern portion]] of the 504A King route runs on a side-of-street right-of-way. It was constructed starting in 2012 to support redevelopment in the [[West Don Lands]] and the [[Distillery District]], former industrial areas.<ref name=\"TTC-2016-06-20\" /><ref name=\"GlobeAndMail2012-05-25\" />\n\nAs part of the [[King Street Transit Priority Corridor|King Street Pilot Project]], a temporary [[transit mall]] was set up along King Street for a one-year trial period starting in mid-November 2017. Although not a dedicated right-of-way, the transit mall achieves the goal of preventing road traffic from impeding streetcar service. Road traffic is discouraged from using the mall by being forced to leave the mall via a right turn at most signalized intersections.<ref name=\"TheStar-2017-12-12\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2017/12/12/king-st-pilot-project-moving-streetcar-riders-quicker-city-says.html |title=King St. pilot project moving streetcar riders quicker, city says |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=David |last=Rider |date=December 12, 2017 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref> This project has since been extended and made permanent under the name King Street Transit Priority Corridor.<ref>https://globalnews.ca/news/4759182/king-street-pilot-project-extended/</ref>\n\n=== Track switches ===\nAt every facing switch, a \"stop, check, go\" process is used as part of a passenger safety procedure. Each streetcar operator, upon arriving at a facing switch-point, is to stop short of the switch, point with their finger toward the switch's position to confirm that the switch is aligned properly for the streetcar's intended movement, and then proceed.<ref>https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Committee_meetings/Audit_Risk_Management/2015/September_11/Reports/2014_TTC_APTA_Audit.pdf</ref>\n\n===Future expansion===\n====Near future====\n{{as of|2019|12}}, the TTC is considering changes to several streetcar routes by 2022.

In 2017, the TTC revised the proposal as summarized here.<ref name=\"TTC-2017-11-13\">{{cite web |url=http://ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2017/November_13/Reports/20_Waterfront_Transit_Update.pdf |title=Waterfront Transit Update |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=November 13, 2017 |accessdate=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* The [[East Bayfront LRT]] is planned to run along [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queens Quay East]] from Union station to complement the [[509 Harbourfront]] line.<ref name=\"TTC-2017-11-13\" />\n* [[Waterfront Toronto]] is recommending [https://swanboatsteve.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/transitnetwork.jpg the creation or extension of three streetcar lines] in the [[Port Lands]].

Because the CLRV/ALRV streetcars required extra maintenance, only 170 of the 200 CLRVs and ALRVs could be put into service. This shortage led to the replacement of streetcars by buses on some routes, which in turn led to a reduction of service on some bus routes.<ref name=\"TheStar-2017-01-09\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2016-12-11\" />\n\nTo address the streetcar shortage, as well as construction projects, the TTC has used bus substitution at various times on several streetcar routes.<ref name=\"TTC-Accessible-2018-01-14\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2016-10-22\" /> The first bus substitution due to the streetcar shortage occurred for the [[502 Downtowner]] route on October 11, 2016.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-01-14\" />\n\nOn February 19, 2018, the TTC replaced the CLRV streetcars on routes [[505 Dundas]] and [[506 Carlton]] with buses and reassigned those streetcars to other routes, such as [[504 King]] and [[511 Bathurst]], to handle crowding from increased ridership. Ridership on the 504 King increased by 25 percent after the implementation of the [[King Street Transit Priority Corridor]] through downtown King Street.<ref name=\"G&M-2018-01-11\" /><ref name=\"TTC-Accessible-2018-01-14\" />\n\nThe streetcar fleet capacity had not grown for almost three decades after the CLRVs and ALRVs were added. After delivery of the last of the initial 204 Flexity cars ordered, the TTC planned to purchase another 60 cars; however, the TTC estimated that would only satisfy demand until 2023 instead of 2027 as originally planned. Bombardier may end up being the chosen supplier for additional Flexity cars solely because, if the TTC went with another supplier, a prototype modified for Toronto's track characteristics would not be ready until 2023, with first delivery in 2024 or 2025.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-06-06\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/06/05/bombardier-has-inside-track-for-ttcs-next-streetcar-order.html |title=Bombardier has inside track for TTC's next streetcar order |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=June 6, 2018 |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Electrical pickup==\n{{see also|Trolley pole|Pantograph (transport)}}\n[[File:CLRV Trolley Pole.jpg|thumb|left|Older streetcar models used by the TTC, like the ALRVs and CLRVs, receive their electricity by [[trolley pole]].]]\nThe older CLRV and ALRV streetcars have only a trolley pole. New Flexity Outlook streetcars are delivered with both a pantograph as well as a trolley pole. All streetcars in service had been using the trolley pole until September 12, 2017, when 509 Harbourfront became the first route to use the pantograph.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2017-09-12\" />\n\nWith the introduction of the new Flexity streetcars, the TTC plans to convert the entire system to be pantograph-compatible. The new streetcars need 50% more electrical current than the older streetcars, and use of the trolley pole limits the amount of electricity the new cars can draw from the overhead wire, resulting in reduced performance. One consequence of trolley pole use on the Flexity streetcars is that air conditioning does not function in summer.<ref name=\"TTC-2013-06-24\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2013/June_24/Reports/New_Streetcar_Implem.pdf |title=New Streetcar Implementation Plan |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |pages=22 |quote=New cars draw over 50% more current than the old cars.

The overhead over the Fleet Street tracks was the first to be so converted. The new overhead uses different hangers so that pantographs do not strike supporting crosswires. It also uses a different [[Wire gauge|gauge of wire]] to handle the higher electrical demands of Flexity Outlook streetcars.<ref name=\"TT-Log-2008-09-29\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml |title=Streetcars Roll Along Fleet Street Tomorrow |work=Transit Toronto |first=Robert |last=Mackenzie |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Pantograph & trolley pole on Queens Quay West (4417&4433).jpg|thumb|The streetcar to the left uses a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], while the one on the right uses a trolley pole. Conversion of the [[overhead wire]] to be compatible with pantographs began in 2008. Note that the one on the left has [[Wrap advertising|vinyl wrap for advertising]].]]\nDuring a rainy period in February 2018, the TTC received an incentive to expedite the conversion of the electrical overhead for pantograph use by the Flexity streetcars. On February 20, 2018, Flexity streetcars using trolley poles were pulling down some of the overhead. In Toronto, the tip of the trolley pole has a shoe with a carbon insert to collect current. The carbon insert also lowers the trolley shoe so that it does not strike hangers that are not yet pantograph-compatible. During wet weather, these carbon inserts wear out faster, needing replacement after a day or two for older streetcars. However, because the Flexity streetcars draw more current than older streetcars, their carbon inserts wore out faster in less than eight hours in the wet weather. (There was also an issue with the quality of carbon the TTC purchased.) With pantographs, this would be less of a problem as the pantograph blades have a larger contact area than a trolley shoe to absorb wear. Because of this incident, the TTC decided it should accelerate the conversion of overhead for pantograph use.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2018-02-22\">{{cite web |url=https://stevemunro.ca/2018/02/22/problems-with-trolley-shoes-on-flexity-cars/ |title=Problems With Trolley Shoes on Flexity Cars |publisher=[[Steve Munro]] |first=Steve |last=Munro |date=April 27, 2018 |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first three routes to operate with pantographs were [[509 Harbourfront]] on September 12, 2017, [[510 Spadina]] on May 14, 2018, and [[512 St. Clair]] on October 1, 2018.<ref name=\"TT-4506\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4506.shtml |title=The Toronto Flexity Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) |publisher=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=October 13, 2018 |accessdate=October 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2018-02-22\" />\n\n==Winter operational issues==\n===Extreme cold weather===\nThe fleet of CLRV and ALRV streetcars experienced several operational issues during extreme cold temperatures during late 2013 and early 2014, late 2014 and early 2015, late 2017 and early 2018, and late 2018 and early 2019, as doors and [[Railway air brake|brakes]] failed as moisture in the pneumatic lines froze.

The [[Williams Omnibus Bus Line]] changed the gauge of their buses in 1861 to fit this gauge. At the time, track for horsecars was not our modern 'T' rail, but wide and flat, with a raised section on the outside of the rail.\n[[File:Toronto Streetcar Grand Junction.jpg|thumb|A [[grand union]] at a streetcar intersection; Toronto has three grand unions, such as this one at Spadina Avenue and Queen Street West]]\nAccording to the TTC, the City of Toronto feared that the street railway franchise operator, first in 1861, the [[Toronto Street Railway]], then in 1891, the [[Toronto Railway Company]], and in 1921, the TTC, would allow the operation of steam locomotives and freight trains [[street running|through city streets]], as was common practice in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] (until the 1950s) and in many US cities, such as [[New York City]] and [[Syracuse, New York]].<ref name=\"TorontoStar2010-01-06\" />\n\nStandard gauge [[Track (rail transport)|tracks]] in the streets would have allowed this, but steam railway equipment could not follow the [[Minimum railway curve radius|abrupt curves]] in the streetcar network.

Electric railway freight cars could negotiate street curves, but freight operations to downtown were still not allowed until the final few years of radial operation by the TTC.\n\nSome proposals for the city's subway system involved using streetcars in the tunnels, possibly having some routes run partially in tunnels and partially on city streets, so the [[Toronto subway]] was built using the same gauge as streetcars, although ultimately, streetcars were never used as part of the subway system.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nBesides the Toronto streetcar and subway systems, the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] uses the Toronto gauge of {{RailGauge|58.875in}} for its museum streetcar line to accommodate its collection of Toronto subway trains and streetcars.\n\n===Pre-TTC===\nBefore TTC ownership, however, the streetcar gauge was either {{RailGauge|58.75in}} or {{convert|4|ft|11|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}<!-- {{RailGauge|59in}} -->, depending on the historical source, instead of today's {{RailGauge|58.875in}}.\n\nAccording to Raymond L.

As horse car rail was step rail, the horse cars, equipped with iron wheels with flanges on the inside, ran on the outer, or upper step of the rail. Wagon wheels naturally did not have a flange. They were made of wood, with an iron tire. Wagons would use the inner, or lower step of the rail. The upper step of the rail guided the wagons on the track. In order to accommodate this arrangement, the track gauge had to be 4 feet, 11 inches. As the streets themselves were not paved, this arrangement permitted wagons carrying heavy loads a stable roadbed.\"<ref name=\"TT-4002\" /> In support of Heard's statement about the pre-TTC gauge, the Charter of the Toronto Railway Company said \"the gauge of system (4 ft. 11 in.) is to be maintained on main lines and extensions thereof\".<ref name=\"TRC-charter\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9kKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=toronto+railway+company+track+gauge&source=bl&ots=rnnt-eVs8_&sig=wR5iN4-FrEFQXr5NXJ7FiywWqys&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio4LKfr5TMAhUBPz4KHU5xBOMQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&q=toronto%20railway%20company%20track%20gauge&f=false |title=The charter of the Toronto Railway Company |publisher=City of Toronto |pages=21 |author=City solicitor |date=1892 |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n[[Image:RoncyMaintBays.jpg|thumb|Maintenance tracks at [[Roncesvalles Carhouse]], one of four maintenance and storage facilities used by the streetcar network]]\n\n===Dedicated station===\n{{ttcs|Queens Quay}} is the one standalone underground station that does not connect to the subway.

streetcar system''' is a network of ten [[tram|streetcar]] routes in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, operated by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC). It is the third [[List of North American light rail systems by ridership|busiest light-rail system in North America]]. The network is concentrated primarily in [[Downtown Toronto]] and in proximity to the city's [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront]]. Much of the streetcar route network dates from the 19th century. Most of Toronto's streetcar routes operate on street trackage shared with vehicular traffic, and streetcars stop on demand at frequent stops like buses.\n\nToronto's streetcars provide most of the downtown core's surface transit service. Four of the TTC's five most heavily used surface routes are streetcar routes. In 2016, ridership on the streetcar system totalled almost 65{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"apta\" />\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the Toronto Transit Commission}}\n\n===Early history (1861\u20131945)===\n[[File:Toronto Street Railway Co. horse-car 145 on King street. View from Church street.jpg|thumb|left|Horse-drawn [[Toronto Street Railway]] streetcars, 1890. By 1894, horse-drawn streetcars were replaced by electric streetcars.]]\n\nIn 1861, the [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] issued a thirty-year transit franchise (Resolution 14, By-law 353) for a [[horsecar|horse-drawn]] [[Tram|street railway]], after the [[Williams Omnibus Bus Line]] had become heavily loaded. Alexander Easton's [[Toronto Street Railway]] (TSR) opened the first street railway line in Canada on September 11, 1861, operating from [[Yorkville Town Hall]] to the [[St. Lawrence Market South|St. Lawrence Market]]. At the end of the TSR franchise, the City government ran the railway for eight months but ended up granting a new thirty-year franchise to the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) in 1891. The TRC was the first operator of horseless streetcars in Toronto. The first electric car ran on August 15, 1892, and the last horse car ran on August 31, 1894, to meet franchise requirements.\n\nThere came to be problems with interpretation of the franchise terms for the City. By 1912, the city limits had extended significantly, with the annexation of communities to the north (1912: [[North Toronto]]) and the east (1908: [[East Toronto|Town of East Toronto]]) and the west (1909: the City of West Toronto\u2014[[The Junction]]). After many attempts to force the TRC to serve these areas, the City created its own street railway operation, the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] to do so, and built several routes. Repeated court battles forced the TRC to build new cars, but they were of old design. When the TRC franchise ended in 1921, the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] was created, combining the city-operated [[Toronto Civic Railways]] lines into its new network.\n\nThe TTC began in 1921 as solely a streetcar operation, with the bulk of the routes acquired from the private TRC and merged with the publicly operated Toronto Civic Railways. In 1923, the TTC took over the Lambton, Davenport and Weston routes of the [[Toronto Suburban Railway]] (TSR) and integrated them into the streetcar system.<!-- REFs are in referenced article -->\n\n[[File:Township of York, opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremonies for the [[Rogers Road streetcar line|Roger Road line]], in [[York, Toronto|York]], 1924. The TTC was contracted to operate streetcars in the township.]]\n\nIn 1925, routes were operated on behalf of the [[York, Toronto|Township of York]] (as Township of York Railway), but the TTC was contracted to operate them. One of these routes was the former TSR Weston route.\n\nIn 1927, the TTC became the operator of three [[Interurban|radial]] lines of the former [[Toronto and York Radial Railway]]. The TTC connected these lines to the streetcar system in order to share equipment and facilities, such as carhouses, but the radials had their own separate management within the TTC's Radial Department. The last TTC-operated radial ([[North Yonge Railways]]) closed in 1948.<!-- REFs are in referenced articles -->\n\n===Plans for abandonment (1945\u20131989)<span id=\"Abandonment plans (1945\u20131989)\"></span>===\nAfter the [[World War II|Second World War]], many cities across North America and Europe<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Alvaro |last2=Fernandes |first2=Ruben |title=Urban public transport in Europe: Technology diffusion and market organisation |journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice |date=February 2012 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=269\u2013284 |doi=10.1016/j.tra.2011.09.002}}</ref> began to eliminate their streetcar systems in favour of buses. During the 1950s, the TTC continued to invest in streetcars and the TTC took advantage of [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|other cities' streetcar removals]] by purchasing extra PCC cars from [[Cleveland]], Birmingham, Kansas City, and Cincinnati.\n[[File:Trolley bus 1965 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|Streetcar and [[trolleybus]] routes/tracks in October 1965. In the next year, plans were announced to eliminate the streetcar system.]]\nIn 1966, the TTC announced plans to eliminate all streetcar routes by 1980. Streetcars were considered out of date, and their elimination in almost all other cities made it hard to buy new vehicles and maintain the existing ones. Metro Toronto chair [[William Allen (Canadian politician)|William Allen]] claimed in 1966 that \"streetcars are as obsolete as the horse and buggy\".<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Bragg |title=Our Streetcars are Near the End of the Line |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=November 13, 1967 |page=7}}</ref> Many streetcars were removed from service when [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] opened in February 1966.\n\nThe plan to abolish the streetcar system was strongly opposed by many people in the city, and a group named \"Streetcars for Toronto\" was formed to work against the plan. The group was led by Professor Andrew Biemiller and transit advocate [[Steve Munro]]. It had the support of city councillors [[William Kilbourn]] and Paul Pickett, and urban advocate [[Jane Jacobs]]. Streetcars for Toronto presented the TTC board with a report that found retaining the streetcar fleet would, in the long run, be cheaper than converting to buses. This combined with a strong public preference for streetcars over buses changed the decision of the TTC board.<ref name=\"RailwayAge2017-04-05\" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Craig |last=Cal |url=http://spacingtoronto.ca/2007/12/01/streetcars-for-toronto-35th-anniversary/ |title=Streetcars for Toronto \u2013 35th Anniversary |work=Spacing |date=December 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128071525/http://spacingtoronto.ca/2007/12/01/streetcars-for-toronto-35th-anniversary/ |archivedate=November 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe busiest north\u2013south and east\u2013west routes were replaced respectively by the Yonge\u2013University and the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line, and the northernmost streetcar lines, including the North Yonge and Oakwood routes, were replaced by [[Trolleybus|trolley buses]] (and later by diesel buses). Two lines that operated north of [[St. Clair Avenue]] were abandoned for other reasons. The [[Rogers Road streetcar line|Rogers Road route]] was abandoned to free up streetcars for expanded service on other routes.<ref name=\"TT-4119\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4119.shtml |title=The Township of York Railways (Deceased) |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=August 14, 2017 |accessdate=October 20, 2017}}</ref> The Mount Pleasant route was removed because of complaints that streetcars slowed automobile traffic.

It also continued to rebuild and maintain the existing fleet of [[Presidents' Conference Committee (Toronto streetcar)|PCC]] (Presidents' Conference Committee) streetcars until they were no longer roadworthy.\n\nWhen [[Kipling station]] opened in 1980 as the new western terminus of Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth, it had provision for a future streetcar or LRT platform opposite the bus platforms.

However, as that line was being built, the Province of Ontario persuaded the TTC to switch to using a new technology called the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro#Toronto|Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] (now Bombardier Innovia Metro) by promising to pay for any cost overruns (which eventually amounted to over $100{{nbsp}}million). Thus, the Scarborough RT (now [[Line 3 Scarborough]]) was born, and streetcar service did not return to Scarborough, instead stopping at the boundary.<ref name=\"TT-5002\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Toronto's Subway And The Scarborough RT |work=Transit Toronto |date=July 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017 |quote=Why was the Kennedy RT station renovated so soon after it was built?}}</ref>\n\n===Second period of expansion (1989\u20132000)===\n[[File:CLRVs on Spadina.jpg|thumb|left|A streetcar operating on route [[510 Spadina]]. Streetcar service on [[Spadina Avenue]] was reintroduced in 1990.]]\nThe TTC returned to building new streetcar routes in 1989. The first new line was route 604 Harbourfront, starting from [[Union station (TTC)|Union station]], travelling underneath Bay Street and rising to a dedicated centre median on [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queen's Quay]] (along the edge of [[Lake Ontario]]) to the foot of [[Spadina Avenue]]. This route was lengthened northward along Spadina Avenue in 1997, continuing to travel in a dedicated right-of-way in the centre of the street, and ending in an underground terminal at [[Spadina station]]. At this time, the route was renamed [[510 Spadina]] to fit with the numbering scheme of the other streetcar routes. This new streetcar service replaced the former route 77 Spadina bus, and since 1997 has provided the main north\u2013south transit service through [[Chinatown, Toronto|Toronto's Chinatown]] and the western boundary of [[University of Toronto]]'s main campus. The tracks along Queen's Quay were extended to Bathurst Street in 2000 to connect to the existing [[511 Bathurst|Bathurst route]], providing for a new [[509 Harbourfront]] route from Union Station to the refurbished [[Exhibition Loop]] at the [[Exhibition Place|Exhibition grounds]], where the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] is held.\n\n===21st century (2001\u2013present)===\nBy 2003, two-thirds of the city's streetcar tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using unwelded rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on loose gravel. The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10 to 15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over compacted gravel, and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to embed rail clips and rubber-encased rails. The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.<ref name=\"SteveMunro2009-10-25\">{{cite news |url=http://stevemunro.ca/2009/10/25/streetcar-track-replacement-plan-2010-2014/ |title=Streetcar Track Replacement Plan 2010\u20132014 |publisher=Steve Munro |first=Steve |last=Munro |author-link=Steve Munro |date=October 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"G&M2003-07-14\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/state-of-tracks-forces-streetcars-to-crawl/article22394719/ |title=State of tracks forces streetcars to crawl |work=The Globe and Mail |first=Gay |last=Abbate |date=July 14, 2003 |accessdate=July 14, 2003}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Streetcar arrives at Keele from Gunns Loop.JPG|thumb|A streetcar operating on a [[reserved track]] on route [[512 St. Clair]].

The other exception to the 500 series numbering was the Harbourfront LRT streetcar. When introduced in 1990, this route was numbered 604, which was intended to group it with the old numbering scheme for [[Toronto subway|Toronto subway routes]]. In 1996, the TTC overhauled its rapid transit route numbers and stopped trying to market the Harbourfront route as \"rapid transit\". The number was changed to 510. The tracks were later extended in two directions to form the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront routes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transittoronto.org/streetcar/4107.shtml |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |title=Route 509 \u2013 The New Harbourfront Streetcar |accessdate=July 21, 2007 |date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDuring times when streetcar service on all or a portion of a route has been replaced temporarily by buses (e.g., for track reconstruction, major fire, special event, heavy snowfall, lack of available streetcars, disaster), the replacement bus service is typically identified by the same route number as the corresponding streetcar line.\n\n===Subway connections===\n[[File:Main Street TTC and streetcar.JPG|thumb|left|A streetcar at {{ttcs|Main Street}} station's streetcar connection. A number of [[Toronto subway]] stations provide connections to streetcars.]]\nThere are underground connections between streetcars and the [[Toronto subway|subway]] at {{ttcs|St. Clair West}}, Spadina, and Union stations, and streetcars enter {{ttcs|St. Clair}}, {{ttcs|Dundas West}}, {{ttcs|Bathurst}}, {{ttcs|Broadview}}, and {{ttcs|Main Street}} stations at street level. At the eight downtown stations, excepting Union, from {{ttcs|Queen's Park}} to {{ttcs|College}} on Line 1 Yonge\u2013University, streetcars stop on the street outside the station entrances. Union station serves as the hub for both the TTC and the [[GO Transit|GO Transit system]].\n\n===Dedicated rights-of-way and transit malls===\nThe majority of streetcar routes in Toronto operate in mixed traffic, generally reflecting the original track configurations of the streetcar system, a system that dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, newer trackage has largely been established within dedicated [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]], in order to allow streetcars to operate with fewer disruptions due to delays caused by automobile traffic. Most of the system's dedicated rights-of-way operate within the median of existing streets, separated from general traffic by raised curbs and controlled by specialized traffic signals at intersections. [[501 Queen|Queen streetcars]] have operated on such a right-of-way along [[the Queensway]] between Humber and Sunnyside loops since 1957. Since the 1990s, dedicated rights-of-way have been opened downtown along [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queens Quay]], [[Spadina Avenue]], [[St. Clair Avenue]] West, and Fleet Street.\n[[File:CLRVs 4049 and 4090 Eastbound on King.jpg|thumb|The majority of streetcar routes in Toronto operate in mixed traffic, reflecting the original track configurations of the streetcar system.]]\nShort sections of the track also operate in a tunnel (to connect with Spadina, Union, and St. Clair West subway stations). The most significant section of underground streetcar trackage is a tunnel underneath Bay Street connecting Queens Quay with Union Station; this section, which is approximately {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, includes one [[Queens Quay station|intermediate underground station]] at Bay Street and Queens Quay.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, the TTC reinstated a separated right-of-way \u2014 removed between 1928 and 1935<ref>[http://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4110.shtml Route 512 \u2013 The St Clair Streetcar]</ref> \u2014 on St. Clair Avenue, for the entire [[512 St. Clair]] route. A court decision obtained by local merchants in October 2005 had brought construction to a halt and put the project in doubt; the judicial panel then recused themselves, and the delay for a new decision adversely affected the construction schedule. A new judicial panel decided in February 2006 in favour of the city, and construction resumed in mid-2006. One-third of the St. Clair right-of-way was completed by the end of 2006 and streetcars began using it on February 18, 2007. The portion finished was from [[St. Clair station]] (Yonge Street) to [[Vaughan Road]]. The second phase started construction in mid-2007 from Dufferin Street to Caledonia Road. Service resumed using the second and third phases on December 20, 2009 extending streetcar service from St. Clair to Earlscourt Loop located just south and west of Lansdowne Avenue. The fourth and final phase from Earlscourt Loop to Gunns Loop (just west of Keele Street) is completed and full streetcar service over the entire route was finally restored on June 30, 2010.<ref>http://www3.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Construction/St_Clair_Avenue_West_Transit_Improvements_Project_-_Phase_4.jsp</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/ttc/article/830736--finally-st-clair-streetcar-fully-restored |location=Toronto |work=The Star |first=Tess |last=Kalinowski |title=Finally, St. Clair streetcar fully restored |date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Queens Quay & York Street - bollards & signage.jpg|thumb|Route [[509 Harbourfront]] is a TTC streetcar route that features dedicated right-of-way lanes.]]\n\nBetween September 2007 and March 2008, the tracks on Fleet Street between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] and the [[Exhibition Loop]] were converted to a dedicated right-of-way and opened for the [[511 Bathurst]] and the [[509 Harbourfront|509 Harbourfront streetcars]]. Streetcar track and overhead power line were also installed at the Fleet loop, which is located at the [[Queen's Wharf Lighthouse]].<ref>https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2007/09/03-fleet_stre.shtml</ref><ref>https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml</ref>\n\nThe [[Distillery Loop and Cherry Street branch|eastern portion]] of the 504A King route runs on a side-of-street right-of-way.

Although not a dedicated right-of-way, the transit mall achieves the goal of preventing road traffic from impeding streetcar service.

Because the CLRV/ALRV streetcars required extra maintenance, only 170 of the 200 CLRVs and ALRVs could be put into service. This shortage led to the replacement of streetcars by buses on some routes, which in turn led to a reduction of service on some bus routes.<ref name=\"TheStar-2017-01-09\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2016-12-11\" />\n\nTo address the streetcar shortage, as well as construction projects, the TTC has used bus substitution at various times on several streetcar routes.<ref name=\"TTC-Accessible-2018-01-14\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2016-10-22\" /> The first bus substitution due to the streetcar shortage occurred for the [[502 Downtowner]] route on October 11, 2016.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-01-14\" />\n\nOn February 19, 2018, the TTC replaced the CLRV streetcars on routes [[505 Dundas]] and [[506 Carlton]] with buses and reassigned those streetcars to other routes, such as [[504 King]] and [[511 Bathurst]], to handle crowding from increased ridership. Ridership on the 504 King increased by 25 percent after the implementation of the [[King Street Transit Priority Corridor]] through downtown King Street.<ref name=\"G&M-2018-01-11\" /><ref name=\"TTC-Accessible-2018-01-14\" />\n\nThe streetcar fleet capacity had not grown for almost three decades after the CLRVs and ALRVs were added. After delivery of the last of the initial 204 Flexity cars ordered, the TTC planned to purchase another 60 cars; however, the TTC estimated that would only satisfy demand until 2023 instead of 2027 as originally planned. Bombardier may end up being the chosen supplier for additional Flexity cars solely because, if the TTC went with another supplier, a prototype modified for Toronto's track characteristics would not be ready until 2023, with first delivery in 2024 or 2025.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-06-06\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/06/05/bombardier-has-inside-track-for-ttcs-next-streetcar-order.html |title=Bombardier has inside track for TTC's next streetcar order |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=June 6, 2018 |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Electrical pickup==\n{{see also|Trolley pole|Pantograph (transport)}}\n[[File:CLRV Trolley Pole.jpg|thumb|left|Older streetcar models used by the TTC, like the ALRVs and CLRVs, receive their electricity by [[trolley pole]].]]\nThe older CLRV and ALRV streetcars have only a trolley pole. New Flexity Outlook streetcars are delivered with both a pantograph as well as a trolley pole. All streetcars in service had been using the trolley pole until September 12, 2017, when 509 Harbourfront became the first route to use the pantograph.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2017-09-12\" />\n\nWith the introduction of the new Flexity streetcars, the TTC plans to convert the entire system to be pantograph-compatible. The new streetcars need 50% more electrical current than the older streetcars, and use of the trolley pole limits the amount of electricity the new cars can draw from the overhead wire, resulting in reduced performance. One consequence of trolley pole use on the Flexity streetcars is that air conditioning does not function in summer.<ref name=\"TTC-2013-06-24\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2013/June_24/Reports/New_Streetcar_Implem.pdf |title=New Streetcar Implementation Plan |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |pages=22 |quote=New cars draw over 50% more current than the old cars.

The overhead over the Fleet Street tracks was the first to be so converted. The new overhead uses different hangers so that pantographs do not strike supporting crosswires. It also uses a different [[Wire gauge|gauge of wire]] to handle the higher electrical demands of Flexity Outlook streetcars.<ref name=\"TT-Log-2008-09-29\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml |title=Streetcars Roll Along Fleet Street Tomorrow |work=Transit Toronto |first=Robert |last=Mackenzie |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Pantograph & trolley pole on Queens Quay West (4417&4433).jpg|thumb|The streetcar to the left uses a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], while the one on the right uses a trolley pole. Conversion of the [[overhead wire]] to be compatible with pantographs began in 2008. Note that the one on the left has [[Wrap advertising|vinyl wrap for advertising]].]]\nDuring a rainy period in February 2018, the TTC received an incentive to expedite the conversion of the electrical overhead for pantograph use by the Flexity streetcars. On February 20, 2018, Flexity streetcars using trolley poles were pulling down some of the overhead. In Toronto, the tip of the trolley pole has a shoe with a carbon insert to collect current. The carbon insert also lowers the trolley shoe so that it does not strike hangers that are not yet pantograph-compatible. During wet weather, these carbon inserts wear out faster, needing replacement after a day or two for older streetcars. However, because the Flexity streetcars draw more current than older streetcars, their carbon inserts wore out faster in less than eight hours in the wet weather. (There was also an issue with the quality of carbon the TTC purchased.) With pantographs, this would be less of a problem as the pantograph blades have a larger contact area than a trolley shoe to absorb wear. Because of this incident, the TTC decided it should accelerate the conversion of overhead for pantograph use.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2018-02-22\">{{cite web |url=https://stevemunro.ca/2018/02/22/problems-with-trolley-shoes-on-flexity-cars/ |title=Problems With Trolley Shoes on Flexity Cars |publisher=[[Steve Munro]] |first=Steve |last=Munro |date=April 27, 2018 |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first three routes to operate with pantographs were [[509 Harbourfront]] on September 12, 2017, [[510 Spadina]] on May 14, 2018, and [[512 St. Clair]] on October 1, 2018.<ref name=\"TT-4506\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4506.shtml |title=The Toronto Flexity Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) |publisher=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=October 13, 2018 |accessdate=October 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2018-02-22\" />\n\n==Winter operational issues==\n===Extreme cold weather===\nThe fleet of CLRV and ALRV streetcars experienced several operational issues during extreme cold temperatures during late 2013 and early 2014, late 2014 and early 2015, late 2017 and early 2018, and late 2018 and early 2019, as doors and [[Railway air brake|brakes]] failed as moisture in the pneumatic lines froze.

During such storms, the TTC applies anti-freeze to the overhead wire to prevent ice from interrupting electrical contact. In addition, the TTC attaches \"sliders\" to trolley poles on every fifth streetcar to knock ice off the overhead wire. The TTC places overhead crews on standby at various locations around the streetcar network to address problems of power loss or overhead wires coming down.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\" />\n\nThe anti-freeze used on the overheard wire is also applied to streetcar switches on the network. In addition, the TTC runs \"storm cars\" on all routes to prevent any ice build-up on switches that the anti-freeze could not prevent.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\" />\n\nThese measures are applied only during freezing rain. However, during the ice storm of April 14\u201316, 2018, the TTC also used bus substitution on portions of the streetcar network outside the downtown area in order to concentrate streetcars and emergency crews into a smaller area.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Route_diversions/Ice_Storm1.jsp |title=Service changes in the event of an ice storm |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=April 16, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416220533/https://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Route_diversions/Ice_Storm1.jsp |archivedate=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track gauge==\n{{See also2|[[Toronto subway#Track|Toronto subway track gauge]]}}\nThe tracks of Toronto's streetcars and subways are built to the unique [[track gauge]] of {{Track gauge|58.875in|lk=on}}, {{convert|2+3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wider than the usual {{Track gauge|ussg|allk=on}}, which [[Line 3 Scarborough]] uses.<ref name=\"TorontoStar2010-01-06\">\n{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/01/06/transit_city_measures_up_to_international_standard.html |title=Transit City measures up to international standard |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Tess |last=Kalinowski |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archivedate=September 30, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930021110/http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/01/06/transit_city_measures_up_to_international_standard.html |url-status=live |quote=\"TTC gauge is 'English carriage gauge' and was used in Toronto well before the TTC was formed,\" explains transit blogger Steve Munro. \"There were two purposes: One was to make it impossible for the steam railways to use city tracks and the other (alleged) was to allow carriages and wagons to drive on the tracks when roads were impassable due to mud.\"}}</ref> The unique gauge has remained to this day because the integrated nature of the streetcar network makes it impossible to replace the gauge on part of the network without closing the entire network, which would be unacceptable given the extent of the system and its importance to transportation in Toronto.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Though often colloquially called the Toronto gauge, according to [[Steve Munro]], TTC gauge is \"English carriage gauge\".\n\n{{quotation|That the gauge of the said railways shall be such that the ordinary vehicles now in use may travel on the said tracks, and that it shall and may be lawful to and for all and every person and persons whatsoever to travel upon and use the said tracks with their vehicles loaded or empty, when and so often as they may please, provided they do not impede or interfere with the cars of the party of the second part (Toronto Street Railway), running thereon, and subject at all times to the right of the said party of the second part, his executors, and administrators and assigns to keep the said tracks with his and their cars, when meeting or overtaking any other vehicle thereon.<ref name=\"TT-4002\">{{cite web |url=http://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Toronto's Streetcars |work=Transit Toronto |date=3 January 2003 |access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref>}}\nAs wagons were normally built at standard gauge, the streetcar rails were selected to be slightly wider, allowing the wagons to ride on the inside sections of the rail, and the streetcars on the outside. The [[Williams Omnibus Bus Line]] changed the gauge of their buses in 1861 to fit this gauge. At the time, track for horsecars was not our modern 'T' rail, but wide and flat, with a raised section on the outside of the rail.\n[[File:Toronto Streetcar Grand Junction.jpg|thumb|A [[grand union]] at a streetcar intersection; Toronto has three grand unions, such as this one at Spadina Avenue and Queen]]\nAccording to the TTC, the City of Toronto feared that the street railway franchise operator, first in 1861, the [[Toronto Street Railway]], then in 1891, the [[Toronto Railway Company]], and in 1921, the TTC, would allow the operation of steam locomotives and freight trains [[street running|through city streets]], as was common practice in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] (until the 1950s) and in many US cities, such as [[New York City]] and [[Syracuse, New York]].<ref name=\"TorontoStar2010-01-06\" />\n\nStandard gauge [[Track (rail transport)|tracks]] in the streets would have allowed this, but steam railway equipment could not follow the [[Minimum railway curve radius|abrupt curves]] in the streetcar network. Opposition to freight operation in city streets precluded interchange even with adjacent [[Toronto radial lines|radial lines]] even after the lines [[Track gauge conversion|changed]] to TTC gauge. Electric railway freight cars could negotiate street curves, but freight operations to downtown were still not allowed until the final few years of radial operation by the TTC.\n\nSome proposals for the city's subway system involved using streetcars in the tunnels, possibly having some routes run partially in tunnels and partially on city streets, so the [[Toronto subway]] was built using the same gauge as streetcars, although ultimately, streetcars were never used as part of the subway system.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nBesides the Toronto streetcar and subway systems, the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] uses the Toronto gauge of {{RailGauge|58.875in}} for its museum streetcar line to accommodate its collection of Toronto subway trains and streetcars.\n\n===Pre-TTC===\nBefore TTC ownership, however, the streetcar gauge was either {{RailGauge|58.75in}} or {{convert|4|ft|11|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}<!-- {{RailGauge|59in}} -->, depending on the historical source, instead of today's {{RailGauge|58.875in}}.\n\nAccording to Raymond L.

The junction was used by both the [[Toronto Suburban Railway]] and the [[Toronto Railway Company]].\n\nHowever, Ken Heard, Consultant Museologist, Canadian Museums Association, was reported to say: \"One of the terms of these agreements was that the track gauge was to accommodate wagons. As horse car rail was step rail, the horse cars, equipped with iron wheels with flanges on the inside, ran on the outer, or upper step of the rail. Wagon wheels naturally did not have a flange. They were made of wood, with an iron tire. Wagons would use the inner, or lower step of the rail. The upper step of the rail guided the wagons on the track. In order to accommodate this arrangement, the track gauge had to be 4 feet, 11 inches. As the streets themselves were not paved, this arrangement permitted wagons carrying heavy loads a stable roadbed.\"<ref name=\"TT-4002\" /> In support of Heard's statement about the pre-TTC gauge, the Charter of the Toronto Railway Company said \"the gauge of system (4 ft. 11 in.) is to be maintained on main lines and extensions thereof\".<ref name=\"TRC-charter\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9kKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=toronto+railway+company+track+gauge&source=bl&ots=rnnt-eVs8_&sig=wR5iN4-FrEFQXr5NXJ7FiywWqys&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio4LKfr5TMAhUBPz4KHU5xBOMQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&q=toronto%20railway%20company%20track%20gauge&f=false |title=The charter of the Toronto Railway Company |publisher=City of Toronto |pages=21 |author=City solicitor |date=1892 |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n[[Image:RoncyMaintBays.jpg|thumb|Maintenance tracks at [[Roncesvalles Carhouse]], one of four maintenance and storage facilities used by the streetcar network]]\n\n===Dedicated station===\n{{ttcs|Queens Quay}} is the one standalone underground station that does not connect to the subway.

Many of these are also interchange points with subway or bus services.\n\n===Carhouses===\nToronto's streetcars are housed and maintained at various carhouses or \"streetcar barns\":\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Facility details'''\n!Yard\n!Location\n!Year opened\n!Notes\n|-\n| [[Hillcrest Complex]]\n| [[Davenport Road]] and [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]]\n| 1924\n| Newly built by TTC on former site of farm and later Toronto Driving Club track; services streetcars and buses, repair facilities\n|-\n| [[Roncesvalles Carhouse]]\n| [[Queen Street (Toronto)|Queen Street West]] and Roncesvalles Avenue\n| 1895 (for TRC); rebuilt 1921 (by TTC)\n| Property acquired [[Toronto Railway Company]], but new carbarn built in 1921 with indoor inspection and repair facility and outdoor streetcar storage tracks\n|-\n| [[Russell Carhouse|Russell (Connaught Avenue) Carhouse]]\n| Connaught Avenue and Queen Street East\n| 1913 (by TRC and 1916 carhouse added); 1924 (rebuilt by TTC)\n| Built for the [[Toronto Railway Company]] as paint shop and 1916 carhouse built to replace King carhouse lost to a fire in 1916; acquired by the TTC in 1921 and rebuilt in 1924 with indoor maintenance facility and outdoor streetcar storage tracks\n|-\n| [[Leslie Barns]]\n| Leslie Street and Lake Shore Boulevard East \u2013 southeast corner\n| November 2015\n| Carhouse opened November 2015 and receiving some of Flexity fleet (100 of the 204 cars);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Projects_and_initiatives/New_Streetcars_Light_Rail_Vehicles/Ashbridges_Bay_Light%20Rail_Vehicle_LRV_Maintenance_and_Storag.jsp |title=Ashbridges Bay Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) Maintenance and Storage Facility |date=May 2010 |publisher=Toronto Transit Commission |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |work=ttc.ca}}</ref> fully opened in early 2016\n|}\n\n'''Inactive carhouses once part of the TTC's streetcar operations:'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Facility details'''\n!Yard\n!Location\n!Year opened\n!Year closed\n!Notes\n|-\n| Danforth Carhouse\n| [[Danforth Avenue]] and Coxwell Avenue\n| 1915; 1921\u201322 (additions by TTC)\n| 2002\n| built for the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] in 1915 and additional indoor storage added by TTC in 1921\u201322; re-purposed as bus garage in 1967; closed in 2002 but still used by TTC for storage and office space<ref name=\"TT-8307\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/bus/8307.shtml |title=Danforth Carhouse And Garage |work=Transit Toronto |first=Godfrey |last=Mallion |date=August 26, 2017 |accessdate=March 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| Dundas Carhouse<ref>http://www.stevemunro.ca/?p=392</ref>\n| [[Dundas Street]] West and Howard Park Avenue\n| 1907\n| 1936\n| Original acquired from TRC (built in 1907), but carhouse was demolished in 1921 but retained for storage for 60 cars; [[Wye (rail)|wye]] and runaround loop since disappeared and area re-developed with cars moving to Roncesvalles\n|-\n| Eglinton (Yonge) Carhouse\n| [[Eglinton Avenue]] West and [[Yonge Street]]\n| 1922\n| 2002; demolished\n| Built to replace TRC Yorkville Carhouse and retired as carhouse in 1948 to become bus garage until 2002; most of facility now demolished and remainder used as temporary bus terminal\n|-\n| George Street Yard\n| 170 The Esplanade East\n| 1894?\n| 1960s\n| Used to store and scrap streetcars; now part of David Crombie Park built along with the St. Lawrence housing project (built between 1960s to 1990s)\n|-\n| Harbour Yard\n| Lakeshore Boulevard between Bay and York Streets\n| 1951\n| 1954\n| Built as temporary outdoor storage space for Peter Witt cars after Eglinton Carhouse closed to streetcars; tracks removed 1954; now site of parking lot and office towers\n|-\n| Lansdowne Carhouse\n| [[Lansdowne Avenue]] and Paton Avenue\n| 1911\n| 1996; demolished 2003\n| Built for the [[Toronto Railway Company]] and acquired by TTC in 1921; became a trolley bus garage in 1947 and streetcar storage ended 1967; abandoned after 1996 and demolished 2003\n|-\n| TRC Motor Shops\n| 165 Front Street East\n| 1886\u20131887\n| 1924\n| Built for Toronto Street Railway near St Lawrence Market as horse stables and became electrical generating plant 1891 after horsecar converted to electric car operations by Toronto Railway Company; later as storage space 1906 and acquired by TTC in 1921; used until 1924 and deemed surplus in 1970s; sold to Young People's Theatre 1977\n|-\n| [[Wychwood Barns|St. Clair (Wychwood) Carhouse]]\n| Wychwood Avenue south of [[St. Clair Avenue]] West\n| 1914\n| 1978\n| Built for the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] in 1914 and expanded 1916.

It was adapted from a novel of the same name by [[Arthur Herzog]].

It received very negative reviews from critics and was a box-office failure. ''The Swarm'' has been considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst movies ever made]].<ref name=\"lh\">''Halliwell's film and video guide 2002'' edited by John Walker. London. HarperCollins Entertainment, 2001. {{ISBN|0007122659}}  (p. 804).</ref> Despite this, it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] ([[Paul Zastupnevich]]).\n\n==Plot==\nA group of soldiers led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman) are ordered to investigate the basement level of a [[Missile launch facility|missile base]], which appears to have been attacked, and the garrison all but wiped out. After Baker contacts his commander, General Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate a civilian van found parked at the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist, Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), one of the few survivors of the attack, but not someone stationed at the base. Slater orders two helicopters to track a large airborne mass moving slowly away from the base. The mass is revealed to be a swarm of bees, which engulfs the two helicopters, killing their crews. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by this swarm, composed of deadly [[African killer bees]]. Slater doesn't trust Crane, but Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.\n\nMeanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. Their teenage son, Paul Durant (Christian Juttner), manages to escape in a [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]], although he is also stung, and crashes into the [[Marysville, Texas|Marysville]] town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, on account of the after-effects of the bee stings.\n\nMuch to Slater's annoyance, Crane is put in charge by the [[President of the United States|President]] and calls in many experts to help. Wheelchair-bound Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) arrives at the base and confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started with the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens), who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation, and overrules him, instead focusing on a solution that will kill the bees without harming people and the environment.\n\nRecovering from his earlier bee attack, Paul and two of his friends go in search of the hive to firebomb it, which results only in angering the bees, which make their way to Marysville and kill hundreds, including some children at the local school. Crane and Helena take shelter at the local diner, with pregnant caf\u00e9 waitress Rita (Patty Duke). Reporter Anne McGregor (Lee Grant), watches from the safety of her news van, hoping to get some exciting footage about the siege. After this most recent attack, Slater suggests evacuating many of the townsfolk in a train. However, the bees engulf the train as well, causing it to derail and crash, killing most of the occupants including a love triangle made up of school superintendent Maureen Scheuster (Olivia De Havilland), retiree Felix Austin (Ben Johnson), and town mayor and drug-store owner Clarence Tuttle (Fred MacMurray).\n\nConfined to a hospital bed, Rita gives birth to her child, falling in love with the doctor in the process, but Paul, who has fallen ill again, succumbs to the after-effects of the stings and dies, devastating Helena. The savage swarm heads for Houston, so Crane drops eco-friendly poison pellets designed by Dr. Hubbard (Richard Chamberlain) on them, but the bees ignore the pellets, evidently intelligent enough to sense danger. Working on an antidote to the bees' venom, Dr. Krim self-injects to keep track of the results; the trial proves fatal and Krim dies from the effects of the venom. Meanwhile, nuclear power plant manager Dr. Andrews (Jos\u00e9 Ferrer), ignoring the warnings of Dr. Hubbard, is convinced that his plant can withstand the attacks of the bees. However, the bees invade the plant, killing both Andrews and Hubbard, as well as completely destroying the plant and wiping out an entire town.\n\nWashington orders that operations to stop the bees be placed under military control and Slater takes charge. He orders the evacuated city of Houston to be deliberately torched by soldiers with flame-throwers, hoping the conflagration will destroy the swarm. Helena, who was stung during the attack on Marysville, falls seriously ill again. Crane analyzes tapes from the original bee attack of the base and comes to the conclusion that their alarm system attracted the swarm into the base as the sound resembled a signal from the swarm's [[Queen bee|queen]]. The bees break into the headquarters building so Slater and Baker use a flame thrower to allow Crane and Helena to escape, but at the cost of their own lives. Helicopters successfully manage to lure the bees out to sea by placing floating buoys with speakers emitting the sound Crane discovered into an area of water doused with oil. When the swarm arrives, the oil is set ablaze by missiles fired from the nearby coast, destroying all of the bees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Dr. Bradford Crane\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Helena Anderson\n* [[Richard Widmark]] as General Thaddeus Slater\n* [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Dr. Hubbard\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as Maureen Schuester\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Felix Austin\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Anne MacGregor\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as Dr. Andrews\n* [[Patty Duke]] as Rita Bard\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Jud Hawkins\n* [[Bradford Dillman]] as Major Baker\n* [[Fred MacMurray]] as Clarence Tuttle\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Dr. Walter Krim\n* [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as General Thompson\n* [[Christian Juttner]] as Paul Durant\n* [[Morgan Paull]] as Dr. Newman\n* [[Alejandro Rey]] as Dr. Martinez\n* [[Don \"Red\" Barry]] as Pete Harris\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was announced in 1974 at the height of the disaster movie craze. It was part of $38 million worth of projects Irwin Allen had lined up, others including ''The Day the World Ended'' (a project which was retitled and released in 1980 as ''[[When Time Ran Out...]]''.) <ref>Film disasters......hit Hollywood\nHuddy, John.

A total of 100 people were employed in the production to care for and transport the bees during the film shoot.

The film is listed in [[Golden Raspberry Award]] founder [[John J.B. Wilson]]'s book ''[[The Official Razzie Movie Guide]]'' as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made, where Wilson states that under Allen's unsubtle direction, \"despite the enormous production budget, ''The Swarm'' turned the tale of an invasion of killer bees into the ultimate [[B movie]].\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst |year=2005|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=0-446-69334-0}}</ref> \n\nIt has a score of 11% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 19 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Swarm (1978) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/swarm |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"nothing less than the ultimate apotheosis of yesterday's B-movie.\" Comparing the film unfavorably to recent blockbusters like ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' which also evoked old B-movies, he wrote that \"Allen merely reproduces a tacky genre while spending a great deal of money doing it. There's not a frame of film, not a twist of plot, not a line of dialogue, not a performance in ''The Swarm'' that suggests real appreciation for film history, only a slavish desire to imitate it.

It was adapted from a novel of the same name by [[Arthur Herzog]]. Directed by [[Irwin Allen]], the cast features [[Michael Caine]], [[Katharine Ross]], [[Richard Widmark]], [[Richard Chamberlain]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Lee Grant]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]], [[Patty Duke]], [[Slim Pickens]], [[Bradford Dillman]], [[Fred MacMurray]] and [[Henry Fonda]]. It received very negative reviews from critics and was a box-office failure. ''The Swarm'' has been considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst movies ever made]]. <ref name=\"lh\">''Halliwell's film and video guide 2002'' edited by John Walker. London. HarperCollins Entertainment, 2001. {{ISBN|0007122659}}  (p. 804).</ref> Despite this, it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] ([[Paul Zastupnevich]]).\n\n==Plot==\nA group of soldiers led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman) are ordered to investigate the basement level of a [[Missile launch facility|missile base]], which appears to have been attacked, and the garrison all but wiped out. After Baker contacts his commander, General Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate a civilian van found parked at the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist, Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), one of the few survivors of the attack, but not someone stationed at the base. Slater orders two helicopters to track a large airborne mass moving slowly away from the base. The mass is revealed to be a swarm of bees, which engulfs the two helicopters, killing their crews. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by this swarm, composed of deadly [[African killer bees]]. Slater doesn't trust Crane, but Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.\n\nMeanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. Their teenage son, Paul Durant (Christian Juttner), manages to escape in a [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]], although he is also stung, and crashes into the [[Marysville, Texas|Marysville]] town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, on account of the after-effects of the bee stings.\n\nMuch to Slater's annoyance, Crane is put in charge by the [[President of the United States|President]] and calls in many experts to help. Wheelchair-bound Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) arrives at the base and confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started with the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens), who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation, and overrules him, instead focusing on a solution that will kill the bees without harming people and the environment.\n\nRecovering from his earlier bee attack, Paul and two of his friends go in search of the hive to firebomb it, which results only in angering the bees, which make their way to Marysville and kill hundreds, including some children at the local school. Crane and Helena take shelter at the local diner, with pregnant caf\u00e9 waitress Rita (Patty Duke). Reporter Anne McGregor (Lee Grant), watches from the safety of her news van, hoping to get some exciting footage about the siege. After this most recent attack, Slater suggests evacuating many of the townsfolk in a train. However, the bees engulf the train as well, causing it to derail and crash, killing most of the occupants including a love triangle made up of school superintendent Maureen Scheuster (Olivia De Havilland), retiree Felix Austin (Ben Johnson), and town mayor and drug-store owner Clarence Tuttle (Fred MacMurray).\n\nConfined to a hospital bed, Rita gives birth to her child, falling in love with the doctor in the process, but Paul, who has fallen ill again, succumbs to the after-effects of the stings and dies, devastating Helena. The savage swarm heads for Houston, so Crane drops eco-friendly poison pellets designed by Dr. Hubbard (Richard Chamberlain) on them, but the bees ignore the pellets, evidently intelligent enough to sense danger. Working on an antidote to the bees' venom, Dr. Krim self-injects to keep track of the results; the trial proves fatal and Krim dies from the effects of the venom. Meanwhile, nuclear power plant manager Dr. Andrews (Jos\u00e9 Ferrer), ignoring the warnings of Dr. Hubbard, is convinced that his plant can withstand the attacks of the bees. However, the bees invade the plant, killing both Andrews and Hubbard, as well as completely destroying the plant and wiping out an entire town.\n\nWashington orders that operations to stop the bees be placed under military control and Slater takes charge. He orders the evacuated city of Houston to be deliberately torched by soldiers with flame-throwers, hoping the conflagration will destroy the swarm. Helena, who was stung during the attack on Marysville, falls seriously ill again. Crane analyzes tapes from the original bee attack of the base and comes to the conclusion that their alarm system attracted the swarm into the base as the sound resembled a signal from the swarm's [[Queen bee|queen]]. The bees break into the headquarters building so Slater and Baker use a flame thrower to allow Crane and Helena to escape, but at the cost of their own lives. Helicopters successfully manage to lure the bees out to sea by placing floating buoys with speakers emitting the sound Crane discovered into an area of water doused with oil. When the swarm arrives, the oil is set ablaze by missiles fired from the nearby coast, destroying all of the bees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Dr. Bradford Crane\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Helena Anderson\n* [[Richard Widmark]] as General Thaddeus Slater\n* [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Dr. Hubbard\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as Maureen Schuester\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Felix Austin\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Anne MacGregor\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as Dr. Andrews\n* [[Patty Duke]] as Rita Bard\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Jud Hawkins\n* [[Bradford Dillman]] as Major Baker\n* [[Fred MacMurray]] as Clarence Tuttle\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Dr. Walter Krim\n* [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as General Thompson\n* [[Christian Juttner]] as Paul Durant\n* [[Morgan Paull]] as Dr. Newman\n* [[Alejandro Rey]] as Dr. Martinez\n* [[Don \"Red\" Barry]] as Pete Harris\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was announced in 1974 at the height of the disaster movie craze.

''The Second Intifada: Background and Causes of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict''. [https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/jcs/article/view/220/378] \"What caused the outbreak of the second intifada? The conventional wisdom places the blame on one of two central figures, Ariel Sharon or Yasser Arafat. In one version, Sharon, then the leader of the Israeli opposition, started the intifada by going on an intentionally provocative visit to the Temple Mount on 28 September 2000. Alternatively, Arafat, President of the Palestinian Authority (PA), decided that the new State of Palestine should be launched in blood and fire; he unleashed Palestinian militants rather than accept a negotiated resolution of the conflict... This discontent, further fed by the failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000, laid the groundwork for popular support for a more confrontational approach with Israel... This tendency to believe in the efficacy of force was reinforced for some Palestinians when Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000.\"</ref> The violence started in September 2000, after [[Ariel Sharon]] made a visit to the [[Temple Mount]], seen by [[Palestinians]] as highly provocative.<ref name=pressman/> Palestinian demonstrators threw stones at police and were dispersed by the [[Israeli army]], using [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=Mitchell_cause/>\n\nHigh numbers of casualties were caused among civilians as well as combatants.

However, the violence continued into the following years, though suicide bombings decreased significantly.\n\n==Etymology==\n'''Second Intifada''' refers to a second Palestinian uprising, following the [[First Intifada|first Palestinian uprising]], which occurred between December 1987 and 1993. [[wikt:intifada|\"Intifada\"]] ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0636\u0629}}) translates into English as \"uprising.\" Its root is an Arabic word meaning \"the shaking off.\" It has been used in the meaning of \"insurrection\" in various Arab countries; the [[1977 Egyptian bread riots|Egyptian riots of 1977]], for example, were called the \"bread intifada\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://libcom.org/history/1977-egypts-bread-intifada |title = 1977: Egypt&#039;s bread intifada}}</ref> The term refers to a revolt against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories.\n\n'''Al-Aqsa Intifada''' refers to the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], the place where the intifada started. It is the name of a mosque, constructed in the 8th century CE at Al-Haram Al-Sharif, also known as the [[Temple Mount]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], a location considered the holiest site in Judaism and third holiest in Islam.\n\nThe Intifada is sometimes called the '''Oslo War''' (\u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u05dc\u05d5) by some Israelis who consider it to be the result of concessions made by Israel following the [[Oslo Accords]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Itamar Rabinovich |year=2004 |title=Waging Peace: Israel and the Arabs, 1948\u20132003 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0691119823 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wagingpeaceisrae00rabi_0/page/306 306] |author-link=Itamar Rabinovich |url=https://archive.org/details/wagingpeaceisrae00rabi_0/page/306 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Devin Sper |year=2004 |title=The Future of Israel |publisher=Sy Publishing |isbn=978-0976161301 |page=[https://archive.org/details/futureofisrael0000sper/page/335 335] |url=https://archive.org/details/futureofisrael0000sper/page/335 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Binyamin Elon |year=2005 |title=God's Covenant With Israel: Establishing Biblical Boundaries in Today's World |publisher=Balfour Books |isbn=978-0892216277 |page=45|author-link=Binyamin Elon }}</ref> and '''Arafat's War''', after the [[Yasser Arafat|late Palestinian leader]] whom some blamed for starting it.

For their part, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] formally recognised Israel and committed to adopting responsibility for internal security in population centres in the areas evacuated. Palestinian self-rule was to last for a five-year interim period during which a permanent agreement would be negotiated. However, the realities on the ground left both sides deeply disappointed with the Oslo process.  Israelis and Palestinians have blamed each other for the failure of the Oslo peace process.  In the five years immediately following the signing of the Oslo accords, 405 Palestinians <!-- (source: B'Tselem) --> and 256 Israelis were killed, which for the latter represented a casualty count higher than that of the previous fifteen years combined (216, 172 of whom were killed during the [[First Intifada]]).\n\nFrom 1996 Israel made extensive contingency plans and preparations, collectively code-named \"Musical Charm,\" in the eventuality that peace talks might fail. In 1998, after concluding that the 5-year plan stipulated in the Oslo Talks would not be completed, the IDF implemented an Operation Field of Thorns plan to conquer towns in Area C, and some areas of Gaza, and military exercises at regimental level were carried out in April 2000 to that end. Palestinian preparations were defensive, and small scale, more to reassure the local population than to cope with an eventual attack from Israel. The intensity of these operations led one Brigadier General, Zvi Fogel to wonder whether Israel's military preparations would not turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.<ref>Hillel Frisch,[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLdwp_4BZhMC&pg=PA102 ''The Palestinian Military: Between Militias and Armies,'' ] Routledge, 2010 p.102.</ref>\n\nIn 1995, [[Shimon Peres]] took the place of [[Yitzhak Rabin]], who had been [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassinated]] by [[Yigal Amir]], a Jewish extremist opposed to the Oslo peace agreement. In the 1996 elections, Israelis elected a right-wing<ref name=\"Schmemann\" /> coalition led by the [[Likud]] candidate, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] who was followed in 1999 by the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]] leader [[Ehud Barak]].\n\n===Camp David Summit===\nFrom 11 to 25 July 2000, the [[2000 Camp David Summit|Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David]] was held between United States [[President of the United States of America|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]], and [[Palestinian Authority]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]]. The talks ultimately failed with each side blaming the other.

The Israeli government gave up hope for negotiated settlement to the conflict and pursued a unilateral policy of physically separating Israel from Palestinian communities by beginning construction on the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]]. Israel claims the barrier is necessary to prevent Palestinian attackers from entering Israeli cities. Palestinians claim the barrier separates Palestinian communities from each other and that the construction plan is a de facto annexation of Palestinian territory.\n\nFollowing a 4 October [[Maxim restaurant suicide bombing|suicide bombing in Maxim restaurant]], [[Haifa]], which claimed the lives of 21 Israelis, Israel claimed that Syria and [[Iran]] sponsored the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement|Islamic Jihad]] and [[Hezbollah]], and were responsible for the terrorist attack.

Between September 2000 and May 2004, ninety tunnels connecting Egypt and the Gaza Strip were found and destroyed. Raids in Rafah left many families homeless. Israel's official stance is that their houses were captured by militants and were destroyed during battles with IDF forces.

Hamas vowed to continue the armed struggle sending numerous [[Qassam rocket]]s into open fields near [[Nahal Oz]], and hitting a [[kindergarten]] in [[Gush Katif|Kfar Darom]] with an anti-tank missile.\n\nOn 9 December five Palestinians weapon smugglers were killed and two were arrested in the border between Rafah and [[Egypt]]. Later that day, [[Jamal Abu Samhadana]] and two of his bodyguards were injured by a missile strike. In the first Israeli airstrike against militants in weeks, an unmanned Israeli drone plane launched one missile at Abu Samahdna's car as it travelled between Rafah and Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. It was the fourth attempt on Samhadana's life by Israel. Samhadana is one of two leaders of the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] and one of the main forces behind the smuggling tunnels. Samhadana is believed to be responsible for the [[Improvised explosive device|blast]] against an American diplomatic convoy in Gaza that killed three Americans.\n\nOn 10 December, in response to Hamas firing mortar rounds into the Neveh Dekalim settlement in the Gaza Strip and wounding four Israelis (including an 8-year-old boy), Israeli soldiers fired at the Khan Younis refugee camp (the origin of the mortars) killing a 7-year-old girl. An IDF source confirmed troops opened fire at Khan Younis, but said they aimed at Hamas mortar crews.\n\nThe largest attack since the death of Yasser Arafat claimed the lives of five Israeli soldiers on 12 December, wounding ten others. Approximately 1.5 tons of explosives were detonated in a tunnel under an Israeli military-controlled border crossing on the Egyptian border with Gaza near Rafah, collapsing several structures and damaging others. The explosion destroyed part of the outpost and killed three soldiers. Two Palestinian militants then penetrated the outpost and killed two other Israeli soldiers with gunfire. It is believed that Hamas and a new Fatah faction, the \"Fatah Hawks\", conducted the highly organised and coordinated attack. A spokesman, \"Abu Majad\", claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of the [[Fatah Hawks]] claiming it was in retaliation for \"the assassination\" of Yasser Arafat, charging he was poisoned by Israel.\n\n===2005===\n[[2005 Palestinian presidential election|Palestinian presidential elections]] were held on 9 January, and [[Mahmoud Abbas]] (Abu Mazen) was elected as the president of the PA.

Although Abbas called on militants to halt attacks against Israel, he promised them protection from Israeli incursions and did not advocate disarmament by force.\n\nViolence continued in the Gaza Strip, and [[Ariel Sharon]] froze all diplomatic and security contacts with the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. Spokesman Assaf Shariv declared that \"Israel informed international leaders today that there will be no meetings with Abbas until he makes a real effort to stop the terror.\" The freezing of contacts came less than one week after Mahmoud Abbas was elected, and the day before his inauguration.

Although attacks on Israelis did not stop completely, they decreased sharply. On 8 February 2005, at the [[Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005]], Sharon and Abbas declared a mutual [[truce]] between Israel and the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. They shook hands at a four-way summit that also included [[Jordan]] and [[Egypt]] at [[Sharm al-Sheikh]]. However, Hamas and [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement|Islamic Jihad]] said the truce is not binding for their members.

He also fired senior commanders in the Palestinian security apparatus. On 10 February, [[Israeli security forces]] arrested Maharan Omar Shucat Abu Hamis, a Palestinian resident of [[Nablus]], who was about to launch a bus [[suicide attack]] in the [[French Hill]] in [[Jerusalem]].\n\nOn 13 February 2005, Abbas entered into talks with the leaders of the Islamic Jihad and the Hamas, for them to rally behind him and respect the truce. Ismail Haniyah, a senior leader of the group Hamas said that \"its position regarding calm will continue unchanged and Israel will bear responsibility for any new violation or aggression.\"\n\nIn the middle of June, Palestinian factions intensified bombardment over the city of [[Sderot]] with improvised [[Qassam rocket]]s. Palestinian attacks resulted in 2 Palestinians and 1 Chinese civilian killed by a Qassam, and 2 Israelis were killed. The wave of attacks lessened support for the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement plan]] among the Israeli public. Attacks on Israel by the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement|Islamic Jihad]] and the [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] increased in July, and on 12 July, a [[Suicide attack|suicide bombing]] hit the coastal city of [[Netanya]], killing 5 civilians. On 14 July, Hamas started to shell Israeli settlements inside and outside the [[Gaza Strip]] with dozens of Qassam rockets, killing an Israeli woman. On 15 July, Israel resumed its \"targeted killing\" policy, killing 7 Hamas militants and bombing about 4 Hamas facilities. The continuation of shelling rockets over Israeli settlements, and street battles between Hamas militants and Palestinian policemen, threatened to shatter the truce agreed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005.

In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at \"provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative\".</blockquote>\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization, according to the same report, denied that the Intifada was planned, and asserted that \"Camp David represented nothing less than an attempt by Israel to extend the force it exercises on the ground to negotiations.\" The report also stated:\n\n<blockquote>From the perspective of the PLO, Israel responded to the disturbances with excessive and illegal use of deadly force against demonstrators; behavior which, in the PLO's view, reflected Israel's contempt for the lives and safety of Palestinians. For Palestinians, the widely seen images of Muhammad al-Durrah in Gaza on September 30, shot as he huddled behind his father, reinforced that perception.</blockquote>\n\nThe Mitchell report concluded:\n\n<blockquote>The Sharon visit did not cause the \"Al-Aqsa Intifada\". But it was poorly timed and the provocative effect should have been foreseen; indeed it was foreseen by those who urged that the visit be prohibited.</blockquote>\n\nand also:\n\n<blockquote>We have no basis on which to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the PA to initiate a campaign of violence at the first opportunity; or to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the [Government of Israel] to respond with lethal force.</blockquote>\n\n==Views on the Second Intifada==\nPalestinians have claimed that Sharon's visit was the beginning of the Second Intifada,<ref name=bbctimeline/> while others have claimed that Yasser Arafat had pre-planned the uprising.<ref name=toameh/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Suha-Arafat-admits-husband-premeditated-Intifada|title=Suha Arafat admits husband premeditated Intifada|work=Jerusalem Post|date=29 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome, like [[Bill Clinton]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Clinton |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Clinton |title=My Life |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2004 |isbn=1-4000-3003-X}}</ref> say that tensions were high due to failed negotiations at the [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David Summit]] in July 2000.

During the summit, Israel expressed its willingness to make far-reaching and unprecedented compromises in order to arrive at a workable, enduring agreement. However, Yasser Arafat chose to break off the negotiations without even offering any proposals of his own. Consequently, the summit adjourned with President Clinton placing the blame for its failure squarely at Arafat's feet. ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that the wave of Palestinian terrorism, which began in the wake of the Camp David summit failure, has nothing to do with a spontaneous Palestinian action to \"resist the occupation.\" The Palestinian leadership had taken a strategic decision to abandon the path to peace and to use violence as their primary tactic for advancing their agenda. This decision undermined the bedrock foundation of the peace process \u2013 the understanding that a solution can only be reached through compromise rather than inflexibility, and through negotiation rather than violence.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The Palestinian claim that Israel's presence in the territories caused the terrorism began as a desperate attempt to deflect criticism after Arafat rejected Israel's peace proposals. It quickly evolved into an excuse for the inexcusable \u2013 the indiscriminate murder of innocent civilians.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrorist attacks can never be justified, and they are particularly tragic when the disputed issues could have been settled through negotiations. The Palestinian Authority had been given a real opportunity to end the conflict through negotiations. However, Israel's olive branch was met with a hail of gunfire and a barrage of suicide bombers. The greatest obstacle to peace is not the lack of a Palestinian state, rather it is the existence of Palestinian terrorism.}}</ref><ref name=biri-IMFA/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/terrorism/palestinian/pages/palestinian%20violence%20and%20terrorism%20since%20september.aspx |title=Palestinian violence and terrorism since September 2000 |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=28 September 2014 |quote=The events of last few days represent the latest and most severe developments in a wave of violence that has been building in recent weeks.

An additional 22 Israelis were killed by actions of their own side.<ref name=\"statspage\"/>\n\nIPICT counts \"probable combatants\" in its total of combatants.

For example, in many cases where an incident has resulted in a large number of Palestinian casualties, the only information available is that an individual was killed when Israeli soldiers returned fire in response to shots fired from a particular location. While it is possible that the person killed had not been active in the fighting and just happened to be in the vicinity of people who were, it is reasonable to assume that the number of such coincidental deaths is not particularly high. Where the accounts of an incident appear to support such a coincidence, the individual casualty has been given the benefit of the doubt, and assigned a non-combatant status.<ref name=statspage/></blockquote>\n\nIn the same 2002 IPICT full report there is a pie chart (Graph 2.9) that lists the IPICT combatant breakdown for Palestinian deaths through September 2002.

Hamas is officially declared as a [[List of terrorist organisations|terrorist organization]] by the United States and the European Union and its gaining control over the Palestinian Authority (such as by forming the government) would jeopardize international funds to the PA, by laws forbidding sponsoring of terrorist group.\n\nOn 9 June, seven members of the Ghalia family [[Gaza beach blast|were killed]] on a Gaza beach. The cause of the explosion remains uncertain. Nevertheless, in response, Hamas declared an end to its commitment to a ceasefire declared in 2005 and announced the resumption of attacks on Israelis. Palestinians blame an Israeli artillery shelling of nearby locations in the northern Gaza Strip for the deaths, while an Israeli military inquiry cleared itself from the charges.\n\nOn 25 June, a military outpost was attacked by Palestinian militants and a gunbattle followed that left 2 Israeli soldiers and 3 Palestinian militants dead. Corporal [[Gilad Shalit]], an Israeli soldier, was captured and Israel warned of an imminent [[Operation Summer Rains|military response]] if the soldier was not returned unharmed. In the early hours of 28 June Israeli tanks, APCs and troops entered the Gaza strip just hours after the air force had taken out two main bridges and the only powerstation in the strip, effectively shutting down electricity and water.

They waged a high-intensity campaign of [[guerrilla warfare]] against Israeli military and civilian targets inside Israel and in the occupied territory, utilizing tactics such as [[ambush]]es, [[sniper|sniper attacks]], and [[suicide bombing]]s. Military equipment was mostly imported, while some light arms, hand grenades and [[explosive belt]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, and [[Qassam rocket]]s were indigenously produced. They also increased use of remote-controlled [[land mine|landmines]] against Israeli armor, a tactic that was highly popular among the poorly armed groups. [[Car bomb]]s were often used against \"lightly hardened\" targets such as Israeli armored jeeps and checkpoints.

Conducted as a single or double bombing, suicide bombings were generally conducted against \"soft\" targets, or \"lightly hardened\" targets (such as checkpoints) to try to raise the cost of the war to Israelis and demoralize the Israeli society. Most suicide bombing attacks (although not all) targeted civilians, and conducted on crowded places in Israeli cities, such as public transport, restaurants, and markets.\n\nOne recent development is the use of [[Child suicide bombers in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict|suicide bombs carried by children]]. Unlike most suicide bombings, the use of these not only earned condemnation from the United States and from human rights groups such as [[Amnesty International]], but also from many Palestinians and much of the Middle East press. The youngest Palestinian [[Child suicide bombers in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict|suicide bomber]] was 16-year-old Issa Bdeir, a high school student from the village of Al Doha, who shocked his friends and family when he blew himself up in a park in [[Rishon LeZion]], killing a teenage boy and an elderly man.

The IDF stressed the safety of their troops, using such heavily armored equipment as the [[Merkava]] heavy tank and armored personnel carriers, and carried out airstrikes with various military aircraft including [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]], [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone aircraft]] and [[Attack helicopter|helicopter gunships]] to strike militant targets. Much of the ground fighting was conducted house-to-house by well-armed and well-trained infantry. Due to its superior training, equipment, and numbers, the IDF had the upper hand during street fighting. Palestinian armed groups suffered heavy losses during combat, but the operations were often criticized internationally due to the civilian casualties often caused. Palestinian metalworking shops and other business facilities suspected by Israel of being used to manufacture weapons are regularly targeted by airstrikes, as well as Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels.\n\nIsraeli [[IDF Caterpillar D9|Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]]s were routinely employed to detonate [[booby trap]]s and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]], to demolish houses along the border with Egypt that were used for shooting at Israeli troops, to create \"buffer zones\", and to support military operations in the West Bank. Until February 2005, Israel had in place a policy to demolish the family homes of suicide bombers after giving them a notice to evacuate. Due to the considerable number of Palestinians living in single homes, the large quantity of homes destroyed, and collateral damage from home demolitions, it became an increasingly controversial tactic. Families began providing timely information to Israeli forces regarding suicide bombing activities in order to prevent the demolition of their homes, although families doing so risked being executed or otherwise punished for [[collaborationism|collaboration]], either by the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] or extrajudicially by Palestinian militants. The IDF committee studying the issue recommended ending the practice because the policy was not effective enough to justify its costs to Israel's image internationally and the backlash it created among Palestinians.<ref>[[Gabi Siboni]], [http://www.inss.org.il/uploadimages/Import/(FILE)1298360394.pdf Defeating Suicide Terrorism in Judea and Samaria, 2002\u20132005], \"'''[[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|Military and Strategic Affairs]]'''\", Volume 2, No. 2, October 2010.</ref>\n\nWith complete ground and air superiority, mass arrests were regularly conducted by Israeli military and police forces; at any given time, there were about 6,000 Palestinian prisoners detained in Israeli prisons, about half of them held temporarily without a final indictment, in accordance with Israeli law.\n\nThe tactic of military \"[[curfew]]\" \u2013 long-term lockdown of civilian areas \u2013 was used extensively by Israel throughout the Intifada. The longest curfew was in [[Nablus]], which was kept under curfew for over 100 consecutive days, with generally under two hours per day allowed for people to get food or conduct other business.\n\nSecurity [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|Checkpoints]] and roadblocks were erected inside and between Palestinian cities, subjecting all people and vehicles to security inspection for free passage. Israel defended those checkpoints as being necessary to stop militants and limit the ability to move weapons around. However some Palestinian, Israeli and International observers and organizations have criticized the checkpoints as excessive, humiliating, and a major cause of the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Territories. Transit could be delayed by several hours, depending on the security situation in Israel. Sniper towers were used extensively in the Gaza Strip before the Israeli [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|pullout]].\n\nThe Israeli intelligence services [[Shin Bet]] and [[Mossad]] penetrated Palestinian militant organizations by relying on moles and sources within armed groups, tapping communication lines, and aerial reconnaissance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polis.leeds.ac.uk/assets/files/research/working-papers/wp16jones.pdf |publisher=School of Politics and International Studies |title= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> within the groups the [[Israeli Security Forces]] (IDF, Magav, police [[YAMAM]] and Mistaravim SF units) to thwart hundreds of suicide bombings by providing real-time warnings and reliable intelligence reports, and a list of Palestinians marked for targeted killings.\n\nIsrael extensively used \"[[Israeli targeted killings|targeted killings]]\", the assassinations of Palestinian leaders involved in perpetrating attacks against Israelis, to eliminate imminent threats and to deter others from following suit, relying primarily on airstrikes and covert operations by [[Shin Bet]] to carry them out.

In one of the most controversial killings, the [[Mossad]] (Israeli foreign intelligence service) allegedly killed Hamas leader [[Mahmoud al-Mabhouh]] in [[Dubai]], using forged passports to slip agents into Dubai.

The conventional wisdom places the blame on one of two central figures, Ariel Sharon or Yasser Arafat. In one version, Sharon, then the leader of the Israeli opposition, started the intifada by going on an intentionally provocative visit to the Temple Mount on 28 September 2000. Alternatively, Arafat, President of the Palestinian Authority (PA), decided that the new State of Palestine should be launched in blood and fire; he unleashed Palestinian militants rather than accept a negotiated resolution of the conflict... This discontent, further fed by the failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000, laid the groundwork for popular support for a more confrontational approach with Israel... This tendency to believe in the efficacy of force was reinforced for some Palestinians when Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000.\"</ref> The violence started in September 2000, after [[Ariel Sharon]] made a visit to the [[Temple Mount]], seen by [[Palestinians]] as highly provocative.<ref name=pressman/> Palestinian demonstrators threw stones at police and were dispersed by the [[Israeli army]], using [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=Mitchell_cause/>\n\nHigh numbers of casualties were caused among civilians as well as combatants.

However, the violence continued into the following years, though suicide bombings decreased significantly.\n\n==Etymology==\n'''Second Intifada''' refers to a second Palestinian uprising, following the [[First Intifada|first Palestinian uprising]], which occurred between December 1987 and 1993. [[wikt:intifada|\"Intifada\"]] ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0636\u0629}}) translates into English as \"uprising.\" Its root is an Arabic word meaning \"the shaking off.\" It has been used in the meaning of \"insurrection\" in various Arab countries; the [[1977 Egyptian bread riots|Egyptian riots of 1977]], for example, were called the \"bread intifada\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://libcom.org/history/1977-egypts-bread-intifada |title = 1977: Egypt&#039;s bread intifada}}</ref> The term refers to a revolt against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories.\n\n'''Al-Aqsa Intifada''' refers to the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], the place where the intifada started. It is the name of a mosque, constructed in the 8th century CE at Al-Haram Al-Sharif, also known as the [[Temple Mount]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], a location considered the holiest site in Judaism and third holiest in Islam.\n\nThe Intifada is sometimes called the '''Oslo War''' (\u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u05dc\u05d5) by some Israelis who consider it to be the result of concessions made by Israel following the [[Oslo Accords]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Itamar Rabinovich |year=2004 |title=Waging Peace: Israel and the Arabs, 1948\u20132003 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0691119823 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wagingpeaceisrae00rabi_0/page/306 306] |author-link=Itamar Rabinovich |url=https://archive.org/details/wagingpeaceisrae00rabi_0/page/306 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Devin Sper |year=2004 |title=The Future of Israel |publisher=Sy Publishing |isbn=978-0976161301 |page=[https://archive.org/details/futureofisrael0000sper/page/335 335] |url=https://archive.org/details/futureofisrael0000sper/page/335 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Binyamin Elon |year=2005 |title=God's Covenant With Israel: Establishing Biblical Boundaries in Today's World |publisher=Balfour Books |isbn=978-0892216277 |page=45|author-link=Binyamin Elon }}</ref> and '''Arafat's War''', after the [[Yasser Arafat|late Palestinian leader]] whom some blamed for starting it.

For their part, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] formally recognised Israel and committed to adopting responsibility for internal security in population centres in the areas evacuated. Palestinian self-rule was to last for a five-year interim period during which a permanent agreement would be negotiated. However, the realities on the ground left both sides deeply disappointed with the Oslo process.  Israelis and Palestinians have blamed each other for the failure of the Oslo peace process.  In the five years immediately following the signing of the Oslo accords, 405 Palestinians <!-- (source: B'Tselem) --> and 256 Israelis were killed, which for the latter represented a casualty count higher than that of the previous fifteen years combined (216, 172 of whom were killed during the [[First Intifada]]).\n\nFrom 1996 Israel made extensive contingency plans and preparations, collectively code-named \"Musical Charm,\" in the eventuality that peace talks might fail. In 1998, after concluding that the 5-year plan stipulated in the Oslo Talks would not be completed, the IDF implemented an Operation Field of Thorns plan to conquer towns in Area C, and some areas of Gaza, and military exercises at regimental level were carried out in April 2000 to that end. Palestinian preparations were defensive, and small scale, more to reassure the local population than to cope with an eventual attack from Israel. The intensity of these operations led one Brigadier General, Zvi Fogel to wonder whether Israel's military preparations would not turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.<ref>Hillel Frisch,[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLdwp_4BZhMC&pg=PA102 ''The Palestinian Military: Between Militias and Armies,'' ] Routledge, 2010 p.102.</ref>\n\nIn 1995, [[Shimon Peres]] took the place of [[Yitzhak Rabin]], who had been [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassinated]] by [[Yigal Amir]], a Jewish extremist opposed to the Oslo peace agreement. In the 1996 elections, Israelis elected a right-wing<ref name=\"Schmemann\" /> coalition led by the [[Likud]] candidate, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] who was followed in 1999 by the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]] leader [[Ehud Barak]].\n\n===Camp David Summit===\nFrom 11 to 25 July 2000, the [[2000 Camp David Summit|Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David]] was held between United States [[President of the United States of America|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]], and [[Palestinian Authority]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]].

The Israeli government gave up hope for negotiated settlement to the conflict and pursued a unilateral policy of physically separating Israel from Palestinian communities by beginning construction on the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]]. Israel claims the barrier is necessary to prevent Palestinian attackers from entering Israeli cities. Palestinians claim the barrier separates Palestinian communities from each other and that the construction plan is a de facto annexation of Palestinian territory.\n\nFollowing a 4 October [[Maxim restaurant suicide bombing|suicide bombing in Maxim restaurant]], [[Haifa]], which claimed the lives of 21 Israelis, Israel claimed that Syria and [[Iran]] sponsored the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement|Islamic Jihad]] and [[Hezbollah]], and were responsible for the terrorist attack.

Between September 2000 and May 2004, ninety tunnels connecting Egypt and the Gaza Strip were found and destroyed. Raids in Rafah left many families homeless. Israel's official stance is that their houses were captured by militants and were destroyed during battles with IDF forces.

Hamas vowed to continue the armed struggle sending numerous [[Qassam rocket]]s into open fields near [[Nahal Oz]], and hitting a [[kindergarten]] in [[Gush Katif|Kfar Darom]] with an anti-tank missile.\n\nOn 9 December five Palestinians weapon smugglers were killed and two were arrested in the border between Rafah and [[Egypt]]. Later that day, [[Jamal Abu Samhadana]] and two of his bodyguards were injured by a missile strike. In the first Israeli airstrike against militants in weeks, an unmanned Israeli drone plane launched one missile at Abu Samahdna's car as it travelled between Rafah and Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. It was the fourth attempt on Samhadana's life by Israel. Samhadana is one of two leaders of the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] and one of the main forces behind the smuggling tunnels. Samhadana is believed to be responsible for the [[Improvised explosive device|blast]] against an American diplomatic convoy in Gaza that killed three Americans.\n\nOn 10 December, in response to Hamas firing mortar rounds into the Neveh Dekalim settlement in the Gaza Strip and wounding four Israelis (including an 8-year-old boy), Israeli soldiers fired at the Khan Younis refugee camp (the origin of the mortars) killing a 7-year-old girl. An IDF source confirmed troops opened fire at Khan Younis, but said they aimed at Hamas mortar crews.\n\nThe largest attack since the death of Yasser Arafat claimed the lives of five Israeli soldiers on 12 December, wounding ten others. Approximately 1.5 tons of explosives were detonated in a tunnel under an Israeli military-controlled border crossing on the Egyptian border with Gaza near Rafah, collapsing several structures and damaging others. The explosion destroyed part of the outpost and killed three soldiers. Two Palestinian militants then penetrated the outpost and killed two other Israeli soldiers with gunfire. It is believed that Hamas and a new Fatah faction, the \"Fatah Hawks\", conducted the highly organised and coordinated attack. A spokesman, \"Abu Majad\", claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of the [[Fatah Hawks]] claiming it was in retaliation for \"the assassination\" of Yasser Arafat, charging he was poisoned by Israel.\n\n===2005===\n[[2005 Palestinian presidential election|Palestinian presidential elections]] were held on 9 January, and [[Mahmoud Abbas]] (Abu Mazen) was elected as the president of the PA.

Although Abbas called on militants to halt attacks against Israel, he promised them protection from Israeli incursions and did not advocate disarmament by force.\n\nViolence continued in the Gaza Strip, and [[Ariel Sharon]] froze all diplomatic and security contacts with the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. Spokesman Assaf Shariv declared that \"Israel informed international leaders today that there will be no meetings with Abbas until he makes a real effort to stop the terror.\" The freezing of contacts came less than one week after Mahmoud Abbas was elected, and the day before his inauguration.

Although attacks on Israelis did not stop completely, they decreased sharply. On 8 February 2005, at the [[Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005]], Sharon and Abbas declared a mutual [[truce]] between Israel and the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. They shook hands at a four-way summit that also included [[Jordan]] and [[Egypt]] at [[Sharm al-Sheikh]]. However, Hamas and [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement|Islamic Jihad]] said the truce is not binding for their members.

He also fired senior commanders in the Palestinian security apparatus. On 10 February, [[Israeli security forces]] arrested Maharan Omar Shucat Abu Hamis, a Palestinian resident of [[Nablus]], who was about to launch a bus [[suicide attack]] in the [[French Hill]] in [[Jerusalem]].\n\nOn 13 February 2005, Abbas entered into talks with the leaders of the Islamic Jihad and the Hamas, for them to rally behind him and respect the truce. Ismail Haniyah, a senior leader of the group Hamas said that \"its position regarding calm will continue unchanged and Israel will bear responsibility for any new violation or aggression.\"\n\nIn the middle of June, Palestinian factions intensified bombardment over the city of [[Sderot]] with improvised [[Qassam rocket]]s. Palestinian attacks resulted in 2 Palestinians and 1 Chinese civilian killed by a Qassam, and 2 Israelis were killed. The wave of attacks lessened support for the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement plan]] among the Israeli public. Attacks on Israel by the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement|Islamic Jihad]] and the [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] increased in July, and on 12 July, a [[Suicide attack|suicide bombing]] hit the coastal city of [[Netanya]], killing 5 civilians. On 14 July, Hamas started to shell Israeli settlements inside and outside the [[Gaza Strip]] with dozens of Qassam rockets, killing an Israeli woman. On 15 July, Israel resumed its \"targeted killing\" policy, killing 7 Hamas militants and bombing about 4 Hamas facilities. The continuation of shelling rockets over Israeli settlements, and street battles between Hamas militants and Palestinian policemen, threatened to shatter the truce agreed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005.

In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at \"provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative\".</blockquote>\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization, according to the same report, denied that the Intifada was planned, and asserted that \"Camp David represented nothing less than an attempt by Israel to extend the force it exercises on the ground to negotiations.\" The report also stated:\n\n<blockquote>From the perspective of the PLO, Israel responded to the disturbances with excessive and illegal use of deadly force against demonstrators; behavior which, in the PLO's view, reflected Israel's contempt for the lives and safety of Palestinians. For Palestinians, the widely seen images of Muhammad al-Durrah in Gaza on September 30, shot as he huddled behind his father, reinforced that perception.</blockquote>\n\nThe Mitchell report concluded:\n\n<blockquote>The Sharon visit did not cause the \"Al-Aqsa Intifada\". But it was poorly timed and the provocative effect should have been foreseen; indeed it was foreseen by those who urged that the visit be prohibited.</blockquote>\n\nand also:\n\n<blockquote>We have no basis on which to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the PA to initiate a campaign of violence at the first opportunity; or to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the [Government of Israel] to respond with lethal force.</blockquote>\n\n==Views on the Second Intifada==\nPalestinians have claimed that Sharon's visit was the beginning of the Second Intifada,<ref name=bbctimeline/> while others have claimed that Yasser Arafat had pre-planned the uprising.<ref name=toameh/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Suha-Arafat-admits-husband-premeditated-Intifada|title=Suha Arafat admits husband premeditated Intifada|work=Jerusalem Post|date=29 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome, like [[Bill Clinton]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Clinton |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Clinton |title=My Life |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2004 |isbn=1-4000-3003-X}}</ref> say that tensions were high due to failed negotiations at the [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David Summit]] in July 2000.

During the summit, Israel expressed its willingness to make far-reaching and unprecedented compromises in order to arrive at a workable, enduring agreement. However, Yasser Arafat chose to break off the negotiations without even offering any proposals of his own. Consequently, the summit adjourned with President Clinton placing the blame for its failure squarely at Arafat's feet. ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that the wave of Palestinian terrorism, which began in the wake of the Camp David summit failure, has nothing to do with a spontaneous Palestinian action to \"resist the occupation.\" The Palestinian leadership had taken a strategic decision to abandon the path to peace and to use violence as their primary tactic for advancing their agenda. This decision undermined the bedrock foundation of the peace process \u2013 the understanding that a solution can only be reached through compromise rather than inflexibility, and through negotiation rather than violence.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The Palestinian claim that Israel's presence in the territories caused the terrorism began as a desperate attempt to deflect criticism after Arafat rejected Israel's peace proposals. It quickly evolved into an excuse for the inexcusable \u2013 the indiscriminate murder of innocent civilians.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrorist attacks can never be justified, and they are particularly tragic when the disputed issues could have been settled through negotiations. The Palestinian Authority had been given a real opportunity to end the conflict through negotiations. However, Israel's olive branch was met with a hail of gunfire and a barrage of suicide bombers. The greatest obstacle to peace is not the lack of a Palestinian state, rather it is the existence of Palestinian terrorism.}}</ref><ref name=biri-IMFA/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/terrorism/palestinian/pages/palestinian%20violence%20and%20terrorism%20since%20september.aspx |title=Palestinian violence and terrorism since September 2000 |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=28 September 2014 |quote=The events of last few days represent the latest and most severe developments in a wave of violence that has been building in recent weeks.

An additional 22 Israelis were killed by actions of their own side.<ref name=\"statspage\"/>\n\nIPICT counts \"probable combatants\" in its total of combatants. From their full report in September 2002:\n\n<blockquote>A 'probable combatant' is someone killed at a location and at a time during which an armed confrontation was going on, who appears most likely \u2013 but not certain \u2013 to have been an active participant in the fighting. For example, in many cases where an incident has resulted in a large number of Palestinian casualties, the only information available is that an individual was killed when Israeli soldiers returned fire in response to shots fired from a particular location. While it is possible that the person killed had not been active in the fighting and just happened to be in the vicinity of people who were, it is reasonable to assume that the number of such coincidental deaths is not particularly high. Where the accounts of an incident appear to support such a coincidence, the individual casualty has been given the benefit of the doubt, and assigned a non-combatant status.<ref name=statspage/></blockquote>\n\nIn the same 2002 IPICT full report there is a pie chart (Graph 2.9) that lists the IPICT combatant breakdown for Palestinian deaths through September 2002.

Hamas is officially declared as a [[List of terrorist organisations|terrorist organization]] by the United States and the European Union and its gaining control over the Palestinian Authority (such as by forming the government) would jeopardize international funds to the PA, by laws forbidding sponsoring of terrorist group.\n\nOn 9 June, seven members of the Ghalia family [[Gaza beach blast|were killed]] on a Gaza beach. The cause of the explosion remains uncertain. Nevertheless, in response, Hamas declared an end to its commitment to a ceasefire declared in 2005 and announced the resumption of attacks on Israelis. Palestinians blame an Israeli artillery shelling of nearby locations in the northern Gaza Strip for the deaths, while an Israeli military inquiry cleared itself from the charges.\n\nOn 25 June, a military outpost was attacked by Palestinian militants and a gunbattle followed that left 2 Israeli soldiers and 3 Palestinian militants dead. Corporal [[Gilad Shalit]], an Israeli soldier, was captured and Israel warned of an imminent [[Operation Summer Rains|military response]] if the soldier was not returned unharmed. In the early hours of 28 June Israeli tanks, APCs and troops entered the Gaza strip just hours after the air force had taken out two main bridges and the only powerstation in the strip, effectively shutting down electricity and water.

They waged a high-intensity campaign of [[guerrilla warfare]] against Israeli military and civilian targets inside Israel and in the occupied territory, utilizing tactics such as [[ambush]]es, [[sniper|sniper attacks]], and [[suicide bombing]]s. Military equipment was mostly imported, while some light arms, hand grenades and [[explosive belt]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, and [[Qassam rocket]]s were indigenously produced. They also increased use of remote-controlled [[land mine|landmines]] against Israeli armor, a tactic that was highly popular among the poorly armed groups. [[Car bomb]]s were often used against \"lightly hardened\" targets such as Israeli armored jeeps and checkpoints.

Conducted as a single or double bombing, suicide bombings were generally conducted against \"soft\" targets, or \"lightly hardened\" targets (such as checkpoints) to try to raise the cost of the war to Israelis and demoralize the Israeli society. Most suicide bombing attacks (although not all) targeted civilians, and conducted on crowded places in Israeli cities, such as public transport, restaurants, and markets.\n\nOne recent development is the use of [[Child suicide bombers in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict|suicide bombs carried by children]]. Unlike most suicide bombings, the use of these not only earned condemnation from the United States and from human rights groups such as [[Amnesty International]], but also from many Palestinians and much of the Middle East press. The youngest Palestinian [[Child suicide bombers in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict|suicide bomber]] was 16-year-old Issa Bdeir, a high school student from the village of Al Doha, who shocked his friends and family when he blew himself up in a park in [[Rishon LeZion]], killing a teenage boy and an elderly man.

The IDF stressed the safety of their troops, using such heavily armored equipment as the [[Merkava]] heavy tank and armored personnel carriers, and carried out airstrikes with various military aircraft including [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]], [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone aircraft]] and [[Attack helicopter|helicopter gunships]] to strike militant targets. Much of the ground fighting was conducted house-to-house by well-armed and well-trained infantry. Due to its superior training, equipment, and numbers, the IDF had the upper hand during street fighting. Palestinian armed groups suffered heavy losses during combat, but the operations were often criticized internationally due to the civilian casualties often caused. Palestinian metalworking shops and other business facilities suspected by Israel of being used to manufacture weapons are regularly targeted by airstrikes, as well as Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels.\n\nIsraeli [[IDF Caterpillar D9|Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]]s were routinely employed to detonate [[booby trap]]s and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]], to demolish houses along the border with Egypt that were used for shooting at Israeli troops, to create \"buffer zones\", and to support military operations in the West Bank. Until February 2005, Israel had in place a policy to demolish the family homes of suicide bombers after giving them a notice to evacuate. Due to the considerable number of Palestinians living in single homes, the large quantity of homes destroyed, and collateral damage from home demolitions, it became an increasingly controversial tactic. Families began providing timely information to Israeli forces regarding suicide bombing activities in order to prevent the demolition of their homes, although families doing so risked being executed or otherwise punished for [[collaborationism|collaboration]], either by the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] or extrajudicially by Palestinian militants. The IDF committee studying the issue recommended ending the practice because the policy was not effective enough to justify its costs to Israel's image internationally and the backlash it created among Palestinians.<ref>[[Gabi Siboni]], [http://www.inss.org.il/uploadimages/Import/(FILE)1298360394.pdf Defeating Suicide Terrorism in Judea and Samaria, 2002\u20132005], \"'''[[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|Military and Strategic Affairs]]'''\", Volume 2, No. 2, October 2010.</ref>\n\nWith complete ground and air superiority, mass arrests were regularly conducted by Israeli military and police forces; at any given time, there were about 6,000 Palestinian prisoners detained in Israeli prisons, about half of them held temporarily without a final indictment, in accordance with Israeli law.\n\nThe tactic of military \"[[curfew]]\" \u2013 long-term lockdown of civilian areas \u2013 was used extensively by Israel throughout the Intifada. The longest curfew was in [[Nablus]], which was kept under curfew for over 100 consecutive days, with generally under two hours per day allowed for people to get food or conduct other business.\n\nSecurity [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|Checkpoints]] and roadblocks were erected inside and between Palestinian cities, subjecting all people and vehicles to security inspection for free passage. Israel defended those checkpoints as being necessary to stop militants and limit the ability to move weapons around. However some Palestinian, Israeli and International observers and organizations have criticized the checkpoints as excessive, humiliating, and a major cause of the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Territories. Transit could be delayed by several hours, depending on the security situation in Israel. Sniper towers were used extensively in the Gaza Strip before the Israeli [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|pullout]].\n\nThe Israeli intelligence services [[Shin Bet]] and [[Mossad]] penetrated Palestinian militant organizations by relying on moles and sources within armed groups, tapping communication lines, and aerial reconnaissance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polis.leeds.ac.uk/assets/files/research/working-papers/wp16jones.pdf |publisher=School of Politics and International Studies |title= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> within the groups the [[Israeli Security Forces]] (IDF, Magav, police [[YAMAM]] and Mistaravim SF units) to thwart hundreds of suicide bombings by providing real-time warnings and reliable intelligence reports, and a list of Palestinians marked for targeted killings.\n\nIsrael extensively used \"[[Israeli targeted killings|targeted killings]]\", the assassinations of Palestinian leaders involved in perpetrating attacks against Israelis, to eliminate imminent threats and to deter others from following suit, relying primarily on airstrikes and covert operations by [[Shin Bet]] to carry them out.

Israel in turn has criticized what it describes as a practice of militant leaders hiding among civilians in densely populated areas, thus turning them into unwitting [[human shield]]s. In one of the most controversial killings, the [[Mossad]] (Israeli foreign intelligence service) allegedly killed Hamas leader [[Mahmoud al-Mabhouh]] in [[Dubai]], using forged passports to slip agents into Dubai.

She began trying to walk while she was still heavily medicated and fell, breaking her hip. In January 1993, she underwent surgery for a knee replacement. She was hospitalized from February 2 to April 15. She underwent a second knee surgery in July of that year.\n\nA day after returning home from this second surgery, she suffered a severe stroke. Doris Duke [[Harry Demopoulos#Duke Estate|died]] at her Falcon's Lair home on October 28, 1993, at the age of 80. The cause was progressive [[pulmonary edema]] resulting in [[cardiac arrest]], according to a spokesman.<ref name=\"courttv.com\"/><ref name=nytobit/>\n\nDuke was cremated 24 hours after her death and her executor, [[Bernard Lafferty]], scattered her ashes into the Pacific Ocean as her last will specified.<ref name=\"courttv.com\"/>\n\n==Net worth==\nWhen Doris' father died, he left a fortune valued at $100 million,<ref name=ny>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/02/nyregion/doris-duke-leaves-1-billion-to-a-new-charitable-foundation.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|title=Doris Duke Leaves $1 billion to a New Charitable Foundation|date=November 2, 1993|author=McFadden, Robert|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}</ref> with the largest share going to Duke and her mother. Nanaline was a shrewd businesswoman, often compared to [[Hetty Green]], and when she died in 1962, she left her daughter an estate then estimated to be worth $250 million.<ref name=ny/>\n\nDuke also owned numerous shares in big-name companies, such as [[General Motors]], and had a large financial team of bankers and accountants to manage her holdings (since, despite rumors, Duke had little to no interest in money matters). In addition, Duke had a collection of artwork, which was said to include works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, as well as her valuable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asia art and furniture. Also in Duke's collection were over 2,000 bottles of rare wine (worth over $5 million) and the extraordinary Duke collection of fine jewels. Her total net worth, including all property, was valued at $5.3 billion.\n\n===Philanthropy===\nDuke's first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her.<ref>{{cite web| title=Doris Duke Biographical History and Archival Collections (Duke University Libraries)| url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/collections/people/dorisduke/#item-14| website=Library.duk.edu| accessdate=October 24, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906141800/http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/collections/people/dorisduke/#item-14| archive-date=September 6, 2013| url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1958, she established the [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]] Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms.

Historic properties include [[Rough Point]], [[Samuel Whitehorne House]], [[Prescott Farm]], the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the  Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s ashram in India, [[The Beatles at Rishikesh|visited by the Beatles]] in 1968.<ref name=NCH>{{cite book|title=Beyond Gurus: A Woman of Many Worlds|first=Nancy Cooke|last=de Herrera|publisher=Blue Dolphin Publishing|year=1993|isbn=978-0-931892-49-3|url=https://archive.org/details/beyondguruswoman00herr}}</ref> \n  \nDuke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art.

In the late 1980s, Duke donated $2 million to Duke University to be used for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] research.<ref name=ny/> Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Doris Duke Foundation Records, 1934-2009 (Duke University Libraries)|accessdate=October 23, 2016|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/dorisdukefound|website=Library.duk.edu}}</ref> After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, [[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri La]], [[Rough Point]], and [[Duke Farms]].\n\n===Trusts and wills===\nDuke was the life beneficiary of two trusts created by her father, James Buchanan Duke, in 1917 and 1924. The income from the trusts was payable to any children after her death. In 1988, at the age of 75, Duke legally adopted a woman named Chandi Heffner, then a 35-year-old [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotee and sister of the third wife of billionaire [[Nelson Peltz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164455,00.html |title=Sarandon to Play World's Richest Little Girl |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=August 2, 2005 |accessdate=October 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606201655/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164455,00.html |archive-date=June 6, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Duke initially maintained that Heffner was the reincarnation of her only biological child Arden, who died soon after birth in 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|title=Top Three Inheritance Disputes|publisher=legalzoom|accessdate=May 10, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411060518/http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|archive-date=April 11, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe two women had a falling out, and the final version of Duke's will specified that she did not wish Heffner to benefit from her father's trusts; she also negated the adoption. Despite the negation, after Duke's death, the estate's trustees settled a lawsuit brought by Heffner for $65 million.<ref name=\"Top Three Inheritance Disputes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|title=Top Three Inheritance Disputes|publisher=legalzoom|accessdate=June 29, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411060518/http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|archive-date=April 11, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn her final will, Duke left virtually all of her fortune to several existing and new charitable foundations. She appointed her butler, [[Bernard Lafferty]] born in [[Creeslough]], [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]], as executor of her estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-05/news/mn-61438_1_butler-made-wealthy-by-heiress|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Butler Made Wealthy by Heiress Dies|date=November 5, 1996|author=Lieberman, Paul|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref> Lafferty appointed the [[U.

In an earlier will, Demopoulos had been named executor <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/05/nyregion/bernard-lafferty-the-butler-for-doris-duke-dies-at-51.html|title=Bernard Lafferty the Butler for Doris Dukes Dies at 51|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref> and challenged Lafferty's appointment. Demopolous argued that Lafferty and his lawyers had cajoled a sick, sedated old woman into giving him control of her estate.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nEven more sensational accusations were made by a nurse, Tammy Payette, who contended that Lafferty and a prominent Beverly Hills physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, had conspired to hasten Duke's death with morphine and Demerol.  In 1996, the year Lafferty died, the Los Angeles [[District Attorney]]'s office ruled there was no firm evidence of foul play.<ref name=\"Top Three Inheritance Disputes\"/>\n\n[[Duke University]] also filed suit, claiming entitlement to a larger share of the Duke assets than the $10 million provided in the will (although Duke's will also stated that any beneficiary who disputed its provisions should receive nothing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|title=Last Will of Duke, Section 19|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=September 10, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008}}</ref>).\n\nLitigation involving 40 lawyers at 10 different law firms tied up the Duke estate for nearly three years. New York courts ultimately removed Lafferty for using estate funds for his own support and US Trust for failing \"to do anything to stop him.\"<ref name=\"Top Three Inheritance Disputes\"/> The [[Surrogate Court]] of Manhattan overrode Duke's will and appointed new trustees from among those who had challenged it: [[Harry Demopoulos]]; J.

Keohane]], president of Duke University; and [[John J. Mack]], president of [[Morgan Stanley]].<ref name=\"nytimes1996\"/> The fees for their lawsuits exceeded $10 million, and were paid by the Duke estate. These trustees now control all assets of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which Doris Duke directed should support medical research, anti-vivisectionism, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, performance arts, wildlife, and ecology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|title=Last Will of Doris Duke, Section 8|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=September 10, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe DDCF also controls funding for the three separate foundations created to operate Duke's former homes: the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art, Duke Farms and Newport Restoration Foundation. The trustees have progressively reduced funding for these foundations, stating that Doris Duke's own works are \"perpetuating the Duke family history of personal passions and conspicuous consumption.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sudol |first=Valerie |title=Famed Duke Gardens To Become Ambitious 'Green' Lab |newspaper=Newhouse News Service |year=2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2008 |url=http://www.newhouse.com/famed-duke-gardens-to-become-ambitious-green-laboratory-4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928021113/http://www.newhouse.com/famed-duke-gardens-to-become-ambitious-green-laboratory-4.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 28, 2008 }}</ref> Recently, these foundations have sold some assets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/CarpetSale08.html|title=Sale of Rare Carpet to Benefit Newport Restoration Foundation Collections Fund|publisher=Newport Restoration Foundation|accessdate=June 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921162758/http://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/CarpetSale08.html|archive-date=September 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> and have closed Duke Gardens.
