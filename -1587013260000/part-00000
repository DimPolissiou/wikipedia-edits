Known colloquially known as \"grounded videos\" or \"punishment day videos\", these videos usually feature the protagonist characters from animated children's programs such as ''[[Caillou]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' being out of character and generally getting into trouble, resulting in their punishments being disproportionate. Generally, this is a [[Grounding (discipline technique)|grounding]] for an absurd amount of time from an authority figure, usually longer than a human's natural lifetime (such as a century or multiple decades, often exaggerated into billions of years), or can be as extreme as immediate [[capital punishment]] carried out by law enforcement. These are usually created with the intent of comedic effect, as the [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] system Vyond uses to provide voices can fail to recognize the large numbers used in those videos, and often reads onomatopoeic sounds as literal words rather than expressions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/culture/internet-gutter-grounded-videos-1655814/|title=Internet Gutter: Grounded videos|website=Geek.com|date=2016-08-03|accessdate=2019-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://vyond.com/}}\n\n[[Category:Animation software]]\n[[Category:Marketing companies established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Privately held companies based in California]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Websites about animation]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2007]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2007]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2007]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Website}}\n{{advert|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Vyond\n| logo = Vyond 2018.svg\n| logo_size =\n| logo_caption =\n| former_name = Go!Animate (2007\u20132013)<br>GoAnimate (2013\u20132018)\n| owner = GoAnimate, Inc.\n| type = [[Privately held company|Private]]\n| founded = {{Start date and age|2007|11|1}}\n| founder = Alvin Hung\n| hq_location = [[San Mateo, California]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n| key_people = {{ubl\n| [[Alvin Hung]] (Founder & former CEO)\n| Gary Lipkowitz (CEO)\n}}\n\n| services = [[Video production]]\n}}\n'''Vyond''' (formerly known as '''Go!Animate''' and '''GoAnimate''') is a cloud-based, animated video creation platform owned by GoAnimate, Inc.\n\n==History==\n{{Cleanup-PR|section|date=February 2018}}\nVyond was founded as GoAnimate in 2007 by [[Alvin Hung]], and the first version of GoAnimate went live in mid-2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/08/16/alvin-hung-founder-ceo-goanimate.html?page=all|title=Alvin Hung: Founder & CEO, GoAnimate - San Francisco Business Times|website=San Francisco Business Times|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> In May 2009, DomoAnimate was launched.

Known colloquially known as \"grounded videos\" or \"punishment day videos\", these videos usually feature the protagonist characters from animated children's programs such as ''[[Caillou]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' being out of character and generally getting into trouble, resulting in their punishments being disproportionate. Generally, this is a [[Grounding (discipline technique)|grounding]] for an absurd amount of time from an authority figure, usually longer than a human's natural lifetime (such as a century or multiple decades, often exaggerated into billions of years), or can be as extreme as immediate [[capital punishment]] carried out by law enforcement. These are usually created with the intent of comedic effect, as the [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] system Vyond uses to provide voices can fail to recognize the large numbers used in those videos, and often reads onomatopoeic sounds as literal words rather than expressions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/culture/internet-gutter-grounded-videos-1655814/|title=Internet Gutter: Grounded videos|website=Geek.com|date=2016-08-03|accessdate=2019-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://vyond.com/}}\n\n[[Category:Animation software]]\n[[Category:Marketing companies established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Privately held companies based in California]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Websites about animation]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2007]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2007]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2007]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Majavah", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: 14 day \u2192 14-day, \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyond"}

In the original film, Cinderella is voiced by American singer and actress [[Ilene Woods]]. For the sequels and subsequent film and television appearances, Woods was replaced by American actresses [[Jennifer Hale]] and Tami Tappan, who provide the character's speaking and singing voices respectively. \n\nIn the wake of her father's untimely demise, Cinderella is left in the unfortunate care of her cruel stepmother and jealous stepsisters, who constantly mistreat her, forcing Cinderella to work as a [[scullery maid]] in her own home. When Prince Charming holds a ball, the evil stepmother does not allow her to go. Cinderella, aided by her kind Fairy Godmother and equipped with a beautiful silver gown and a unique pair of glass slippers, attends, only to have to leave at [[midnight]] when the Fairy Godmother's spell is broken.\n\nReception towards Cinderella has been mixed, with some film critics describing the character as much too passive, [[Flat character|one-dimensional]], and less interesting than the film's supporting characters. Other critics found her endearing, charming, and timeless. Woods' vocal performance has also been praised. Panned or praised, Cinderella has nonetheless become one of the most famous and recognizable princesses in the history of film. With her iconic glass slippers, silver gown, hairstyle, and transformation, one of the first on-screen makeovers of its kind, the character has been established as a fashion icon, receiving accolades and recognition from ''InStyle'', ''Entertainment Weekly'', ''Glamour'' and ''Oprah.com'', as well as footwear designer and fashion icon [[Christian Louboutin]], who, in 2012, designed and released a shoe based on Cinderella's glass slippers. [[Lily James]] played a live-action version of the character in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live action adaptation]] of the original 1950 film.\n\n==Development==\nThe Disney version of Cinderella was based on the French version of the tale by [[Charles Perrault]], ''Cendrillon'' written in 1697 in ''Histoires ou Contes du Temps Pass\u00e9''.<ref name=\"masterworks\">{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Walt's Masterworks: Cinderella|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/cinderella/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===Personality===\nThe script for the original film went through revisions by various writers, sometimes with different interpretations of the character. [[Maurice Rapf]] tried to make her a less passive character than [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]], and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Rapf explained, \"My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then on it's up to you.' I made her earn it, and what she had to do to achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. So I had a scene where they're ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don't think anyone took (my idea) very seriously.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mouse Under Glass: Secrets of Disney Animation & Theme Parks|last=Koenig|first=David|publisher=Bonaventure Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0964060517|location=|pages=75}}</ref>\n\n===Appearance===\nThe character was animated by [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]] and [[Eric Larson]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Pierre Lambert|title=Walt Disney, l'\u00e2ge d'or|page=166|isbn=2950781888}}</ref> but the two animators did not have the same perception of the character, accentuating the elegance of [[Marc Davis (animator)|Davis]] and [[Eric Larson|Larson]]'s opting for simplicity.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pierre Lambert|title=Walt Disney, l'\u00e2ge d'or|page=167|isbn=2950781888}}</ref> As done with other Disney films, [[Walt Disney]] hired actress [[Helene Stanley]] to perform the live-action reference for Cinderella, that she before artists began sketching, playing the role of Cinderella in a particular scene,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters|author=John Grant|isbn=0060157771|page=228}}</ref> and artists to draw animated frames based on the movements of the actress.<ref name=\"archives\" /> She later did the same kind of work for the characters of [[Aurora (Disney)|Princess Aurora]] in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' and Anita Radcliff in ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]''.<ref name=\"archives\">{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Cinderella Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331190207/http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html|archivedate=2010-03-31}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Christopher Finch, author of ''The Art of Walt Disney'':{{cquote|Disney insisted that all scenes involving human characters should be shot first in live-action to determine that they would work before the expensive business of animation was permitted to start.

After her father dies, she is forced into servitude in her own home and is  tormented by her evil stepmother, [[Lady Tremaine]], and two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella. Despite this, she maintains hope through her dreams and remains a kind, gentle and sweet person. She has faith that someday her dreams of happiness will come true and her kindness will be repaid. Cinderella is shown to have a down-to-earth attitude, but she is also a daydreamer.  For example, in \"Sing Sweet Nightingale\", she becomes distracted with the bubbles, allowing Lucifer to smudge the floor she was cleaning.  Also, after hearing that the Grand Duke is traveling the kingdom with the missing slipper, she dreamily dances back to the attic humming the song she heard at the ball. She is also shown to have a sarcastic side and a sharp wit.\n\nWith the help of her animal friends, she fixes up an old party dress of her mother's so she can attend a royal ball.  However, when her evil stepsisters brutally tear the dress apart, she is heartbroken and fears that her dreams will never come true until her [[Fairy Godmother]] appears, restoring Cinderella's hope by transforming her torn homemade dress into her now-iconic silver [[ball gown|gown]] with a glittering crystalline puffed peplum, a delicate laced white [[petticoat]], and puffy sleeves. Her hair is worn up in a [[French twist (hairstyle)|French twist]] supported by a silver headband with diamond earrings, silver-white opera gloves, a black diamond choker, and glass slippers.\n\nHer look was probably inspired by 1950s French haute couture, while her torn dress is clearly inspired by Salvador Dal\u00ec and Elsa Schiaparelli's Tear dress.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lugli|first1=Emanuele|title=Tear That Dress: Cinderella (1950) and Disney's Critique of Postwar Fashion|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/tear-that-dress-off-cinderella-1950-and-disneys-critique-of-postwar-fashion/#.VeWdKtO6feR|website=Bright Lights Film Journal|accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref>\n\nAs a servant, she wears her hair down in a ponytail, held in place with a blue ribbon, sometimes supported by a white scarf and wears a brown dress with a powder blue blouse, a white apron, and black flats.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''Cinderella''===\n{{main|Cinderella (1950 film)}}\n[[File:Disneyland Cinderella handstogether.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cinderella as she appears at [[Disney Parks]].]]\nAt the start of the film, the titular character Cinderella is working as a scullery maid in her own home for her cruel stepmother named Lady Tremaine and her two stepsisters named Anastasia and Drizella. Her only friends are the birds, the mice who also live in the [[manor]], including [[Gus and Jaq]], her pet dog Bruno and her father's horse Major.\n\nShe prepares breakfast for the animals and for her stepfamily before beginning her regular chores. An invitation to the ball arrives at the door and Cinderella wants to attend. Her stepmother tells her she may go under the condition that she must finish her chores and find something suitable to wear. Cinderella discovers her deceased mother's old party dress and hopes to fix it to make it more modern, but she is too busy to do so. Meanwhile, when the mice see shadows of Cinderella's stepsisters throwing down their old sash and beads, Jaq and Gus are forced to quietly retrieve them. The mice use the unwanted items to fix up the dress. Later, Cinderella fears she will not be done working in time and will not be able to attend the ball, but her friends reveal the altered dress. Cinderella is overjoyed and thanks her friends. She races down the steps just in time, but her stepsisters recognize their discarded items and accuse her of stealing their sash and beads. They tear the dress to shreds, leaving Cinderella all by herself, and she runs out to the garden, crying.\n\nHer [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]] appears to make her dreams come true and transforms her torn dress into a beautiful shimmering silver gown. Before Cinderella leaves, her godmother warns her that the spell will be broken at midnight. At the ball, Cinderella dances with Prince Charming and they immediately fall in love with each other. As twelve o'clock approaches, she hurries to leave, hoping to prevent the spell from breaking at the ball, which could cause her to get caught by her stepmother or stepsisters. In her haste, she loses one of her glass slippers on the staircase but fails to retrieve it in time. Cinderella hurries into her coach as it prepares to leave. The spell breaks and Cinderella is in rags once more before reminiscing her dance with the prince and thanking her godmother for all she's done for her. The next day, the prince announces he will marry the maiden whose foot fits into the glass slipper. Lady Tremaine hears Cinderella humming the same song that had played at the ball and figures out Cinderella was the girl Prince Charming fell in love with. Cinderella is locked in the tower by her stepmother, who refuses to let her have the opportunity to try on the slipper, but her animal friends help her escape. She hurries downstairs to try on the glass slipper. Knowing the slipper will fit her, Lady Tremaine intentionally causes the footman to trip and shatter the slipper. Cinderella reveals that she has kept the other slipper. She tries it on, and it fits perfectly. She and the Prince are married soon after.<ref name=\"Film\">{{cite video|people=Wilfred Jackson (director)|title=[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]|publisher=[[Walt Disney]]|date=1950}}</ref>\n\n===''Cinderella II: Dreams Come True''===\n{{main|Cinderella II: Dreams Come True}}\nGus and Jaq, with help of the other mice, and the Fairy Godmother, set off to make a new book to narrate what happens after the ending of the previous story by stringing three segments of stories together, resulting in three individual stories: \"Aim to Please\", \"Tall Tail\", and \"An Uncommon Romance\". In the first story, Cinderella and Prince Charming return home and a party begins shortly afterward. In the second story, \"Tall Tail\", Cinderella works on planning to build up a festival. The mouse named Jaq in the previous film has become a human named Sir Hugh. And in the third story, \"An Uncommon Romance\", Cinderella helps her younger stepsister [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] reconcile with the baker, even though her stepmother Lady Tremaine has forbidden it. Near the end of the film, she reads the book that the mice made for her.<ref>{{cite video|people=John Kafka (director)|title=[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]|publisher=[[DisneyToon Studios]]|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n===''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time''===\n{{main|Cinderella III: A Twist in Time}}\nIn Cinderella III: A Twist in Time, Cinderella's hard-working ethics, optimism, and devotion are put to the test, when she is magically stripped away from her \"happily ever after\" by a vengeful and then magically-empowered Tremaine and is forced to jump into physical action to restore her happy life and relationship with Prince Charming. During these events, Cinderella is shown to be cunning, tactical, persistent, and a fierce rival to those who oppress her. With no magic, being forced to rely solely on her intelligence and fearlessness, Cinderella is able to defeat her stepmother, repair her relationship with a reformed Anastasia and retain her much-deserved life of happiness, proving both her independence and strong will.<ref>{{cite video|people=Frank Nissen (director)|title=[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]|publisher=[[DisneyToon Studios]]|date=2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Sofia the First''===\n{{main|Sofia the First}}\nCinderella appears in the pilot movie ''[[Sofia the First|Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess]]'', where she helps Sofia make friends with Amber, her stepsister.\n\n===\"Le Croissant de Triomphe\"===\nIn the newest editions of ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' short movies, a 2013 production reflects the iconic princess in a crucial moment.\n\nCinderella appears in the third episode of ''Mickey Mouse,'' entitled ''[http://video.disney.com/watch/disneychannel-croissant-de-triomphe-4d7b3aae690a98650d776d97 Le Croissant de Triomphe]''. While a cafe owned and operated by [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] runs out of [[croissant]]s, she makes a phone call to receive from [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] an order of croissants. In order to arrive on time, Mickey hurries and flies through Paris, and accidentally lands in [[Cinderella Castle|a castle]] where [[Prince Charming]] tries to fit the crystal slipper into Cinderella's foot. She was still dressed in her regular maid clothes. At that time, Mickey accidentally passes in his motorcycle and breaks the glass slipper.\n\n===2015 film===\n[[Lily James]] portrays the character, named Ella, in Disney's 2015 live-action version of ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]''. Like in the original film, her father remarries after the death of her mother but after he dies as well, she then becomes the horribly mistreated servant of her stepmother Lady Tremaine and her two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drisella. They give her the nickname \"Cinderella\" when, one morning, she wakes up with [[Cinder|soot]] on her face after sleeping near the fireplace the previous night. Unlike the original film, however, she meets the Prince (named Kit) before the ball while out in the forest. She is also shown to be more assertive when she actually stands up to her stepmother in the film's final act; Lady Tremaine attempts to blackmail Ella by only agreeing to let her try on the glass slipper if Ella will make her head of the royal household and provide suitable husbands for her stepsisters, but Ella rejects this idea, refusing to give Lady Tremaine power over Kit after the way she ruined Ella's life.\n\n==In other media==\n[[File:Tokyo Disneylands cinderella castle.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Cinderella Castle]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]].]]\n[[File:Cinderella castle day.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Cinderella Castle]] at [[Walt Disney World]].]]\nCinderella appears as one of the Disney [[Princesses of Heart]] in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, captured by Maleficent, who destroyed her world.

Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]]' 12th animated feature film ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950) and its [[sequel]]s ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'' (2002) and ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'' (2007). In the original film, Cinderella is voiced by American singer and actress [[Ilene Woods]]. For the sequels and subsequent film and television appearances, Woods was replaced by American actresses [[Jennifer Hale]] and Tami Tappan, who provide the character's speaking and singing voices respectively. \n\nIn the wake of her father's untimely demise, Cinderella is left in the unfortunate care of her cruel stepmother and jealous stepsisters, who constantly mistreat her, forcing Cinderella to work as a [[scullery maid]] in her own home. When Prince Charming holds a ball, the evil stepmother does not allow her to go. Cinderella, aided by her kind Fairy Godmother and equipped with a beautiful silver gown and a unique pair of glass slippers, attends, only to have to leave at [[midnight]] when the Fairy Godmother's spell is broken.\n\nReception towards Cinderella has been mixed, with some film critics describing the character as much too passive, [[Flat character|one-dimensional]], and less interesting than the film's supporting characters. Other critics found her endearing, charming, and timeless. Woods' vocal performance has also been praised. Panned or praised, Cinderella has nonetheless become one of the most famous and recognizable princesses in the history of film. With her iconic glass slippers, silver gown, hairstyle, and transformation, one of the first on-screen makeovers of its kind, the character has been established as a fashion icon, receiving accolades and recognition from ''InStyle'', ''Entertainment Weekly'', ''Glamour'' and ''Oprah.com'', as well as footwear designer and fashion icon [[Christian Louboutin]], who, in 2012, designed and released a shoe based on Cinderella's glass slippers. [[Lily James]] played a live-action version of the character in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live action adaptation]] of the original 1950 film.\n\n==Development==\nThe Disney version of Cinderella was based on the French version of the tale by [[Charles Perrault]], ''Cendrillon'' written in 1697 in ''Histoires ou Contes du Temps Pass\u00e9''.<ref name=\"masterworks\">{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Walt's Masterworks: Cinderella|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/cinderella/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===Personality===\nThe script for the original film went through revisions by various writers, sometimes with different interpretations of the character. [[Maurice Rapf]] tried to make her a less passive character than [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]], and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Rapf explained, \"My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then on it's up to you.' I made her earn it, and what she had to do to achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. So I had a scene where they're ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don't think anyone took (my idea) very seriously.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mouse Under Glass: Secrets of Disney Animation & Theme Parks|last=Koenig|first=David|publisher=Bonaventure Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0964060517|location=|pages=75}}</ref>\n\n===Appearance===\nThe character was animated by [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]] and [[Eric Larson]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Pierre Lambert|title=Walt Disney, l'\u00e2ge d'or|page=166|isbn=2950781888}}</ref> but the two animators did not have the same perception of the character, accentuating the elegance of [[Marc Davis (animator)|Davis]] and [[Eric Larson|Larson]]'s opting for simplicity.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pierre Lambert|title=Walt Disney, l'\u00e2ge d'or|page=167|isbn=2950781888}}</ref> As done with other Disney films, [[Walt Disney]] hired actress [[Helene Stanley]] to perform the live-action reference for Cinderella, that she before artists began sketching, playing the role of Cinderella in a particular scene,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters|author=John Grant|isbn=0060157771|page=228}}</ref> and artists to draw animated frames based on the movements of the actress.<ref name=\"archives\" /> She later did the same kind of work for the characters of [[Aurora (Disney)|Princess Aurora]] in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' and Anita Radcliff in ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]''.<ref name=\"archives\">{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Cinderella Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331190207/http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html|archivedate=2010-03-31}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Christopher Finch, author of ''The Art of Walt Disney'':{{cquote|Disney insisted that all scenes involving human characters should be shot first in live-action to determine that they would work before the expensive business of animation was permitted to start.

After her father dies, she is forced into servitude in her own home and is  tormented by her evil stepmother, [[Lady Tremaine]], and two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella. Despite this, she maintains hope through her dreams and remains a kind, gentle and sweet person. She has faith that someday her dreams of happiness will come true and her kindness will be repaid. Cinderella is shown to have a down-to-earth attitude, but she is also a daydreamer.  For example, in \"Sing Sweet Nightingale\", she becomes distracted with the bubbles, allowing Lucifer to smudge the floor she was cleaning.  Also, after hearing that the Grand Duke is traveling the kingdom with the missing slipper, she dreamily dances back to the attic humming the song she heard at the ball. She is also shown to have a sarcastic side and a sharp wit.\n\nWith the help of her animal friends, she fixes up an old party dress of her mother's so she can attend a royal ball.  However, when her evil stepsisters brutally tear the dress apart, she is heartbroken and fears that her dreams will never come true until her [[Fairy Godmother]] appears, restoring Cinderella's hope by transforming her torn homemade dress into her now-iconic silver [[ball gown|gown]] with a glittering crystalline puffed peplum, a delicate laced white [[petticoat]], and puffy sleeves. Her hair is worn up in a [[French twist (hairstyle)|French twist]] supported by a silver headband with diamond earrings, silver-white opera gloves, a black diamond choker, and glass slippers.\n\nHer look was probably inspired by 1950s French haute couture, while her torn dress is clearly inspired by Salvador Dal\u00ec and Elsa Schiaparelli's Tear dress.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lugli|first1=Emanuele|title=Tear That Dress: Cinderella (1950) and Disney's Critique of Postwar Fashion|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/tear-that-dress-off-cinderella-1950-and-disneys-critique-of-postwar-fashion/#.VeWdKtO6feR|website=Bright Lights Film Journal|accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref>\n\nAs a servant, she wears her hair down in a ponytail, held in place with a blue ribbon, sometimes supported by a white scarf and wears a brown dress with a powder blue blouse, a white apron, and black flats.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''Cinderella''===\n{{main|Cinderella (1950 film)}}\n[[File:Disneyland Cinderella handstogether.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cinderella as she appears at [[Disney Parks]].]]\nAt the start of the film, the titular character Cinderella is working as a scullery maid in her own home for her cruel stepmother named Lady Tremaine and her two stepsisters named Anastasia and Drizella. Her only friends are the birds, the mice who also live in the [[manor]], including [[Gus and Jaq]], her pet dog Bruno and her father's horse Major.\n\nShe prepares breakfast for the animals and for her stepfamily before beginning her regular chores. An invitation to the ball arrives at the door and Cinderella wants to attend. Her stepmother tells her she may go under the condition that she must finish her chores and find something suitable to wear. Cinderella discovers her deceased mother's old party dress and hopes to fix it to make it more modern, but she is too busy to do so. Meanwhile, when the mice see shadows of Cinderella's stepsisters throwing down their old sash and beads, Jaq and Gus are forced to quietly retrieve them. The mice use the unwanted items to fix up the dress. Later, Cinderella fears she will not be done working in time and will not be able to attend the ball, but her friends reveal the altered dress. Cinderella is overjoyed and thanks her friends. She races down the steps just in time, but her stepsisters recognize their discarded items and accuse her of stealing their sash and beads. They tear the dress to shreds, leaving Cinderella all by herself, and she runs out to the garden, crying.\n\nHer [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]] appears to make her dreams come true and transforms her torn dress into a beautiful shimmering silver gown. Before Cinderella leaves, her godmother warns her that the spell will be broken at midnight. At the ball, Cinderella dances with Prince Charming and they immediately fall in love with each other. As twelve o'clock approaches, she hurries to leave, hoping to prevent the spell from breaking at the ball, which could cause her to get caught by her stepmother or stepsisters. In her haste, she loses one of her glass slippers on the staircase but fails to retrieve it in time. Cinderella hurries into her coach as it prepares to leave. The spell breaks and Cinderella is in rags once more before reminiscing her dance with the prince and thanking her godmother for all she's done for her. The next day, the prince announces he will marry the maiden whose foot fits into the glass slipper. Lady Tremaine hears Cinderella humming the same song that had played at the ball and figures out Cinderella was the girl Prince Charming fell in love with. Cinderella is locked in the tower by her stepmother, who refuses to let her have the opportunity to try on the slipper, but her animal friends help her escape. She hurries downstairs to try on the glass slipper. Knowing the slipper will fit her, Lady Tremaine intentionally causes the footman to trip and shatter the slipper. Cinderella reveals that she has kept the other slipper. She tries it on, and it fits perfectly. She and the Prince are married soon after.<ref name=\"Film\">{{cite video|people=Wilfred Jackson (director)|title=[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]|publisher=[[Walt Disney]]|date=1950}}</ref>\n\n===''Cinderella II: Dreams Come True''===\n{{main|Cinderella II: Dreams Come True}}\nGus and Jaq, with help of the other mice, and the Fairy Godmother, set off to make a new book to narrate what happens after the ending of the previous story by stringing three segments of stories together, resulting in three individual stories: \"Aim to Please\", \"Tall Tail\", and \"An Uncommon Romance\". In the first story, Cinderella and Prince Charming return home and a party begins shortly afterward. In the second story, \"Tall Tail\", Cinderella works on planning to build up a festival. The mouse named Jaq in the previous film has become a human named Sir Hugh. And in the third story, \"An Uncommon Romance\", Cinderella helps her younger stepsister [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] reconcile with the baker, even though her stepmother Lady Tremaine has forbidden it. Near the end of the film, she reads the book that the mice made for her.<ref>{{cite video|people=John Kafka (director)|title=[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]|publisher=[[DisneyToon Studios]]|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n===''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time''===\n{{main|Cinderella III: A Twist in Time}}\nIn Cinderella III: A Twist in Time, Cinderella's hard-working ethics, optimism, and devotion are put to the test, when she is magically stripped away from her \"happily ever after\" by a vengeful and then magically-empowered Tremaine and is forced to jump into physical action to restore her happy life and relationship with Prince Charming. During these events, Cinderella is shown to be cunning, tactical, persistent, and a fierce rival to those who oppress her. With no magic, being forced to rely solely on her intelligence and fearlessness, Cinderella is able to defeat her stepmother, repair her relationship with a reformed Anastasia and retain her much-deserved life of happiness, proving both her independence and strong will.<ref>{{cite video|people=Frank Nissen (director)|title=[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]|publisher=[[DisneyToon Studios]]|date=2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Sofia the First''===\n{{main|Sofia the First}}\nCinderella appears in the pilot movie ''[[Sofia the First|Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess]]'', where she helps Sofia make friends with Amber, her stepsister.\n\n===\"Le Croissant de Triomphe\"===\nIn the newest editions of ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' short movies, a 2013 production reflects the iconic princess in a crucial moment.\n\nCinderella appears in the third episode of ''Mickey Mouse,'' entitled ''[http://video.disney.com/watch/disneychannel-croissant-de-triomphe-4d7b3aae690a98650d776d97 Le Croissant de Triomphe]''. While a cafe owned and operated by [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] runs out of [[croissant]]s, she makes a phone call to receive from [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] an order of croissants. In order to arrive on time, Mickey hurries and flies through Paris, and accidentally lands in [[Cinderella Castle|a castle]] where [[Prince Charming]] tries to fit the crystal slipper into Cinderella's foot. She was still dressed in her regular maid clothes. At that time, Mickey accidentally passes in his motorcycle and breaks the glass slipper.\n\n===2015 film===\n[[Lily James]] portrays the character, named Ella, in Disney's 2015 live-action version of ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]''. Like in the original film, her father remarries after the death of her mother but after he dies as well, she then becomes the horribly mistreated servant of her stepmother Lady Tremaine and her two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drisella. They give her the nickname \"Cinderella\" when, one morning, she wakes up with [[Cinder|soot]] on her face after sleeping near the fireplace the previous night. Unlike the original film, however, she meets the Prince (named Kit) before the ball while out in the forest. She is also shown to be more assertive when she actually stands up to her stepmother in the film's final act; Lady Tremaine attempts to blackmail Ella by only agreeing to let her try on the glass slipper if Ella will make her head of the royal household and provide suitable husbands for her stepsisters, but Ella rejects this idea, refusing to give Lady Tremaine power over Kit after the way she ruined Ella's life.\n\n==In other media==\n[[File:Tokyo Disneylands cinderella castle.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Cinderella Castle]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]].]]\n[[File:Cinderella castle day.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Cinderella Castle]] at [[Walt Disney World]].]]\nCinderella appears as one of the Disney [[Princesses of Heart]] in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, captured by Maleficent, who destroyed her world.

Chinese characters do not constitute an alphabet or a compact [[syllabary]]. Rather, the writing system is roughly [[Logogram|logosyllabic]]; that is, a character generally represents one [[syllable]] of spoken Chinese and may be a word on its own or a part of a polysyllabic word. The characters themselves are often composed of parts that may represent physical objects, abstract notions,{{sfnp|Wieger|1915}} or pronunciation.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=84}} Literacy requires the memorization of a great number of characters: educated Chinese know about 4,000.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1968}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=73}} The large number of Chinese characters has in part led to the adoption of Western alphabets or other complementary systems as auxiliary means of representing Chinese.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=143}}\n\nVarious current Chinese characters have been traced back to the late [[Shang Dynasty]] about 1200\u20131050 BC,<ref name = \"William G.

The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems: Chinese]</ref> but the process of creating characters is thought to have begun some centuries earlier.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=64\u201365}}  After a period of variation and evolution, Chinese characters were standardized under the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221\u2013206 BC).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=63}}  Over the millennia, these characters have evolved into well-developed styles of [[Chinese calligraphy]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=65\u201370}} As the [[varieties of Chinese]] diverged, a situation of [[diglossia]] developed, with speakers of mutually unintelligible varieties able to communicate through writing using [[Classical Chinese]].{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|pp=155\u2013156}} In the early 20th century, Classical Chinese was replaced in this role by [[written vernacular Chinese]], corresponding to the [[Standard Chinese|standard spoken language]] (\"Mandarin\"). Although most other [[varieties of Chinese]] are not written, there are traditions of [[written Cantonese]], [[written Shanghainese]] and [[written Hokkien]], among others.\n\nSome Chinese characters have been adopted into writing systems of other neighbouring East Asian languages, but are currently used only in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and to a lesser extent in [[Korean language|Korean]], as [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is now written using alphabetic script.<ref name=omniglot/>{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=153}}\n\n==Structure==\n[[Image:Shuowen.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th-century [[Song Dynasty]] redaction of the [[Shuowen Jiezi|Shu\u014dw\u00e9n Ji\u011bz\u00ec]].]]\nWritten Chinese is not based on an alphabet or a compact syllabary.{{sfnp|Wieger|1915}}  Instead, Chinese characters are [[glyphs]] whose components may depict objects or represent abstract notions.  Occasionally a character consists of only one component; more commonly two or more components are combined to form more complex characters, using a variety of different principles.  The best known exposition of Chinese character composition is the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', compiled by [[Xu Shen]] around 120 AD.  Since Xu Shen did not have access to Chinese characters in their earliest forms, his analysis cannot always be taken as authoritative.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=9}}  Nonetheless, no later work has supplanted the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' in terms of breadth, and it is still relevant to etymological research today.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=67}}\n\n===Derivation of characters===\n{{main article|Chinese character classification}}\nAccording to the ''Shuowen Jiezi'', Chinese characters are developed on six basic principles.{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|pp=10\u201311}}  (These principles, though popularized by the ''Shuowen Jiezi'', were developed earlier; the oldest known mention of them is in the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'', a text from about 150 BC.<ref name=LuXun1934>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinyin.info/readings/lu_xun/writing.html|author=Lu Xun|year=1934|title=An Outsider's Chats about Written Language|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>)  The first two principles produce simple characters, known as \u6587 ''w\u00e9n'':{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li> {{lang|zh|\u8c61\u5f62}} ''xi\u00e0ngx\u00edng'': [[Pictographs]], in which the character is a graphical depiction of the object it denotes.  Examples: \u4eba ''r\u00e9n'' \"person\", \u65e5 ''r\u00ec'' \"sun\", \u6728 ''m\u00f9'' \"tree/wood\". </li>\n<li> {{lang|zh|\u6307\u4e8b}} ''zh\u01d0sh\u00ec'': Indicatives, or [[ideographs]], in which the character represents an abstract notion.  Examples: \u4e0a ''sh\u00e0ng'' \"up\", \u4e0b ''xi\u00e0'' \"down\", \u4e09 ''s\u0101n'' \"three\". </li>\n</ol>\n\nThe remaining four principles produce complex characters historically called \u5b57 ''z\u00ec'' (although this term is now generally used to refer to all characters, whether simple or complex).  Of these four, two construct characters from simpler parts:{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li> {{lang|zh-hant|\u6703\u610f}}/{{lang|zh-hans|\u4f1a\u610f}} ''hu\u00ecy\u00ec'': Logical aggregates, in which two or more parts are used for their meaning.  This yields a composite meaning, which is then applied to the new character.  E.g., {{lang|zh-hant|\u6771}}/{{lang|zh-hans|\u4e1c}} ''d\u014dng'' \"east\", which represents a sun rising in the trees. </li>\n<li> {{lang|zh-hant|\u5f62\u8072}}/{{lang|zh-hans|\u5f62\u58f0}} ''x\u00edngsh\u0113ng'': Phonetic complexes, in which one part\u2014often called the [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]]\u2014indicates the general semantic category of the character (such as water-related or eye-related), and the other part is another character, used for its phonetic value.  Example: \u6674 ''q\u00edng'' \"clear/fair (weather)\", which is composed of \u65e5 ''r\u00ec'' \"sun\", and \u9752 ''q\u012bng'' \"blue/green\", which is used for its pronunciation. </li>\n</ol>\n\nIn contrast to the popular conception of Chinese as a primarily pictographic or ideographic language, the vast majority of Chinese characters (about 95% of the characters in the ''Shuowen Jiezi'') are constructed as either logical aggregates or, more often, phonetic complexes.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=84}} In fact, some phonetic complexes were originally simple pictographs that were later augmented by the addition of a semantic root.  An example is \u70b7 ''zh\u00f9'' \"candle\" (now archaic, meaning \"lampwick\"), which was originally a pictograph \u4e3b, a character that is now pronounced ''zh\u01d4'' and means \"host\", or  The character \u706b ''hu\u01d2'' \"fire\" was added to indicate that the meaning is fire-related.{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|p=30}}\n\nThe last two principles do not produce new written forms Instead, they transfer new meanings to existing forms:{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li> {{lang|zh-hant|\u8f49\u6ce8}}/{{lang|zh-hans|\u8f6c\u6ce8}} ''zhu\u01cenzh\u00f9'': Transference, in which a character, often with a simple, concrete meaning takes on an extended, more abstract meaning.  Example: \u7db2/\u7f51 ''w\u01ceng'' \"net\", which was originally a pictograph depicting a fishing net.  Over time, it has taken on an extended meaning, covering any kind of lattice; for instance, it can be used to refer to a computer network. </li>\n<li> {{lang|zh|\u5047\u501f}} ''ji\u01ceji\u00e8'': Borrowing, in which a character is used, either intentionally or accidentally, for some entirely different purpose.  Example: \u54e5 ''g\u0113'' \"older brother\", which is written with a character originally meaning \"song/sing\", now written \u6b4c ''g\u0113''.  Once, there was no character for \"older brother\", so an otherwise unrelated character with the right pronunciation was borrowed for that meaning. </li>\n</ol>\n\nChinese characters are written to fit into a square, even when composed of two simpler forms written side-by-side or top-to-bottom.  In such cases, each form is compressed to fit the entire character into a square.{{sfnp|Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|1994|p=52}}\n\n===Strokes===\n\n{{main article|Stroke (CJK character)}}\n\nCharacter components can be further subdivided into ''strokes''.  The strokes of Chinese characters fall into eight main categories: horizontal (\u4e00), vertical (\u4e28),  left-falling (\u4e3f), right-falling (\u4e36), rising (lower element of \u51ab), dot (\u3001), hook (\u4e85), and turning (\u4e5b, \u4e5a, \u4e59, etc.).{{sfnp|Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|1994|pp=31\u201343}}\n\nThere are eight basic rules of stroke order in writing a Chinese character:\n\n# Horizontal strokes are written before vertical ones.\n# Left-falling strokes are written before right-falling ones.\n# Characters are written from top to bottom.\n# Characters are written from left to right.\n# If a character is framed from above, the frame is written first.\n# If a character is framed from below, the frame is written last.\n# Frames are closed last.\n# In a symmetrical character, the middle is drawn first, then the sides.\n\nThese rules do not strictly apply to every situation and are occasionally violated.{{sfnp|Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|1994|pp=46\u201349}}\n\n===Layout===\n{{main article|Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|Chinese punctuation|}}\n\n[[File:HK Hung Hom \u4eac\u90fd\u5927\u9152\u6a13 Capital Restaurant Ma Tau Wai Road 35 Fat Kwong Street KMBus Stop.JPG|thumb |right|Vertical Chinese writing seen on a restaurant sign and bus stop in Hong Kong.]]\n\nChinese characters conform to a roughly square frame and are not usually linked to one another, so do not have a preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being on the right side of the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no [[Chinese punctuation|punctuation]], with sentence and phrase breaks being determined by context and rhythm.<ref name=HuangEtAl2002>{{cite conference |author= Liang Huang |title= Statistical Part-of-Speech Tagging for Classical Chinese |conference=Text, Speech, and Dialogue: Fifth International Conference |year=2002 |pages=115\u2013122 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.\n\nIn modern times, the familiar Western layout, left-to-right horizontal Chinese, has become more popular. Similar to Latin-letter text, the horizontal rows are read from left to right, then top of the page to the bottom. This is used especially in the [[People's Republic of China]] (mainland China), where the government mandated left-to-right writing in 1955.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=80}}  The government of the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) followed suit in 2004 for official documents.<ref name=BBC2004>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3683825.stm |author= BBC News journalists |date=4 May 2004 |title= Taiwan Law Orders One-Way Writing |publisher= BBC |accessdate= 2007-09-05 |quote= Official Taiwanese documents can no longer be written from right to left or from top to bottom in a new law passed by the country's parliament }}</ref>  The use of punctuation has also become more common, whether the text is written in columns or rows.  The punctuation marks are clearly influenced by their Western counterparts, although some marks are particular to Asian languages: for example, the double and single quotation marks (\u300e \u300f and \u300c \u300d); the hollow period dot (\u3002), which is otherwise used just like an ordinary period full-stop; and a special kind of comma called an ''[[enumeration comma]]'' (\u3001), which is used to separate items in a list, as opposed to clauses in a sentence.\n\nStreet and shop [[Signage|signs]] are a particularly challenging aspect of written Chinese layout, since they can be written either left-to-right, or right-to-left (the latter can be thought of as the traditional layout with each \"column\" being one character high), as well as from top to bottom.  It is not uncommon to encounter all three orientations on signs on neighboring stores.<ref name=Go1995.P>{{cite book |author= Ping-gam Go |title= Understanding Chinese Characters (Third Edition) |year=1995 |publisher= Simplex Publications |pages= P1\u2013P31}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n\n{{main article|Chinese calligraphy}}\n\n[[Image:Shang_dynasty_inscribed_tortoise_plastron.jpg|thumb|left|An ancient Chinese [[oracle bone]].]]\nChinese is one of the oldest continually used writing systems still in use.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=ix}} The earliest generally accepted examples of Chinese writing date back to the reign of the [[Shang Dynasty]] king [[Wu Ding]] (1250\u20131192 BC).  These were divinatory inscriptions on [[oracle bones]], primarily ox scapulae and turtle shells.  Characters were carved on the bones in order to frame a question; the bones were then heated over a fire and the resulting cracks were interpreted to determine the answer.  Such characters are called \u7532\u9aa8\u6587 ''ji\u01ceg\u01d4w\u00e9n'' \"shell-bone script\" or [[oracle bone script]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nIn 2003, some 11 isolated symbols carved on tortoise shells were found at [[Jiahu]], an archaeological site in the [[Henan]] province of China, some bearing a striking resemblance to certain modern characters, such as \u76ee ''m\u00f9'' \"eye\".  Since the Jiahu site dates from about 6600 BC, it predates the earliest confirmed Chinese writing by more than 5,000&nbsp;years.  Dr Garman Harbottle, of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, US, who headed a team of archaeologists at the [[University of Science and Technology of China]], in Anhui province, has suggested that these symbols were precursors of Chinese writing, but  Professor David Keightley, of the University of California, Berkeley, US whose field of expertise is the origins of Chinese civilization in the Neolithic and early Bronze Ages, employing  archaeological and inscriptional evidence, suggests that the time gap is too great for a connection.<ref name=Rincon2003>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2956925.stm|author=Paul Rincon|year=2003|title=Earliest Writing Found in China|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Western Zhou Ritual Containers3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Left: Bronze \u65b9\u6a3d ''f\u0101ngz\u016bn'' [[Chinese ritual bronzes|ritual wine container]] dated about 1000 BC.

An inscription of some 180 Chinese characters appears twice on the vessel, commenting on state rituals that accompanied a court ceremony.]]\n\nFrom the late Shang Dynasty, Chinese writing evolved into the form found in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|cast inscriptions]] on [[Chinese ritual bronzes]] made during the Western [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c 1066\u2013770 BC) and the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770\u2013476 BC), a kind of writing called \u91d1\u6587 ''j\u012bnw\u00e9n'' \"metal script\".  Jinwen characters are less angular and angularized than the oracle bone script.  Later, in the [[Warring States period]] (475\u2013221 BC), the script became still more regular, and settled on a form, called \u516d\u570b\u6587\u5b57/\u516d\u56fd\u6587\u5b57 ''li\u00f9gu\u00f3 w\u00e9nz\u00ec'' \"script of the six states\", that Xu Shen used as source material in the ''Shuowen Jiezi''.  These characters were later embellished and stylized to yield the [[seal script]], which represents the oldest form of Chinese characters still in modern use.  They are used principally for signature seals, or [[seal (Chinese)|chops]], which are often used in place of a signature for Chinese documents and artwork.  [[Li Si]] promulgated the seal script as the standard throughout the empire during the [[Qin dynasty]], then newly unified.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=63}}\n\nSeal script in turn evolved into the other surviving writing styles; the first writing style to follow was the clerical script.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=64\u201365}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=65\u201370}}  The development of such a style can be attributed to those of the Qin Dynasty who were seeking to create a convenient form of written characters for daily usage. In general, clerical script characters are \"flat\" in appearance, being wider than the seal script, which tends to be taller than it is wide. Compared with the seal script, clerical script characters are strikingly rectilinear.  In [[running script]], a semi-cursive form, the character elements begin to run into each other, although the characters themselves generally remain separate.\nRunning script eventually evolved into [[grass script]], a fully cursive form, in which the characters are often entirely unrecognizable by their canonical forms.  Grass script gives the impression of anarchy in its appearance, and there is indeed considerable freedom on the part of the calligrapher, but this freedom is circumscribed by conventional \"abbreviations\" in the forms of the characters.  [[Regular script]], a non-cursive form, is the most widely recognized script.  In regular script, each stroke of each character is clearly drawn out from the others.  Even though both the running and grass scripts appear to be derived as semi-cursive and cursive variants of regular script, it is in fact the regular script that was the last to develop.\n\n{|\n|[[Image:XiaozhuanQinquan sized.jpg|200x200px]]\n|[[Image:LishuHuashanmiao.jpg|150x200px]]\n|[[Image:XingshuLantingxv.jpg|150x200px]]\n|[[Image:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|150x200px]]\n|[[Image:KaishuOuyangxun.jpg|150x200px]]\n|-\n|<center>Seal</center>\n|<center>Clerical</center>\n|<center>Running (semi-cursive)</center>\n|<center>Grass (fully cursive)</center>\n|<center>Regular (non-cursive)</center>\n|}\n\nRegular script is considered the archetype for Chinese writing and forms the basis for most printed forms.  In addition, regular script imposes a [[Stroke order#General guidelines|stroke order]], which must be followed in order for the characters to be written correctly.{{sfnp|McNaughton|Ying|1999|p=24}}  (Strictly speaking, this stroke order applies to the clerical, running, and grass scripts as well, but especially in the running and grass scripts, this order is occasionally deviated from.)  Thus, for instance, the character \u6728 ''m\u00f9'' \"wood\" must be written starting with the horizontal stroke, drawn from left to right; next, the vertical stroke, from top to bottom; next, the left diagonal stroke, from top to bottom; and lastly the right diagonal stroke, from top to bottom.{{sfnp|McNaughton|Ying|1999|p=43}}\n\n===Simplified and traditional Chinese===\n\n{{main article|Simplified Chinese|Traditional Chinese|Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters}}\nIn the 20th century, written Chinese divided into two canonical forms, called [[simplified Chinese]] and [[traditional Chinese]].  Simplified Chinese was developed in mainland China in order to make the characters faster to write (especially as some characters had as many as a few dozen strokes) and easier to memorize.  The People's Republic of China claims that both goals have been achieved, but some external observers disagree.  Little systematic study has been conducted on how simplified Chinese has affected the way Chinese people become literate; the only studies conducted before it was standardized in mainland China seem to have been statistical ones regarding how many strokes were saved on average in samples of running text.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=151}}\n\nThe simplified forms have also been criticized for being inconsistent.  For instance, traditional \u8b93 ''r\u00e0ng'' \"allow\" is simplified to \u8ba9, in which the phonetic on the right side is reduced from 17 strokes to just three.  (The speech radical on the left has also been simplified.)  However, the same phonetic is used in its full form, even in simplified Chinese, in such characters as \u58e4 ''r\u01ceng'' \"soil\" and \u9f49 ''n\u00e0ng'' \"snuffle\"; these forms remained uncontracted because they were relatively uncommon and would therefore represent a negligible stroke reduction.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=152}}  On the other hand, some simplified forms are simply long-standing calligraphic abbreviations, as for example \u4e07 ''w\u00e0n'' \"[[myriad|ten thousand]]\", for which the traditional Chinese form is \u842c.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=147}}\n\nSimplified Chinese is standard in the mainland of China, [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]].  Traditional Chinese is retained in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]] and [[overseas Chinese]] communities (except [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]).<ref name=Bruggeman2006>{{Cite journal|author=Sebastien Bruggeman|title=Chinese Language Processing and Computing|year=2006}}</ref>  Throughout this article, Chinese text is given in both simplified and traditional forms when they differ, with the traditional forms being given first.\n\n==Function==\n\n[[Image:Tomb Fu Hao YinXu.jpg|Burial pit at Tomb of Lady Fu Hao|thumb|230px|right|[[Tomb of Fu Hao]], c. 1200 BC, containing some 200 bronze vessels with 109 inscriptions in [[oracle bone script]] of [[Fu Hao]]'s name.<ref>Thorp, Robert L. \"The Date of Tomb 5 at Yinxu, Anyang: A Review Article,\" Artibus Asiae (Volume 43, Number 3, 1981): 239\u2013246. esp. pp. 240, 245.</ref>]]\nAt the inception of written Chinese, spoken Chinese was monosyllabic; that is, Chinese words expressing independent concepts (objects, actions, relations, etc.) were usually one syllable.  Each written character corresponded to one monosyllabic word.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=84}}  The spoken language has since become polysyllabic,{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|pp=177\u2013188}} but because modern polysyllabic words are usually composed of older monosyllabic words, Chinese characters have always been used to represent individual Chinese syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=75}}\n\nFor over two thousand years, the prevailing written standard was a vocabulary and syntax rooted in Chinese as spoken around the time of [[Confucius]] (about 500 BC), called [[Classical Chinese]], or \u6587\u8a00\u6587 ''w\u00e9ny\u00e1nw\u00e9n''.  Over the centuries, Classical Chinese gradually acquired some of its grammar and character senses from the various dialects.  This accretion was generally slow and minor; however, by the 20th century, Classical Chinese was distinctly different from any contemporary dialect, and had to be learned separately.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=83}}{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=154}}  Once learned, it was a common medium for communication between people speaking different dialects, many of which were mutually unintelligible by the end of the first millennium AD.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=24\u201325}}  A Mandarin speaker might say ''y\u012b'', a [[Cantonese]] ''y\u0101t'', a [[Shanghainese]] ''iq'', and a [[Hokkien]] ''chit'', but all four will understand the character <{{wiktzh|\u4e00}}> to mean \"one\".{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nChinese languages and dialects vary by not only pronunciation, but also, to a lesser extent, vocabulary and grammar.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=88}}  Modern written Chinese, which replaced Classical Chinese as the written standard as an indirect result of the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, is not technically bound to any single variety; however, it most nearly represents the vocabulary and syntax of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], by far the most widespread Chinese dialectal family in terms of both geographical area and number of speakers.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=87}}  This version of written Chinese is called [[Vernacular Chinese]], or \u767d\u8a71/\u767d\u8bdd ''b\u00e1ihu\u00e0'' (literally, \"plain speech\").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=109}}  Despite its ties to the dominant Mandarin language, Vernacular Chinese also permits some communication between people of different dialects, limited by the fact that Vernacular Chinese expressions are often ungrammatical or unidiomatic in non-Mandarin dialects.  This role may not differ substantially from the role of other [[lingua franca|linguae francae]], such as [[Latin]]: For those trained in written Chinese, it serves as a common medium; for those untrained in it, the graphic nature of the characters is in general no aid to common understanding (characters such as \"one\" notwithstanding).{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=150}}  In this regard, Chinese characters may be considered a large and inefficient phonetic script.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=72}}  However, Ghil'ad Zuckermann\u2019s exploration of [[phono-semantic matching]] in [[Standard Chinese]] concludes that the Chinese writing system is multifunctional, conveying both semantic and phonetic content.<ref>Ghil'ad Zuckermann (2003), [http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?is=140391723X ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew''], Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 255.</ref>\n\nThe variation in vocabulary among dialects has also led to the informal use of \"dialectal characters\", as well as standard characters that are nevertheless considered archaic by today's standards.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=76}}  Cantonese is unique among non-Mandarin regional languages in having a written colloquial standard, used in Hong Kong and overseas, with a large number of unofficial characters for words particular to this language.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=99}}  [[Written Cantonese|Written colloquial Cantonese]] has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging, although for formal written communications Cantonese speakers still normally use Vernacular Chinese.<ref name=Lam2004>{{cite journal|author=Wan Shun Eva Lam|title=Second Language Socialization in a Bilingual Chat Room: Global and Local Considerations|year=2004|journal=Learning, Language, and Technology|volume=8|issue=3}}</ref> To a lesser degree [[Hokkien]] is used in a similar way in Taiwan and elsewhere, although it lacks the level of standardization seen in Cantonese.

A notable exception to this rule was the system of [[man'y\u014dgana]], which used a small set of Chinese characters to help indicate pronunciation.  The man'y\u014dgana later developed into the phonetic syllabaries, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].<ref name=RaghavacharyaEtAl2006>{{cite conference|author=Hari Raghavacharya|title=Perspectives for the Historical Information Retrieval with Digitized Japanese Classical Manuscripts|conference=Proceedings of the 20th Annual Conference of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence|year=2006|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nChinese characters are called ''h\u00e0nz\u00ec'' in Mandarin, after the [[Han Dynasty]] of China; in Japanese, this was pronounced ''[[kanji]]''.  In modern [[Japanese writing system|written Japanese]], kanji are used for most nouns, verb stems, and adjective stems, while hiragana are used for grammatical elements and miscellaneous words that have no common kanji rendition; katakana are used for transliteration of loanwords from other languages, the names of plants, animals and certain scientific or technical words, onomatopoeia and emphasis.  The [[J\u014dy\u014d kanji]], a list of kanji for common use standardized by the Japanese government, contains 2,136 characters\u2014about half the number of characters commanded by literate Chinese.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=153}}\n\nThe role of Chinese characters in Korean and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is much more limited.  At one time, many Chinese characters (called [[hanja]]) were introduced into Korean for their meaning, just as in Japanese.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=153}}  Today, Korean is written almost exclusively using the [[Hangul]] alphabet with a small number of Chinese characters. Each square block character contains Hangul symbols, or letters, that together represent a syllable.{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|p=58}} Similarly, the use of Chinese and Chinese-styled characters in the Vietnamese [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]] script has been almost entirely superseded by the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=79}} Chinese characters are still actively used in South Korea today, mostly for signs, newspapers, books, and government documents.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nChinese characters are also used within China to write non-Han languages. The largest non-Han group in China, the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], have for over 1300 years used Chinese characters. Despite both the introduction of an official alphabetic script in 1957 and lack of a corresponding official set of Chinese characters, more Zhuang people can read the [[sawndip|Zhuang logograms]] than the alphabetic script.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n==Media==\nOver the history of written Chinese, a variety of media have been used for writing. They include:\n* [[Bamboo and wooden slips]], from at least the thirteenth century BC\n* [[History of paper|Paper]], invented no later than the second century BC\n* [[Silk]], since at least the Han dynasty\n* Stone, metal, wood, bamboo, plastic and ivory on [[Seal (East Asia)|seals]].\n\nSince at least the Han dynasty, such media have been used to create [[hanging scroll]]s and [[handscroll]]s.\n\n==Literacy==\n\nBecause the majority of modern Chinese words contain more than one character, there are at least two measuring sticks for Chinese literacy: the number of characters known, and the number of words known.  [[John DeFrancis]], in the introduction to his ''Advanced Chinese Reader'', estimates that a typical Chinese college graduate recognizes 4,000 to 5,000 characters, and 40,000 to 60,000 words.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1968}}  [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]], in ''Chinese'', places the number of characters somewhat lower, at 3,000 to 4,000.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=73}} These counts are complicated by the tangled development of Chinese characters.  In many cases, a single character came to be written in [[Variant Chinese character|multiple ways]]. This development was restrained to an extent by the standardization of the seal script during the Qin dynasty, but soon started again. Although the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' lists 10,516 characters\u20149,353 of them unique (some of which may already have been out of use by the time it was compiled) plus 1,163 graphic variants\u2014the ''[[Jiyun]]'' of the Northern [[Song Dynasty]], compiled less than a thousand years later in 1039, contains 53,525 characters, most of them graphic variants.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=72}}\n\n===Dictionaries===\n\n{{main article|Chinese dictionary}}\n\nWritten Chinese is not based on an alphabet or syllabary, so Chinese dictionaries, as well as dictionaries that define Chinese characters in other languages, cannot easily be alphabetized or otherwise lexically ordered, as English dictionaries are.  The need to arrange Chinese characters in order to permit efficient lookup has given rise to a considerable variety of ways to organize and index the characters.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=92}}\n\nA traditional mechanism is the method of radicals, which uses a set of character roots.  These roots, or radicals, generally but imperfectly align with the parts used to compose characters by means of logical aggregation and phonetic complex.  A [[canonical form|canonical]] set of 214 radicals was developed during the rule of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (around the year 1700); these are sometimes called the Kangxi radicals.  The radicals are ordered first by stroke count (that is, the number of strokes required to write the radical); within a given stroke count, the radicals also have a prescribed order.{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|p=19}}\n\nEvery Chinese character falls (sometimes arbitrarily or incorrectly) under the heading of exactly one of these 214 radicals.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=92}}  In many cases, the radicals are themselves characters, which naturally come first under their own heading.  All other characters under a given radical are ordered by the stroke count of the character.   Usually, however, there are still many characters with a given stroke count under a given radical.  At this point, characters are not given in any recognizable order; the user must locate the character by going through all the characters with that stroke count, typically listed for convenience at the top of the page on which they occur.{{sfnp|Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|1994|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nBecause the method of radicals is applied only to the written character, one need not know how to pronounce a character before looking it up; the entry, once located, usually gives the pronunciation.  However, it is not always easy to identify which of the various roots of a character is the proper radical.  Accordingly, dictionaries often include a list of hard to locate characters, indexed by total stroke count, near the beginning of the dictionary.  Some dictionaries include almost one-seventh of all characters in this list.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=92}}\n\nOther methods of organization exist, often in an attempt to address the shortcomings of the radical method, but are less common.  For instance, it is common for a dictionary ordered principally by the Kangxi radicals to have an auxiliary index by pronunciation, expressed typically in either [[hanyu pinyin]] or [[zhuyin fuhao]].{{sfnp|McNaughton|Ying|1999|p=20}}  This index points to the page in the main dictionary where the desired character can be found.  Other methods use only the structure of the characters, such as the [[four-corner method]], in which characters are indexed according to the kinds of strokes located nearest the four corners (hence the name of the method),<ref name=WangWang1994>{{cite journal|author=Gwo-En Wang, Jhing-Fa Wang|title=A New Hierarchical Approach for Recognition of Unconstrained Handwritten Numerals|journal=IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics|volume=40|issue=3|year=1994|pages=428\u2013436|doi=10.1109/30.320824}}</ref> or the [[Cangjie method]], in which characters are broken down into a set of 24 basic components.<ref name=Su2005>{{Cite thesis|author=Hsi-Yao Su|title=Language Styling and Switching in Speech and Online Contexts: Identity and Language Ideologies in Taiwan|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|degree=Ph.D.|year=2005|url=http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/1800}}</ref>  Neither the four-corner method nor the Cangjie method requires the user to identify the proper radical, although many strokes or components have alternate forms, which must be memorized in order to use these methods effectively.\n\nThe availability of computerized Chinese dictionaries now makes it possible to look characters up by any of the indexing schemes described, thereby shortening the search process.\n\n===Transliteration and romanization===\n\n{{main article|Chinese romanization|Xiao'erjing|Pinyin|Zhuyin|Wade-Giles|Gwoyeu Romatzyh}}\n\nChinese characters do not reliably indicate their pronunciation, even for one dialect.  It is therefore useful to be able to transliterate a dialect of Chinese into the Latin alphabet or the Perso-Arabic script [[Xiao'erjing]] for those who cannot read Chinese characters.  However, transliteration was not always considered merely a way to record the sounds of any particular dialect of Chinese; it was once also considered a potential replacement for the Chinese characters.  This was first prominently proposed during the May Fourth Movement, and it gained further support with the victory of the Communists in 1949.  Immediately afterward, the mainland government began two parallel programs relating to written Chinese.  One was the development of an alphabetic script for Mandarin, which was spoken by about two-thirds of the Chinese population;{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=88}} the other was the simplification of the traditional characters\u2014a process that would eventually lead to simplified Chinese.  The latter was not viewed as an impediment to the former; rather, it would ease the transition toward the exclusive use of an alphabetic (or at least phonetic) script.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=143}}\n\nBy 1958, however, priority was given officially to [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]; a phonetic script, hanyu pinyin, had been developed, but its deployment to the exclusion of simplified characters was pushed off to some distant future date.  The association between pinyin and Mandarin, as opposed to other dialects, may have contributed to this deferment.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=144\u2013145}}  It seems unlikely that pinyin will supplant Chinese characters anytime soon as the ''sole'' means of representing Chinese.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nPinyin uses the Latin alphabet, along with a few [[diacritical marks]], to represent the sounds of Mandarin in standard pronunciation.  For the most part, pinyin uses vowel and consonant letters as they are used in Romance languages (and also in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]).  However, although 'b' and 'p', for instance, represent the voice/unvoiced distinction in some languages, such as [[French language|French]], they represent the [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated/aspirated]] distinction in Mandarin; Mandarin has few voiced consonants.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=88}}  Also, the pinyin spellings for a few consonant sounds are markedly different from their spellings in other languages that use the Latin alphabet; for instance, pinyin 'q' and 'x' sound similar to English 'ch' and 'sh', respectively.  Pinyin is not the sole transliteration scheme for Mandarin\u2014there are also, for instance, the [[zhuyin fuhao]], [[Wade-Giles]], and [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] systems\u2014but it is dominant in the Chinese-speaking world.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=265}}  All transliterations in this article use the pinyin system.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mainland Chinese Braille]]\n*[[Taiwanese braille]] (Taiwanese Mandarin)\n*[[Cantonese braille]]\n*[[Chinese input methods for computers]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*{{cite book|first=J|last=Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|title=Learn to Write Chinese Characters|year=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-05771-7|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/learntowritechin00bjor}}\n*{{cite book|first=John |last=DeFrancis|authorlink=John DeFrancis|title=Advanced Chinese Reader|year=1968|publisher=The Murray Printing Co|isbn=0-300-01083-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|first=John |last=DeFrancis|title=The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy|year=1984|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-0866-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma |first=Wm.

Although most other [[varieties of Chinese]] are not written, there are traditions of [[written Cantonese]], [[written Shanghainese]] and [[written Hokkien]], among others.\n\nSome Chinese characters have been adopted into writing systems of other neighbouring East Asian languages, but are currently used only in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and to a lesser extent in [[Korean language|Korean]], as [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is now written using alphabetic script.<ref name=omniglot/>{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=153}}\n\n==Structure==\n[[Image:Shuowen.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th-century [[Song Dynasty]] redaction of the [[Shuowen Jiezi|Shu\u014dw\u00e9n Ji\u011bz\u00ec]].]]\nWritten Chinese is not based on an alphabet or a compact syllabary.{{sfnp|Wieger|1915}}  Instead, Chinese characters are [[glyphs]] whose components may depict objects or represent abstract notions.  Occasionally a character consists of only one component; more commonly two or more components are combined to form more complex characters, using a variety of different principles.  The best known exposition of Chinese character composition is the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', compiled by [[Xu Shen]] around 120 AD.  Since Xu Shen did not have access to Chinese characters in their earliest forms, his analysis cannot always be taken as authoritative.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=9}}  Nonetheless, no later work has supplanted the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' in terms of breadth, and it is still relevant to etymological research today.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=67}}\n\n===Derivation of characters===\n{{main article|Chinese character classification}}\nAccording to the ''Shuowen Jiezi'', Chinese characters are developed on six basic principles.{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|pp=10\u201311}}  (These principles, though popularized by the ''Shuowen Jiezi'', were developed earlier; the oldest known mention of them is in the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'', a text from about 150 BC.<ref name=LuXun1934>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinyin.info/readings/lu_xun/writing.html|author=Lu Xun|year=1934|title=An Outsider's Chats about Written Language|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>)  The first two principles produce simple characters, known as \u6587 ''w\u00e9n'':{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li> {{lang|zh|\u8c61\u5f62}} ''xi\u00e0ngx\u00edng'': [[Pictographs]], in which the character is a graphical depiction of the object it denotes.  Examples: \u4eba ''r\u00e9n'' \"person\", \u65e5 ''r\u00ec'' \"sun\", \u6728 ''m\u00f9'' \"tree/wood\". </li>\n<li> {{lang|zh|\u6307\u4e8b}} ''zh\u01d0sh\u00ec'': Indicatives, or [[ideographs]], in which the character represents an abstract notion.  Examples: \u4e0a ''sh\u00e0ng'' \"up\", \u4e0b ''xi\u00e0'' \"down\", \u4e09 ''s\u0101n'' \"three\". </li>\n</ol>\n\nThe remaining four principles produce complex characters historically called \u5b57 ''z\u00ec'' (although this term is now generally used to refer to all characters, whether simple or complex).  Of these four, two construct characters from simpler parts:{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li> {{lang|zh-hant|\u6703\u610f}}/{{lang|zh-hans|\u4f1a\u610f}} ''hu\u00ecy\u00ec'': Logical aggregates, in which two or more parts are used for their meaning.  This yields a composite meaning, which is then applied to the new character.  E.g., {{lang|zh-hant|\u6771}}/{{lang|zh-hans|\u4e1c}} ''d\u014dng'' \"east\", which represents a sun rising in the trees. </li>\n<li> {{lang|zh-hant|\u5f62\u8072}}/{{lang|zh-hans|\u5f62\u58f0}} ''x\u00edngsh\u0113ng'': Phonetic complexes, in which one part\u2014often called the [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]]\u2014indicates the general semantic category of the character (such as water-related or eye-related), and the other part is another character, used for its phonetic value.  Example: \u6674 ''q\u00edng'' \"clear/fair (weather)\", which is composed of \u65e5 ''r\u00ec'' \"sun\", and \u9752 ''q\u012bng'' \"blue/green\", which is used for its pronunciation. </li>\n</ol>\n\nIn contrast to the popular conception of Chinese as a primarily pictographic or ideographic language, the vast majority of Chinese characters (about 95% of the characters in the ''Shuowen Jiezi'') are constructed as either logical aggregates or, more often, phonetic complexes.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=84}} In fact, some phonetic complexes were originally simple pictographs that were later augmented by the addition of a semantic root.  An example is \u70b7 ''zh\u00f9'' \"candle\" (now archaic, meaning \"lampwick\"), which was originally a pictograph \u4e3b, a character that is now pronounced ''zh\u01d4'' and means \"host\", or  The character \u706b ''hu\u01d2'' \"fire\" was added to indicate that the meaning is fire-related.{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|p=30}}\n\nThe last two principles do not produce new written forms Instead, they transfer new meanings to existing forms:{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li> {{lang|zh-hant|\u8f49\u6ce8}}/{{lang|zh-hans|\u8f6c\u6ce8}} ''zhu\u01cenzh\u00f9'': Transference, in which a character, often with a simple, concrete meaning takes on an extended, more abstract meaning.  Example: \u7db2/\u7f51 ''w\u01ceng'' \"net\", which was originally a pictograph depicting a fishing net.  Over time, it has taken on an extended meaning, covering any kind of lattice; for instance, it can be used to refer to a computer network. </li>\n<li> {{lang|zh|\u5047\u501f}} ''ji\u01ceji\u00e8'': Borrowing, in which a character is used, either intentionally or accidentally, for some entirely different purpose.  Example: \u54e5 ''g\u0113'' \"older brother\", which is written with a character originally meaning \"song/sing\", now written \u6b4c ''g\u0113''.  Once, there was no character for \"older brother\", so an otherwise unrelated character with the right pronunciation was borrowed for that meaning. </li>\n</ol>\n\nChinese characters are written to fit into a square, even when composed of two simpler forms written side-by-side or top-to-bottom.  In such cases, each form is compressed to fit the entire character into a square.{{sfnp|Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|1994|p=52}}\n\n===Strokes===\n\n{{main article|Stroke (CJK character)}}\n\nCharacter components can be further subdivided into ''strokes''.  The strokes of Chinese characters fall into eight main categories: horizontal (\u4e00), vertical (\u4e28),  left-falling (\u4e3f), right-falling (\u4e36), rising (lower element of \u51ab), dot (\u3001), hook (\u4e85), and turning (\u4e5b, \u4e5a, \u4e59, etc.).{{sfnp|Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|1994|pp=31\u201343}}\n\nThere are eight basic rules of stroke order in writing a Chinese character:\n\n# Horizontal strokes are written before vertical ones.\n# Left-falling strokes are written before right-falling ones.\n# Characters are written from top to bottom.\n# Characters are written from left to right.\n# If a character is framed from above, the frame is written first.\n# If a character is framed from below, the frame is written last.\n# Frames are closed last.\n# In a symmetrical character, the middle is drawn first, then the sides.\n\nThese rules do not strictly apply to every situation and are occasionally violated.{{sfnp|Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|1994|pp=46\u201349}}\n\n===Layout===\n{{main article|Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|Chinese punctuation|}}\n\n[[File:HK Hung Hom \u4eac\u90fd\u5927\u9152\u6a13 Capital Restaurant Ma Tau Wai Road 35 Fat Kwong Street KMBus Stop.JPG|thumb |right|Vertical Chinese writing seen on a restaurant sign and bus stop in Hong Kong.]]\n\nChinese characters conform to a roughly square frame and are not usually linked to one another, so do not have a preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being on the right side of the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no [[Chinese punctuation|punctuation]], with sentence and phrase breaks being determined by context and rhythm.<ref name=HuangEtAl2002>{{cite conference |author= Liang Huang |title= Statistical Part-of-Speech Tagging for Classical Chinese |conference=Text, Speech, and Dialogue: Fifth International Conference |year=2002 |pages=115\u2013122 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.\n\nIn modern times, the familiar Western layout, left-to-right horizontal Chinese, has become more popular. Similar to Latin-letter text, the horizontal rows are read from left to right, then top of the page to the bottom. This is used especially in the [[People's Republic of China]] (mainland China), where the government mandated left-to-right writing in 1955.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=80}}  The government of the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) followed suit in 2004 for official documents.<ref name=BBC2004>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3683825.stm |author= BBC News journalists |date=4 May 2004 |title= Taiwan Law Orders One-Way Writing |publisher= BBC |accessdate= 2007-09-05 |quote= Official Taiwanese documents can no longer be written from right to left or from top to bottom in a new law passed by the country's parliament }}</ref>  The use of punctuation has also become more common, whether the text is written in columns or rows.  The punctuation marks are clearly influenced by their Western counterparts, although some marks are particular to Asian languages: for example, the double and single quotation marks (\u300e \u300f and \u300c \u300d); the hollow period dot (\u3002), which is otherwise used just like an ordinary period full-stop; and a special kind of comma called an ''[[enumeration comma]]'' (\u3001), which is used to separate items in a list, as opposed to clauses in a sentence.\n\nStreet and shop [[Signage|signs]] are a particularly challenging aspect of written Chinese layout, since they can be written either left-to-right, or right-to-left (the latter can be thought of as the traditional layout with each \"column\" being one character high), as well as from top to bottom.  It is not uncommon to encounter all three orientations on signs on neighboring stores.<ref name=Go1995.P>{{cite book |author= Ping-gam Go |title= Understanding Chinese Characters (Third Edition) |year=1995 |publisher= Simplex Publications |pages= P1\u2013P31}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n\n{{main article|Chinese calligraphy}}\n\n[[Image:Shang_dynasty_inscribed_tortoise_plastron.jpg|thumb|left|An ancient Chinese [[oracle bone]].]]\nChinese is one of the oldest continually used writing systems still in use.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=ix}} The earliest generally accepted examples of Chinese writing date back to the reign of the [[Shang Dynasty]] king [[Wu Ding]] (1250\u20131192 BC).  These were divinatory inscriptions on [[oracle bones]], primarily ox scapulae and turtle shells.  Characters were carved on the bones in order to frame a question; the bones were then heated over a fire and the resulting cracks were interpreted to determine the answer.  Such characters are called \u7532\u9aa8\u6587 ''ji\u01ceg\u01d4w\u00e9n'' \"shell-bone script\" or [[oracle bone script]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nIn 2003, some 11 isolated symbols carved on tortoise shells were found at [[Jiahu]], an archaeological site in the [[Henan]] province of China, some bearing a striking resemblance to certain modern characters, such as \u76ee ''m\u00f9'' \"eye\".  Since the Jiahu site dates from about 6600 BC, it predates the earliest confirmed Chinese writing by more than 5,000&nbsp;years.  Dr Garman Harbottle, of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, US, who headed a team of archaeologists at the [[University of Science and Technology of China]], in Anhui province, has suggested that these symbols were precursors of Chinese writing, but  Professor David Keightley, of the University of California, Berkeley, US whose field of expertise is the origins of Chinese civilization in the Neolithic and early Bronze Ages, employing  archaeological and inscriptional evidence, suggests that the time gap is too great for a connection.<ref name=Rincon2003>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2956925.stm|author=Paul Rincon|year=2003|title=Earliest Writing Found in China|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Western Zhou Ritual Containers3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Left: Bronze \u65b9\u6a3d ''f\u0101ngz\u016bn'' [[Chinese ritual bronzes|ritual wine container]] dated about 1000 BC.

An inscription of some 180 Chinese characters appears twice on the vessel, commenting on state rituals that accompanied a court ceremony.]]\n\nFrom the late Shang Dynasty, Chinese writing evolved into the form found in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|cast inscriptions]] on [[Chinese ritual bronzes]] made during the Western [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c 1066\u2013770 BC) and the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770\u2013476 BC), a kind of writing called \u91d1\u6587 ''j\u012bnw\u00e9n'' \"metal script\".  Jinwen characters are less angular and angularized than the oracle bone script.  Later, in the [[Warring States period]] (475\u2013221 BC), the script became still more regular, and settled on a form, called \u516d\u570b\u6587\u5b57/\u516d\u56fd\u6587\u5b57 ''li\u00f9gu\u00f3 w\u00e9nz\u00ec'' \"script of the six states\", that Xu Shen used as source material in the ''Shuowen Jiezi''.  These characters were later embellished and stylized to yield the [[seal script]], which represents the oldest form of Chinese characters still in modern use.  They are used principally for signature seals, or [[seal (Chinese)|chops]], which are often used in place of a signature for Chinese documents and artwork.  [[Li Si]] promulgated the seal script as the standard throughout the empire during the [[Qin dynasty]], then newly unified.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=63}}\n\nSeal script in turn evolved into the other surviving writing styles; the first writing style to follow was the clerical script.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=64\u201365}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=65\u201370}}  The development of such a style can be attributed to those of the Qin Dynasty who were seeking to create a convenient form of written characters for daily usage. In general, clerical script characters are \"flat\" in appearance, being wider than the seal script, which tends to be taller than it is wide. Compared with the seal script, clerical script characters are strikingly rectilinear.  In [[running script]], a semi-cursive form, the character elements begin to run into each other, although the characters themselves generally remain separate.\nRunning script eventually evolved into [[grass script]], a fully cursive form, in which the characters are often entirely unrecognizable by their canonical forms.  Grass script gives the impression of anarchy in its appearance, and there is indeed considerable freedom on the part of the calligrapher, but this freedom is circumscribed by conventional \"abbreviations\" in the forms of the characters.  [[Regular script]], a non-cursive form, is the most widely recognized script.  In regular script, each stroke of each character is clearly drawn out from the others.  Even though both the running and grass scripts appear to be derived as semi-cursive and cursive variants of regular script, it is in fact the regular script that was the last to develop.\n\n{|\n|[[Image:XiaozhuanQinquan sized.jpg|200x200px]]\n|[[Image:LishuHuashanmiao.jpg|150x200px]]\n|[[Image:XingshuLantingxv.jpg|150x200px]]\n|[[Image:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|150x200px]]\n|[[Image:KaishuOuyangxun.jpg|150x200px]]\n|-\n|<center>Seal</center>\n|<center>Clerical</center>\n|<center>Running (semi-cursive)</center>\n|<center>Grass (fully cursive)</center>\n|<center>Regular (non-cursive)</center>\n|}\n\nRegular script is considered the archetype for Chinese writing and forms the basis for most printed forms.  In addition, regular script imposes a [[Stroke order#General guidelines|stroke order]], which must be followed in order for the characters to be written correctly.{{sfnp|McNaughton|Ying|1999|p=24}}  (Strictly speaking, this stroke order applies to the clerical, running, and grass scripts as well, but especially in the running and grass scripts, this order is occasionally deviated from.)  Thus, for instance, the character \u6728 ''m\u00f9'' \"wood\" must be written starting with the horizontal stroke, drawn from left to right; next, the vertical stroke, from top to bottom; next, the left diagonal stroke, from top to bottom; and lastly the right diagonal stroke, from top to bottom.{{sfnp|McNaughton|Ying|1999|p=43}}\n\n===Simplified and traditional Chinese===\n\n{{main article|Simplified Chinese|Traditional Chinese|Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters}}\nIn the 20th century, written Chinese divided into two canonical forms, called [[simplified Chinese]] and [[traditional Chinese]].  Simplified Chinese was developed in mainland China in order to make the characters faster to write (especially as some characters had as many as a few dozen strokes) and easier to memorize.  The People's Republic of China claims that both goals have been achieved, but some external observers disagree.  Little systematic study has been conducted on how simplified Chinese has affected the way Chinese people become literate; the only studies conducted before it was standardized in mainland China seem to have been statistical ones regarding how many strokes were saved on average in samples of running text.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=151}}\n\nThe simplified forms have also been criticized for being inconsistent.  For instance, traditional \u8b93 ''r\u00e0ng'' \"allow\" is simplified to \u8ba9, in which the phonetic on the right side is reduced from 17 strokes to just three.  (The speech radical on the left has also been simplified.)  However, the same phonetic is used in its full form, even in simplified Chinese, in such characters as \u58e4 ''r\u01ceng'' \"soil\" and \u9f49 ''n\u00e0ng'' \"snuffle\"; these forms remained uncontracted because they were relatively uncommon and would therefore represent a negligible stroke reduction.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=152}}  On the other hand, some simplified forms are simply long-standing calligraphic abbreviations, as for example \u4e07 ''w\u00e0n'' \"[[myriad|ten thousand]]\", for which the traditional Chinese form is \u842c.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=147}}\n\nSimplified Chinese is standard in the mainland of China, [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]].  Traditional Chinese is retained in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]] and [[overseas Chinese]] communities (except [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]).<ref name=Bruggeman2006>{{Cite journal|author=Sebastien Bruggeman|title=Chinese Language Processing and Computing|year=2006}}</ref>  Throughout this article, Chinese text is given in both simplified and traditional forms when they differ, with the traditional forms being given first.\n\n==Function==\n\n[[Image:Tomb Fu Hao YinXu.jpg|Burial pit at Tomb of Lady Fu Hao|thumb|230px|right|[[Tomb of Fu Hao]], c. 1200 BC, containing some 200 bronze vessels with 109 inscriptions in [[oracle bone script]] of [[Fu Hao]]'s name.<ref>Thorp, Robert L. \"The Date of Tomb 5 at Yinxu, Anyang: A Review Article,\" Artibus Asiae (Volume 43, Number 3, 1981): 239\u2013246. esp. pp. 240, 245.</ref>]]\nAt the inception of written Chinese, spoken Chinese was monosyllabic; that is, Chinese words expressing independent concepts (objects, actions, relations, etc.) were usually one syllable.  Each written character corresponded to one monosyllabic word.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=84}}  The spoken language has since become polysyllabic,{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|pp=177\u2013188}} but because modern polysyllabic words are usually composed of older monosyllabic words, Chinese characters have always been used to represent individual Chinese syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=75}}\n\nFor over two thousand years, the prevailing written standard was a vocabulary and syntax rooted in Chinese as spoken around the time of [[Confucius]] (about 500 BC), called [[Classical Chinese]], or \u6587\u8a00\u6587 ''w\u00e9ny\u00e1nw\u00e9n''.  Over the centuries, Classical Chinese gradually acquired some of its grammar and character senses from the various dialects.  This accretion was generally slow and minor; however, by the 20th century, Classical Chinese was distinctly different from any contemporary dialect, and had to be learned separately.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=83}}{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=154}}  Once learned, it was a common medium for communication between people speaking different dialects, many of which were mutually unintelligible by the end of the first millennium AD.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=24\u201325}}  A Mandarin speaker might say ''y\u012b'', a [[Cantonese]] ''y\u0101t'', a [[Shanghainese]] ''iq'', and a [[Hokkien]] ''chit'', but all four will understand the character <{{wiktzh|\u4e00}}> to mean \"one\".{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nChinese languages and dialects vary by not only pronunciation, but also, to a lesser extent, vocabulary and grammar.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=88}}  Modern written Chinese, which replaced Classical Chinese as the written standard as an indirect result of the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, is not technically bound to any single variety; however, it most nearly represents the vocabulary and syntax of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], by far the most widespread Chinese dialectal family in terms of both geographical area and number of speakers.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=87}}  This version of written Chinese is called [[Vernacular Chinese]], or \u767d\u8a71/\u767d\u8bdd ''b\u00e1ihu\u00e0'' (literally, \"plain speech\").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=109}}  Despite its ties to the dominant Mandarin language, Vernacular Chinese also permits some communication between people of different dialects, limited by the fact that Vernacular Chinese expressions are often ungrammatical or unidiomatic in non-Mandarin dialects.  This role may not differ substantially from the role of other [[lingua franca|linguae francae]], such as [[Latin]]: For those trained in written Chinese, it serves as a common medium; for those untrained in it, the graphic nature of the characters is in general no aid to common understanding (characters such as \"one\" notwithstanding).{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=150}}  In this regard, Chinese characters may be considered a large and inefficient phonetic script.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=72}}  However, Ghil'ad Zuckermann\u2019s exploration of [[phono-semantic matching]] in [[Standard Chinese]] concludes that the Chinese writing system is multifunctional, conveying both semantic and phonetic content.<ref>Ghil'ad Zuckermann (2003), [http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?is=140391723X ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew''], Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 255.</ref>\n\nThe variation in vocabulary among dialects has also led to the informal use of \"dialectal characters\", as well as standard characters that are nevertheless considered archaic by today's standards.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=76}}  Cantonese is unique among non-Mandarin regional languages in having a written colloquial standard, used in Hong Kong and overseas, with a large number of unofficial characters for words particular to this language.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=99}}  [[Written Cantonese|Written colloquial Cantonese]] has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging, although for formal written communications Cantonese speakers still normally use Vernacular Chinese.<ref name=Lam2004>{{cite journal|author=Wan Shun Eva Lam|title=Second Language Socialization in a Bilingual Chat Room: Global and Local Considerations|year=2004|journal=Learning, Language, and Technology|volume=8|issue=3}}</ref> To a lesser degree [[Hokkien]] is used in a similar way in Taiwan and elsewhere, although it lacks the level of standardization seen in Cantonese.

At one time, many Chinese characters (called [[hanja]]) were introduced into Korean for their meaning, just as in Japanese.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=153}}  Today, Korean is written almost exclusively using the [[Hangul]] alphabet with a small number of Chinese characters. Each square block character contains Hangul symbols, or letters, that together represent a syllable.{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|p=58}} Similarly, the use of Chinese and Chinese-styled characters in the Vietnamese [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]] script has been almost entirely superseded by the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=79}} Chinese characters are still actively used in South Korea today, mostly for signs, newspapers, books, and government documents.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nChinese characters are also used within China to write non-Han languages. The largest non-Han group in China, the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], have for over 1300 years used Chinese characters. Despite both the introduction of an official alphabetic script in 1957 and lack of a corresponding official set of Chinese characters, more Zhuang people can read the [[sawndip|Zhuang logograms]] than the alphabetic script.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n==Media==\nOver the history of written Chinese, a variety of media have been used for writing. They include:\n* [[Bamboo and wooden slips]], from at least the thirteenth century BC\n* [[History of paper|Paper]], invented no later than the second century BC\n* [[Silk]], since at least the Han dynasty\n* Stone, metal, wood, bamboo, plastic and ivory on [[Seal (East Asia)|seals]].\n\nSince at least the Han dynasty, such media have been used to create [[hanging scroll]]s and [[handscroll]]s.\n\n==Literacy==\n\nBecause the majority of modern Chinese words contain more than one character, there are at least two measuring sticks for Chinese literacy: the number of characters known, and the number of words known.  [[John DeFrancis]], in the introduction to his ''Advanced Chinese Reader'', estimates that a typical Chinese college graduate recognizes 4,000 to 5,000 characters, and 40,000 to 60,000 words.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1968}}  [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]], in ''Chinese'', places the number of characters somewhat lower, at 3,000 to 4,000.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=73}} These counts are complicated by the tangled development of Chinese characters.  In many cases, a single character came to be written in [[Variant Chinese character|multiple ways]]. This development was restrained to an extent by the standardization of the seal script during the Qin dynasty, but soon started again. Although the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' lists 10,516 characters\u20149,353 of them unique (some of which may already have been out of use by the time it was compiled) plus 1,163 graphic variants\u2014the ''[[Jiyun]]'' of the Northern [[Song Dynasty]], compiled less than a thousand years later in 1039, contains 53,525 characters, most of them graphic variants.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=72}}\n\n===Dictionaries===\n\n{{main article|Chinese dictionary}}\n\nWritten Chinese is not based on an alphabet or syllabary, so Chinese dictionaries, as well as dictionaries that define Chinese characters in other languages, cannot easily be alphabetized or otherwise lexically ordered, as English dictionaries are.  The need to arrange Chinese characters in order to permit efficient lookup has given rise to a considerable variety of ways to organize and index the characters.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=92}}\n\nA traditional mechanism is the method of radicals, which uses a set of character roots.  These roots, or radicals, generally but imperfectly align with the parts used to compose characters by means of logical aggregation and phonetic complex.  A [[canonical form|canonical]] set of 214 radicals was developed during the rule of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (around the year 1700); these are sometimes called the Kangxi radicals.  The radicals are ordered first by stroke count (that is, the number of strokes required to write the radical); within a given stroke count, the radicals also have a prescribed order.{{sfnp|Wieger|1915|p=19}}\n\nEvery Chinese character falls (sometimes arbitrarily or incorrectly) under the heading of exactly one of these 214 radicals.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=92}}  In many cases, the radicals are themselves characters, which naturally come first under their own heading.  All other characters under a given radical are ordered by the stroke count of the character.   Usually, however, there are still many characters with a given stroke count under a given radical.  At this point, characters are not given in any recognizable order; the user must locate the character by going through all the characters with that stroke count, typically listed for convenience at the top of the page on which they occur.{{sfnp|Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|1994|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nBecause the method of radicals is applied only to the written character, one need not know how to pronounce a character before looking it up; the entry, once located, usually gives the pronunciation.  However, it is not always easy to identify which of the various roots of a character is the proper radical.  Accordingly, dictionaries often include a list of hard to locate characters, indexed by total stroke count, near the beginning of the dictionary.  Some dictionaries include almost one-seventh of all characters in this list.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=92}}\n\nOther methods of organization exist, often in an attempt to address the shortcomings of the radical method, but are less common.  For instance, it is common for a dictionary ordered principally by the Kangxi radicals to have an auxiliary index by pronunciation, expressed typically in either [[hanyu pinyin]] or [[zhuyin fuhao]].{{sfnp|McNaughton|Ying|1999|p=20}}  This index points to the page in the main dictionary where the desired character can be found.  Other methods use only the structure of the characters, such as the [[four-corner method]], in which characters are indexed according to the kinds of strokes located nearest the four corners (hence the name of the method),<ref name=WangWang1994>{{cite journal|author=Gwo-En Wang, Jhing-Fa Wang|title=A New Hierarchical Approach for Recognition of Unconstrained Handwritten Numerals|journal=IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics|volume=40|issue=3|year=1994|pages=428\u2013436|doi=10.1109/30.320824}}</ref> or the [[Cangjie method]], in which characters are broken down into a set of 24 basic components.<ref name=Su2005>{{Cite thesis|author=Hsi-Yao Su|title=Language Styling and Switching in Speech and Online Contexts: Identity and Language Ideologies in Taiwan|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|degree=Ph.D.|year=2005|url=http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/1800}}</ref>  Neither the four-corner method nor the Cangjie method requires the user to identify the proper radical, although many strokes or components have alternate forms, which must be memorized in order to use these methods effectively.\n\nThe availability of computerized Chinese dictionaries now makes it possible to look characters up by any of the indexing schemes described, thereby shortening the search process.\n\n===Transliteration and romanization===\n\n{{main article|Chinese romanization|Xiao'erjing|Pinyin|Zhuyin|Wade-Giles|Gwoyeu Romatzyh}}\n\nChinese characters do not reliably indicate their pronunciation, even for one dialect.  It is therefore useful to be able to transliterate a dialect of Chinese into the Latin alphabet or the Perso-Arabic script [[Xiao'erjing]] for those who cannot read Chinese characters.  However, transliteration was not always considered merely a way to record the sounds of any particular dialect of Chinese; it was once also considered a potential replacement for the Chinese characters.  This was first prominently proposed during the May Fourth Movement, and it gained further support with the victory of the Communists in 1949.  Immediately afterward, the mainland government began two parallel programs relating to written Chinese.  One was the development of an alphabetic script for Mandarin, which was spoken by about two-thirds of the Chinese population;{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=88}} the other was the simplification of the traditional characters\u2014a process that would eventually lead to simplified Chinese.  The latter was not viewed as an impediment to the former; rather, it would ease the transition toward the exclusive use of an alphabetic (or at least phonetic) script.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=143}}\n\nBy 1958, however, priority was given officially to [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]; a phonetic script, hanyu pinyin, had been developed, but its deployment to the exclusion of simplified characters was pushed off to some distant future date.  The association between pinyin and Mandarin, as opposed to other dialects, may have contributed to this deferment.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=144\u2013145}}  It seems unlikely that pinyin will supplant Chinese characters anytime soon as the ''sole'' means of representing Chinese.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nPinyin uses the Latin alphabet, along with a few [[diacritical marks]], to represent the sounds of Mandarin in standard pronunciation.  For the most part, pinyin uses vowel and consonant letters as they are used in Romance languages (and also in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]).  However, although 'b' and 'p', for instance, represent the voice/unvoiced distinction in some languages, such as [[French language|French]], they represent the [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated/aspirated]] distinction in Mandarin; Mandarin has few voiced consonants.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=88}}  Also, the pinyin spellings for a few consonant sounds are markedly different from their spellings in other languages that use the Latin alphabet; for instance, pinyin 'q' and 'x' sound similar to English 'ch' and 'sh', respectively.  Pinyin is not the sole transliteration scheme for Mandarin\u2014there are also, for instance, the [[zhuyin fuhao]], [[Wade-Giles]], and [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] systems\u2014but it is dominant in the Chinese-speaking world.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=265}}  All transliterations in this article use the pinyin system.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mainland Chinese Braille]]\n*[[Taiwanese braille]] (Taiwanese Mandarin)\n*[[Cantonese braille]]\n*[[Chinese input methods for computers]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*{{cite book|first=J|last=Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n|title=Learn to Write Chinese Characters|year=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-05771-7|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/learntowritechin00bjor}}\n*{{cite book|first=John |last=DeFrancis|authorlink=John DeFrancis|title=Advanced Chinese Reader|year=1968|publisher=The Murray Printing Co|isbn=0-300-01083-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|first=John |last=DeFrancis|title=The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy|year=1984|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-0866-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma |first=Wm.

He possesses no magical power, but he overcame his weakness by increasing his physical strength, which allowed him to join the Magic Knight Squad known as the Black Bulls after acquiring a five-leaf clover grimoire. The grimoire allows him to use Anti-Magic effectively due to his lack of mana, later honing his senses to predict an opponent's attack by sensing their [[qi]]. Asta originally used the magic-nullifying Demon Slayer Sword and the magic-siphoning Demon Dweller Sword he acquired at a dungeon, later acquiring the Demon Destroyer Sword that allows him to exorcise elf-spirits should he inflict enough damage to their host bodies using it.\n\nAsta later learns his weapons and grimoire once belonged to Elf Race's leader Licht, the book itself revealed to have demonic origins as its creation was engineered by one demon with another sealed within it. After the Witch Queen used her magic to increase the Anti-Magic flow in Asta's body, he gained the ability to transform into Black Asta by tapping into the power of the demon within his grimoire. However, Asta later learns his power subjects him to a curse mark known as {{Nihongo|Weg|\u8f4d\uff08\u30f4\u30a3\u30fc\u30b0\uff09|V\u012bgu}} that makes him a target for the Magic Parliament who see him as a monster that needs to be destroyed.\n\n===Yuno===\n:{{voiced by|[[S\u014dma Sait\u014d]]<ref name=\"Anime News Network\">{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-10-20/shun-horie-soma-saito-star-in-black-clover-event-anime/.107890|title=Shun Horie, S\u014dma Sait\u014d Star in Black Clover Event Anime|work=Anime News Network|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref> (OVA), [[Nobunaga Shimazaki]]<ref name=\"Main-Cast\"/> (Anime)|[[Micah Solusod]]<ref name=\"English-Dub\"/>}}\n{{Nihongo|Yuno|\u30e6\u30ce|Yuno}} is an orphan who was left under the care of a church during his infancy, acquiring a four-leaf clover grimoire and a member of the Golden Dawn.

Sylph (nicknamed \"Bell\") often tries to play around with Yuno, but due to his serious demeanor, he is often found complaining. His serious attitude came about when Asta was injured defending him from bullies as a child. Yuno could only admire how Asta saved him, despite not having magic, and it made him feel ashamed. To make up for this, he trained himself to become Asta's equal in a moral sense. His \"cool\" demeanor is only broken when he is enjoying himself, usually when fighting someone strong or watching Asta prove his strength. He has proven himself to be a rising star among the ranks of Golden Dawn, capable of beating even the strongest mages with little to no effort.

While incredibly powerful as a royal, possessing a vast amount of mana, Noelle initially had trouble controlling her Water Magic with her older brother Nozel acting resentful to her as his way of protecting her from both harm and the truth behind the death of their mother Acier. While Noelle used a wand as a means to cope with this magic, she learns that she has been unconsciously holding herself back out of fear of hurting anyone. Eventually, her training and the positive feedback from her new friends in the Black Bulls allow her to overcome that flaw, displaying her full potential when fighting the elf Kivn and gains the ability to create water-based armor that increases her offense and defense. Noelle, wanting to help Asta, would later learn the truth of her mother's death being caused by a demon named Megicula.

Lumiere arrives in time as Licht tells him to kill the elf after cursing his body so the demon cannot use it. Lumiere is named the 1st Wizard King soon after. Lumiere later has Secre petrify him, so he can be revived by her should the demon resurface.

Julius was previously the Magic Knight Captain of the Aqua Deer Squad when they were previously the Grey Deer Squad; Yami and Vangeance both being members whom Julius personally recruited into the Magic Knights. Although he is killed by Patolli to acquire the Magic Stones that he had Yami and the Black Bulls secure, he eventually revived himself through an ancient magic tool that he previously stored 13 years' worth of time in.

He is extremely envious that the people fail to acknowledge him when compared to the Wizard King. Augustus's need to be recognized motivated his decision to take credit for the Royal Knights which Julius actually devised. While extremely powerful as a member of royalty through his use of light magic, Augustus's overconfidence that his position alone made him superior to potential opponents convinced him to not hone his skills. Thus a majority of his spells are mostly showy displays of power meant to impress others, though they usually have the opposite effect and are easily dispatched.\n\n====Damnatio Kira====\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Tsuchida]]}}\n{{Nihongo|Damnatio Kira|\u30c0\u30e0\u30ca\u30c6\u30a3\u30aa\u30fb\u30ad\u30fc\u30e9|}} is a member of House Kira who is chairman of the Clover Kingdom's Magic Parliament, a manipulative and ruthless man who places justice above even his own family. He is also a user of Scale Magic, making him able to counter all forms of magic save Anti-Magic. Following the elf incident, after dispatching anti-monarchist nobles who attempted to kill Augustus in the confusion, Damnatio oversees Asta's trial for using forbidden magic before the Black Bulls intervene with Julius passing a decree for a Black Bull mission outside the Clover Kingdom to hinder Damantio's inquisition. Damnatio allows this, but vows to place every Magic Knight through an inquisition should Asta's mission fails and threatens the Clover Kingdom in any way.\n\n===Owen===\n:{{voiced by|Eiichiro Tokumoto|[[Kent Williams (voice actor)|Kent Williams]]}}\n{{Nihongo|Owen|\u30aa\u30fc\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3|\u014cven}} is a Magic Knight and Julius's right hand who is the best healer in the Clover Kingdom, possessing Water Healing magic that allows him to reattach severed arms or emulate X-rays.

Yami originated from another country known as \"Land of the Rising Sun\" before ending up in the Clover Kingdom, joining the Magic Knights after meeting Julius Novachrono despite being looked down as a foreigner by his peers. Yami uses Darkness magic, using it to enchant his [[katana]] since his type of magic is regarded as Light Magic's polar opposite due to its slowness.

This motivated him to fight stronger opponents to test his strength, joining the Magic Knights while gaining infamy from his conduct of nearly killing an opponent in the entrance exams. Later during the raid of the Midnight Sun's base, Luck ends up being possessed by the elf spirit {{Nihongo|Rufel|\u30eb\u30d5\u30eb|Rufuru}} as a result of Patolli's ritual.

Gauche was later recruited by Yami while attempting to escape prison and reach the orphanage. Though Gauche initially doesn't get along with the squad, even making attempts on Asta's life when Marie developed a crush on the youth, Gauche eventually starts to bring down his walls. Following the Midnight Sun's attack on the Black Bulls' base, Patolli cryptically hinting it when they first met, Gauche ends up being possessed by the Elf {{Nihongo|Droit|\u30c9\u30ed\u30ef|Dorowa}} of the Apostles of the Sephirah before Asta exorcises the elf spirit while Droit accepted the Black Bulls to be nothing like the barbarous humans who killed him and Ecra long ago.

Originally based in the Clover Kingdom's Forsaken Region five centuries ago, the Elves were victims of a plot conducted by the demon Zagred who manipulated the ancient Clover Kingdom's envious royals into slaughtering them for their mana so he could possess their elder Licht. Though Licht and Lumiere thwarted the demon's attempt, Zagred manipulated the elves' souls to reincarnate five centuries later in human vessels. Only Patolli, one of ten powerful Elf mages known as the Apostles of the Sephirah, is fully reincarnated as he assumed Licht brought him back and established the Midnight Sun to gather the elvish magic stones to place within a [[sephiroth|sephirah]] stone stab to invoke a ritual he assumed would resurrect his people by transforming their reincarnated bodies into their {{Nihongo|\"True Forms\"|\u771f\u306e\u59ff|Shin no Sugata}} so that they can exact their revenge on the Clover Kingdom.\n\nThe human members who form the majority of the Midnight Sun are deceived by Patolli into joining the organization under the assumption that they are also reincarnated elves to given {{Nihongo|True Names|\u771f\u306e\u540d|Makoto no Na}}, unaware that that it branded them as sacrificial offerings to activate the ritual, killing them all with Rades reviving himself, Sally, and Valtos moments later.

As Patolli cannot use Vangeance's grimoire, he acquired a four-leaf clover grimoire to channel his Light Magic for both offense and healing. While Patolli hates humans, including his fanatic human subordinates whom he only protects serve in his plans, he expresses a stronger loathing towards Asta for possessing Licht's grimoire and weapons. Patolli eventually reveals his true identity upon taking full control of Vangeance's body as he kills Novachrono for the last of the magic stones needed to activate the sephiroth, sacrificing his human allies to fully revive his fellow apostles and their kin. Patolli finds the only opposition to his revenge are Asta and an elven Yuno as he leads his forces into the Clover Kingdom to acquire the last stone to cement the elves into their reincarnated vessels while the spell kills off all remaining humans within the Clover Kingdom. He soon learns of Zagred with the revelation over being manipulated by the one who caused his peoples' genocide turning him into a Dark Elf while the demon takes his Five-Leaf Clover Grimoire.

Asta originally used the magic-nullifying Demon Slayer Sword and the magic-siphoning Demon Dweller Sword he acquired at a dungeon, later acquiring the Demon Destroyer Sword that allows him to exorcise elf-spirits should he inflict enough damage to their host bodies using it.\n\nAsta later learns his weapons and grimoire once belonged to Elf Race's leader Licht, the book itself revealed to have demonic origins as its creation was engineered by one demon with another sealed within it. After the Witch Queen used her magic to increase the Anti-Magic flow in Asta's body, he gained the ability to transform into Black Asta by tapping into the power of the demon within his grimoire. However, Asta later learns his power subjects him to a curse mark known as {{Nihongo|Weg|\u8f4d\uff08\u30f4\u30a3\u30fc\u30b0\uff09|V\u012bgu}} that makes him a target for the Magic Parliament who see him as a monster that needs to be destroyed.\n\n===Yuno===\n:{{voiced by|[[S\u014dma Sait\u014d]]<ref name=\"Anime News Network\">{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-10-20/shun-horie-soma-saito-star-in-black-clover-event-anime/.107890|title=Shun Horie, S\u014dma Sait\u014d Star in Black Clover Event Anime|work=Anime News Network|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref> (OVA), [[Nobunaga Shimazaki]]<ref name=\"Main-Cast\"/> (Anime)|[[Micah Solusod]]<ref name=\"English-Dub\"/>}}\n{{Nihongo|Yuno|\u30e6\u30ce|Yuno}} is an orphan who was left under the care of a church during his infancy, acquiring a four-leaf clover grimoire and a member of the Golden Dawn. He uses Wind Magic and is the chosen partner of Sylph the Wind Spirit of the 4 great attributes. Sylph (nicknamed \"Bell\") often tries to play around with Yuno, but due to his serious demeanor, he is often found complaining. His serious attitude came about when Asta was injured defending him from bullies as a child. Yuno could only admire how Asta saved him, despite not having magic, and it made him feel ashamed. To make up for this, he trained himself to become Asta's equal in a moral sense. His \"cool\" demeanor is only broken when he is enjoying himself, usually when fighting someone strong or watching Asta prove his strength. He has proven himself to be a rising star among the ranks of Golden Dawn, capable of beating even the strongest mages with little to no effort. When he is physically changed into an Elf by Patolli's ritual (the soul is hinted to be that of Licht's unborn son) Yuno's magical might and willpower allowed him to retain his mind as he faced Patolli and the Demon manipulating him.\n\n===Noelle Silva===\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Y\u016bki]]<ref name=\"Black-Bulls\">{{cite web|title=\"Black Clover\" TV Anime Black Bull Squad Cast Additions And Designs Spotted|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/08/03/black-clover-tv-anime-black-bull-squad-cast-additions-and-designs-spotted|website=Crunchyroll|accessdate=August 3, 2017|date=August 3, 2017}}</ref>|Jill Harris<ref name=\"English-Dub\"/>}}\n{{Nihongo|Noelle Silva|\u30ce\u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30b7\u30eb\u30f4\u30a1|Noeru Shiruva}} is a white-haired member of the Black Bulls and the fourth-born child of the Clover Kingdom's royal family, House Silva. While incredibly powerful as a royal, possessing a vast amount of mana, Noelle initially had trouble controlling her Water Magic with her older brother Nozel acting resentful to her as his way of protecting her from both harm and the truth behind the death of their mother Acier. While Noelle used a wand as a means to cope with this magic, she learns that she has been unconsciously holding herself back out of fear of hurting anyone. Eventually, her training and the positive feedback from her new friends in the Black Bulls allow her to overcome that flaw, displaying her full potential when fighting the elf Kivn and gains the ability to create water-based armor that increases her offense and defense. Noelle, wanting to help Asta, would later learn the truth of her mother's death being caused by a demon named Megicula.

Lumiere arrives in time as Licht tells him to kill the elf after cursing his body so the demon cannot use it. Lumiere is named the 1st Wizard King soon after. Lumiere later has Secre petrify him, so he can be revived by her should the demon resurface. Once the demon is defeated and the elf souls allowed to rest in peace, Lumiere joins them in the afterlife as the magic that kept him alive is wearing off while content that his ideals live on in the new generation.\n\n====Julius Novachrono====\n:{{voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]<ref name=\"More-Cast\">{{cite web|title=Additional \"Black Clover\" Anime Cast Spotted|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/08/16-1/additional-black-clover-anime-cast-spotted|website=Crunchyroll|accessdate=August 16, 2017|date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>|[[Robert McCollum]]<ref name=\"English-Dub\"/>}}\n{{Nihongo|Julius Novachrono|\u30e6\u30ea\u30a6\u30b9\u30fb\u30ce\u30f4\u30a1\u30af\u30ed\u30ce|Yuriusu Novakurono}} is the 28th Wizard King and user of Time Magic, his obsession with new and strange forms of magic having him shirk from his duties on his free time. Julius was previously the Magic Knight Captain of the Aqua Deer Squad when they were previously the Grey Deer Squad; Yami and Vangeance both being members whom Julius personally recruited into the Magic Knights. Although he is killed by Patolli to acquire the Magic Stones that he had Yami and the Black Bulls secure, he eventually revived himself through an ancient magic tool that he previously stored 13 years' worth of time in. But the process revived Julius as a 13-year-old boy with his powers reduced, rendering him unable to carry out his duties as Wizard King.\n\n===House Kira===\nOne of the three royal houses alongside Houses Vermilion and Silva, {{Nihongo4|House Kira|\u30ad\u30fc\u30e9\u5bb6|Kira-ke}}'s lineage dates back to the foundation of the Clover Kingdom and genocide of the Elves.\n\n====Augustus Kira Clover XIII====\n:{{Voiced by|Jun Miyamoto|[[Sonny Strait]]<ref name=\"English-Dub 3\"/>}}\n{{Nihongo|Augustus Kira Clover XIII|\u30a2\u30a6\u30b0\u30b9\u30c8\u30a5\u30b9\u30fb\u30ad\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc13\u4e16|Augusutusu K\u012bra Kur\u014db\u0101 13-sei}}, the current King Clover and member of House Kira, is an arrogant and petty person who thinks that being noble is everything and has nothing but contempt for commoners. He is extremely envious that the people fail to acknowledge him when compared to the Wizard King. Augustus's need to be recognized motivated his decision to take credit for the Royal Knights which Julius actually devised. While extremely powerful as a member of royalty through his use of light magic, Augustus's overconfidence that his position alone made him superior to potential opponents convinced him to not hone his skills. Thus a majority of his spells are mostly showy displays of power meant to impress others, though they usually have the opposite effect and are easily dispatched.\n\n====Damnatio Kira====\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Tsuchida]]}}\n{{Nihongo|Damnatio Kira|\u30c0\u30e0\u30ca\u30c6\u30a3\u30aa\u30fb\u30ad\u30fc\u30e9|}} is a member of House Kira who is chairman of the Clover Kingdom's Magic Parliament, a manipulative and ruthless man who places justice above even his own family. He is also a user of Scale Magic, making him able to counter all forms of magic save Anti-Magic. Following the elf incident, after dispatching anti-monarchist nobles who attempted to kill Augustus in the confusion, Damnatio oversees Asta's trial for using forbidden magic before the Black Bulls intervene with Julius passing a decree for a Black Bull mission outside the Clover Kingdom to hinder Damantio's inquisition. Damnatio allows this, but vows to place every Magic Knight through an inquisition should Asta's mission fails and threatens the Clover Kingdom in any way.\n\n===Owen===\n:{{voiced by|Eiichiro Tokumoto|[[Kent Williams (voice actor)|Kent Williams]]}}\n{{Nihongo|Owen|\u30aa\u30fc\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3|\u014cven}} is a Magic Knight and Julius's right hand who is the best healer in the Clover Kingdom, possessing Water Healing magic that allows him to reattach severed arms or emulate X-rays. After the fight in the Underwater Sea Temple, he tells Asta that he won't be able to use his arms, infected by the Ancient Curse magic, as his bones are turning to dust. After Patolli completes Licht's ritual, Owen ends up being possessed by an Elf spirit with his magic inverted to destroy rather than heal.\n\n===Black Bull Squad===\n====Yami Sukehiro====\n:{{voiced by|[[Junichi Suwabe]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Junichi Suwabe Set To Join \"Black Clover\" TV Anime|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/07/19/junichi-suwabe-set-to-join-black-clover-tv-anime|website=Crunchyroll|accessdate=July 19, 2017|date=July 19, 2017}}</ref>|[[Christopher Sabat|Christopher R.

Yami originated from another country known as \"Land of the Rising Sun\" before ending up in the Clover Kingdom, joining the Magic Knights after meeting Julius Novachrono despite being looked down as a foreigner by his peers. Yami uses Darkness magic, using it to enchant his [[katana]] since his type of magic is regarded as Light Magic's polar opposite due to its slowness. He also possesses a sixth sense which allows him to sense his opponent's [[ki]] to predict their attack and counter, enabling him to learn of the connection between Patolli and Vangeance.\n\n====Finral Roulacase====\n:{{voiced by|[[Jun Fukuyama]]<ref name=\"Black-Bulls\"/>|Brandon McInnis<ref name=\"English-Dub\"/>}}\n{{Nihongo|Finral Roulacase|\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30eb\u30fc\u30e9\u30b1\u30a4\u30b9|Finraru R\u016brakeisu}} is a member of the Black Bulls.

Magna is a good-natured yet hot-headed delinquent who uses Fire Magic and rides his personalized broom Crazy Cyclone. Magna was originally a commoner from Rayaka Village near the Clover Kingdom border, abusing his power in antagonizing the nearby village of Sosshi before ending up becoming a disciple of its elder who influenced his choice to join the Magic Knights. He mainly acts as a senior to Asta and Noelle, accompanying them on some of their missions.\n\n====Luck Voltia====\n:{{voiced by|[[Ayumu Murase]]<ref name=\"Black-Bulls\"/>|[[Justin Briner]]<ref name=\"English-Dub\"/>}}\n{{Nihongo|Luck Voltia|\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30dc\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2|Rakku Borutia}} is a member of the Black Bulls, a borderline psychopath who uses Lightning Magic and is always smiling regardless of circumstances, giving him the nickname \"Luck the Cheery Berserker.\" Born a commoner within Yvon Village and raised by a troubled woman before she died of stress, Luck was instilled with the notion that winning a fight is the same as being loved. This motivated him to fight stronger opponents to test his strength, joining the Magic Knights while gaining infamy from his conduct of nearly killing an opponent in the entrance exams. Later during the raid of the Midnight Sun's base, Luck ends up being possessed by the elf spirit {{Nihongo|Rufel|\u30eb\u30d5\u30eb|Rufuru}} as a result of Patolli's ritual. Luck is released from the spell after Rufel is defeated by Magna and Vanessa with Asta exorcizing the elf spirit while giving him closure.\n\n====Gauche Adlai====\n:{{voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]]<ref name=\"Black-Bulls\"/>|Dave Trosko<ref name=\"English-Dub\"/>}}\n{{Nihongo|Gauche Adlai|\u30b4\u30fc\u30b7\u30e5\u30fb\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30a4|G\u014dshu Adorei}} is a member of the Black Bulls who uses Mirror Magic, augmented by the small mirror in place of his left eye, that allows him to create mirror clones of himself or another. Gauche was originally a noble years prior when his parents died in an \"accident\" and then both he and his little sister Marie were robbed of their inheritance by another noble who cast them into the street. Gauche's devotion to Marie, which bordered on an unhealthy obsession that gave him a sister complex, motivated him to provide for her through criminal acts until he was arrested and Marie placed in an orphanage. Gauche was later recruited by Yami while attempting to escape prison and reach the orphanage. Though Gauche initially doesn't get along with the squad, even making attempts on Asta's life when Marie developed a crush on the youth, Gauche eventually starts to bring down his walls. Following the Midnight Sun's attack on the Black Bulls' base, Patolli cryptically hinting it when they first met, Gauche ends up being possessed by the Elf {{Nihongo|Droit|\u30c9\u30ed\u30ef|Dorowa}} of the Apostles of the Sephirah before Asta exorcises the elf spirit while Droit accepted the Black Bulls to be nothing like the barbarous humans who killed him and Ecra long ago.

While she uses Cotton Magic to usually create sheep that cook her meals, Charmy's magic has been seen to be extremely powerful as it has helped the squad out of more than one difficult situation. During the battle against Lira, Charmy learns she is of [[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]] descent as she found herself able to assume a more adult-like appearance with her sheep turned into wolves to use with her mana-absorbing Food Magic.

During Vanessa's childhood, she is inadvertently estranged from her mother, the Queen of the Witches, when she tries awakening her ability to alter a person's destiny while in captivity. After being freed by Yami, she joins the Black Bulls to forge her own path. Her String Magic grants her the ability to create threads too thin to be detectable to even magic. Eventually, when the Queen forces Asta to kill Noelle, Vanessa awakens her fate-altering ability, the Red Thread of Fate, in the form of a cat [[familiar]] which she names Rouge; it is powerful enough to negate the power of anything Vanessa does not desire like death.\n\n====Grey====\n:{{voiced by|[[Minami Takahashi (voice actress)|Minami Takahashi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-08-06/black-clover-anime-casts-minami-takahashi-as-grey/.135127|title=Black Clover Anime Casts Minami Takahashi as Grey|website=Anime News Network|date=August 6, 2018|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> Masayuki Akasaka (Transformed)|Megan Shipman,<ref name=\"English-Dub 2\" /> Jarrod Greene (Transformed)<ref name=\"English-Dub\" />}}\n{{Nihongo|Grey|\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4|Gurei}} is a member of the Black Bulls.

When he was a child, his father looked up to Magic Knights and tried to pass the Knights' exam several times to join the Magic knights, but when he finally joined, he was betrayed by his own teammates in a battle and killed by them, for joining the Magic Knights despite being a commoner. This enrages Zora, and he stops believing in the integrity of the Magic Knights after seeing multiple instances of them bullying commoners. Even after joining the Magic Knights himself, he never puts on his robe, not believing in his teammates. His magic is Ash Magic, which he can use in various forms, including setting traps, using it for reflecting an oncoming magic etc. His specialty is setting traps.

Being bedridden due to an strange illness from birth, being born into a noble family, Henry prolongs his life with a Magic Absorbing Constitution by passively siphoning mana from others. This forced his family to live in seclusion in the Common Region within the estate that would become the Black Bulls' base, the building itself stabilizing Henry's Mana siphoning. When Henry's parents eventually left and never returned, Henry assumed that he would die soon until he was later found by Yami, and offered him ownership of upon his death. But Yami refuses and instead tells Henry to survive as the base will soon be filled with lots of healthy and active people for him to siphon mana from.

As Patolli cannot use Vangeance's grimoire, he acquired a four-leaf clover grimoire to channel his Light Magic for both offense and healing. While Patolli hates humans, including his fanatic human subordinates whom he only protects serve in his plans, he expresses a stronger loathing towards Asta for possessing Licht's grimoire and weapons. Patolli eventually reveals his true identity upon taking full control of Vangeance's body as he kills Novachrono for the last of the magic stones needed to activate the sephiroth, sacrificing his human allies to fully revive his fellow apostles and their kin.

Soil Ecol. doi:10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.07.009</ref> for solving a question that has crucial importance for all humans in the 21st century: \"As planet Earth citizens, will you stop the climate from warming?\" The author proposes to use a cell-phone for answering this question during the Olympic Games in [[Pyeongchang 2018]] and [[Tokyo 2020]].\n\n===Expanding democracy===\nThe Internet has several attributes that encourage thinking about it as a democratic medium. The lack of [[Command and control (management)|centralized control]] makes [[censorship]] difficult. There are other parallels in the social design in the early days of the internet, such as the strongly [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] support for [[free speech]], the [[sharing culture]] that permeated nearly all aspects of Internet use, and the outright prohibition on commercial use by the [[National Science Foundation]]. Another example is the unmediated mass communication on the internet, such as through [[newsgroup]]s, chat rooms, and [[MUD]]s. This communication ignored the boundaries established with [[broadcast media]], such as [[newspaper]]s or [[radio]], and with one-to-one media, such as letters or [[landline telephone]]s. Finally, because the Internet is a massive digital network with open standards, universal and inexpensive access to a wide variety of communication media and models could actually be attained.<ref>Novak, T., & Hoffman, D. (1998). ''Bridging the Digital Divide: The Impact of Race on Computer Access and Internet Use.'' Nashville: Vanderbilt University.</ref>\n\nSome practical issues involving e-democracy include: effective participation; voting equality at decision stage; enlightened understanding; control of the agenda; and inclusiveness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Democracy and Its Critics|publisher=Yale University Press|author=Robert Dahl|date=1989|isbn=9780300049381|title-link=Democracy and Its Critics}}</ref> Systemic issues may include cyber-security concerns and protection of sensitive data from third parties.\n\n===Improving Democracy===\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=August 2017}}\nStrictly speaking, modern democracies are generally representative democracies, where citizens elect representatives to manage the creation and implementation of laws, policies, and regulations on their behalf, in contrast to direct democracies in which citizens retain that responsibility. They may be referred to as more or less \"democratic\" depending on how well the government represents the will or interest of the people. A shift to E-democracy would in effect devolve political power from elected representatives to the individual.  \n\nIn America, politics have become reliant on the Internet because the Internet is the primary source of information for most Americans. The Internet educates people on democracy, helping people stay up to date with what is happening in their government. Online advertising is becoming more popular for political candidates and group's opinions on propositions.<ref name=diffusion>{{cite journal|title=Testing the Development and Diffusion of E-Government and E-Democracy: A Global Perspective|journal=Public Administration Review|author1=Chung-pin Lee |author2=Kaiju Chang |author3=Frances Stokes Berry |date=9 May 2011|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02228.x |volume=71 |issue = 3|pages=444\u2013454}}</ref> For many the Internet is often the primary resource for information. The reason for this, and especially among younger voters, is that it is easy and reliable when used correctly, thus lowering an individual's workload. The innate usability of search engines, such as [[Google]], results in increased citizen engagement with research and political issues. Social networks allow people to express their opinions about the government through an alias, anonymously and judgment-free.<ref>Oral, Beh\u00e7et(2008). \"Computers & Education: The evaluation of the student teachers' attitudes toward the Internet and democracy.\" Dicle University, Volume 50, Issue 1: 437-445.</ref> Due to the Internets' size and decentralized structure, any individual has the potential to go viral and gain influence over a large number of others. \n\nThe Internet enables citizens to get and post information about politicians, and it allows those politicians to get advice from the people in larger numbers. This collective decision making and problem-solving gives more power to the citizens and helps politicians make decisions faster. This creates a more productive society that can handle problems faster and more efficiently. Getting feedback and advice from the American population is a large part of a politician's job and the Internet allows them to function effectively with larger numbers of people's opinions. With this heightened ability to communicate with the public, the American government is able to function more capably and effectively as a Democracy.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Citizenship And Governance In A Wild, Wired World: How Should Citizens And Public Managers Use Online Tools To Improve Democracy?|journal=National Civic Review|author=Matt Leighninger|date=2 May 2012|doi=10.1002/ncr.20056|volume=100|issue = 2|pages=20\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe American election of 2016 is an example, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made good use of Twitter, attempting to shape perceptions on their behalf, whilst using social media to transmit the idea that authorities are also \u2018normal\u2019, and they can communicate through a Twitter account just like everyone does.

Social media has become an empowerment tool, especially for the youth, who are encouraged to participate in elections. \u00a0Social media has also allowed the politicians to interact with civilians. A clear example was the 2016 American elections and how Donald Trump tweeted most of his announcements and goals. Not only Trump, but other presidents have Twitter accounts such as Justin Trudeau, Jair Bolsonaro, and Hassan Rouhani.

These networked societies are constructed post -\"triple revolution\" of technology, which involves a three-step process.

This event was ultimately suppressed, however; the Facebook group remained, spurring the growth of other activist parties to take an online media route. The Internet in Egypt was used also to form connections with networks of people outside of their own country. The connections provided through Internet media sources, such as Twitter allowed rapid spread of the revolt to be known around the world.

This is especially important when considering electronic voting. An electoral voting system is more complex than other electronic transaction systems and the authentication mechanisms employed must be able to prevent ballot rigging or the threat of rigging. This may include the use of smart cards that allow a voter's identity to be verified whilst at the same time ensuring the privacy of the vote cast. [[Electronic voting in Estonia]] is one example of a method to conquer the privacy-identity problem inherent in internet voting systems. However, the objective should be to provide equivalence with the security and privacy of current manual systems.\n\n===Government responsiveness===\nIn order to attract people to get involved in online consultations and discussions, the government must respond to people and actively demonstrate that there is a relationship between the citizen's engagement and policy outcome. It is also important that people are able to become involved in the process, at a time and place that is convenient to them but when their opinions will count. The government will need to ensure that the structures are in place to deal with increased participation.\n\nIn order to ensure that issues are debated in a democratic, inclusive, tolerant and productive way, the role that intermediaries and\nrepresentative organizations may play should be considered. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing legal rights of access to information held by public authorities, citizens should have the right to effective public deliberation and moderation.<ref>[http://www.agoraproject.eu/papers/e-Government%20in%20the%20Service%20of%20Democracy.pdf Waller Livesey Edin (2001)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Types of interaction==\n[[File:Hilbert 3D e-democracy roadmap.png|thumb|350px|3D e-democracy roadmap: transcending the trade-offs<ref name=\"HilbertJITP\"/>]] E-democracy has the potential to overcome the traditional trade-off between the size of the group that participates in the democratic process and the depth of the will expression (see Figure). Traditionally, large group size was achieved with simple [[ballot]] [[voting]], whereas the depth of the will expression was limited to predefined options (what's on the ballot), while depth of will expression was achieved by limiting the number of participants through [[representative democracy]] (see Table). The [[social media]] [[Web 2.0]] revolution has shown to achieve both, large group sizes and depth of will expression, but the will expressions in social media are not structured and it is difficult (and often subjective) to make sense of them (see Table). New information processing techniques, including [[big data]] analytics and the [[semantic web]] have shown ways to make use of these possibilities for the implementation of future forms of e-democracy.<ref name=\"HilbertJITP\"/> For now, the process of e-democracy is carried out by technologies such as [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[peer-to-peer]] networks, [[collaborative software]] and apps like GovernEye, [[Countable (app)|Countable]], [[VoteSpotter]], [[wiki]]s, Internet forums and [[blog]]s.

According to a survey conducted by Philip N.

Using online tools to organize, people can more easily be involved in the policy-making process of government, and this has led to increased public engagement. Social media sites support networks of people; online networks affect the political process, including causing an increase in politicians' efforts to appeal to the public in campaigns.\n\nFor e-democracy provides a forum for public discussion. An e-government process improves cooperation with the local populace and helps the government focus in upon key issues the community wants addressed. The theory is that every citizen has the opportunity to have a voice in their local government. E-democracy works in tandem with local communities and gives every citizen who wants to contribute the chance. What makes an effective e-democracy is that the citizens not only contribute to the government, but they communicate and work together to improve their own local communities.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Saglie | first1 = Jo | last2 = Vabo | first2 = Signy Irene | title = Size and e-democracy: online participation in Norwegian local politics | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 382\u2013401 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2009.00235.x | date = December 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|397}}\n\nE-democracy is the use of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) to support the democratic decision-making processes. ICTs play a major role in organizing and informing citizens in various forms of civic engagement. ICTs are used to enhance active participation of citizens and to support the collaboration between actors for policy-making purposes within the political processes of all stages of governance.<ref>Kubicek, H., & Westholm, H. (2007).</ref><ref>Macintoch, Ann (2006)</ref>\n\nThe [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] lists three main factors when it comes to ICTs promoting civic engagement. The first of these is timing; most of the civil engagement occurs during the agenda-setting in a cycle. The second key factor is tailor; this refers to the idea of how ICTs are changing in order to allow for more civic engagement. The last of these factors is integrations; integration is how new ICTs are combining the new technological ways with the traditional ways in order to gain more civic engagement.<ref name=OECD>{{cite book | last = OECD | author-link = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |title=Promise and Problems of E-Democracy |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/9/11/35176328.pdf |publisher= [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] | location = Paris | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789264019485  |quote=ICTs can enable greater citizen engagement in policy-making... }}</ref>\n\nICT creates the opportunity for a government that is simultaneously more democratic and more expert by creating open online collaboration between professionals and the general public. The responsibility of gathering information and making decisions is shared between those with technological expertise and those who are professionally considered the decision-makers.

The policy of \"targeting\" young people so that they can \"play their part\" can be read either as an encouragement of youth activism or an attempt to manage it.<ref name=\"Coleman, Stephen 2008\">Coleman, Stephen. \"Doing IT for Themselves: Management versus Autonomy in Youth E-Citizenship.\" Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth.

On the contrary, managed e-citizens regard young people as apprentice citizens who are in a process of transition from the immaturity of childhood to the self-possession of adulthood, and are thus incapable of contributing to politics without regulation. The Internet is another important issue, with managed e-citizens believing young people are highly vulnerable to misinformation and misdirection. The conflict between the two faces of e-citizenship is a view of democracy as an established and reasonably just system, with which young people should be encouraged to engage, and democracy as a political as well as cultural aspiration, most likely to be realized through networks in which young people engage with one another. Ultimately, strategies of accessing and influencing power are at the heart of what might first appear to be mere differences of communication styles.<ref name=\"Coleman, Stephen 2008\"/>\n\nThe Highland Youth Voice demonstrated the attempt to increase democratic involvement, especially through online measures, in Scotland.<ref name=\"hyv.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyv.org.uk/|title=Highland Youth Parliament - Official Website|work=hyv.org.uk|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> The youth population is increasingly more prominent in governmental policy and issues in the UK. However, involvement and interest have been decreasing. In 2001 elections in the United Kingdom to Westminster, the turnout of 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated at only 40%, which can be compared to the more than 80% of 16- to 24-year-old who have accessed the internet at some time in their life.<ref name=\"Macintosh, Ann 2003\">{{cite journal|author=Macintosh, Ann, Edmund Robson, Ella Smith, and Angus Whyte|date=Feb 2003|title=Electronic Democracy and Young People|journal=Social Science Computer Review|volume=21|pages=43\u201354|doi=10.1177/0894439302238970|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/31b51989980ecddee63f02a6b962b4fe9fbeef17}}</ref> The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child have promoted and stressed the need to educate the younger population as citizens of the nation in which they live in, and promote the participation and active politics which they can shape through debate and communication.\n\nThe Highland Youth Voice aims to increase the involvement of the younger generation through understanding their needs and wishes for their government, through an understanding of their views, experiences, and aspirations. Highland Youth Voice gives young Scots a chance to influence the decision makers in the Highlands.<ref name=\"hyv.org.uk\"/>\nThe members age from 14 to 18 and the parliament as a whole is an elected body of around 100 members. They are elected directly through schools and youth forums. Through the website, those involved are able to discuss the issues important to them. The final prominent democratic aspect of the website is the elections for members, which occur every other year. These three contents of the website allow for an online forum in which members may educate themselves through Youth Voice, partake in online policy debates, or experience a model of e-democracy in the ease of online voting.\n\n===Civil society===\n{{main|Civil society}}\nCitizens' associations play an important role in the democratic process, providing a place for individuals to learn about public affairs and a source of power outside that of the state, according to theorists like [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. Public policy researcher [[Hans Klein]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] notes that participation in such forums has a number of barriers, such as the need to meet in one place at one time.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Tocqueville in Cyberspace: Using the Internet for Citizens Associations |last=Klein |first=Hans |date=January 1999 |issue=15 |pages=213\u2013220 |journal=The Information Society}}</ref> In a study of a civic association in the northeastern United States, Klein found that electronic communications greatly enhanced the ability of the organization to fulfill its mission. The lower cost of information exchange on the Internet, as well as the high level of reach that the content potentially has, makes the Internet an attractive medium for political information, particularly amongst social interest groups and parties with lower budgets.\n\nFor example, environmental or social issue groups may find the Internet an easier mechanism to increase awareness of their issues, as compared to traditional media outlets, such as television or newspapers, which require heavy financial investment. Due to all these factors, the Internet has the potential to take over certain traditional media of political communication, such as the telephone, the television, newspapers and the radio. The [[civil society]] has gradually moved into the online world.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = M. | last2 = Danziger | first2 = J. | last3 = Venkatesh | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Jan).

The term ''interest group'' conventionally refers to more formal organizations that either focus on particular social groups and economic sectors, such as trade unions and business and professional associations, or on more specific issues, such as abortion, gun control, or the environment.<ref>Norris, P. (2001). ''Digital divide: Civic engagement, information poverty, and the Internet worldwide.'' Cambridge: University Press</ref> Other traditional interest groups have well-established organizational structures and formal membership rules, and their primary orientation is toward influencing government and the policy process. Transnational advocacy networks bring together loose coalitions of these organizations under common umbrella organizations that cross national borders.\n\nNovel tools are being developed that are aimed at empowering bloggers, webmasters and owners of other social media, with the effect of moving from a ''strictly informational'' use of the Internet to using the Internet ''as a means of social organization'' not requiring top-down action. [[Call to action (marketing)|Calls to action]], for instance, are a novel concept designed to allow webmasters to mobilize their viewers into action without the need for leadership. These tools are also utilized worldwide: for example, India is developing an effective [[blogosphere]] that allows [[internet user]]s to state their thoughts and opinions.<ref>The road to e-democracy. (2008, February). [[The Economist]], 386(8567), 15.</ref>\n\nThe Internet may serve multiple functions for all these organizations, including lobbying elected representatives, public officials, and policy elites; networking with related associations and organizations; mobilizing organizers, activists, and members using action alerts, newsletters, and emails; raising funds and recruiting supporters; and communicating their message to the public via the traditional news media.\n\n===Deliberative democracy===\n{{main|Deliberative democracy|Participatory democracy}}\n\nThe Internet also plays a central role in [[deliberative democracy]], where deliberation and access to multiple viewpoints is central in decision-making.<ref>[http://psc.sagepub.com/content/27/4/21.refs Gimmler, A. (2001). Deliberative democracy, the public sphere, and the internet. Philosophy Social Criticism, 27(4), 21-39.]</ref> The Internet is able to provide an opportunity for interaction and serves as a prerequisite in the deliberative process as a research tool. On the Internet, the exchange of ideas is widely encouraged through a vast number of websites, blogs, and social networking outlets, such as Twitter; all of which encourage freedom of expression. Through the Internet, information is easily accessible, and in a cost-effective manner, providing access and means for change. Another fundamental feature of the Internet is its uncontrolled nature, and ability to provide all viewpoints no matter the accuracy. The freedom the Internet provides is able to foster and advocate change, crucial in E-Democracy.\n\nA recent advancement in the utilization of E-Democracy for the deliberative process is the [[California Report Card]] created by the Data and Democracy Initiative of the [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]]<ref>[http://citris-uc.org/news/2011/ken_goldberg_data_and_democracy_initiative CITRIS - Ken Goldberg appointed Faculty Director of the CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609141130/http://citris-uc.org/news/2011/ken_goldberg_data_and_democracy_initiative |date=9 June 2012 }}</ref> at [[University of California, Berkeley]], together with Lt. Governor [[Gavin Newsom]]. The [[California Report Card]], launched in January 2014, is a mobile-optimized web application designed to facilitate online [[deliberative democracy]]. After a short opinion poll on 6 timely issues, participants are invited to enter an online \"caf\u00e9\" where they are placed, using [[Principal Component Analysis]], among users with similar views. They are then encouraged to engage in the deliberative process by entering textual suggestions about new political issues and grading other participants' suggestions. The [[California Report Card]] prides itself on being resistant to private agendas dominating the discussion.\n\nAnother example is [[Open Forum (Australia)|openforum.com.au]], an Australian non-profit eDemocracy project that invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate.\n\nAn alternative to the SOPA and PIPA, the [[Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act]] (OPEN Act) is supported by Google and Facebook.

The community elects ten prior art pieces to be sent to the patent examiner for review. This enables the public to directly communicate with the patent examiner. This form of e-democracy is a structured environment which demands certain information from participants that aid in the decision-making process. The goal of the project is to make decision-making process is made more effective by allowing experts and civilians who work together to find solutions. Beyond citizens checking a box that reduces opinions to a few given words, citizens can participate and share ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracyjournal.org/article.php?ID=6570|title=Wiki-Government|author=Beth Simone Noveck|publisher=Democracy Journal|date=2008|accessdate=15 Dec 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229110700/http://democracyjournal.org/article.php?ID=6570|archivedate=29 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Voting and polling===\n{{see also|Electronic voting|Voting advice application|Open access poll}}\nAnother great hurdle in implementing e-democracy is the matter of ensuring security in internet-voting systems. Viruses and malware could block or redirect citizens' votes on matters of great importance; as long as that threat remains, e-democracy will not be able to diffuse throughout society.{{cn|date=July 2019}} Kevin Curran and Eric Nichols of the Internet Technologies Research Group noted in 2005 that \"a secure Internet voting system is theoretically possible, but it would be the first secure networked application ever created in the history of computers\".<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last= Curran|first= Kevin\n |author2= Nichols, Eric|title= E-Democracy\n |journal= Journal of Social Sciences\n |year= 2005|volume= 1|issue= 1\n |pages= 16\u201318<!--|accessdate= 6 February 2012-->\n|doi= 10.3844/jssp.2005.16.18\n |doi-access= free}}\n</ref>\n\nA lack of participation in democracy may result from a plethora of polls and surveys, which can lead to survey fatigue.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | editor1-last = Cloke\n | editor1-first = Paul J.\n | editor1-link = Paul Cloke\n | title = Practising Human Geography\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_VUu29CuYeMC\n | edition = reprint\n | location = London\n | publisher = Sage\n | date = 2004\n | page = 130\n | isbn = 9780761973003\n | access-date = 15 July 2019\n | quote = Questionnaire surveys are a familiar fact of life in the developed world.

Some government representatives are also beginning to use [[Twitter]] which provides them with an easy medium to inform their followers. In the state of [[Rhode Island]], for instance, Treasurer [[Frank T. Caprio]] is offering daily tweets of the state's cash flow.\n\nA number of non-governmental sites have developed cross-jurisdiction, customer-focused applications that extract information from thousands of governmental organizations into a system that brings consistency to data across many dissimilar providers. It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to expend tax dollars to get it. One example of this is transparent.gov.com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transparent.gov.com|title=Making Government User-friendly - Government Information|work=gov.com|accessdate=17 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140603082954/http://transparent.gov.com/|archivedate=3 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> a free resource for citizens to quickly identify the various [[Open Government Initiative|open government initiatives]] taking place in their community or in communities across the country. A similar example is  [[USA.gov]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.gov|title=USA.gov: The U.S. Government's Official Web Portal|work=usa.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> the official site of the United States government, which is a directory that links to every federal and state agency.\n\nE-democracy leads to a more simplified process and access to government information for public-sector agencies and citizens. For example, the [[Indiana]] Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings. [[Indiana]] became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/bmv/|title=BMV: myBMV|work=in.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe internet has created increased government accessibility to news, policies, and contacts in the 21st century: \"In 2000 only two percent of government sites offered three or more services online; in 2007 that figure was 58 percent. In 2000, 78 percent of the states offered no on-line services; in 2007 only 14 percent were without these services (West, 2007)\"(Issuu). Direct access via email has also increased; \"In 2007, 89 percent of government sites allowed the public e-mail a public official directly rather than simply e-mailing the webmaster (West, 2007)\"(Issuu).\n\n==Opposition==\n[[Information and communications technologies]] can be used for both democratic and anti-democratic ends.(e.g. both coercive control and participation can be fostered by digital technology)<ref name=\"HilbertDemoc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.martinhilbert.net/democracy.html|title=Digital Processes and Democratic Theory|work=MartinHilbert.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> [[George Orwell]]'s in his [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] is one example of the vision of the anti-democratic use of technology.\n\nObjections to direct democracy are argued to apply to e-democracy, such as the potential for direct [[governance]] to tend towards the polarization of opinions, [[populism]], and [[demagoguery]].<ref name=\"HilbertDemoc\"/>\n\n===Internet censorship===\n{{main|Internet censorship}}\nIn a nation with heavy government censorship, e-democracy could not be utilized to its full extent. Governments often implement internet crackdowns during widespread political protests. In the middle-east in 2011, for example, the multiple cases of internet blackouts were dubbed the \"Arab Net Crackdown\". Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Iran, and Yemen are all countries whose leaders implemented complete censorship of the internet in response to the plethora of pro-democracy demonstrations in their respective nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/corporations_and_the_arab_net_crackdown|title=Corporations and the Arab Net Crackdown|work=Foreign Policy In Focus|accessdate=17 April 2015|date=2011-03-25}}</ref> These lockdowns were primarily put in place in order to prevent the leakage of cell phone videos that contained images of the violent government crackdown on protesters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://act2.freepress.net/sign/dpi/|title=SaveTheInternet.com - Egypt's Internet Crackdown|work=freepress.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, based on Joshua A.

The People's Administration's blueprint has been published in various forms since 1998 and the People's Administration is the first direct democracy party to be registered in a vote-able format anywhere in the world - making the transition possible through evolution via election with legitimate majority support, instead of potentially through revolution via violence. The [[Direktdemokraterna]] party in Sweden also advocates EDD.\n\n===Liquid democracy===\n{{main|Liquid democracy}}\n[[Liquid democracy]], or direct democracy with [[delegable proxy]], would allow citizens to choose a proxy to vote on their behalf while retaining the right to cast their own vote on legislation. The voting and the appointment of proxies could be done electronically. Taking this further, the proxies could form [[proxy chain]]s, in which if A appoints B and B appoints C, and neither A nor B vote on a proposed bill but C does, C's vote will count for all three of them. Citizens could also rank their proxies in order of preference, so that if their first choice proxy fails to vote, their vote can be cast by their second-choice proxy.\n\n===Wikidemocracy===\nOne proposed form of e-democracy is \"wikidemocracy\", with a government legislature whose codex of laws was an editable wiki, like Wikipedia. In 2012, J Manuel Feliz-Teixeira said he believed the resources to implement wikidemocracy were available. He envisions a wiki-system in which there would be three wings of legislative, executive and judiciary roles for which every citizen could have a voice with free access to the wiki and a personal ID to continuously reform policies until the last day of December (when all votes would be counted).<ref>[http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~feliz/e_poster4_wiki-law-government.pdf Feliz-Teixeira, J Manuel. The Perfect Time for the Perfect Democracy? Some thoughts on wiki-law, wiki-government, online platforms in the direction of a true democracy. Porto, 11 March 2012.]</ref> Advantages to wikidemocracy include a no-cost system with the removal of elections, no need for parliament or representatives because citizens directly represent themselves, and ease of access to voice one's opinion. However, there are obstacles, uncertainties and disagreements. First, the digital divide and low quality of education can be deterrents to achieve the full potential of a wikidemocracy. Similarly, there is a diffusion of innovation in response to new technologies in which some people readily adopt novel ways and others at the opposite end of the spectrum reject them or are slow to adapt.<ref>[http://www.enablingchange.com.au/Summary_Diffusion_Theory.pdf Robinson, Les. A summary of Diffusion of Innovations. Fully revised and rewritten Jan. 2009.

The internet is used for promoting [[human right]]s\u2014including [[free speech]], religion, expression, peaceful assembly, government accountability, and the right of knowledge and understanding\u2014that support democracy. An E-democracy process has been recently proposed in a scientific article<ref>Zanella, A., 2017. Humans, humus, and universe. Appl. Soil Ecol. doi:10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.07.009</ref> for solving a question that has crucial importance for all humans in the 21st century: \"As planet Earth citizens, will you stop the climate from warming?\" The author proposes to use a cell-phone for answering this question during the Olympic Games in [[Pyeongchang 2018]] and [[Tokyo 2020]].\n\n===Expanding democracy===\nThe Internet has several attributes that encourage thinking about it as a democratic medium. The lack of [[Command and control (management)|centralized control]] makes [[censorship]] difficult. There are other parallels in the social design in the early days of the internet, such as the strongly [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] support for [[free speech]], the [[sharing culture]] that permeated nearly all aspects of Internet use, and the outright prohibition on commercial use by the [[National Science Foundation]]. Another example is the unmediated mass communication on the internet, such as through [[newsgroup]]s, chat rooms, and [[MUD]]s. This communication ignored the boundaries established with [[broadcast media]], such as [[newspaper]]s or [[radio]], and with one-to-one media, such as letters or [[landline telephone]]s. Finally, because the Internet is a massive digital network with open standards, universal and inexpensive access to a wide variety of communication media and models could actually be attained.<ref>Novak, T., & Hoffman, D. (1998). ''Bridging the Digital Divide: The Impact of Race on Computer Access and Internet Use.'' Nashville: Vanderbilt University.</ref>\n\nSome practical issues involving e-democracy include: effective participation; voting equality at decision stage; enlightened understanding; control of the agenda; and inclusiveness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Democracy and Its Critics|publisher=Yale University Press|author=Robert Dahl|date=1989|isbn=9780300049381|title-link=Democracy and Its Critics}}</ref> Systemic issues may include cyber-security concerns and protection of sensitive data from third parties.\n\n===Improving Democracy===\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=August 2017}}\nStrictly speaking, modern democracies are generally representative democracies, where citizens elect representatives to manage the creation and implementation of laws, policies, and regulations on their behalf, in contrast to direct democracies in which citizens retain that responsibility. They may be referred to as more or less \"democratic\" depending on how well the government represents the will or interest of the people. A shift to E-democracy would in effect devolve political power from elected representatives to the individual.  \n\nIn America, politics have become reliant on the Internet because the Internet is the primary source of information for most Americans. The Internet educates people on democracy, helping people stay up to date with what is happening in their government. Online advertising is becoming more popular for political candidates and group's opinions on propositions.<ref name=diffusion>{{cite journal|title=Testing the Development and Diffusion of E-Government and E-Democracy: A Global Perspective|journal=Public Administration Review|author1=Chung-pin Lee |author2=Kaiju Chang |author3=Frances Stokes Berry |date=9 May 2011|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02228.x |volume=71 |issue = 3|pages=444\u2013454}}</ref> For many the Internet is often the primary resource for information. The reason for this, and especially among younger voters, is that it is easy and reliable when used correctly, thus lowering an individual's workload. The innate usability of search engines, such as [[Google]], results in increased citizen engagement with research and political issues. Social networks allow people to express their opinions about the government through an alias, anonymously and judgment-free.<ref>Oral, Beh\u00e7et(2008). \"Computers & Education: The evaluation of the student teachers' attitudes toward the Internet and democracy.\" Dicle University, Volume 50, Issue 1: 437-445.</ref> Due to the Internets' size and decentralized structure, any individual has the potential to go viral and gain influence over a large number of others. \n\nThe Internet enables citizens to get and post information about politicians, and it allows those politicians to get advice from the people in larger numbers. This collective decision making and problem-solving gives more power to the citizens and helps politicians make decisions faster. This creates a more productive society that can handle problems faster and more efficiently. Getting feedback and advice from the American population is a large part of a politician's job and the Internet allows them to function effectively with larger numbers of people's opinions. With this heightened ability to communicate with the public, the American government is able to function more capably and effectively as a Democracy.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Citizenship And Governance In A Wild, Wired World: How Should Citizens And Public Managers Use Online Tools To Improve Democracy?|journal=National Civic Review|author=Matt Leighninger|date=2 May 2012|doi=10.1002/ncr.20056|volume=100|issue = 2|pages=20\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe American election of 2016 is an example, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made good use of Twitter, attempting to shape perceptions on their behalf, whilst using social media to transmit the idea that authorities are also \u2018normal\u2019, and they can communicate through a Twitter account just like everyone does.

People have all governmental information at their fingertips and easy access to contact their government officials. In this new generation where internet and networking rule everyone's daily lives, it is more convenient that people can be informed of the government and policies through this form of communication.\n\nE-democracy has, in fact, endorsed a better and faster political information exchange, public argumentation and involvement in decision-making (Djik, 2006, pp.126<ref>{{Cite journal|last=van Dijk|first=Jan A.G.M.|last2=Hacker|first2=Kenneth L.|date=2018-05-30|title=Internet and Democracy in the Network Society|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781351110716|doi=10.4324/9781351110716}}</ref>). Social media has become an empowerment tool, especially for the youth, who are encouraged to participate in elections. \u00a0Social media has also allowed the politicians to interact with civilians. A clear example was the 2016 American elections and how Donald Trump tweeted most of his announcements and goals. Not only Trump, but other presidents have Twitter accounts such as Justin Trudeau, Jair Bolsonaro, and Hassan Rouhani. Moreover, some people genuinely believe that the government posting public information online makes them more vulnerable and therefore more evident in people\u2019s eyes, which favors the public\u2019s surveillance.

These networked societies are constructed post -\"triple revolution\" of technology, which involves a three-step process. Step one in the \"triple revolution\" is \"the turn to social networks\", step two: \"the proliferation of the far-flung, instantaneous internet\", and step three: \"the even wider proliferation of always-available mobile phones\".<ref name=\"homes.chass.utoronto.ca\">{{cite web|last1=Zhuo|first1=X.|last2=Wellman|first2=B.|last3=Yu|first3=J. |year=2011 <!-- July/September). --> |title=Egypt: The first internet revolt? |work=Peace Magazine|pages= 6\u201310|url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/publications/egypt/PMag-1107-Egypt-offprint.pdf}}</ref> These elements play a key role in change through the Internet. Such technologies provide an alternative sphere that is unregulated by the government, and where construction of ideas and protests can foster without regulation. For example, In Egypt, the \"April 6 Youth Movement\" established their political group on Facebook where they called for a national strike to occur on April 6. This event was ultimately suppressed, however; the Facebook group remained, spurring the growth of other activist parties to take an online media route. The Internet in Egypt was used also to form connections with networks of people outside of their own country. The connections provided through Internet media sources, such as Twitter allowed rapid spread of the revolt to be known around the world.

Invisible Children, the non-profit organization responsible for this video campaign, was founded on the mission to bring awareness to the vile actions of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), located in Central Africa, and the arrest of its leader, Joseph Kony. In the video, Jason Russell, one of the founders of Invisible Children, says that \"the problem is that 99% of the planet doesn't know who [Kony] is\" and the only way to stop him is by having enough support from the people to convince the government to continue the hunt for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=9230|title=Kony 2012: History in the making?|publisher=The University Times|author=Hazel Shaw|date=7 Mar 2012|accessdate=15 Dec 2014}}</ref> So, Invisible Children's purpose for the video was to raise awareness by making Kony famous through the ever-expanding market of social media and to use the technology we have today to bring his crimes to light.\n\nOn March 21, 2012, a group of 33 Senators introduced a resolution condemning \"the crimes against humanity\" committed by Joseph Kony and the LRA.

The Internet provides a sense of relevancy in participation through allowing everyone's voice to be heard and expressed. A structure of social inclusion is also provided through a wide variety of Internet sites, groups, and social networks, all representing different viewpoints and ideas. Sensitivity to the individual's needs is accomplished through the ability to express individual opinions publicly and rapidly. Finally, the Internet is an extremely flexible area of participation; it is low in cost and widely available to the public. Through these four directions, E-Democracy and the implementation of the Internet are able to play an active role in societal change.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anttiroiko | first1 = Ari-Veikko | year = 2003 | title = Building strong e-democracy: the role of technology in developing democracy for the information age | url = | journal = Commun.

This is especially important when considering electronic voting. An electoral voting system is more complex than other electronic transaction systems and the authentication mechanisms employed must be able to prevent ballot rigging or the threat of rigging. This may include the use of smart cards that allow a voter's identity to be verified whilst at the same time ensuring the privacy of the vote cast. [[Electronic voting in Estonia]] is one example of a method to conquer the privacy-identity problem inherent in internet voting systems. However, the objective should be to provide equivalence with the security and privacy of current manual systems.\n\n===Government responsiveness===\nIn order to attract people to get involved in online consultations and discussions, the government must respond to people and actively demonstrate that there is a relationship between the citizen's engagement and policy outcome. It is also important that people are able to become involved in the process, at a time and place that is convenient to them but when their opinions will count. The government will need to ensure that the structures are in place to deal with increased participation.\n\nIn order to ensure that issues are debated in a democratic, inclusive, tolerant and productive way, the role that intermediaries and\nrepresentative organizations may play should be considered. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing legal rights of access to information held by public authorities, citizens should have the right to effective public deliberation and moderation.<ref>[http://www.agoraproject.eu/papers/e-Government%20in%20the%20Service%20of%20Democracy.pdf Waller Livesey Edin (2001)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Types of interaction==\n[[File:Hilbert 3D e-democracy roadmap.png|thumb|350px|3D e-democracy roadmap: transcending the trade-offs<ref name=\"HilbertJITP\"/>]] E-democracy has the potential to overcome the traditional trade-off between the size of the group that participates in the democratic process and the depth of the will expression (see Figure). Traditionally, large group size was achieved with simple [[ballot]] [[voting]], whereas the depth of the will expression was limited to predefined options (what's on the ballot), while depth of will expression was achieved by limiting the number of participants through [[representative democracy]] (see Table). The [[social media]] [[Web 2.0]] revolution has shown to achieve both, large group sizes and depth of will expression, but the will expressions in social media are not structured and it is difficult (and often subjective) to make sense of them (see Table). New information processing techniques, including [[big data]] analytics and the [[semantic web]] have shown ways to make use of these possibilities for the implementation of future forms of e-democracy.<ref name=\"HilbertJITP\"/> For now, the process of e-democracy is carried out by technologies such as [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[peer-to-peer]] networks, [[collaborative software]] and apps like GovernEye, [[Countable (app)|Countable]], [[VoteSpotter]], [[wiki]]s, Internet forums and [[blog]]s.

Using online tools to organize, people can more easily be involved in the policy-making process of government, and this has led to increased public engagement. Social media sites support networks of people; online networks affect the political process, including causing an increase in politicians' efforts to appeal to the public in campaigns.\n\nFor e-democracy provides a forum for public discussion. An e-government process improves cooperation with the local populace and helps the government focus in upon key issues the community wants addressed. The theory is that every citizen has the opportunity to have a voice in their local government. E-democracy works in tandem with local communities and gives every citizen who wants to contribute the chance. What makes an effective e-democracy is that the citizens not only contribute to the government, but they communicate and work together to improve their own local communities.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Saglie | first1 = Jo | last2 = Vabo | first2 = Signy Irene | title = Size and e-democracy: online participation in Norwegian local politics | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 382\u2013401 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2009.00235.x | date = December 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|397}}\n\nE-democracy is the use of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) to support the democratic decision-making processes. ICTs play a major role in organizing and informing citizens in various forms of civic engagement. ICTs are used to enhance active participation of citizens and to support the collaboration between actors for policy-making purposes within the political processes of all stages of governance.<ref>Kubicek, H., & Westholm, H.

The first of these is timing; most of the civil engagement occurs during the agenda-setting in a cycle. The second key factor is tailor; this refers to the idea of how ICTs are changing in order to allow for more civic engagement. The last of these factors is integrations; integration is how new ICTs are combining the new technological ways with the traditional ways in order to gain more civic engagement.<ref name=OECD>{{cite book | last = OECD | author-link = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |title=Promise and Problems of E-Democracy |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/9/11/35176328.pdf |publisher= [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] | location = Paris | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789264019485  |quote=ICTs can enable greater citizen engagement in policy-making... }}</ref>\n\nICT creates the opportunity for a government that is simultaneously more democratic and more expert by creating open online collaboration between professionals and the general public. The responsibility of gathering information and making decisions is shared between those with technological expertise and those who are professionally considered the decision-makers.

This two-step process, encouraging an individual to vote and to tell his or her friends to vote, was just emerging at that time. Now, political involvement from a variety of social media is commonplace and civic engagement through online forums frequent. Through the use of ICTs, politically minded individuals have the opportunity to become more involved.<ref name=\"Foot\"/>\n\n===Youth engagement===\n{{main|Youth activism}}\nYoung people under the age of 35, or [[Generation X]] and [[Generation Y]], have been noted for their lack of political interest and activity.<ref>Owen, D.

The policy of \"targeting\" young people so that they can \"play their part\" can be read either as an encouragement of youth activism or an attempt to manage it.<ref name=\"Coleman, Stephen 2008\">Coleman, Stephen. \"Doing IT for Themselves: Management versus Autonomy in Youth E-Citizenship.\" Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth.

Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008. 189\u2013206. {{doi|10.1162/dmal.9780262524827.189}}</ref> Autonomous e-citizens argue that despite their limited experience, youth deserve to speak for themselves on agendas of their own making. On the contrary, managed e-citizens regard young people as apprentice citizens who are in a process of transition from the immaturity of childhood to the self-possession of adulthood, and are thus incapable of contributing to politics without regulation. The Internet is another important issue, with managed e-citizens believing young people are highly vulnerable to misinformation and misdirection. The conflict between the two faces of e-citizenship is a view of democracy as an established and reasonably just system, with which young people should be encouraged to engage, and democracy as a political as well as cultural aspiration, most likely to be realized through networks in which young people engage with one another. Ultimately, strategies of accessing and influencing power are at the heart of what might first appear to be mere differences of communication styles.<ref name=\"Coleman, Stephen 2008\"/>\n\nThe Highland Youth Voice demonstrated the attempt to increase democratic involvement, especially through online measures, in Scotland.<ref name=\"hyv.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyv.org.uk/|title=Highland Youth Parliament - Official Website|work=hyv.org.uk|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> The youth population is increasingly more prominent in governmental policy and issues in the UK. However, involvement and interest have been decreasing. In 2001 elections in the United Kingdom to Westminster, the turnout of 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated at only 40%, which can be compared to the more than 80% of 16- to 24-year-old who have accessed the internet at some time in their life.<ref name=\"Macintosh, Ann 2003\">{{cite journal|author=Macintosh, Ann, Edmund Robson, Ella Smith, and Angus Whyte|date=Feb 2003|title=Electronic Democracy and Young People|journal=Social Science Computer Review|volume=21|pages=43\u201354|doi=10.1177/0894439302238970|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/31b51989980ecddee63f02a6b962b4fe9fbeef17}}</ref> The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child have promoted and stressed the need to educate the younger population as citizens of the nation in which they live in, and promote the participation and active politics which they can shape through debate and communication.\n\nThe Highland Youth Voice aims to increase the involvement of the younger generation through understanding their needs and wishes for their government, through an understanding of their views, experiences, and aspirations. Highland Youth Voice gives young Scots a chance to influence the decision makers in the Highlands.<ref name=\"hyv.org.uk\"/>\nThe members age from 14 to 18 and the parliament as a whole is an elected body of around 100 members. They are elected directly through schools and youth forums. Through the website, those involved are able to discuss the issues important to them. The final prominent democratic aspect of the website is the elections for members, which occur every other year. These three contents of the website allow for an online forum in which members may educate themselves through Youth Voice, partake in online policy debates, or experience a model of e-democracy in the ease of online voting.\n\n===Civil society===\n{{main|Civil society}}\nCitizens' associations play an important role in the democratic process, providing a place for individuals to learn about public affairs and a source of power outside that of the state, according to theorists like [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. Public policy researcher [[Hans Klein]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] notes that participation in such forums has a number of barriers, such as the need to meet in one place at one time.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Tocqueville in Cyberspace: Using the Internet for Citizens Associations |last=Klein |first=Hans |date=January 1999 |issue=15 |pages=213\u2013220 |journal=The Information Society}}</ref> In a study of a civic association in the northeastern United States, Klein found that electronic communications greatly enhanced the ability of the organization to fulfill its mission. The lower cost of information exchange on the Internet, as well as the high level of reach that the content potentially has, makes the Internet an attractive medium for political information, particularly amongst social interest groups and parties with lower budgets.\n\nFor example, environmental or social issue groups may find the Internet an easier mechanism to increase awareness of their issues, as compared to traditional media outlets, such as television or newspapers, which require heavy financial investment. Due to all these factors, the Internet has the potential to take over certain traditional media of political communication, such as the telephone, the television, newspapers and the radio. The [[civil society]] has gradually moved into the online world.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = M. | last2 = Danziger | first2 = J. | last3 = Venkatesh | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Jan).

The term ''interest group'' conventionally refers to more formal organizations that either focus on particular social groups and economic sectors, such as trade unions and business and professional associations, or on more specific issues, such as abortion, gun control, or the environment.<ref>Norris, P. (2001). ''Digital divide: Civic engagement, information poverty, and the Internet worldwide.'' Cambridge: University Press</ref> Other traditional interest groups have well-established organizational structures and formal membership rules, and their primary orientation is toward influencing government and the policy process. Transnational advocacy networks bring together loose coalitions of these organizations under common umbrella organizations that cross national borders.\n\nNovel tools are being developed that are aimed at empowering bloggers, webmasters and owners of other social media, with the effect of moving from a ''strictly informational'' use of the Internet to using the Internet ''as a means of social organization'' not requiring top-down action. [[Call to action (marketing)|Calls to action]], for instance, are a novel concept designed to allow webmasters to mobilize their viewers into action without the need for leadership. These tools are also utilized worldwide: for example, India is developing an effective [[blogosphere]] that allows [[internet user]]s to state their thoughts and opinions.<ref>The road to e-democracy. (2008, February). [[The Economist]], 386(8567), 15.</ref>\n\nThe Internet may serve multiple functions for all these organizations, including lobbying elected representatives, public officials, and policy elites; networking with related associations and organizations; mobilizing organizers, activists, and members using action alerts, newsletters, and emails; raising funds and recruiting supporters; and communicating their message to the public via the traditional news media.\n\n===Deliberative democracy===\n{{main|Deliberative democracy|Participatory democracy}}\n\nThe Internet also plays a central role in [[deliberative democracy]], where deliberation and access to multiple viewpoints is central in decision-making.<ref>[http://psc.sagepub.com/content/27/4/21.refs Gimmler, A. (2001). Deliberative democracy, the public sphere, and the internet. Philosophy Social Criticism, 27(4), 21-39.]</ref> The Internet is able to provide an opportunity for interaction and serves as a prerequisite in the deliberative process as a research tool. On the Internet, the exchange of ideas is widely encouraged through a vast number of websites, blogs, and social networking outlets, such as Twitter; all of which encourage freedom of expression. Through the Internet, information is easily accessible, and in a cost-effective manner, providing access and means for change. Another fundamental feature of the Internet is its uncontrolled nature, and ability to provide all viewpoints no matter the accuracy. The freedom the Internet provides is able to foster and advocate change, crucial in E-Democracy.\n\nA recent advancement in the utilization of E-Democracy for the deliberative process is the [[California Report Card]] created by the Data and Democracy Initiative of the [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]]<ref>[http://citris-uc.org/news/2011/ken_goldberg_data_and_democracy_initiative CITRIS - Ken Goldberg appointed Faculty Director of the CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609141130/http://citris-uc.org/news/2011/ken_goldberg_data_and_democracy_initiative |date=9 June 2012 }}</ref> at [[University of California, Berkeley]], together with Lt. Governor [[Gavin Newsom]]. The [[California Report Card]], launched in January 2014, is a mobile-optimized web application designed to facilitate online [[deliberative democracy]]. After a short opinion poll on 6 timely issues, participants are invited to enter an online \"caf\u00e9\" where they are placed, using [[Principal Component Analysis]], among users with similar views. They are then encouraged to engage in the deliberative process by entering textual suggestions about new political issues and grading other participants' suggestions. The [[California Report Card]] prides itself on being resistant to private agendas dominating the discussion.\n\nAnother example is [[Open Forum (Australia)|openforum.com.au]], an Australian non-profit eDemocracy project that invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate.\n\nAn alternative to the SOPA and PIPA, the [[Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act]] (OPEN Act) is supported by Google and Facebook.

The community elects ten prior art pieces to be sent to the patent examiner for review. This enables the public to directly communicate with the patent examiner. This form of e-democracy is a structured environment which demands certain information from participants that aid in the decision-making process. The goal of the project is to make decision-making process is made more effective by allowing experts and civilians who work together to find solutions.

Some government representatives are also beginning to use [[Twitter]] which provides them with an easy medium to inform their followers. In the state of [[Rhode Island]], for instance, Treasurer [[Frank T. Caprio]] is offering daily tweets of the state's cash flow.\n\nA number of non-governmental sites have developed cross-jurisdiction, customer-focused applications that extract information from thousands of governmental organizations into a system that brings consistency to data across many dissimilar providers. It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to expend tax dollars to get it. One example of this is transparent.gov.com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transparent.gov.com|title=Making Government User-friendly - Government Information|work=gov.com|accessdate=17 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140603082954/http://transparent.gov.com/|archivedate=3 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> a free resource for citizens to quickly identify the various [[Open Government Initiative|open government initiatives]] taking place in their community or in communities across the country. A similar example is  [[USA.gov]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.gov|title=USA.gov: The U.S. Government's Official Web Portal|work=usa.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> the official site of the United States government, which is a directory that links to every federal and state agency.\n\nE-democracy leads to a more simplified process and access to government information for public-sector agencies and citizens. For example, the [[Indiana]] Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings. [[Indiana]] became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/bmv/|title=BMV: myBMV|work=in.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe internet has created increased government accessibility to news, policies, and contacts in the 21st century: \"In 2000 only two percent of government sites offered three or more services online; in 2007 that figure was 58 percent. In 2000, 78 percent of the states offered no on-line services; in 2007 only 14 percent were without these services (West, 2007)\"(Issuu). Direct access via email has also increased; \"In 2007, 89 percent of government sites allowed the public e-mail a public official directly rather than simply e-mailing the webmaster (West, 2007)\"(Issuu).\n\n==Opposition==\n[[Information and communications technologies]] can be used for both democratic and anti-democratic ends.(e.g. both coercive control and participation can be fostered by digital technology)<ref name=\"HilbertDemoc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.martinhilbert.net/democracy.html|title=Digital Processes and Democratic Theory|work=MartinHilbert.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> [[George Orwell]]'s in his [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] is one example of the vision of the anti-democratic use of technology.\n\nObjections to direct democracy are argued to apply to e-democracy, such as the potential for direct [[governance]] to tend towards the polarization of opinions, [[populism]], and [[demagoguery]].<ref name=\"HilbertDemoc\"/>\n\n===Internet censorship===\n{{main|Internet censorship}}\nIn a nation with heavy government censorship, e-democracy could not be utilized to its full extent. Governments often implement internet crackdowns during widespread political protests. In the middle-east in 2011, for example, the multiple cases of internet blackouts were dubbed the \"Arab Net Crackdown\". Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Iran, and Yemen are all countries whose leaders implemented complete censorship of the internet in response to the plethora of pro-democracy demonstrations in their respective nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/corporations_and_the_arab_net_crackdown|title=Corporations and the Arab Net Crackdown|work=Foreign Policy In Focus|accessdate=17 April 2015|date=2011-03-25}}</ref> These lockdowns were primarily put in place in order to prevent the leakage of cell phone videos that contained images of the violent government crackdown on protesters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://act2.freepress.net/sign/dpi/|title=SaveTheInternet.com - Egypt's Internet Crackdown|work=freepress.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, based on Joshua A.

[[Ross Perot]] was a prominent advocate of EDD when he advocated \"electronic [[town meeting|town halls]]\" during his 1992 and 1996 [[President of the United States|Presidential]] campaigns in the [[United States]]. [[Politics of Switzerland|Switzerland]], already partially governed by direct democracy, is making progress towards such a system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissworld.org/dvd_rom/eng/direct_democracy_2004/content/votes/e_voting.html|archivedate=7 April 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407015504/http://www.swissworld.org/dvd_rom/eng/direct_democracy_2004/content/votes/e_voting.html|title=Electronic Voting in Switzerland|work=swissworld.org}}</ref>\n[[Senator On-Line]], an Australian political party established in 2007, proposes to institute an EDD system so that Australians can decide which way the senators vote on each and every bill.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Senator On-Line |url = http://senatoronline.com.au/ |accessdate = 3 June 2008 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607140855/http://senatoronline.com.au/ |archivedate = 7 June 2008 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> A similar initiative was formed 2002 in Sweden where the party [[Direktdemokraterna]], running for the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish parliament]], offers its members the power to decide the actions of the party over all or some areas of decision, or to use a proxy with immediate recall for one or several areas.\n\nThe first mainstream direct democracy party to be registered{{when|date=August 2017}} with any country's electoral commission [checked against each country's register] is the UK's People's Administration Direct Democracy party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paparty.co.uk|title=Direct Democracy|work=paparty.co.uk|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> The People's Administration have developed and published the complete architecture for a legitimate reform to EDD [including the required Parliamentary reform process]. Established by musicians [including Alex Romane] and political activists, the People's Administration advocates using the web and telephone to enable the majority electorate to create, propose and vote upon all policy implementation. The People's Administration's blueprint has been published in various forms since 1998 and the People's Administration is the first direct democracy party to be registered in a vote-able format anywhere in the world - making the transition possible through evolution via election with legitimate majority support, instead of potentially through revolution via violence. The [[Direktdemokraterna]] party in Sweden also advocates EDD.\n\n===Liquid democracy===\n{{main|Liquid democracy}}\n[[Liquid democracy]], or direct democracy with [[delegable proxy]], would allow citizens to choose a proxy to vote on their behalf while retaining the right to cast their own vote on legislation. The voting and the appointment of proxies could be done electronically. Taking this further, the proxies could form [[proxy chain]]s, in which if A appoints B and B appoints C, and neither A nor B vote on a proposed bill but C does, C's vote will count for all three of them. Citizens could also rank their proxies in order of preference, so that if their first choice proxy fails to vote, their vote can be cast by their second-choice proxy.\n\n===Wikidemocracy===\nOne proposed form of e-democracy is \"wikidemocracy\", with a government legislature whose codex of laws was an editable wiki, like Wikipedia. In 2012, J Manuel Feliz-Teixeira said he believed the resources to implement wikidemocracy were available. He envisions a wiki-system in which there would be three wings of legislative, executive and judiciary roles for which every citizen could have a voice with free access to the wiki and a personal ID to continuously reform policies until the last day of December (when all votes would be counted).<ref>[http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~feliz/e_poster4_wiki-law-government.pdf Feliz-Teixeira, J Manuel. The Perfect Time for the Perfect Democracy? Some thoughts on wiki-law, wiki-government, online platforms in the direction of a true democracy. Porto, 11 March 2012.]</ref> Advantages to wikidemocracy include a no-cost system with the removal of elections, no need for parliament or representatives because citizens directly represent themselves, and ease of access to voice one's opinion. However, there are obstacles, uncertainties and disagreements. First, the digital divide and low quality of education can be deterrents to achieve the full potential of a wikidemocracy. Similarly, there is a diffusion of innovation in response to new technologies in which some people readily adopt novel ways and others at the opposite end of the spectrum reject them or are slow to adapt.<ref>[http://www.enablingchange.com.au/Summary_Diffusion_Theory.pdf Robinson, Les. A summary of Diffusion of Innovations. Fully revised and rewritten Jan. 2009. Enabling Change]</ref> It is also uncertain how secure this type of democracy would be because we would have to trust that the system administrator would have a high level of integrity to protect the votes saved to the public domain. Lastly, Peter Levine agrees that wikidemocracy would increase discussion on political and moral issues, but he disagrees with Feliz-Teixeira who argues that wikidemocracy would remove the need for representatives and formal governmental structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peterlevine.ws/Internetdemocracy.htm|title=Democracy's Moment|work=peterlevine.ws|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nWikidemocracy is also used to mean more limited instantiations of e-democracy, such as in Argentina in August 2011, where the polling records of the presidential election were made available to the public in online form, for vetting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/pablo-mancini/wiki-democracy-begins-in-_b_934331.html|title=\"Wiki\" Democracy Begins In Argentina|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=17 April 2015|date=2011-08-24}}</ref> The term has also been used in a more general way to refer to the democratic values and environments offered by wikis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getwiki.net/-The_Messiness_of_WikiDemocracy|title=GetWiki - The Messiness of WikiDemocracy|work=getwiki.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, some in [[Finland]] undertook an experiment in wikidemocracy by creating a \"shadow government program\" on the Internet, essentially a compilation of the political views and aspirations of various groups in Finland, on a wiki.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ominvoimin.com/santas-little-helpers-wikidemocracy-in-finland/|title=Santa's Little Helpers: Wikidemocracy in Finland - Ominvoimin \u2013 ihmisten tekem\u00e4\u00e4|work=ominvoimin.com|accessdate=17 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107053420/http://ominvoimin.com/santas-little-helpers-wikidemocracy-in-finland/|archivedate=7 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Collaborative governance]]\n* [[Collaborative e-democracy]]\n* [[Demoex]] - Democracy Experiment\n* [[Democratization of technology]]\n* [[E2D International]] \n* [[E-Government]]\n* [[E-participation]]\n* [[Electronic civil disobedience]]\n* [[Electronic Democracy Party]], a [[political party]] in [[Turkey]]\n* [[Emergent democracy]]\n* [[eRulemaking]]\n* [[Hacktivism]]\n* [[Internet activism]]\n* [[Isocracy]]\n* [[Media democracy]]\n* [[Online consultation]]\n* [[Online deliberation]]\n* [[Online Party of Canada]], a [[political party]] in [[Canada]]\n* [[Open politics]]\n* [[Open source governance]]\n* [[ParoleWatch]]\n* [[Participation (decision making)|Participation]]\n* [[Parliamentary informatics]]\n* [[Party of Internet Democracy]], a [[political party]] in [[Hungary]]\n* [[Platform cooperative]]\n* [[Public Whip]]\n* [[Second Superpower]]\n* [[Smart mob]]\n* [[Spatial Citizenship]]\n* [[Technocracy]]\n* [[Technology and society]]\n* [[TheyWorkForYou]]\n* [[Index of Internet-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of the Internet]]\n* [[IserveU]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] based online voting platform.\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550({{NoMoreLinks}})\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n \u2551 PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
