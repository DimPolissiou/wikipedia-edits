Against the economists' demand for freedom of criticism, Lenin advanced the position that the [[orthodox Marxists]] had the same right to criticize in return. He stressed that in the struggle against the bourgeoisie revolutionary social democrats would need to pay particular attention to theoretical questions, recalling Engels' position that there were three forms of social democratic struggle, namely political, economic and theoretical.<ref>{{cite web|last=North|first=David|title=The Origins of Bolshevism and What Is To Be Done?|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2005/09/le3-all.html|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=[[International Committee of the Fourth International]]|date=6 September 2005|accessdate=3 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606205901/http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2005/09/le3-all.html|archive-date=6 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLenin puts the case that workers will not spontaneously become Marxists just by fighting battles over wages with their employers. Instead, Marxists need to form a political party to publicise Marxist ideas and persuade workers to become Marxists. He goes on to argue that to understand politics you must understand all of society, not just workers and their economic struggles with their employers. To become political and to become Marxists, workers need to learn about all of society, not just their own corner of it, arguing: <blockquote>Class political consciousness can be brought to the workers ''only from without''; that is, only from outside the economic struggle, from outside the sphere of relations between workers and employers. The sphere from which alone it is possible to obtain this knowledge is the sphere of relationships (of ''all'' classes and strata) to the state and the government, the sphere of the interrelations between ''all'' classes.<ref>[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin, Vladimir]] (1901).

However, socialist theory in Russia, as elsewhere in Europe, was the product of the \"educated representatives of the propertied classes\", the [[intellectuals]] or \"[[revolutionary socialist]] intellectuals\".

This was quickly shortened first to \"The Hot Chocolate\" and then to \"Hot Chocolate\" by [[Mickie Most]]. By 1970 the band's line-up had changed again to include Harvey Hinsley who had been playing on demos of Wilson & Brown,in early 1970,-after Love is Life hit the charts, Tony Wilson asked Harvey to join Hot Chocolate,-in August 1970;The band had a holiday in summer 1973 & left Harvey to find a new drummer Tony Connor (who was also a member of [[Audience (band)|Audience]] at the time] De Allie [left in 1971] and King 1973;\n\nHot Chocolate started their recording career making a [[reggae]] version of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", but frontman Errol Brown was told he needed permission. He was contacted by [[Apple Records]], discovered that Lennon liked his version, and the group was subsequently signed to Apple Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/377/errol_brown_a_fondent_farewell/ |title=ERROL BROWN: A Fondent Farewell |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> The link was short-lived as [[the Beatles]] were starting to break up; and the Apple connection soon ended.\n\nLater in 1970 Hot Chocolate, with the help of record producer Mickie Most, began releasing tracks that became hits, such as \"[[Love Is Life]]\", \"[[Emma (song)|Emma]]\", \"[[You Could Have Been a Lady]]\" (a US and Canadian hit for [[April Wine]]), and \"I Believe in Love\". All those releases were on the [[Rak Records|Rak]] record label, owned by Most. Brown and bassist Tony Wilson wrote most of their original material, and also provided hits for [[Herman's Hermits]], \"Bet Yer Life I Do\", [[Julie Felix]], \"Heaven is Here\", and [[Mary Hopkin]], \"Think About Your Children\".\n \nGradually the band started to become [[UK Singles Chart]] regulars. One of the hits from this period, \"[[Brother Louie (Hot Chocolate song)|Brother Louie]]\", featured a guest spoken vocal from [[Alexis Korner]].\n\n==Success==\nIt was in the [[disco]] era of the mid-1970s that Hot Chocolate became a big success. A combination of high production standards, the growing confidence of the main songwriting team of Wilson and Brown, and tight vocal [[harmonies]] enabled them to secure further big hits such as \"You Sexy Thing\" and \"[[Every 1's a Winner (song)|Every 1's a Winner]]\", which were also US hits, peaking at No. 3 (1976) and No. 6 (1979), respectively. \"Every 1's a Winner\" featured a distinctive distorted guitar riff by Harvey Hinsley using a [[Roland GR-500]]. After Wilson's departure for a solo career, that included a 1976 album ''I Like Your Style'', Brown assumed all songwriting duties. Wilson was initially replaced by Brian Satterwhite; before Satterwhite departed the band and Olive switched to bass as his primary instrument.<ref name=\"badcatrecords1\"/>\n\nIn 1977, after 15 hits, they finally reached [[Chart-topper|Number One]] with \"[[So You Win Again]]\". It was one of the few of their recordings that was not written, at least partly, by Brown.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles\"/> The track was a [[Russ Ballard]] composition.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles\"/>\n\nThe band became the only group, and one of just three acts, that had a hit in every year of the 1970s in the UK charts (the other two being [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Diana Ross]]).<ref name=\"British Hit Singles\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2001\n| title= British Hit Singles\n| edition= 14th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 0-85156-156-X\n| page= 47}}</ref><ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\">{{cite book\n| first= Jo\n| last= Rice\n| year= 1982\n| title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd \n| location= Enfield, Middlesex\n| isbn= 0-85112-250-7\n| page= 184}}</ref>\nThe band eventually had at least one hit, every year, between 1970 and 1984.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> \n\nThe band continued well into the 1980s, and clocked up another big hit record: \"[[It Started with a Kiss (song)|It Started with a Kiss]]\", in 1982, which reached Number 5 in the UK. In all, the group charted 25 [[UK Top 40]] hit singles.

In 2003, [[Errol Brown]] received the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]; and in 2004, the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for his contribution to British music.\n\nIn 1992 the band reformed with new vocalist Greg Bannis and keyboardists Steve Ansell, Andy Smith, Willy Dowling, and Steve Matthews (the latter two of which departed the band in 1994), and manager and agent Ric Martin took control over the band's bookings and live appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegreatrockbible.com/portfolio-item/hot-chocolate-biography/ |title=HOT CHOCOLATE biography |publisher=The Great Rock Bible |date=23 November 2014 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref> Kennie Simon took over lead vocals in 2010 following the departure of Bannis and Hot Chocolate continue to make [[concert|live appearances]] in the UK and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-chocolate.co.uk |title=Home |publisher=Hot Chocolate |accessdate=7 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 May 2015, original frontman and principal songwriter Errol Brown died from liver cancer.

The act had at least one [[hit record|hit]] every year from 1970 to 1984, and their 1975 song \"[[You Sexy Thing]]\" made the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in three decades.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| pages= 259/260\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5}}</ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nFormed in 1968, the band initially consisted of vocalist Errol Brown, guitarist Franklyn De Allie, drummer Jim King (shortly thereafter replaced by the unrelated Ian King), percussionist Patrick Olive, and bassist Tony Wilson;<ref name=\"badcatrecords1\">{{cite web|url=http://badcatrecords.com/BadCat/HOTCHOCOLATE.htm |title=B |website=Badcatrecords.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref> with keyboardist Larry Ferguson joining the band in the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp2/features/top5/hot_chocolate.shtml |title=Top of the Pops 2 \u2013 Top 5 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=24 September 2014 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref> The band was originally named \"Hot Chocolate Band\" by Mavis Smith, who worked for the [[Apple Corps]] press office. This was quickly shortened first to \"The Hot Chocolate\" and then to \"Hot Chocolate\" by [[Mickie Most]]. By 1970 the band's line-up had changed again to include Harvey Hinsley and Tony Connor (who was also a member of [[Audience (band)|Audience]] at the time) replacing De Allie and King respectively.<ref name=\"badcatrecords1\"/>\n\nHot Chocolate started their recording career making a [[reggae]] version of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", but frontman Errol Brown was told he needed permission. He was contacted by [[Apple Records]], discovered that Lennon liked his version, and the group was subsequently signed to Apple Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/377/errol_brown_a_fondent_farewell/ |title=ERROL BROWN: A Fondent Farewell |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> The link was short-lived as [[the Beatles]] were starting to break up; and the Apple connection soon ended.\n\nLater in 1970 Hot Chocolate, with the help of record producer Mickie Most, began releasing tracks that became hits, such as \"[[Love Is Life]]\", \"[[Emma (song)|Emma]]\", \"[[You Could Have Been a Lady]]\" (a US and Canadian hit for [[April Wine]]), and \"I Believe in Love\". All those releases were on the [[Rak Records|Rak]] record label, owned by Most. Brown and bassist Tony Wilson wrote most of their original material, and also provided hits for [[Herman's Hermits]], \"Bet Yer Life I Do\", [[Julie Felix]], \"Heaven is Here\", and [[Mary Hopkin]], \"Think About Your Children\".\n \nGradually the band started to become [[UK Singles Chart]] regulars. One of the hits from this period, \"[[Brother Louie (Hot Chocolate song)|Brother Louie]]\", featured a guest spoken vocal from [[Alexis Korner]].\n\n==Success==\nIt was in the [[disco]] era of the mid-1970s that Hot Chocolate became a big success. A combination of high production standards, the growing confidence of the main songwriting team of Wilson and Brown, and tight vocal [[harmonies]] enabled them to secure further big hits such as \"You Sexy Thing\" and \"[[Every 1's a Winner (song)|Every 1's a Winner]]\", which were also US hits, peaking at No. 3 (1976) and No. 6 (1979), respectively. \"Every 1's a Winner\" featured a distinctive distorted guitar riff by Harvey Hinsley using a [[Roland GR-500]]. After Wilson's departure for a solo career, that included a 1976 album ''I Like Your Style'', Brown assumed all songwriting duties. Wilson was initially replaced by Brian Satterwhite; before Satterwhite departed the band and Olive switched to bass as his primary instrument.<ref name=\"badcatrecords1\"/>\n\nIn 1977, after 15 hits, they finally reached [[Chart-topper|Number One]] with \"[[So You Win Again]]\". It was one of the few of their recordings that was not written, at least partly, by Brown.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles\"/> The track was a [[Russ Ballard]] composition.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles\"/>\n\nThe band became the only group, and one of just three acts, that had a hit in every year of the 1970s in the UK charts (the other two being [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Diana Ross]]).<ref name=\"British Hit Singles\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2001\n| title= British Hit Singles\n| edition= 14th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 0-85156-156-X\n| page= 47}}</ref><ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\">{{cite book\n| first= Jo\n| last= Rice\n| year= 1982\n| title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd \n| location= Enfield, Middlesex\n| isbn= 0-85112-250-7\n| page= 184}}</ref>\nThe band eventually had at least one hit, every year, between 1970 and 1984.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> \n\nThe band continued well into the 1980s, and clocked up another big hit record: \"[[It Started with a Kiss (song)|It Started with a Kiss]]\", in 1982, which reached Number 5 in the UK. In all, the group charted 25 [[UK Top 40]] hit singles.

The Asian side is usually not considered as Estambol, however the expression ''la civdad de Estambol'' would encompass the boundaries of the present-day city.

However, many languages also preserve other, traditional names. Greeks continue to call the city Constantinople (\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 ''Konstantinupoli'' in Modern Greek) or simply \"The City\" (\u03b7 \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 ''i Poli''). Languages that use forms based on ''Stamboul'' include [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] (though the alternative form of ''Istambu\u0142'' is also universally accepted and employed in many translations), [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The Albanian form is ''Stamboll''; the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] form is ''Estambul''; the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] form is ''Istambul'', with an ''m'' instead of an ''n''; the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] form is ''Isztambul'' with an extra ''z'' because if it was omitted, Hungarians would mispronounce the name as \"Ishtanbul\". [[Armenian language|Armenian]] uses ''Bolis'', based on the Greek ''Poli(s)'' 'City'. [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] preserves the old Norse name ''Mikligar\u00f0ur'', though the form ''Istanb\u00fal'' is generally used. In [[Slovene language|Slovene]] ''Carigrad'' is still largely used and often preferred over the official name.<ref>Seznam tujih imen v slovenskem jeziku. Geodetska uprava Republike Slovenije.

The inhabitants are called ''Estambul\u00ed'' or ''Estambull\u00ed''.<ref name=Nehama />\n\n===Hebrew===\nIn Hebrew, the city was sometimes referred to as \"Kushtandina\" {{Hebrew|\u05e7\u05d5\u05e9\u05d8\u05e0\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4}}, and sometimes \"Kushtandina Rabati\" {{Hebrew|\u05e7\u05d5\u05e9\u05d8\u05e0\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9}}, literally, Great Kushtandina, or shortened to \"Kushta\" {{Hebrew|\u05e7\u05d5\u05e9\u05d8\u05d0}}, probably due to a distorted pronunciation of the Judaeo-Spanish ''Kostandina''. This usage was common among non-Sephardic Jews until the early 20th century; however, in present-day [[Israel]] it has virtually disappeared, replaced by the Hebrew transliteration of the Turkish \"Istanbul\" ({{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d8\u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05dc}}).\n\n===Chinese===\n* Lumi city \u9b6f\u8ff7\u57ce (Lumi \u9b6f\u8ff7 is the Chinese pronunciation of [[R\u00fbm]] or Rumi) during the [[Ming dynasty]]\n* Wulumu \u52d9\u9b6f\u6728 (originates from [[R\u00fbm]] or Rumi), during the [[Qing dynasty]]\n* Gongsidangdinebole \u62f1\u65af\u7576\u5e95\u8a25\u4f2f\u52d2 during the [[Qing dynasty]]\n* Kangsitanyinuoge'er \u5eb7\u601d\u5766\u8cbd\u8afe\u683c\u723e during the [[Qing dynasty]]\n* Junshitandingbao \u541b\u58eb\u5766\u4e01\u5821 modern transcription of Constantinople, used when referring to the city in a historical sense\n\nPresent-day Chinese uses transcriptions of the name Istanbul (Yisitanbu'er \u4f0a\u65af\u5766\u5e03\u5c14 or Yisitanbao \u4f0a\u65af\u5766\u5821) when referring to the modern city.\n\n==Modern languages==\n{{further|Names of European cities in different languages: I-L#I}}\nMost modern Western languages have adopted the name ''Istanbul'' for the modern city during the 20th century, following the current usage in the Turkish Republic. However, many languages also preserve other, traditional names. Greeks continue to call the city Constantinople (\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 ''Konstantinupoli'' in Modern Greek) or simply \"The City\" (\u03b7 \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 ''i Poli''). Languages that use forms based on ''Stamboul'' include [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] (though the alternative form of ''Istambu\u0142'' is also universally accepted and employed in many translations), [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The Albanian form is ''Stamboll''; the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] form is ''Estambul''; the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] form is ''Istambul'', with an ''m'' instead of an ''n''; the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] form is ''Isztambul'' with an extra ''z'' because if it was omitted, Hungarians would mispronounce the name as \"Ishtanbul\". [[Armenian language|Armenian]] uses ''Bolis'', based on the Greek ''Poli(s)'' 'City'. [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] preserves the old Norse name ''Mikligar\u00f0ur'', though the form ''Istanb\u00fal'' is generally used. In [[Slovene language|Slovene]] ''Carigrad'' is still largely used and often preferred over the official name.<ref>Seznam tujih imen v slovenskem jeziku. Geodetska uprava Republike Slovenije.
