Taking place at least twice during the year via the league fixtures, this cross-town rivalry has extended to the [[Hazfi Cup]], as well as in minor tournaments and friendlies. The largest victory belongs to Persepolis with winning 6\u20130.\n\n== History ==\nThe first derby match between the teams took place on April 5, 1968, at [[Shiroudi Stadium|Amjadieh Stadium]], where the game finished as a scoreless draw. At the time, Esteghlal was known as Taj SC. Both clubs were relatively young but Persepolis had a solid fan base, because of its close association to the once popular [[Shahin FC|Shahin]] club. The rivalry between Shahin and Taj was transferred to its current stage when the Shahin club had to cease operations due to poor relations with the [[IRIFF|IFF]].\n\nOver time, the rivalry became more heated and club fans began attaining collective identities. By the mid-1970s Persepolis was seen as a working class club, while Taj was viewed as a club close to the ruling establishment and supported by the upper class of Iranian society. Persepolis fans outnumbered Esteghlal fans by large numbers at the time.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of the matches, fan violence has occurred several times. In minor cases, fans break chairs or throw garbage at the field, but in some cases, fans have stormed the field of play, physical fights between opposing teams and fans have broken out, and public property has been destroyed.\n\nEver since 1995, federation officials have invited foreign [[Referee (association football)|referees]] to officiate the game to ease fan and player suspicions of referee bias. This occurred after the events of the 38th derby (see below).\n\n[[Azadi Stadium]] has been the stadium where most of the matches took place, but [[Amjadieh Stadium]] (now Shiroudi) in Tehran, [[Azadi Stadium]] in [[Tehran]] and [[Sahand Stadium]] in [[Tabriz]] have all hosted the game at least once.\n\n[[Hassan Rowshan]] from [[Esteghlal F.C.]], at the age of 18 years and 357 days is yet the youngest player ever who has scored a goal in the Tehran derby. He scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win against [[Persepolis F.C.]] on May 25, 1974.\n[[Ali Alipour]], at the age of 19 years and 185 days, became the youngest [[Persepolis F.C.]] player ever to score in Tehran derby. He scored the only goal in their 1\u20130 victory on May 15, 2010.\n\n== Notable matches ==\n* '''Persepolis 0 \u2013 Taj 3 (February 6, 1970)''' \u2013 The game score was 0\u20131 in favor of Taj until the 82nd minute when the Persepolis players left the field to protest against the match officials. The football federation later declared Esteghlal the winner by a score of 3\u20130.\n* '''Persepolis 0 \u2013 Taj 3 (January 17, 1971)''' \u2013 The game was tied 1\u20131 until the 75th minute when the Persepolis players left the field to protest against the match officials after several decisions went Esteghlal's way. The football federation later declared Taj the winner by a score of 3\u20130. This was the second time this occurred in two years.\n* '''Persepolis 4 \u2013 Taj 1 (February 4, 1972)''' \u2013 This was Persepolis's first win in the derby match, which was also a Goalfull match.\n* '''Persepolis 6 \u2013 Taj 0 (September 7, 1973)''' \u2013 Persepolis's best ever result in Tehran derby. Being beaten by 6 goals of their old Rivals and enemies  was so shameful for Esteghlal. [[Homayoun Behzadi]] hattricked, [[Iraj Soleimani]] Scored twice and another goal scored by [[Hossein Kalani]].\n* '''Esteghlal 1 \u2013 Persepolis 0 (October 7, 1983)''' \u2013 Iranian television broadcaster [[IRIB]] did not air the match so a large number of fans flocked to Azadi Stadium. An estimated 128,000 entered the 100,000-capacity stadium. So many fans were in attendance that some were forced to climb the metal base of the stadium floodlights. None of the derby matches to this date have had a higher attendance and mostly likely never will as the 2002 renovations of the stadium reduced its capacity.\n* '''Esteghlal 0(2)  \u2013 Persepolis 0(4)  (March 1989)''' \u2013 This is one of few times the two clubs have met each other in the [[Hazfi Cup]]. The match finished scoreless in regulation time, and extra-time was eventless. Persepolis beat Esteghlal 4\u20132 in penalty shootouts to advance to the next stage in the Hazfi Cup.\n\n[[File:Taj vs. Persepolis, Aryamehr Stadium, Tehran, Persia, May 1975.jpg|thumb|TAJ defender Saeed Baghvardani comes to the rescue of goalkeeper [[Nasser Hejazi]] when he heads out a humdinger by Persepolis striker [[Safar Iranpak]] (fourth left). Aryamehr [Azadi] Stadium, Tehran, May 1975.]]\n\n* '''Esteghlal 3 \u2013 Persepolis  0 (January 20, 1995)''' \u2013 In the 38th derby Persepolis was leading in the match by a score of 2\u20130 until the last 10 minutes of the match. Esteghlal scored 2 goals in quick succession, including one which was a penalty. This angered the Persepolis fans and players who felt the referee was biased towards Esteghlal. Persepolis fans stormed the field, and many fights broke out on the pitch between fans and players. After this match it was decided that Iranian referees will no longer be used for the derby.\n* '''Persepolis 2 \u2013 Esteghlal 2 (December 29, 2000)''' \u2013 The game was extremely sensitive as [[Mehdi Hasheminasab]] had left Persepolis in the off-season for Esteghlal. [[Behrouz Rahbarifar]] opened up the scoring in minute 56, while [[Mohammad Navazi]] tied the game up at the 67th minute. Many thought the game would be over when Hasheminasab scored a late goal at minute 86, but [[Ali Karimi]] saved Persepolis scoring a goal at minute 89 to please the red fans. During the game Esteghlal's goalkeeper [[Parviz Broumand]] and Persepolis striker [[Payan Rafat]] were constantly insulting each other. This eventually led to Broumand punching Rafat in the face and giving him a black eye. A massive fight broke out between the players. After the match hooligans went on a rampage. They completely destroyed 250 city buses and damaged many shops.  Three players from each side were arrested along with 60 fans for their behavior.\n* '''Esteghlal 3 \u2013 Persepolis 2 (February 25, 2005)''' \u2013 After a scoreless draw at halftime Esteghlal opened the scoreline 68 minutes with a goal from [[Reza Enayati]]. Persepolis responded by two goals [[Sheys Rezaei]] in the 74th minute and another by [[Sohrab Entezari]] in the 77th minute. Persepolis players and fans believed they have earned the win and Esteghlal fans begin to leave the stadium. Shortly after the goal by Entezari, [[Mahmoud Fekri]] scored an equalizer just 6 minutes later. Esteghlal soon put everything they have into the attack and in the 93rd minute it paid off with a header by [[Pirouz Ghorbani]] hitting the back of the Persepolis net.\n* '''Persepolis 2 \u2013 Esteghlal 1 (November 3, 2006)''' \u2013 One of the most important derby matches for the two teams. Both teams' chances of winning the league were very unlikely so the two desperately wanted to win so one would finish above the other. [[Amir Hossein Sadeghi]] broke the deadlock with a header in the 16th minute to make it 1\u20130 to Esteghlal. Six minutes later, Esteghlal goalkeeper [[Mehdi Rahmati]] charged out of his goal to clear the ball for a corner to Persepolis. However, he lost his concentration and took a long time to return to his net resulting in [[Mehrzad Madanchi]] curling one in for Persepolis from the corner of the pitch and making the score 1\u20131 at half-time. The match was very open in the second half and finally in the 71st minute, [[Mehrdad Oladi]] broke through and chipped [[Mehdi Rahmati]] to win the game for Persepolis 2\u20131. Later on that season, Persepolis finished 3rd in the league, one place above Esteghlal who finished 4th.\n* '''Esteghlal 1 \u2013 Persepolis 1 (February 13, 2009)''' \u2013 Going into this derby the four previous meetings between the rivals had ended in 2\u20131 and Esteghlal has won the game . However all the speculations regarding possible match-fixing started after this game. Esteghlal was winning the game when substitute [[Ali Alizadeh]] late into stoppage time and what did look deliberately played a handball and gifted away a penalty-kick. [[Maziar Zare]] scored the equalizer and the game finished in yet another 1\u20131 draw. From this match after using international referees for 14 years, the Iranian federation decided to use Iranian referees in Tehran derbies again.\n* '''Persepolis 2 \u2013 Esteghlal 1 (February 3, 2010)''' \u2013 Before this derby, six straight derby games between the two had finished 1\u20131. Many fans{{Who|date=November 2010}} were claiming that the matches had been fixed to avoid having a losing team. Both teams had the same owner, a fact that obviously added fuel to the fire. Prior to this game, the two teams had a several year-long tradition of eating dinner together on the evening before the games, a tradition which did not take place ahead of this very tense game. Much to many fans' expectations this game was also about to end in a 1\u20131 draw before [[Karim Bagheri]] scored a screamer from 35 yards late in the game to win the match 2\u20131 for Persepolis.\n* '''Esteghlal 1 \u2013 Persepolis 0 (October 15, 2010)''' \u2013 The match was tied late in the game when Esteghlal got a counterattack and captain [[Farhad Majidi]] scored the winning goal in the 91st minute.\n* '''Esteghlal 3 \u2013 Persepolis 0 (December 9, 2011)''' \u2013 The first meeting of the two teams in the Hazfi Cup in over a decade, the match was tied 0\u20130 at the end of regulation time leading to overtime. In over time Esteghlal dominated the game scoring three goals claiming their 24th win in the derby and their fourth consecutive competitive win (only considering  [[Persian Gulf Pro League]] and the [[Hazfi Cup]]) for Esteghlal over their city rivals. Indeed, the match 73 in the chart below happened almost one month before this match (which is match 74) and was a draw. This derby was the largest goal margin in 14 years and the largest Esteghlal win in over 30 years.\n* '''Esteghlal 2 \u2013 Persepolis 3 (February 2, 2012)''' \u2013 After losing four times in a row (but only considering  [[Persian Gulf Pro League]] and the [[Hazfi Cup]], i.e. matches 69\u201371 and 73, match 72 being a draw), Persepolis and its fans were desperate for a win over their blue rivals. Head coach [[Mustafa Denizli]] had returned to the reds for the second half of the season and had previously experienced victory over Esteghlal back in 2006. Persepolis found themselves 2\u20130 down yet again and had [[Mehrdad Oladi]] very harshly sent off for what was seen as just a foul. Mazloumi and blues fans were beginning celebrations of yet another victory over their rivals as Persepolis fans began to leave the stadium when suddenly newly signed forward [[Eamon Zayed]] bagged a goal back for the reds in the 82nd minute. Persepolis were lifted by this goal and Zayed immediately connected with [[Mehdi Mahdavikia]]'s excellent cross a minute later and levelled the score to 2\u20132 with a fine header. The last five minutes of the game was very open with Persepolis looking more lively and in the 92nd minute of the match, [[Hossein Badamaki]]'s cross found Zayed yet again and the Libyan striker turned his defender and finished brilliantly to round off a historic hat-trick and great win for Persepolis and its fans.\n* '''Persepolis 4 \u2013 Esteghlal 2 (April 15, 2016)''' \u2013 This derby was highly anticipated and vital for both teams as they were competing for the top spot in the [[Iran Pro League]] table. Persepolis came into this match with an excellent form and were regarded as favourites to win; however, Esteghlal was in 2nd place above their archrival on goal difference. In a highly entertaining and end-to-end game, the red-clad Persepolis netted twice in each half to beat the blue-shirted Esteghlal 4\u20132 in their 82nd derby in Tehran on a rainy Friday and be the new [[Iran Pro League]] table-topper in the 26th week. The league's top scorer [[Mehdi Taremi]] (2), [[Ramin Rezaeian]], [[Mohsen Mosalman]] scored for the reds; [[Jaber Ansari]], [[Omid Ebrahimi]] (penalty) scored for the blues. After Red's captain [[Hadi Norouzi]] had died earlier in the season due to a heart attack in his sleep, Persepolis players and fans labelled the scoreline in reference to Norouzi's shirt number of 24.\n* '''Esteghlal 3 \u2013 Persepolis 2 (February 2, 2017)''' \u2013 After five years of unbeaten derbies, Persepolis lost in a dramatic match. Persepolis had conceded only five goals in 20 previous league matches but in this game, Esteghlal scored three goals in the first half and shocked the Persepolis players and fans. The struggling match finished with a 3\u20132 result after several quarrels in which [[Mehdi Rahmati]] (Esteghlal goalkeeper) has been sent off by the referee.<div style=\"font-size:100%\">\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n=== Matches ===\n{{Main|List of Tehran Derby matches}}\n\n=== Head to head ===\nAs of 22 September 2019, there have been 85 competitive first-class meetings between the two teams since the first league meeting in 1969.

Taking place at least twice during the year via the league fixtures, this cross-town rivalry has extended to the [[Hazfi Cup]], as well as in minor tournaments and friendlies. The largest victory belongs to Persepolis with winning 6\u20130.\n\n== History ==\nThe first derby match between the teams took place on April 5, 1968, at [[Shiroudi Stadium|Amjadieh Stadium]], where the game finished as a scoreless draw. At the time, Esteghlal was known as Taj SC. Both clubs were relatively young but Persepolis had a solid fan base, because of its close association to the once popular [[Shahin FC|Shahin]] club. The rivalry between Shahin and Taj was transferred to its current stage when the Shahin club had to cease operations due to poor relations with the [[IRIFF|IFF]].\n\nOver time, the rivalry became more heated and club fans began attaining collective identities. By the mid-1970s Persepolis was seen as a working class club, while Taj was viewed as a club close to the ruling establishment and supported by the upper class of Iranian society. Persepolis fans outnumbered Esteghlal fans by large numbers at the time.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of the matches, fan violence has occurred several times. In minor cases, fans break chairs or throw garbage at the field, but in some cases, fans have stormed the field of play, physical fights between opposing teams and fans have broken out, and public property has been destroyed.\n\nEver since 1995, federation officials have invited foreign [[Referee (association football)|referees]] to officiate the game to ease fan and player suspicions of referee bias. This occurred after the events of the 38th derby (see below).\n\n[[Azadi Stadium]] has been the stadium where most of the matches took place, but [[Amjadieh Stadium]] (now Shiroudi) in Tehran, [[Azadi Stadium]] in [[Tehran]] and [[Sahand Stadium]] in [[Tabriz]] have all hosted the game at least once.\n\n[[Hassan Rowshan]] from [[Esteghlal F.C.]], at the age of 18 years and 357 days is yet the youngest player ever who has scored a goal in the Tehran derby. He scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win against [[Persepolis F.C.]] on May 25, 1974.\n[[Ali Alipour]], at the age of 19 years and 185 days, became the youngest [[Persepolis F.C.]] player ever to score in Tehran derby. He scored the only goal in their 1\u20130 victory on May 15, 2010.\n\n== Notable matches ==\n* '''Persepolis 0 \u2013 Taj 3 (February 6, 1970)''' \u2013 The game score was 0\u20131 in favor of Taj until the 82nd minute when the Persepolis players left the field to protest against the match officials. The football federation later declared Esteghlal the winner by a score of 3\u20130.\n* '''Persepolis 0 \u2013 Taj 3 (January 17, 1971)''' \u2013 The game was tied 1\u20131 until the 75th minute when the Persepolis players left the field to protest against the match officials after several decisions went Esteghlal's way. The football federation later declared Taj the winner by a score of 3\u20130. This was the second time this occurred in two years.\n* '''Persepolis 4 \u2013 Taj 1 (February 4, 1972)''' \u2013 This was Persepolis's first win in the derby match, which was also a Goalfull match.\n* '''Persepolis 6 \u2013 Taj 0 (September 7, 1973)''' \u2013 Persepolis's best ever result in Tehran derby. Being beaten by 6 goals of their old Rivals and enemies  was so shameful for Esteghlal. [[Homayoun Behzadi]] hattricked, [[Iraj Soleimani]] Scored twice and another goal scored by [[Hossein Kalani]].\n* '''Esteghlal 1 \u2013 Persepolis 0 (October 7, 1983)''' \u2013 Iranian television broadcaster [[IRIB]] did not air the match so a large number of fans flocked to Azadi Stadium. An estimated 128,000 entered the 100,000-capacity stadium. So many fans were in attendance that some were forced to climb the metal base of the stadium floodlights. None of the derby matches to this date have had a higher attendance and mostly likely never will as the 2002 renovations of the stadium reduced its capacity.\n* '''Esteghlal 0(2)  \u2013 Persepolis 0(4)  (March 1989)''' \u2013 This is one of few times the two clubs have met each other in the [[Hazfi Cup]]. The match finished scoreless in regulation time, and extra-time was eventless. Persepolis beat Esteghlal 4\u20132 in penalty shootouts to advance to the next stage in the Hazfi Cup.\n\n[[File:Taj vs. Persepolis, Aryamehr Stadium, Tehran, Persia, May 1975.jpg|thumb|TAJ defender Saeed Baghvardani comes to the rescue of goalkeeper [[Nasser Hejazi]] when he heads out a humdinger by Persepolis striker [[Safar Iranpak]] (fourth left). Aryamehr [Azadi] Stadium, Tehran, May 1975.]]\n\n* '''Esteghlal 3 \u2013 Persepolis  0 (January 20, 1995)''' \u2013 In the 38th derby Persepolis was leading in the match by a score of 2\u20130 until the last 10 minutes of the match. Esteghlal scored 2 goals in quick succession, including one which was a penalty. This angered the Persepolis fans and players who felt the referee was biased towards Esteghlal. Persepolis fans stormed the field, and many fights broke out on the pitch between fans and players. After this match it was decided that Iranian referees will no longer be used for the derby.\n* '''Persepolis 2 \u2013 Esteghlal 2 (December 29, 2000)''' \u2013 The game was extremely sensitive as [[Mehdi Hasheminasab]] had left Persepolis in the off-season for Esteghlal. [[Behrouz Rahbarifar]] opened up the scoring in minute 56, while [[Mohammad Navazi]] tied the game up at the 67th minute. Many thought the game would be over when Hasheminasab scored a late goal at minute 86, but [[Ali Karimi]] saved Persepolis scoring a goal at minute 89 to please the red fans. During the game Esteghlal's goalkeeper [[Parviz Broumand]] and Persepolis striker [[Payan Rafat]] were constantly insulting each other. This eventually led to Broumand punching Rafat in the face and giving him a black eye. A massive fight broke out between the players. After the match hooligans went on a rampage. They completely destroyed 250 city buses and damaged many shops.  Three players from each side were arrested along with 60 fans for their behavior.\n* '''Esteghlal 3 \u2013 Persepolis 2 (February 25, 2005)''' \u2013 After a scoreless draw at halftime Esteghlal opened the scoreline 68 minutes with a goal from [[Reza Enayati]]. Persepolis responded by two goals [[Sheys Rezaei]] in the 74th minute and another by [[Sohrab Entezari]] in the 77th minute. Persepolis players and fans believed they have earned the win and Esteghlal fans begin to leave the stadium. Shortly after the goal by Entezari, [[Mahmoud Fekri]] scored an equalizer just 6 minutes later. Esteghlal soon put everything they have into the attack and in the 93rd minute it paid off with a header by [[Pirouz Ghorbani]] hitting the back of the Persepolis net.\n* '''Persepolis 2 \u2013 Esteghlal 1 (November 3, 2006)''' \u2013 One of the most important derby matches for the two teams. Both teams' chances of winning the league were very unlikely so the two desperately wanted to win so one would finish above the other. [[Amir Hossein Sadeghi]] broke the deadlock with a header in the 16th minute to make it 1\u20130 to Esteghlal. Six minutes later, Esteghlal goalkeeper [[Mehdi Rahmati]] charged out of his goal to clear the ball for a corner to Persepolis. However, he lost his concentration and took a long time to return to his net resulting in [[Mehrzad Madanchi]] curling one in for Persepolis from the corner of the pitch and making the score 1\u20131 at half-time. The match was very open in the second half and finally in the 71st minute, [[Mehrdad Oladi]] broke through and chipped [[Mehdi Rahmati]] to win the game for Persepolis 2\u20131. Later on that season, Persepolis finished 3rd in the league, one place above Esteghlal who finished 4th.\n* '''Esteghlal 1 \u2013 Persepolis 1 (February 13, 2009)''' \u2013 Going into this derby the four previous meetings between the rivals had ended in 2\u20131 and Esteghlal has won the game . However all the speculations regarding possible match-fixing started after this game. Esteghlal was winning the game when substitute [[Ali Alizadeh]] late into stoppage time and what did look deliberately played a handball and gifted away a penalty-kick. [[Maziar Zare]] scored the equalizer and the game finished in yet another 1\u20131 draw. From this match after using international referees for 14 years, the Iranian federation decided to use Iranian referees in Tehran derbies again.\n* '''Persepolis 2 \u2013 Esteghlal 1 (February 3, 2010)''' \u2013 Before this derby, six straight derby games between the two had finished 1\u20131. Many fans{{Who|date=November 2010}} were claiming that the matches had been fixed to avoid having a losing team. Both teams had the same owner, a fact that obviously added fuel to the fire. Prior to this game, the two teams had a several year-long tradition of eating dinner together on the evening before the games, a tradition which did not take place ahead of this very tense game. Much to many fans' expectations this game was also about to end in a 1\u20131 draw before [[Karim Bagheri]] scored a screamer from 35 yards late in the game to win the match 2\u20131 for Persepolis.\n* '''Esteghlal 1 \u2013 Persepolis 0 (October 15, 2010)''' \u2013 The match was tied late in the game when Esteghlal got a counterattack and captain [[Farhad Majidi]] scored the winning goal in the 91st minute.\n* '''Esteghlal 3 \u2013 Persepolis 0 (December 9, 2011)''' \u2013 The first meeting of the two teams in the Hazfi Cup in over a decade, the match was tied 0\u20130 at the end of regulation time leading to overtime. In over time Esteghlal dominated the game scoring three goals claiming their 24th win in the derby and their fourth consecutive competitive win (only considering  [[Persian Gulf Pro League]] and the [[Hazfi Cup]]) for Esteghlal over their city rivals. Indeed, the match 73 in the chart below happened almost one month before this match (which is match 74) and was a draw. This derby was the largest goal margin in 14 years and the largest Esteghlal win in over 30 years.\n* '''Esteghlal 2 \u2013 Persepolis 3 (February 2, 2012)''' \u2013 After losing four times in a row (but only considering  [[Persian Gulf Pro League]] and the [[Hazfi Cup]], i.e. matches 69\u201371 and 73, match 72 being a draw), Persepolis and its fans were desperate for a win over their blue rivals. Head coach [[Mustafa Denizli]] had returned to the reds for the second half of the season and had previously experienced victory over Esteghlal back in 2006. Persepolis found themselves 2\u20130 down yet again and had [[Mehrdad Oladi]] very harshly sent off for what was seen as just a foul. Mazloumi and blues fans were beginning celebrations of yet another victory over their rivals as Persepolis fans began to leave the stadium when suddenly newly signed forward [[Eamon Zayed]] bagged a goal back for the reds in the 82nd minute. Persepolis were lifted by this goal and Zayed immediately connected with [[Mehdi Mahdavikia]]'s excellent cross a minute later and levelled the score to 2\u20132 with a fine header. The last five minutes of the game was very open with Persepolis looking more lively and in the 92nd minute of the match, [[Hossein Badamaki]]'s cross found Zayed yet again and the Libyan striker turned his defender and finished brilliantly to round off a historic hat-trick and great win for Persepolis and its fans.\n* '''Persepolis 4 \u2013 Esteghlal 2 (April 15, 2016)''' \u2013 This derby was highly anticipated and vital for both teams as they were competing for the top spot in the [[Iran Pro League]] table. Persepolis came into this match with an excellent form and were regarded as favourites to win; however, Esteghlal was in 2nd place above their archrival on goal difference. In a highly entertaining and end-to-end game, the red-clad Persepolis netted twice in each half to beat the blue-shirted Esteghlal 4\u20132 in their 82nd derby in Tehran on a rainy Friday and be the new [[Iran Pro League]] table-topper in the 26th week. The league's top scorer [[Mehdi Taremi]] (2), [[Ramin Rezaeian]], [[Mohsen Mosalman]] scored for the reds; [[Jaber Ansari]], [[Omid Ebrahimi]] (penalty) scored for the blues. After Red's captain [[Hadi Norouzi]] had died earlier in the season due to a heart attack in his sleep, Persepolis players and fans labelled the scoreline in reference to Norouzi's shirt number of 24.\n* '''Esteghlal 3 \u2013 Persepolis 2 (February 2, 2017)''' \u2013 After five years of unbeaten derbies, Persepolis lost in a dramatic match. Persepolis had conceded only five goals in 20 previous league matches but in this game, Esteghlal scored three goals in the first half and shocked the Persepolis players and fans. The struggling match finished with a 3\u20132 result after several quarrels in which [[Mehdi Rahmati]] (Esteghlal goalkeeper) has been sent off by the referee.<div style=\"font-size:100%\">\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n=== Matches ===\n{{Main|List of Tehran Derby matches}}\n\n=== Head to head ===\nAs of 22 September 2019, there have been 85 competitive first-class meetings between the two teams since the first league meeting in 1969.

This is common practice in biology along with the description of new [[taxon|taxa]], where the voucher specimens, on which the taxonomic description is based, become the [[Type (biology)#Type specimen|type specimens]]. When the identity of a certain taxon (or a genetic sequence in the case of DNA barcoding) is in doubt, the original specimen can be re-examined to review and ideally solve the issue. Voucher specimens should be clearly labelled as such, including a permanent voucher identifier that unambiguously connects the specimen with the DNA barcode data derived from it. Furthermore, these voucher specimens should be deposited in publicly accessible repositories like [[scientific collection]]s or [[herbarium|herbaria]] to preserve them for future reference and to facilitate research involving the deposited specimens.<ref name=Agerer-eal-2000>{{cite journal |last1=Agerer |first1=Reinhard |last2=Ammirati |first2=Joe |last3=Blanz |first3=Paul |last4=Courtecuisse |first4=R\u00e9gis |last5=Desjardin |first5=Dennis E. |last6=Gams |first6=Walter |last7=Hallenberg |first7=Nils |last8=Halling |first8=Roy |last9=Hawksworth |first9=David L. |last10=Horak |first10=Egon |last11=Korf |first11=Richard P. |last12=Mueller |first12=Greg M. |last13=Oberwinkler |first13=Franz |last14=Rambold |first14=Gerhard |last15=Summerbell |first15=Richard C. |last16=Triebel |first16=Dagmar |last17=Watling |first17=Roy |date=2000 |title=Open letter to the scientific community of mycologists |journal=Applied Soil Ecology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=295\u2013298 |doi=10.1016/S0929-1393(00)00076-7 |url=https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0929139300000767?token=C590FD403AA59D5AE704E466B116B3846667B8491E04A5D23D71F83669B4F491CCBE074974F3B622A015F1680AD71660 }}</ref>\n\n==Barcode DNA markers==\n===Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) &ndash; the primary fungal barcode===\n[[File:Eucaryot rdna.png|thumb|400px|[[Tandem repeat]]s of the [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] rDNA [[Metabolic gene cluster|gene cluster]] containing the genetic sequences for the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S subunits of the [[ribosome]].

It is the first in a duology.\n\n==Plot==\nCassandra \"Cas\" Leung is at a dawn check up of her Reckoner [[Durga]], one of many genetically engineered [[sea monster]]s bred and trained by Cas' family business. The Reckoners and their trainers act as paid protection for ships passing through the dangerous [[Pacific Ocean|NeoPasific ocean]]. While checking up with Durga, Cas notes that it's making strange noises. She speaks to her mother, the lead [[biologist]] working on the Reckoner program, about this issue. Her mother suggests that her concerns are just nervousness for her first mission as Reckoner trainer. Cas begrudgingly relents.\n\nThe next day Cas boards the Nereid, a luxury [[cruise ship]] she is tasked to protect with Durga. As the days move forwards Cas grows increasingly concerned with Durga's heath, as its strange noises grow to violent tremors and the water becomes thick with its blood. Despite this, the captain of the Nereid rejects the idea of turning around. This is revealed to be a mistake when Cas wakes to news that a pirate ship was spotted approaching The Nereid. Durga, being too weak to fight the pirates, is brutally killed in front of Cas. The Nereid is then boarded by pirates, the crew is murdered, and Cas is dragged aboard the pirate ship Minnow. After a failed suicide attempt, she is brought before the captain of the Minnow, the notorious pirate Santa Elana. Santa Elana presents Cas with a Baby Reckoner, still in an embryonic sac, that she is to train for use by the Minnow against other Reckoners. Cas then becomes the ward of Swift, one of Santa Elana's [[lieutenant]]s. Swift is to make sure Cas successfully raises the Reckoner pup, and becomes situated within the Minnow's culture. An arrangement neither are pleased with.\n\nCas next faces danger when she has to undergo the complicated process of birthing the Reckoner pup from its embryonic sac, knowing that if she fails she will likely die with it. The sac is carefully cut open with the Reckoner being safely released into a small pool. With the pup born Cas spends her time either on the training deck with the Reckoner baby she names Bao, or by Swifts side. Cas and Bao are often locked in the training deck together as Cas nurtures the infant Reckoner. Cas and Swift are made similarly inseparable by the consent threat of Cas being murdered or assaulted by a pirate in Swifts absence.\n\nDespite this danger, Cas is successful in bringing Bao into adolescence, with the Reckoner now able to swim in the open ocean. The danger has also done little to stop Cas from bonding with Swift and Santa Elana's other Lieutenants. Cas is even cheered on by her captors when she rides Bao alongside The Minnow. Swift Begins assisting Cas in training Bao,  getting him to obey commands give via a LED beacon mounted on Cas' wrist. The two sharing a laugh at Cas saving Swift from almost being mauled by Bao whilst trying to feed. It is around this time Cas begines to have conflicting views of Swift, seeing her as both a captor and a guardian. A Relationship that is complicated when Cas witnesses Swift take part in a raid against a civilian ship, and is reminded again that both Swift and herself are culpable for acts of violence perpetrated by the Minnow. That see could have taken Bao and defended the ship from The Minnow. That Swift, and maybe Cas herself, were pirates. Cas and Swift's relationship stagnates over the next few weeks following the raid, with much of their time together being spent in silence while training Bao. This awkward period is broken when Swift takes Cas into the Slew, a joint gym and combat arena. Cas bests Swift in a fight and the crowd of pirates cheers her victory. A sign of Cas' acceptance in pirate society.\n\nLater, after Bao was nearly struck by The Minnow, Cas runs to check up on it. She arrives at the training deck to find one of Santa Elana's Lieutenants, Code, hovering above Bao with a Syringe of poison in his hands. Still hidden, Cas watches as Swift runs into the deck and tackles Code to the ground. Together they subdue Code and bring him to Santa Elana. They quickly realize that Code attempted to kill Bao so Santa Elana would kill Cas and then Swift, thus insuring his place as Santa Elana's Successor. Shaken from their encounter, Cas and Swift spend the night in each others company. Code is later executed by being fed to Bao, much to Cas' horror. Swift confronts Cas after she runs from the site of the execution, calling her a hypocrite for being appalled by the murder of Code by a Reckoner but not by the thousands who died at the hands of Reckoner Justice. In the ensuing fight Swift admits to caring deeply for Cas, a notion Cas rejects do to the power imbalance innate to their relationship.\n\nThe day after Cas and Swift's fight the Minnow Docks at The Flotilla, a floating city in the NeoPascific. Cas, being Swifts ward, is forced to accompany her into the city. Cas is surprised when Swift takes her to visit her families shack. After speaking with Swift's father, the two journey into the center of the Flotilla to shop. Eventually Swift leads them to a secluded rooftop where they speak about Swifts history as a pirate and being the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of her family. On their way back to the Minnow Cas is spotted by Fabian Murphey, an associate of her mother. Fabian tries to grab onto Cas, but she is pulled away by swift and the two escape the man by jumping off the Flotilla and into the ocean.\n\nBack on the ship, Santa Elana explains to her crew that Fabian will likely inform the mainland military that the Minnow has a Reckoner in its arsenal, and that they can expect an attack on their ship by the military in about three days. Cas also learns that it was fabian who supplied Santa Elana with a Reckoner pup, and is likely responsible for the death of Durga. Santa Elana gives Cas three days to make Bao combat ready and fight off the mainland attack. It takes her one day.\n\nThe first attack from the mainland comes early in the form of a squadron of [[Quadcopter|quad-copters]], which are shot down by the Minnow or swatted out of the air by Bao. Cas spends the next few hours [[working through]] her killing the quad-copter pilots. Ultimately Cas determines the killing was necessary. Later the next night Cas visits Swift at her gun position. THey have a conversation about how they feel trapped by their circumstance, that they wish they could escape poverty, and piracy. It is also on the deck at night Cas and Swift wordlessly acknowledge their mutual romantic feelings, but know they can't been in a relationship with such an imbalance of power. The next morning the whole crew of the Minnow rallies to fight the second and final mainland attack. As Cas is preparing for battle on the training deck, she says her final goodbyes to Swift, believing she will be forced to bring Bao back to the mainland after the battle. It is here the couple shares their first kiss. Cas then rides Bao into battle, killing three other Reckoners and destroying their ships, allowing for the Minnow to escape.\n\nCas and Bao eventually catch up with the Minnow, and asks for an audience with Santa Elana. Cas admits she can no longer live on the mainland, that she has become, in her heart, a pirate and asks to be taken on as one of Santa Elana's Lieutenants. Cas argues that if she lets Bao go the mainland will no longer hunt them. That she will make a good pirate, doing what ever is asked of her; except kill another Reckoner. It is at this point that Santa Elana informs Cas that Swift was the one who poisoned Durga, so a Reckoner killer is unneeded. Made numb by betrayal, Cas frees Bao by drops her Training Beacon into the ocean,  and officially joins the Minnow's crew.\n\n===Publication history===\n2016, US, Flux {{ISBN|9780738746913}}, Pub date 8 February 2016, Trade Paperback\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Moral Relativism ===\n''The Abyss Surrounds Us'' posits that neither the mainland or pirate society are wholly moral or immoral. Instead it takes a stance of [[moral relativism]]. It shows that characters from the, assumed morally bankrupt,  pirate society justify their violence as survival, and are shown to be caring people capable of morality. Similarly it shows the mainland society, which believe itself to be morally upstanding, kill innocents with Reckoners in its policing of piracy. The book ultimately posits that there is no objective standard of morality, and that morality is instead a societal construct.\n\n=== Queer Romance ===\nBoth Cas and Swift are [[lesbian]]s, with Cas mentioning having had girlfriends in the past and Swift being shown with a woman in her lap after a raid. Depiction of Cas and Swift's relationship is unique in that there is no [[homophobia]] in the future depicted in The Abyss surrounds Us, and the two women are never judged or persecuted for their homosexuality. Homosexuality, in their world, is entirely accepted and integrated into society. Their relationship is treated as a normal and uneventful phenomenon.\n\n=== Climate Change ===\nThe Abyss Surrounds Us takes place in a future society that has already experienced catastrophic [[climate change]], an event referred to as \"The Schism\", and has been altered significantly because of it. In the opening pages of the book we are give a map of the Neopasific, the Pasific ocean which has expanded deep into continents after the rapid [[Glacier|melting of glaciers]]. We also see global civil unrest and [[Anarchy|anarchism]], with many global powers such as [[United States|America]], [[China]], and [[India]] designating into smaller states. ''The Abyss Surrounds Us'' also displays the human cost of catastrophic Climate Change. Early in the book the protagonist meets and elderly man who tells her his account of the collapse of a massive [[Seawall|sea wall]] which protected [[California]] from [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]], and the millions of deaths and the hardships endured because of it. Many of those effected by the Schism would become refugees and forced to live in floating cities on the Neopasific, such as the Flotilla which Cas visits. The Abyss surrounds us could be viewed as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unmitigated climate change.\n\n==Reception==\nThe novel received a starred review from [[Kirkus Reviews]].<ref name=\"kirkus\">{{cite journal|title=THE ABYSS SURROUNDS US|journal=Kirkus Reviews|date=3 November 2015|issue=15 November 2015|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/emily-skrutskie/the-abyss-surrounds-us/|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Abyss Surrounds Us'' was a Junior Library Guild selection.\n\n==Sequel==\nA sequel, ''The Edges of the Abyss'', was published 18 April 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--Link to, but don't include, reviews of the novel and other sources-->\n\n* [http://skrutskie.com/ Emily Skrutskie (author website)]\n* [http://www.fluxnow.com/recent-releases/the-abyss-surrounds-us/ ''The Abyss Surrounds Us'' at Flux]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abyss Surrounds Us}}\n[[Category:2016 American novels]]\n[[Category:American science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:2016 science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:American young adult novels]]\n[[Category:Children's science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:Pirate books]]\n[[Category:Debut science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:2016 debut novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2016 young adult science fiction novel}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=March 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2017}}\n}}\n\n<!--Novel article template : part of the Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels-->\n{{Infobox Book <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = The Abyss Surrounds Us\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = The_Abyss_Surrounds_Us.jpg\n| image_caption = \n| author        = Emily Skrutskie\n| illustrator   = \n| cover_artist  =  \n| country       = United States\n| language      = English\n| series        = The Abyss Surrounds Us\n| subject       = <!-- Subject is not relevant for fiction -->\n| genre         = [[Science fiction]]\n| published     = 2016 ([[Flux (book publisher)|Flux]]) \n| media_type    = Print ([[Trade paper edition|Trade Paperback]])\n| pages         = 273 (Trade Paperback edition)\n| isbn          = 9780738746913 \n| oclc          = \n| preceded_by   = \n| followed_by   =The Edges of the Abyss \n| wikisource    = \n}}\n'''''The Abyss Surrounds Us''''' is a 2016 young adult [[science fiction]] novel by [[Emily Skrutskie]].

The lyrics are simple, but the love is profound. \"So many times I wish I could leave\", tells that someone in the play wants to give up, but because of a kind of power (in the play is a group of brothers working hard together) to make me persevere. The singer sang freely, which made the audience worried.\n\nSongs expressing love include \"Milk Bread\" and \"happiness walking together\". The lyrics and singing methods are sweet. The pink bubbles are next to you. You can feel the simple and lovely love between the hero and the hero without watching TV.\n\nMilk Bread sung by Yang Zi, peak at 2 on Billboard Billboard China Social Chart\nLi Xian also participated in the soundtrack title ''For the Future (Gei Wei Lai)''. The singing voice is similar to his interpretation of Han Shangyan, which is convergent and low-key, seemingly absent. Even when it comes to the climax in the play or song, it expresses everything with a calm and mature character. What attracted me to this song was the middle part of the child's voice, as if there was a kind of magic power to let each other sing courageously.

The singer sang freely, which made the audience worried.\n\nSongs expressing love include \"Milk Bread\" and \"happiness walking together\". The lyrics and singing methods are sweet.

The singing voice is similar to his interpretation of Han Shangyan, which is convergent and low-key, seemingly absent. Even when it comes to the climax in the play or song, it expresses everything with a calm and mature character.

Following the failure of de Lacy's male heirs in 1241, the Lordship was split between two great-granddaughters. One moiety, a central eastern portion, was awarded to [[Maud de Lacy, Baroness Geneville|Maud]] (de Geneville) as the [[County palatine|liberty]] of [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]]; the other moiety, comprising north-eastern and western portions, went to Maud's sister Margery (de Verdun) and in 1297 became the [[County Meath|royal county of Meath]]. The liberty and royal county were merged in 1461.

Athlone developed due to its military significance, and its strategic location on the main Dublin\u2013Galway route across the [[River Shannon]]. Mullingar gained considerable advantage from the development of the [[Royal Canal]]. The canal facilitated cheap transport of produce to Dublin, Britain and Europe. Athlone and Mullingar expanded further with the coming of the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] network in the nineteenth century.\n\nTourism in Westmeath is generally based on its many water amenities. The county lakes include [[Lough Derravaragh]], [[Lough Ennell]], [[Lough Owel]], [[Lough Lene]], [[Lough Sheelin]] and [[Lough Ree]]. Both the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]], and the Royal Canal flow through Westmeath, and the [[River Shannon]] (Ireland's key tourism waterway) has a modern inland harbour in Athlone.\n\nIn 2017 the largest employment sectors within Westmeath were:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibec.ie/IBEC/Press/PressPublicationsdoclib3.nsf/vPages/Newsroom%7Eibec-highlights-need-to-address-infrastructure-imbalance-15-02-2017/$file/Local+Economic+Indicators+2017.pdf |title=Eibic highlights |date=2017 |website=www.ibec.ie |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Athone - Mullingar section of the Dublin \u2013 Galway Greenway, along the old railway corridor between Athlone and Mullingar, was constructed in 2015. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/ourservices/tourismartsrecreation/greenway/|title=Westmeath County Council - Westmeath Royal Canal Greenway<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=westmeathcoco.ie|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\nThe Royal Canal Greenway takes tourists from the county boundary to Mullingar, and then on towards Longford. Those wishing to use the Dublin-Galway Greenway can transfer from the Royal Canal route to the old rail corridor onwards towards Athlone.\n\nThe development of industry in Westmeath has been mainly based on food processing and consumer products. Whiskey is distilled in Kilbeggan and tobacco is processed in Mullingar. The county has an extensive beef and dairy trade. In recent times, the manufacturer [[Alkermes (company)|Alkermes]] has located in Athlone. The eastern part of the county is home to commuters, many of whom work at the technology parks on the western side of [[Dublin]].\n\nMullingar is renowned for the high quality of its beef and veal. Weaned cattle from the west of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] are fattened for market on the lush [[grassland]]s of Meath and Westmeath. The cattle are also used to maintain grassland to help sustain wildlife in the areas fringing the [[Bog of Allen]].\n\nWestmeath is home to many stud farms. The plains of Westmeath, covered in calcium-rich [[marl]], contribute significantly to calcification of foal bones during their formative years. Westmeath mares are usually put into foal in spring to facilitate summer growth. Pregnancy lasts for approximately 335\u2013340 days and usually results in one foal. Horses mature when they are around four years old.\n\n==Railways==\nWestmeath also has railway infrastructure with a number of trains passing through towns in the county. The [[Dublin\u2013Westport/Galway railway line]] runs through the county, with services from [[Dublin Heuston]] to [[Galway railway station|Galway]]/[[Westport railway station, Mayo|Westport]]/[[Ballina railway station|Ballina]] inter-city train service stops at [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]], while the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]] service stops at [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]].  The line from [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]] via [[Moate railway station]] to [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]] could be reopened for trains from [[Galway railway station|Galway]] to [[Dublin Connolly]]. Other major infrastructural projects and plans for the county include [[Transport 21]].\n\n==Road transport==\nRoads are of good quality in the county. As part of the [[Transport 21]] infrastructure programme undertaken by the government, both the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4]] and [[N6 road (Ireland)|N6]] roads have been upgraded to [[motorway]] or [[dual carriageway]] standard. All towns that these roads passed through are now bypassed, such as [[Mullingar]], [[Athlone]], [[Moate]] and [[Kinnegad]]. Both [[Dublin]] and [[Galway]] are within commuting distance from Westmeath following the completion of the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6 motorway]] in December 2009.\n* [[Midlands Gateway|Midlands (ATM) Gateway]]\n* [[National Development Plan]]\n* [[Transport 21]]\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Athlone IT.jpg|thumb|The [[Athlone IT]] International Arena in [[Athlone]]]]\n\nWestmeath is an active sporting county. The [[Westmeath GAA]] senior [[Gaelic football|football]] team won the [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]], the Delaney Cup, in 2004. They also won the National Football League [[2015 National Football League (Ireland)#Division 2|Division 2]] in 2001, 2003 and 2008. The Westmeath senior [[hurling]] team has enjoyed much recent success winning the [[Christy Ring Cup]] in 2005, 2007 and 2010.\n\n[[Athlone Town F.C.]] have won the League of Ireland Championship on two occasions, in 1980 and 1982, and the [[FAI Cup]] in 1924.\n\nWestmeath Ladies won the 2011 All-Ireland Intermediate Football Championship.\n\n[[Athlone Institute of Technology]] boasts a \u20ac10 million international athletics arena, which opened in early 2013. The International Arena has a footprint of 6,818m2 and an overall building floor area of 9,715m2. Some 850 tonnes of structural steel and fifty thousand concrete blocks went into the construction of the facility, which can house two thousand spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ait.ie/internationalarena/|title=AIT International Arena|work=ait.ie|access-date=14 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118072003/http://www.ait.ie/internationalarena/|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWestmeath Snooker Ranking Tournaments officially recognised by The Republic of Ireland Billiards & Snooker Association are organised and run by St Mary's Snooker Club Bishopgate Street Mullingar.

However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

animation|computer-animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[adventure film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 56th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], co-directed by [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]] and [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]], the film introduces [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana and features the voices of [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]], [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Alan Tudyk]]. The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances. The film went on to gross over $690&nbsp;million worldwide. Along with ''[[Zootopia]]'', it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year. It received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]]: one for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and another for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[How Far I'll Go]]\").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/2017-oscar-nominations-academy-awards-nominees-1201968107/|title=Oscar Nominations: Complete List|date=January 24, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!
