The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies in order to become the ultimate pirate legend. ''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[multiplayer]] game in which players [[cooperative gameplay|cooperate]] with each other to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship. The game is described as a \"shared world adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures.\n\nThe game was first conceptualized in 2014. Rare was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, ''Sea of Thieves''{{'s}} development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]; it was also one of the earliest [[first-party]] games released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 10 million players as of January 2020. Microsoft declared the game the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) they have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game.

Joe Neate, the game's executive director, described the game as an \"improv\" comedy, and added that the game is about going \"off-script\".<ref name=\"friendliest\"/> Rare shaped the world and the game's lore to reflect players' actions, including various [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]]s to celebrate their actions or achievements. The team believed that if a narrative campaign is included, incorporating players' actions into the game's lore would become difficult.<ref name=\"friendliest\"/><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/>\n\nThe company explored different settings for the game, such as [[vampire]]s and [[dinosaur]]s, though it eventually settled on the [[piracy|pirate]] theme because it matched the game's core concept which encourages cooperation. Rare also saw less competition in the market.{{efn|Duncan elaborated that the team was thankful that they did not chose dinosaur as the setting due to the release of ''[[Ark: Survival Evolved]]'' (2017)}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/19/rare-considered-vampire-dinosaur-themes-for-sea-of-thieves-a-ign-unfiltered|title=Rare Considered Vampire, Dinosaur Themes for Sea of Thieves \u2014 IGN Unfiltered|first=Alex|last=Osborn|work=[[IGN]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The pirate theme allows players to have the freedom to do what they want in the game's world and decide freely how they want to play and behave. The team looked at various sources for inspiration, including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[Black Sails (TV series)|Black Sails]]''. Designer Mike Chapman believed a lot of parallels can be drawn between ''Sea of Thieves'' and ''[[The Goonies]]'', in which a group of friends bond together while they search for treasure, creating a journey that all of them would fondly remember.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Neate added that the game's goal was to evoke \"[a] sense of travel and exploration and discovery\".<ref name=\"voice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/17971710/sea-of-thieves-lore-forsaken-shores-cursed-sails-worldbuilding|title=Sea of Thieves\u2019 lore is surprisingly deep, silly and refreshing|first=Cass|last=Marshall|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=22 October 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The team implemented the \"infinite pirate generator\" instead of allowing players to customize their avatar as they feared that some players would create \"abominations\" that would not have fit the game's visual style.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317084/How_Rare_designed_Sea_of_Thieves_infinite_pirate_generator.php|title=How Rare designed Sea of Thieves' infinite pirate generator|first=Jack|last=Yarwood|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The game features a stylized visual style with hand-painted textures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025015/Visual-Adventures-on-Sea-of|title=Visual Adventures on 'Sea of Thieves'|work=GDC Vault|first=Ryan|last=Stevenson|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Duncan added that the team chose this painted art style because they wanted it to be \"timeless\" and reflect the  \"joyful\" and \"delightful\" game world.<ref name=\"art\"/>\n\n===Gameplay design===\n\nRare noticed that in many multiplayer games, experienced players would focus on grinding for endgame content instead of playing with other players, while novice players would worry about their progression lagging significantly behind more experienced players. Therefore, the team introduced \"horizontal progression\", in which players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank; all items have the same attributes, so endgame content would not confer gameplay bonuses to experienced players. This progression system encourages more experienced players to assist novice players when they are completing voyages, and reduce the gap between the two experience levels.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player group in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate, so that players get to encounter other players regularly but not too frequently.{{efn|Chapman estimated that a player will see another player-controlled ships every 15 minutes to half an hour.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|title=Sea of Thieves Has a Very Smart Approach to Server Size|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was designed to test the player's [[soft skills]]. Players need to exercise their [[common sense]] in order to solve the challenges: for instance, players need to learn to read maps.

Chapman described these locations of interest as the \"catalyst for stories\" which draw different players together, fostering cooperation or competition. Being attacked by [[sea monster]]s also add a layer of unpredictability to the game as these encounters are random.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming]] platforms such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchase it.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game in which players cooperate with each other.

He added that cooperation with strangers could create unforgettable experiences for players which could be deeply satisfying.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> Peter Brown from ''[[GameSpot]]'' also enjoyed coordinating with other players and goofing around, though he remarked that some players were [[trolling]] others which caused the experience to be frustrating.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Jeff Grubb from ''[[VentureBeat]]'' also enjoyed the game, saying that playing with strangers often created numerous hilarious moments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/20/sea-of-thieves-is-mesmerizing-and-hilarious/|title=Sea of Thieves is mesmerizing and hilarious|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Kyle Hilliard from ''[[Game Informer]]'' stated that each session \"results in a story\" due to the emergent gameplay, and praised Rare for successfully creating an excellent \"pirate simulator\" and \"manufacturing a digital playground that is fun to explore\".<ref name=\"GIRev\"/>  Sam Loveridge from ''[[GamesRadar]]'' likewise commented that the game is \"an anecdote generator at its very best\" due to its emergent storytelling.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Brandin Tyrrel from ''[[IGN]]'' stated that \"''Sea of Thieves'' works well when treated like a [[chat room]] or a [[party game]], where it serves as catalyst for having a good time with the people you\u2019re with\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Brandin |date=27 March 2018 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/28/sea-of-thieves-review |title=Sea of Thieves Review |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay received generally negative reviews. Devore felt that the quests were repetitive and that the world did not have a lot of interesting things to do.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> Paul Tamburro from ''[[Game Revolution]]'' agreed, remarking that the quests had little variety and did not allow room for creativity. While he praised the [[sandbox game|sandbox]] format, he felt that there were not enough secrets or stories players could discover in the world.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/> Loverdige called the voyages \"elaborated [[fetch quest]]s\". He lamented that there was no option to turn off PvP and players could not customize their own characters.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Russ Frushtick from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' remarked that misbehaving players may make the experience frustrating because PvP could never be disabled. However, he remarked that the game offered no incentive for players who wanted to engage in PvP combat.<ref name=\"Poly\"/> Hilliard felt that the game did not have enough content to keep players engaged, and remarked that the combat felt bland. Many critics commented that players would not be motivated to complete quests because only cosmetic items are unlocked.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/><ref name=\"GameRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> Tyrrel praised the ship combat, though he felt that the respawn system was too forgiving.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Christian Donlan from ''[[Eurogamer]]'' likewise called the ship combat \"thrilling\" and the general combat \"crunchy, pleasantly basic\".<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/> Tyler Wilde from ''[[PC Gamer]]'' liked exploring the shipwrecks, believing that exploration evokes a sense of discovery, though he commented that he wished more emergent events would happen in the ocean.<ref name=\"PCGRev\"/> Solo play received mixed opinions.

The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies in order to become the ultimate pirate legend. ''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[multiplayer]] game in which players [[cooperative gameplay|cooperate]] with each other to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship. The game is described as a \"shared world adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures.\n\nThe game was first conceptualized in 2014. The game was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, ''Sea of Thieves''{{'s}} development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]; it was also one of the earliest [[first-party]] games released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 10 million players as of January 2020. Microsoft declared the game the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) they have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game.

Therefore, the team introduced \"horizontal progression\", in which players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank; all items have the same attributes, so endgame content would not confer gameplay bonuses to experienced players. This progression system encourages more experienced players to assist novice players when they are completing voyages, and reduce the gap between the two experience levels.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player group in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate, so that players get to encounter other players regularly but not too frequently.{{efn|Chapman estimated that a player will see another player-controlled ships every 15 minutes to half an hour.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|title=Sea of Thieves Has a Very Smart Approach to Server Size|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was designed to test the player's [[soft skills]].

Being attacked by [[sea monster]]s also add a layer of unpredictability to the game as these encounters are random.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming]] platforms such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchase it.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game in which players cooperate with each other.
