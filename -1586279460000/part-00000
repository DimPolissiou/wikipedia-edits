As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the population was 14,750. The community of Alamo is well known for its bucolic country feel, notable residents, and its affluent lifestyle with the median home price being $1.89 million.\n\nAlamo (from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''\u00e1lamo,'' \"[[Populus|poplar]]\") was named for the poplar trees that lined San Ramon Creek.\n\nAs an unincorporated community, Alamo does not have a government of its own.  Police services are provided by the Contra Costa County Office of the Sheriff. Fire and [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] services are provided by the [[San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District]].\n\nAlamo has a median household income of $140,561 ({{as of|2011|lc=y}}).<ref>http://www.city-data.com/city/Alamo-California.html</ref>\nIn August 2007, a group of citizens launched a new initiative to incorporate the community,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/08/06/residents-of-alamo-begin-path-to-cityhood/|title=Residents of Alamo begin path to cityhood|last=Benca|first=Jeanine|date=August 6, 2007|website=East Bay Times|language=en-US|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> the latest in a series of attempts that go back to the early 1960s or before; it was defeated by referendum in March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danvilleweekly.com/story.php?story_id=5718|title=Incorporation's end|date=March 6, 2009|website=Danville Express|publisher=Danvilleweekly.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218080133/http://www.danvilleweekly.com/story.php?story_id=5718|archivedate=2010-02-18|accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> Previous failed Alamo incorporation efforts always included parts of other nearby unincorporated areas: Alamo-Danville (1964)<ref name=\"museumsrv1\">{{cite web |author=Museum of the San Ramon Valley |url=http://www.museumsrv.org/srvm_History_HomeRuleII.html |title=Museum of the San Ramon Valley&#124;History&#124;Home Rule II |publisher=Museumsrv.org |accessdate=2013-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103234445/http://www.museumsrv.org/srvm_History_HomeRuleII.html |archive-date=2013-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Alamo-Danville-San Ramon (1976).<ref name=\"museumsrv1\"/><ref>{{cite web |author=Museum of the San Ramon Valley |url=http://www.museumsrv.org/srvm_history_HomeRuleIII.html |title=Museum of the San Ramon Valley&#124;History&#124;Home Rule III |publisher=Museumsrv.org |date=1982-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103233747/http://www.museumsrv.org/srvm_history_HomeRuleIII.html |archive-date=2013-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nHumans have lived in the area for over 5,000 years. The [[Tatcan Indians]], a [[Bay Miwok]] tribe closely connected to the Saclans of [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]], lived in Alamo in the eighteenth century.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] was founded in 1797, its grazing area stretched throughout the [[San Ramon Valley]].  The Mexican land grant [[Rancho San Ramon (Pacheco-Castro)|Rancho San Ramon]] was deeded to [[Mariano Castro]] and his uncle Bartolo Pacheco in 1833. It covered modern-day [[Danville, California|Danville]] and Alamo. Castro owned the northern half, which included Alamo.\n\nIn 1843 much of the Alamo, Las Trampas and Tice Valley areas were granted to brothers Inocencio and Jos\u00e9 Romero. It was called Rancho El Sobrante de San Ramon. Because of missing title papers, the brothers lost their ranch in American courts in 1857.\n\nPioneers Mary Ann and John Jones traveled through Alamo in 1847. she provided the earliest English description of the area in her diary. Her husband stopped the wagon saying, \"Mary, look! Did you ever see anything so beautiful?\" She wrote later:\n\n<blockquote>''On every side, the valley and surrounding hills were covered with thick, velvety clover, and with wild oats standing waist high waving and rippling in the summer breeze, like the bosom of a lake.''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historycontraco00hulagoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historycontraco00hulagoog/page/n143 97]|quote=\u00a0On every side, the valley and surrounding hills were covered with thick, velvety clover, and with wild oats standing waist high waving and rippling in the summer breeze, like the bosom of a lake.|title=The History of Contra Costa County. California|last=Hulaniski|first=Frederick J.|date=1917-01-01|publisher=Elms Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe Jones family returned to Alamo in 1851, after California had become a state. John became the first postmaster in 1852 and she applied her considerable energies to schooling children and beginning a Cumberland [[Presbyterian]] church. Other early Alamo founders included David Glass, George Engelmeyer, Silas and Susanna Stone, Captain Wall, Joshua Bollinger, and James Foster.\n\nThe area was named Alamo, which comes from the Spanish word ''\u00e1lamo'', meaning \"poplar\" or \"[[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]].\" Because of its location and climate, Alamo grew quickly. An early road from the redwoods near Moraga ran through [[Tice Valley]] to Alamo, since Americans preferred [[Coast redwood|redwood]] for building materials instead of Mexican [[adobe brick]].\n\nThe Hemme, Bollinger, Jones and Stone ranches began by grazing cattle and raising wheat and other grains. In 1891 the Hemme train station was placed near today's Hemme Avenue; later it was renamed the Alamo station.\n\nEventually orchards and vineyards spread across the area. Almonds, walnuts, pears, grapes and other fruit thrived in the temperate climate. In 1873, Alamo pioneer Myron Hall grafted Persian cuttings to native [[walnut]] trees and helped start the prosperous walnut industry in Contra Costa County. This \"mother tree\" was tended for over 100 years.\n\nThe Alamo post office is the oldest continuously operated one in the valley. It was always an important community gathering place. According to longtime postmaster Bertha Linhares, when the mail was expected the men <blockquote>''sat in the post office-store in the winter \u2026 the women went into our sitting room and visited with my mother \u2026 We always heard all the news and troubles of the Alamo residents.''{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}</blockquote> Her father, brother and sister were also postmasters from 1905 to 1960.\n\n==Notable residents==\n* [[Brandon Belt]] - [[San Francisco Giants]] MLB player\n* [[Joan Buchanan]] - Former member of the [[California State Assembly]]\n* [[Steven Burd]] - [[Safeway Inc.]] supermarket president and CEO\n* [[Stephen Curry]] - [[Golden State Warriors]] [[NBA]] player\n* [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]] - [[Oakland Raiders]] Owner\n* [[David Duffield]] - CEO of [[Workday, Inc]] and currently on [[Forbes]] [[List of billionaires]]\n* [[Bret Hedican]] - former [[Anaheim Ducks]] [[NHL]] player\n* [[Greg Kent]] - ex [[American Football League|AFL]]/[[National Football League|NFL]] player for the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Oakland Raiders]] \n* [[Greg Kragen]] - ex NFL player for the [[Denver Broncos]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and [[Carolina Panthers]]\n* [[Tony La Russa]] - former MLB manager\n* [[Katherine Langford]] - Actress\n* [[Mark McGwire]] - former MLB player\n* [[Mike Moore (baseball)|Mike Moore]] - former [[Oakland Athletics]] pitcher\n* [[Jason Newsted]] - former [[Metallica]] bassist\n* [[Greg Sestero]] - Actor, star of cult classic ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'', author of ''[[The Disaster Artist]]'', raised in Alamo\n* [[Ellen Tauscher]] - Former Congresswoman for [[California's 10th congressional district]]\n* [[Bree Turner]] - Actress, currently starring on NBC's ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'', raised in Alamo\n* [[Kristi Yamaguchi]] - [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalist\n* [[Tony Eldridge]] - Film Producer, [[The Equalizer 2]], raised in Alamo.\n* [[Alan Silvestri]] - American composer and conductor known for his film and television scores.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Las Trampas Waterfall.jpg|thumb|right|A small cascade in the Las Trampas Regional Wilderness west of Alamo]]\nAlamo is located in [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]], at the northern end of the {{convert|20|mi}}-long San Ramon Valley between two [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] \u2212 the Las Trampas Ridge to the west and the [[Diablo Range]] to the east.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The city of [[San Ramon, California|San Ramon]] and the town of [[Danville, California|Danville]] are also located in this valley.

A barn fa\u00e7ade at the park entrance memorializes the park's former use as a ranch for longhorn steer with the owner being Hap Magee during the years of 1953 and 1985.\n\nBefore the cattle ranch, the site was a summer camp for San Francisco orphans, known as Camp Swain. The property was purchased in 1874 by Captain Isaac and Ann Trasker Swain on behalf of an orphanage in San Francisco. The Swains thought the children should have a warm place to go during San Francisco's damp summers. In 1911 the San Francisco Protestant Orphanage first brought their children to Camp Swain. The orphans came to the valley from 1911 to 1952, using the train and then buses. There is a drinking fountain commemorating Camp Swain with a plaque and a brick rendering of children playing.\n\nToday there are picnic facilities, children's water play area, a large meadow with a spectacular heritage oak, dog parks and off-street parking.

The [[Tatcan Indians]], a [[Bay Miwok]] tribe closely connected to the Saclans of [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]], lived in Alamo in the eighteenth century.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] was founded in 1797, its grazing area stretched throughout the [[San Ramon Valley]].  The Mexican land grant [[Rancho San Ramon (Pacheco-Castro)|Rancho San Ramon]] was deeded to [[Mariano Castro]] and his uncle Bartolo Pacheco in 1833. It covered modern-day [[Danville, California|Danville]] and Alamo. Castro owned the northern half, which included Alamo.\n\nIn 1843 much of the Alamo, Las Trampas and Tice Valley areas were granted to brothers Inocencio and Jos\u00e9 Romero. It was called Rancho El Sobrante de San Ramon. Because of missing title papers, the brothers lost their ranch in American courts in 1857.\n\nPioneers Mary Ann and John Jones traveled through Alamo in 1847. she provided the earliest English description of the area in her diary. Her husband stopped the wagon saying, \"Mary, look! Did you ever see anything so beautiful?\" She wrote later:\n\n<blockquote>''On every side, the valley and surrounding hills were covered with thick, velvety clover, and with wild oats standing waist high waving and rippling in the summer breeze, like the bosom of a lake.''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historycontraco00hulagoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historycontraco00hulagoog/page/n143 97]|quote=\u00a0On every side, the valley and surrounding hills were covered with thick, velvety clover, and with wild oats standing waist high waving and rippling in the summer breeze, like the bosom of a lake.|title=The History of Contra Costa County. California|last=Hulaniski|first=Frederick J.|date=1917-01-01|publisher=Elms Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe Jones family returned to Alamo in 1851, after California had become a state. John became the first postmaster in 1852 and she applied her considerable energies to schooling children and beginning a Cumberland [[Presbyterian]] church. Other early Alamo founders included David Glass, George Engelmeyer, Silas and Susanna Stone, Captain Wall, Joshua Bollinger, and James Foster.\n\nThe area was named Alamo, which comes from the Spanish word ''\u00e1lamo'', meaning \"poplar\" or \"[[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]].\" Because of its location and climate, Alamo grew quickly. An early road from the redwoods near Moraga ran through [[Tice Valley]] to Alamo, since Americans preferred [[Coast redwood|redwood]] for building materials instead of Mexican [[adobe brick]].\n\nThe Hemme, Bollinger, Jones and Stone ranches began by grazing cattle and raising wheat and other grains. In 1891 the Hemme train station was placed near today's Hemme Avenue; later it was renamed the Alamo station.\n\nEventually orchards and vineyards spread across the area. Almonds, walnuts, pears, grapes and other fruit thrived in the temperate climate. In 1873, Alamo pioneer Myron Hall grafted Persian cuttings to native [[walnut]] trees and helped start the prosperous walnut industry in Contra Costa County. This \"mother tree\" was tended for over 100 years.\n\nThe Alamo post office is the oldest continuously operated one in the valley. It was always an important community gathering place. According to longtime postmaster Bertha Linhares, when the mail was expected the men <blockquote>''sat in the post office-store in the winter \u2026 the women went into our sitting room and visited with my mother \u2026 We always heard all the news and troubles of the Alamo residents.''{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}</blockquote> Her father, brother and sister were also postmasters from 1905 to 1960.\n\n==Notable residents==\n* [[Brandon Belt]] - [[San Francisco Giants]] MLB player\n* [[Joan Buchanan]] - Former member of the [[California State Assembly]]\n* [[Steven Burd]] - [[Safeway Inc.]] supermarket president and CEO\n* [[Stephen Curry]] - [[Golden State Warriors]] [[NBA]] player\n* [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]] - [[Oakland Raiders]] Owner\n* [[David Duffield]] - CEO of [[Workday, Inc]] and currently on [[Forbes]] [[List of billionaires]]\n* [[Bret Hedican]] - former [[Anaheim Ducks]] [[NHL]] player\n* [[Greg Kent]] - ex [[American Football League|AFL]]/[[National Football League|NFL]] player for the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Oakland Raiders]] \n* [[Greg Kragen]] - ex NFL player for the [[Denver Broncos]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and [[Carolina Panthers]]\n* [[Tony La Russa]] - former MLB manager\n* [[Katherine Langford]] - Actress\n* [[Mark McGwire]] - former MLB player\n* [[Mike Moore (baseball)|Mike Moore]] - former [[Oakland Athletics]] pitcher\n* [[Jason Newsted]] - former [[Metallica]] bassist\n* [[Greg Sestero]] - Actor, star of cult classic ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'', author of ''[[The Disaster Artist]]'', raised in Alamo\n* [[Ellen Tauscher]] - Former Congresswoman for [[California's 10th congressional district]]\n* [[Bree Turner]] - Actress, currently starring on NBC's ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'', raised in Alamo\n* [[Kristi Yamaguchi]] - [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalist\n* [[Tony Eldridge]] - Film Producer, [[The Equalizer 2]], raised in Alamo.\n* [[Alan Silvestri]] - American composer and conductor known for his film and television scores.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Las Trampas Waterfall.jpg|thumb|right|A small cascade in the Las Trampas Regional Wilderness west of Alamo]]\nAlamo is located in [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]], at the northern end of the {{convert|20|mi}}-long San Ramon Valley between two [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] \u2212 the Las Trampas Ridge to the west and the [[Diablo Range]] to the east.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The city of [[San Ramon, California|San Ramon]] and the town of [[Danville, California|Danville]] are also located in this valley.

Young who was instrumental in preserving the charm of Alamo.\n\nHe served in 1980 as chairman of the county Planning Commission, and as a commissioner from 1977 to 1979 with the San Ramon Valley Area Planning Commission.\n\nYoung was a World War II veteran, serving in the Pacific campaign where he assisted in the evacuation of the Chinese Fifth Army from North Vietnam. He retired in 1965 from active reserve as a Navy lieutenant commander.\n\nHis participation in the Lafayette Local Government Study Committee in 1966\u201367 led to that city's incorporation in 1968. His Boulevard of Trees project replanted dying trees along Danville Boulevard in Alamo.\n\nHe was on the Tao House study committee in Danville and the steering committee for San Ramon Valley Regional Medical Center. He was an executive director for the Contra Costa County Historical Society, as well its president from 1985\u20131986 and also was a president of the Alamo Park Foundation.\n<ref>http://www.cocohistory.com/youngpark.html</ref>\n\n====Livorna Park====\n[[File:Aerial view of Livorna Park.JPG|thumb|400px|Aerial view of Livorna Park]]\nLocated at the corner of Livorna Road & Miranda Avenue, this 4.4 acre community park features a large open-air gazebo, a bocce ball court, a multi-use sports court, playground structures, large play areas, drinking fountain, restrooms, two barbecue areas, ample grassed area and off-street parking.\n\nDuring the summer months a series of concerts are held at the park in the early evenings typically over a weekend. The concerts are organized by the Alamo Municipal Advisory Committee.\n\nThe park also typically hosts a children's Easter egg hunt each year on Easter Sunday.

This 16.3 acre park has several historic structures and is managed jointly by Alamo and [[Danville, California|Danville]]. A barn fa\u00e7ade at the park entrance memorializes the park's former use as a ranch for longhorn steer with the owner being Hap Magee during the years of 1953 and 1985.\n\nBefore the cattle ranch, the site was a summer camp for San Francisco orphans, known as Camp Swain. The property was purchased in 1874 by Captain Isaac and Ann Trasker Swain on behalf of an orphanage in San Francisco. The Swains thought the children should have a warm place to go during San Francisco's damp summers. In 1911 the San Francisco Protestant Orphanage first brought their children to Camp Swain. The orphans came to the valley from 1911 to 1952, using the train and then buses. There is a drinking fountain commemorating Camp Swain with a plaque and a brick rendering of children playing.\n\nToday there are picnic facilities, children's water play area, a large meadow with a spectacular heritage oak, dog parks and off-street parking.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on November 7, 1999. This episode was written by [[Ken Keeler]] and directed by [[Brian Sheesley]]. The episode features an attack by aliens from Omicron Persei 8, when the planet's ruler [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Lrrr|Lrrr]] is outraged when the final episode of the Earth show ''Single Female Lawyer'' is interrupted by technical difficulties.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens in the year 1999, with [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]] making a [[pizza delivery]] to the control booth of [[WNYW]], New York's [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] flagship station. While there, Fry spills beer on the console (later in the episode, Amy did some research, saying it was a Coke), interrupting the broadcast of ''Single Female Lawyer'' (a spoof of ''[[Ally McBeal]]''). As the technician panics, Fry ominously states, \"Like anyone on Earth cares.\" The camera pulls back from the broadcast tower, away from Earth, and through the depths of space, settling on Omicron Persei 8, a thousand [[light-year]]s away and a thousand years later. Incensed that they do not get to see the end of the episode, the Omicronians launch an invasion fleet.\n\nBack on Earth during the year 3000, the off-duty Planet Express crew decides to take a trip to Monument Beach for [[Labor Day]], where most of the world's monuments have stood since the 27th century (thanks to the activities of New New York's [[super villain]] governor), when the Omicronians begin to invade, destroying them all one after another. [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Lrrr|Lrrr]], ruler of Omicron Persei 8, demands that the Earth produce \"the one called McNeal\". President McNeal, fearing for his own safety, orders [[Zapp Brannigan]] to lead an assault against the alien invaders, enlisting the Planet Express crew and thousands of other ships, and turning on the Robot's patriotism circuits, to Bender's annoyance. However, they only succeed in blowing up the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] while suffering heavy casualties: the fleet stands no chance against the ''actual'' alien mother ship. After the attack predictably ends in disaster, Earth's government hands over President McNeal. Lrrr announces that he is the wrong McNeal, and vaporizes the President. Lrrr shows the world a photo of the McNeal they want, and Fry recognizes her as Jenny McNeal, the title character of ''Single Female Lawyer''. The Omicronians demand the broadcast of the television show, or they will destroy the Earth. Unfortunately, most videotapes were destroyed in 2443, during the [[Second Coming|second coming]] of [[Jesus]]. The Planet Express crew decides to fake the show in order to save the world.\n\nFry's script comes up short (he explains that it took an hour to write, so he assumed it would take an hour to perform), and Leela (as Jenny), is forced to improvise. She proposes marriage to the judge (played by [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]]). During a commercial break, an aggravated Fry tells Leela that people do not watch [[Television|TV]] for clever and unexpected situations because they get scared and confused by the unfamiliar and the unexpected. Lrrr makes a public statement backing up Fry's assertion. Fry quickly writes an ending where the judge ([[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]]) dies (even though the judge did not know what was going on and tests his pulse), leaving Jenny McNeal as a single female lawyer again. The Omicronians, satisfied with the ending, give the episode a C+, saying the show was good enough for them to spare the planet, though not good enough for them to give humans their secret to [[immortality]] (Fry blames it on Zoidberg \"overacting\"). The episode ends with the aliens departing Earth to watch a 1000-year-old [[Jay Leno]] monologue and Fry stating that the secret to a successful television show is that [[Reset button technique|everything ends up back to normal at the end of each episode]]. Ironically, the camera pans out to a view of New New York burning in ruins.\n\n==Production==\nThe broadcast of \"Single Female Lawyer\" takes 1000 years to reach Omicron Persei 8, but the Omicronians are able to travel to Earth in much less time.  In the DVD commentary for this episode, executive producer David X. Cohen explains that the writers had decided that the [[speed of light]] would be increased in the future and that massive particles would still not be able to travel faster than light, but that electromagnetic waves from the past would still travel at their regular, lower speed.<ref name=\"DXC WAA\">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X|date=1999|title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode \"When Aliens Attack\"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}</ref>\n\nThough his coworker [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Linda|Linda]] appears, [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Morbo|Morbo]] is absent from this episode. According to the DVD commentary, the writers try to avoid putting Morbo into episodes that have a large focus on aliens. They also discuss the similarities of Morbo's voice to that of Lrrr.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe title of the episode is a parody of ''[[When Animals Attack!]]'', which was a popular Fox program in the mid-1990s.\n\nAs the Planet Express ship intercepts the Omicron mothership, Fry compares himself to [[Uhura]], [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]], and [[Xena]] while dressed as Red Squadron leader Garven Dreis from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. The following scene then parodies the [[Battle of Yavin]] from ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]].''\n\nThe show ''Single Female Lawyer'', as well as Earth President McNeal, is a reference to ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', a popular contemporary Fox program.\n\nThe spaceship destroying the [[White House]] at Monument Beach is a reference to the film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''.<ref name=\"Drawn To TV\">{{cite book|last=Booker|first=M.

Club]]'' gave the episode an A-, stating, \"The show\u2019s writers aren\u2019t trying to change the way people approach the medium. They\u2019re just finding humor by acknowledging truths that typically go unspoken.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on November 7, 1999. This episode was written by [[Ken Keeler]] and directed by [[Brian Sheesley]]. The episode features an attack by aliens from Omicron Persei 8, when the planet's ruler [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Lrrr|Lrrr]] is outraged when the final episode of the Earth show ''Single Female Lawyer'' is interrupted by technical difficulties.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens in the year 1999, with [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]] making a [[pizza delivery]] to the control booth of [[WNYW]], New York's [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] flagship station. While there, Fry spills beer on the console (later in the episode, Amy did some research, saying it was a Coke), interrupting the broadcast of ''Single Female Lawyer'' (a spoof of ''[[Ally McBeal]]''). As the technician panics, Fry ominously states, \"Like anyone on Earth cares.\" The camera pulls back from the broadcast tower, away from Earth, and through the depths of space, settling on Omicron Persei 8, a thousand [[light-year]]s away and a thousand years later. Incensed that they do not get to see the end of the episode, the Omicronians launch an invasion fleet.\n\nBack on Earth during the year 3000, the off-duty Planet Express crew decides to take a trip to Monument Beach for [[Labor Day]], where most of the world's monuments have stood since the 27th century (thanks to the activities of New New York's [[super villain]] governor), when the Omicronians begin to invade, destroying them all one after another. [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Lrrr|Lrrr]], ruler of Omicron Persei 8, demands that the Earth produce \"the one called McNeal\". President McNeal, fearing for his own safety, orders [[Zapp Brannigan]] to lead an assault against the alien invaders, enlisting the Planet Express crew and thousands of other ships, and turning on the Robot's patriotism circuits, to Bender's annoyance. However, they only succeed in blowing up the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] while suffering heavy casualties: the fleet stands no chance against the ''actual'' alien mother ship. After the attack predictably ends in disaster, Earth's government hands over President McNeal. Lrrr announces that he is the wrong McNeal, and vaporizes the President. Lrrr shows the world a photo of the McNeal they want, and Fry recognizes her as Jenny McNeal, the title character of ''Single Female Lawyer''. The Omicronians demand the broadcast of the television show, or they will destroy the Earth. Unfortunately, most videotapes were destroyed in 2443, during the [[Second Coming|second coming]] of [[Jesus]]. The Planet Express crew decides to fake the show in order to save the world.\n\nFry's script comes up short (he explains that it took an hour to write, so he assumed it would take an hour to perform), and Leela (as Jenny), is forced to improvise. She proposes marriage to the judge (played by [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]]). During a commercial break, an aggravated Fry tells Leela that people do not watch [[Television|TV]] for clever and unexpected situations because they get scared and confused by the unfamiliar and the unexpected. Lrrr makes a public statement backing up Fry's assertion. Fry quickly writes an ending where the judge ([[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]]) dies (even though the judge did not know what was going on and tests his pulse), leaving Jenny McNeal as a single female lawyer again. The Omicronians, satisfied with the ending, give the episode a C+, saying the show was good enough for them to spare the planet, though not good enough for them to give humans their secret to [[immortality]] (Fry blames it on Zoidberg \"overacting\"). The episode ends with the aliens departing Earth to watch a 1000-year-old [[Jay Leno]] monologue and Fry stating that the secret to a successful television show is that [[Reset button technique|everything ends up back to normal at the end of each episode]]. Ironically, the camera pans out to a view of New New York burning in ruins.\n\n==Production==\nThe broadcast of \"Single Female Lawyer\" takes 1000 years to reach Omicron Persei 8, but the Omicronians are able to travel to Earth in much less time.  In the DVD commentary for this episode, executive producer David X. Cohen explains that the writers had decided that the [[speed of light]] would be increased in the future and that massive particles would still not be able to travel faster than light, but that electromagnetic waves from the past would still travel at their regular, lower speed.<ref name=\"DXC WAA\">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X|date=1999|title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode \"When Aliens Attack\"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}</ref>\n\nThough his coworker [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Linda|Linda]] appears, [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Morbo|Morbo]] is absent from this episode. According to the DVD commentary, the writers try to avoid putting Morbo into episodes that have a large focus on aliens. They also discuss the similarities of Morbo's voice to that of Lrrr.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe title of the episode is a parody of ''[[When Animals Attack!]]'', which was a popular Fox program in the mid-90's.\n\nAs the Planet Express ship intercepts the Omicron mothership, Fry compares himself to [[Uhura]], [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]], and [[Xena]] while dressed as Red Squadron leader Garven Dreis from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. The following scene then parodies the [[Battle of Yavin]] from ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]].''\n\nThe show ''Single Female Lawyer'', as well as Earth President McNeal, is a reference to ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', a popular contemporary Fox program.\n\nThe spaceship destroying the [[White House]] at Monument Beach is a reference to the film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''.<ref name=\"Drawn To TV\">{{cite book|last=Booker|first=M.

Club]]'' gave the episode an A-, stating, \"The show\u2019s writers aren\u2019t trying to change the way people approach the medium. They\u2019re just finding humor by acknowledging truths that typically go unspoken. Sure, the last shot shows a city laid to waste by the invaders, in direct contradiction to the usual 'and everything was the same in the end' conclusion that Fry is praising, but it\u2019s not like the destruction is going to carry over into next week.

In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring [[Xerox art|xeroxed]] black-and-white pictures and/or writing.<ref name=billzebub/> This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.<ref name=billzebub/> Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and Emperor's ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').\n\n=== Production ===\nThe earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings would often be done in homes or basements,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} giving their recordings a distinctive \"lo-fi\" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.<ref name=chronicles/><ref name=murdermusic/> Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more \"raw\" or \"cold\".<ref name=murdermusic/> A well-known example of this approach is on the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]], a band who Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says \"represent the [[DIY]] aspect of black metal.\"<ref name=murdermusic/> In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]]. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience.<ref name=murdermusic/> Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, \"Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction\".<ref name=guardian/>\n\n== History ==\nThe conventional history of black metal is that pioneers like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]] were part of a \"first wave\", and that a \"second wave\" was begun by the early Norwegian scene, especially by Mayhem vocalist, Dead's suicide;<ref>Enrico Ahlig: [http://www.metal-hammer.de/news/meldungen/article299447/marduk-gitarrist-besitzt-leichenteile-von-dead.html ''Marduk-Gitarrist besitzt Leichenteile von Dead''], 5 June 2012, accessed on 9 January 2013.</ref> Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide;{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=39}} and Darkthrone's album ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]''.<ref name=paganfront>[[Hendrik M\u00f6bus]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Jon \"Metalion\" Kristiansen: [https://www.vice.com/read/saga-true-black-metal-v15n5 ''The Saga of True Norwegian Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Wolf-R\u00fcdiger M\u00fchlmann: ''Darkthrone''.

They were often [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]] bands.<ref name=sam/><ref>{{cite book |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |title=Metal: The Definitive Guide |page=208}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"black metal\" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982). Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards,<ref name=murdermusic/> the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.\n\nAnother major influence on black metal was the Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. [[Quorthon]]), created \"the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal\".{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that later became a common trait.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return\u2026\u2026]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988).

In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring [[Xerox art|xeroxed]] black-and-white pictures and/or writing.<ref name=billzebub/> This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.<ref name=billzebub/> Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and Emperor's ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').\n\n=== Production ===\nThe earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings would often be done in homes or basements,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} giving their recordings a distinctive \"lo-fi\" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.<ref name=chronicles/><ref name=murdermusic/> Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more \"raw\" or \"cold\".<ref name=murdermusic/> A well-known example of this approach is on the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]], a band who Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says \"represent the [[DIY]] aspect of black metal.\"<ref name=murdermusic/> In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]]. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience.<ref name=murdermusic/> Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, \"Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction\".<ref name=guardian/>\n\n== History ==\nThe conventional history of black metal is that pioneers like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]] were part of a \"first wave\", and that a \"second wave\" was begun by the early Norwegian scene, especially by Mayhem vocalist, Dead's suicide;<ref>Enrico Ahlig: [http://www.metal-hammer.de/news/meldungen/article299447/marduk-gitarrist-besitzt-leichenteile-von-dead.html ''Marduk-Gitarrist besitzt Leichenteile von Dead''], 5 June 2012, accessed on 9 January 2013.</ref> Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide;{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=39}} and Darkthrone's album ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]''.<ref name=paganfront>[[Hendrik M\u00f6bus]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Jon \"Metalion\" Kristiansen: [https://www.vice.com/read/saga-true-black-metal-v15n5 ''The Saga of True Norwegian Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Wolf-R\u00fcdiger M\u00fchlmann: ''Darkthrone''.

Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards,<ref name=murdermusic/> the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.\n\nAnother major influence on black metal was the Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. [[Quorthon]]), created \"the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal\".{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that later became a common trait.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return\u2026\u2026]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988).

However, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and rather used Satanic themes to provoke controversy or gain attention. One of the few exceptions was [[Mercyful Fate]] singer and [[Church of Satan]] member [[King Diamond]], whom [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls \"one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for [[shock value]]\".{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Gorgoroth by Christian Misje.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Video shoot for \"Carving a Giant\" by Gorgoroth, which features mock crucifixions]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, many Norwegian black-metallers presented themselves as genuine Devil worshippers.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} They attacked the Church of Satan for its \"freedom and life-loving\" views;<ref name=killyourself2>Esa Lahdenpera: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html ''Northern Black Metal Legends''].

The school's [[Hyde Park campus of the Culinary Institute of America|primary campus]] is located in [[Hyde Park, New York]], with branch campuses in [[St. Helena, California|St. Helena]] and [[Napa, California]], [[San Antonio, Texas]], and the [[Republic of Singapore]]. The college, which was the first to teach culinary arts in the United States, offers associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees, and has the largest staff of [[American Culinary Federation]] Certified Master Chefs. The CIA also offers continuing education for professionals in the hospitality industry as well as conferences and consulting services. In addition to professional education, the college also offers recreational classes for non-professionals. The college operates student-run restaurants on their four U.S. campuses.\n\nThe school was founded in 1946 in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], as a vocational institute for returning veterans of [[World War II]]. With a growing student body, the school purchased a former [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic novitiate|novitiate]] in Hyde Park in 1970, which remains its central campus. The school began awarding associate degrees in 1971, bachelor's degrees in 1993, and master's degrees in 2018.

The largest complaints, laid out in a thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum.<ref name=\"2008protest\"/> Immediately after the faculty's vote of no confidence, the board of trustees unanimously voted to their confidence and support of Ryan and extended his contract.<ref name=\"CHE\"/>\n\nFollowing the approval, students began organizing a protest, including creating several student groups on Facebook, and hanging \"Fire Tim Ryan\" signs in dorm rooms. The students described further complaints including the administration's close ties with the corporate food industry and less challenging kitchen tasks, such as frying frozen waffle fries. In May the school prevented the campus newspaper, ''La Papillote'', from writing about the issue, which prompted its editor to resign. The school later apologized and reportedly allowed a full report in the paper's next issue. Ryan held that he was trying to prevent students from being involved in a conflict between the faculty and administration.<ref name=\"2008protest\"/>\n\nOn April 23, 2013, about 90 students held a [[walkout]] and protest in objection to a recent trend of declining enforcement of educational standards. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen experience, has varied from three months to a year, and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front-of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their student loan debt written on them.<ref name=\"ExpcProtest\"/>\n<!--In 2013, complaints included no off-hours cafeteria, lowered admission/grad standards, expanded too rapidly, produces less skillful/work ethic chefs. provost said adm standards rose<ref name=\"ExpcProtest\"/>-->\n\nOn September 27, 2015, the Culinary Craft Association (CCA), a union at the school, protested the CIA's outsourcing of jobs. Previously in 2015, the school had terminated 40 jobs in its dishwashing, stewarding, and cleaning departments, forcing them to reapply for jobs with cut wages and benefits. Later that year, CCA joined the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU) Local 200United, members of which also protested in September 2015. The school was also demanding CCA cut ties with SEIU in order for the union workers to keep their jobs.<ref name=\"CCA2015\"/><ref name=\"CCA2017b\"/> On September 22, 2017, CCA held another protest; 17 of the 45 workers represented in the union are scheduled to be laid off and replaced by workers of LCS Facility Group.

She was the victim of an attempted rape on the CIA's campus. The victim and attacker were scheduled to work together at an on-campus restaurant soon after the attack, and after the victim's complaint, she nevertheless had to work with him that subsequent weekend. After they were scheduled together again, she quit working there. At the same time, one of the school's deans informed her the school dismissed her complaint as the attack did not violate the school's harassment, sexual misconduct and discrimination policy. The victim said that the school also mentioned that because the victim escaped, no violation occurred.<ref name=\"Rape\">{{cite news|last1=Judkis|first1=Maura|last2=Heil|first2=Emily|title=Rape in the storage room.

The CIA also offers continuing education for professionals in the hospitality industry as well as conferences and consulting services. In addition to professional education, the college also offers recreational classes for non-professionals. The college operates student-run restaurants on their four U.S. campuses.\n\nThe school was founded in 1946 in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], as a vocational institute for returning veterans of [[World War II]]. With a growing student body, the school purchased a former [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic novitiate|novitiate]] in Hyde Park in 1970, which remains its central campus. The school began awarding associate degrees in 1971, bachelor's degrees in 1993, and master's degrees in 2018. Additional campuses were opened in the following years: St. Helena in 1995, Texas in 2008, Singapore in 2010, and Napa in 2016.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Culinary Institute of America}}\n[[File:1.

Students in the program can choose from two tracks in the program: Restaurant/Foodservice or Food Product/Concept.<ref name=\"Masters\"/> The CIA also offers a Master of Professional Studies degree in Wine Management, a 30-week program at the Greystone campus in California's [[Napa Valley]].<ref name=\"MastersWine\"/> The program emphasizes how wine makes its way to tables and explores a variety of beverages and food pairings.\n\n===The Food Business School===\nIn spring 2015, the institute opened the Food Business School for executive and graduate education in business. The school's faculty are instructors at [[UC Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]], and [[UC Davis]]; some were chefs, restaurant consultants and other food industry employees.<ref name=\"FBS\"/> The school involves three separate programs: online classes, 3- or 4-day sessions at the Greystone campus or other areas in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]],<ref name=\"FTfbs\"/> and multiple-month-long programs.<ref name=\"FBS\"/> Tuition varies from $400 for a single course to $4,000 for an \"intensive retreat\". The program only offers certificates, but not graduate degrees. The school's dean and founder is William Rosenzweig.<ref name=\"WPfbs\"/>\n\n=== Other programs and courses ===\nThe college's New York campus also offers continuing education courses and certificate programs. The California and Texas campuses run several continuing education classes, and the California campus also has programs for wine professionals. A variety of programs for food enthusiasts are run as well at all the U.S. campuses. The college partnered with [[Epicurious]] in running an online cooking school featuring a variety of culinary classes.<ref name=\"Epicurious\"/> The CIA also runs a certification program called ProChef, a program to recognize culinary and academic skills, as well as familiarity with business practices.<ref name=\"ProChef\"/>\n\nThe CIA's California campus also runs an accelerated culinary program for students who already have at least four years of experience in foodservice. The program includes the same basic classes as the school's associate degree programs, however the accelerated program does not include the externship requirement, and several classes are run with a faster-paced curriculum or including more in-depth material.<ref name=\"Programs\"/>\n\n=== Conferences and summits ===\nThe CIA holds various conferences, summits, and retreats for professionals in food and related industries, focusing on topics such as world cuisines, flavor development, health and wellness, nutrition science, volume foodservice, sustainability, and technology.<ref name=\"Conferences\"/> These include the Worlds of Flavor International Conference and Festival <ref name=\"WOF\"/>; Menus of Change <ref name=\"MOC\"/>; Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives <ref name=\"HKHL\"/>; and the Global Plant-Forward Culinary Summit <ref name=\"Plant-forward\"/>.\n\n=== Libraries and museums ===\n[[File:CIA Hyde Park Hilton Library 01.jpg|thumb|The Conrad N.

The newsletter aims to improve the relationship between the school and its alumni by providing information of interest about the college, its alumni, and students; covering of major issues and events concerning the college; and featuring the leadership and contributions of the school's alumni.<ref name=\"miseenplace\"/>\n\n''La Papillote'', the school's student newspaper, was established in 1979. The newspaper's stated purpose is to report the news of the institution to the students and other members of the campus community. The newspaper also examines contemporary issues of the industry and other topics. The school's student life department oversees production of the newspaper and fills its editor-in-chief position, which is held by a current student. The paper uses submissions from students, chefs, and outside professionals.<ref name=\"Papillote\"/>\n\n== Branding ==\nThe CIA has a [[brand licensing]] program that sells branded products for foodservice operations and households, and it also publishes cookbooks for professional and home use. The school's general cookbook, ''The Professional Chef'' also has an interactive [[iPad]] edition that [[PC Magazine]] called \"a new frontier for books.\"<ref name=\"PCMag\"/> During the late 1990s, the CIA produced the [[PBS]] television show ''Cooking Secrets of the CIA''.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>\n\n== Events ==\nBeginning in April 2007, the school hosts the CIA Leadership Awards event annually to honor people for success and achievements in the foodservice industry. The events are organized as fundraising dinners, with CEOs and other prominent members of the industry attending, sponsoring student scholarships.<ref name=\"AA\"/> At the Leadership Awards event, the school issues the Augie Award, named for [[Auguste Escoffier]], the French chef and restaurateur who popularized and modernized French cuisine.

The largest complaints, laid out in a thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum.<ref name=\"2008protest\"/> Immediately after the faculty's vote of no confidence, the board of trustees unanimously voted to their confidence and support of Ryan and extended his contract.<ref name=\"CHE\"/>\n\nFollowing the approval, students began organizing a protest, including creating several student groups on Facebook, and hanging \"Fire Tim Ryan\" signs in dorm rooms. The students described further complaints including the administration's close ties with the corporate food industry and less challenging kitchen tasks, such as frying frozen waffle fries. In May the school prevented the campus newspaper, ''La Papillote'', from writing about the issue, which prompted its editor to resign. The school later apologized and reportedly allowed a full report in the paper's next issue. Ryan held that he was trying to prevent students from being involved in a conflict between the faculty and administration.<ref name=\"2008protest\"/>\n\nOn April 23, 2013, about 90 students held a [[walkout]] and protest in objection to a recent trend of declining enforcement of educational standards. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen experience, has varied from three months to a year, and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front-of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their student loan debt written on them.<ref name=\"ExpcProtest\"/>\n<!--In 2013, complaints included no off-hours cafeteria, lowered admission/grad standards, expanded too rapidly, produces less skillful/work ethic chefs. provost said adm standards rose<ref name=\"ExpcProtest\"/>-->\n\nOn September 27, 2015, the Culinary Craft Association (CCA), a union at the school, protested the CIA's outsourcing of jobs. Previously in 2015, the school had terminated 40 jobs in its dishwashing, stewarding, and cleaning departments, forcing them to reapply for jobs with cut wages and benefits. Later that year, CCA joined the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU) Local 200United, members of which also protested in September 2015. The school was also demanding CCA cut ties with SEIU in order for the union workers to keep their jobs.<ref name=\"CCA2015\"/><ref name=\"CCA2017b\"/> On September 22, 2017, CCA held another protest; 17 of the 45 workers represented in the union are scheduled to be laid off and replaced by workers of LCS Facility Group. The workers are in grounds-keeping, recycling and painting at the school, where most of them have been employed for at least 20 years.<ref name=\"CCA2017a\"/><ref name=\"CCA2017b\"/><ref name=\"CCA2017c\"/>\n\nIn November 2017, soon after the [[Weinstein effect]] began and because of it, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported on a student who criticized the school's handling of sexual assault. She was the victim of an attempted rape on the CIA's campus. The victim and attacker were scheduled to work together at an on-campus restaurant soon after the attack, and after the victim's complaint, she nevertheless had to work with him that subsequent weekend. After they were scheduled together again, she quit working there. At the same time, one of the school's deans informed her the school dismissed her complaint as the attack did not violate the school's harassment, sexual misconduct and discrimination policy. The victim said that the school also mentioned that because the victim escaped, no violation occurred.<ref name=\"Rape\">{{cite news|last1=Judkis|first1=Maura|last2=Heil|first2=Emily|title=Rape in the storage room.

The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition.  By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]], [[Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Russia]], a joint bid from [[Belgium\u2013Netherlands 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Belgium and Netherlands]], and a joint bid from [[Portugal\u2013Spain 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Portugal and Spain]]. Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from [[Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Australia]], [[Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Japan]], [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar]], [[South Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|South Korea]], and the [[United States 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|United States]]. [[Indonesian 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Indonesia's bid]] was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons.\n\nOn 2 December 2010, Russia and Qatar were selected as the locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups respectively. The selection process involved several controversies. Two members of the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] had their voting rights suspended following allegations that they would accept money in exchange for votes. More allegations of vote buying arose after Qatar's win was announced. Eleven of the 22 committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments have been fined, suspended, banned for life or [[2015 FIFA corruption case|prosecuted]] for corruption.\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 2007, FIFA ended its continental rotation policy. Instead countries that are members of the same confederation as either of the last two tournament hosts are ineligible, leaving [[Confederation of African Football|Africa]] ineligible for 2018 and [[CONMEBOL|South America]] ineligible for both 2018 and 2022.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm |work=BBC News |date= 29 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2007|title= Fifa abandons World Cup rotation | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071030043406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm| archivedate= 30 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Other factors in the selection process include the number of suitable stadiums, and their location across candidate nations. Voting is done using a multiple round [[exhaustive ballot]] system whereby the candidate receiving the fewest votes in each round is eliminated until a single candidate is chosen by the majority.\n\n=== Rotation policy ===\n[[File:World Map FIFA2.svg|thumb|FIFA's confederations]]\n\nFollowing the selection of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] hosts, FIFA had decided on a policy for determining the hosts of future editions. The six world confederations\u2014roughly corresponding to continents\u2014would rotate in their turn of providing bids, for a specific edition, from within their member national associations. This system was used only for the selection of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] (South Africa) and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] (Brazil) hosts, open only to [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] and [[CONMEBOL]] members, respectively.\n\nIn September 2007, the rotation system came under review, and a new system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm |title= New rotation proposal |work=BBC Sport |date= 25 September 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011155608/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm| archivedate= 11 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in [[Zurich]], Switzerland by FIFA's Executive Committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid could have come from [[CONCACAF]], [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[UEFA]], or [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]], as Africa and South America are ineligible.<ref name=iht>{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/australia-can-host-world-cup/2005/09/17/1126750168444.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title= Australia can host World Cup |first= Matthew |last= Hall |date= 18 September 2005|accessdate=22 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071022203403/http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/australia-can-host-world-cup/2005/09/17/1126750168444.html| archivedate= 22 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Likewise, no CONMEBOL member could have made a 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.\n\nThe United States, the last non-European candidate in the 2018 bidding cycle, withdrew its bid for that year; hence the 2018 tournament will have to be held in UEFA. This in turn meant that CONMBEBOL and UEFA were ineligible for 2022.\n\n== Voting procedure ==\nFor both the 2018 and 2022 editions of the World Cup, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] voted to decide which candidate should host the tournament. The multiple round exhaustive ballot system was used to determine the tournament host. All eligible members of the FIFA Executive Committee had one vote. The candidate country that received the fewest votes in each round was eliminated until a single candidate was chosen by the majority. In the event of a tied vote, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] would have had the deciding vote. There are twenty-four members on the Committee, but two of those were suspended due to accusations of [[Electoral fraud|selling votes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/12/02/football.world.cup.2018.2022/index.html?hpt=T1|title=Russia, Qatar win race to host World Cups as FIFA spreads its vision|date=2 December 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Schedule ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Notes{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n|-\n|15 January 2009\n|Applications formally invited\n|-\n|2 February 2009\n|Closing date for registering intention to bid\n|-\n|16 March 2009\n|Deadline to submit completed bid registration forms\n|-\n|14 May 2010\n|Deadline for submission of full details of bid\n|-\n|19 July 2010\n|Four-day individual applicant inspections begin\n|-\n|17 September 2010\n|Inspections end<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/bidders/2018/newsid=1210979.html |publisher=FIFA.com |title=FIFA receives bidding documents for 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729211034/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/bidders/2018/newsid%3D1210979.html |archivedate=29 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n|2 December 2010\n|FIFA appointed hosts for 2018 and 2022 World Cups\n|}\n\n== 2018 bids ==\nEleven bids were submitted in March 2009 covering thirteen nations, with two joint bids: Belgium-Netherlands and Portugal-Spain.

The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition.  By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]], [[Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Russia]], a joint bid from [[Belgium\u2013Netherlands 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Belgium and Netherlands]], and a joint bid from [[Portugal\u2013Spain 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Portugal and Spain]]. Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from [[Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Australia]], [[Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Japan]], [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar]], [[South Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|South Korea]], and the [[United States 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|United States]]. [[Indonesian 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Indonesia's bid]] was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons.\n\nOn 2 December 2010, Russia and Qatar were selected as the locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups respectively. The selection process involved several controversies. Two members of the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] had their voting rights suspended following allegations that they would accept money in exchange for votes. More allegations of vote buying arose after Qatar's win was announced. Eleven of the 22 committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments have been fined, suspended, banned for life or [[2015 FIFA corruption case|prosecuted]] for corruption.\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 2007, FIFA ended its continental rotation policy. Instead countries that are members of the same confederation as either of the last two tournament hosts are ineligible, leaving [[Confederation of African Football|Africa]] ineligible for 2018 and [[CONMEBOL|South America]] ineligible for both 2018 and 2022.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm |work=BBC News |date= 29 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2007|title= Fifa abandons World Cup rotation | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071030043406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm| archivedate= 30 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Other factors in the selection process include the number of suitable stadiums, and their location across candidate nations. Voting is done using a multiple round [[exhaustive ballot]] system whereby the candidate receiving the fewest votes in each round is eliminated until a single candidate is chosen by the majority.\n\n=== Rotation policy ===\n[[File:World Map FIFA2.svg|thumb|FIFA's confederations]]\n\nFollowing the selection of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] hosts, FIFA had decided on a policy for determining the hosts of future editions. The six world confederations\u2014roughly corresponding to continents\u2014would rotate in their turn of providing bids, for a specific edition, from within their member national associations. This system was used only for the selection of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] (South Africa) and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] (Brazil) hosts, open only to [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] and [[CONMEBOL]] members, respectively.\n\nIn September 2007, the rotation system came under review, and a new system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm |title= New rotation proposal |work=BBC Sport |date= 25 September 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011155608/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm| archivedate= 11 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in [[Zurich]], Switzerland by FIFA's Executive Committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid could have come from [[CONCACAF]], [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[UEFA]], or [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]], as Africa and South America are ineligible.<ref name=iht>{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/australia-can-host-world-cup/2005/09/17/1126750168444.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title= Australia can host World Cup |first= Matthew |last= Hall |date= 18 September 2005|accessdate=22 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071022203403/http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/australia-can-host-world-cup/2005/09/17/1126750168444.html| archivedate= 22 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Likewise, no CONMEBOL member could have made a 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.\n\nThe United States, the last non-European candidate in the 2018 bidding cycle, withdrew its bid for that year; hence the 2018 tournament will have to be held in UEFA. This in turn meant that CONMBEBOL and UEFA were ineligible for 2022.\n\n== Voting procedure ==\nFor both the 2018 and 2022 editions of the World Cup, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] voted to decide which candidate should host the tournament. The multiple round exhaustive ballot system was used to determine the tournament host. All eligible members of the FIFA Executive Committee had one vote. The candidate country that received the fewest votes in each round was eliminated until a single candidate was chosen by the majority. In the event of a tied vote, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] would have had the deciding vote. There are twenty-four members on the Committee, but two of those were suspended due to accusations of [[Electoral fraud|selling votes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/12/02/football.world.cup.2018.2022/index.html?hpt=T1|title=Russia, Qatar win race to host World Cups as FIFA spreads its vision|date=2 December 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Schedule ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Notes{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n|-\n|15 January 2009\n|Applications formally invited\n|-\n|2 February 2009\n|Closing date for registering intention to bid\n|-\n|16 March 2009\n|Deadline to submit completed bid registration forms\n|-\n|14 May 2010\n|Deadline for submission of full details of bid\n|-\n|19 July 2010\n|Four-day individual applicant inspections begin\n|-\n|17 September 2010\n|Inspections end<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/bidders/2018/newsid=1210979.html |publisher=FIFA.com |title=FIFA receives bidding documents for 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729211034/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/bidders/2018/newsid%3D1210979.html |archivedate=29 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n|2 December 2010\n|FIFA appointed hosts for 2018 and 2022 World Cups\n|}\n\n== 2018 bids ==\nEleven bids were submitted in March 2009 covering thirteen nations, with two joint bids: Belgium-Netherlands and Portugal-Spain.

The film revolutionized movie-making in the [[gangster genre]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Barry |first=Langford |title=Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond |year=2005 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=134}}</ref> and was adored by the public and critics alike. ''The Godfather'' won three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (shared with [[Mario Puzo]]).\n\n''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after [[Billy Wilder]]) to be so honored three times for the same film. ''[[The Conversation]]'', which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. His next film, ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the [[Vietnam War]]. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.\n\nHis best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (both 1983), the crime dramas ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), and the horror film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992).

It was on the sets of ''Dementia 13'' that he met his future wife [[Eleanor Coppola|Eleanor Jessie Neil]].\n\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (''Pilma, Pilma'') written by a UCLA student.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola\" /> This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]]. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966) and ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'' (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the [[David Benedictus]] novel ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> This movie earned critical acclaim; [[Geraldine Page]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], as well as a [[Golden Globe Award]], for her performance. It also earned Coppola his Master of Fine Arts Degree from [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" /><ref name=\"UCLATFT\">[http://www.tft.ucla.edu/about/executive-board/francis-ford-coppola/ \"Profile: Francis Ford Coppola\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716061348/http://www.tft.ucla.edu/about/executive-board/francis-ford-coppola/ |date=July 16, 2014 }}, UCLA School of Theater, Film, and television, Executive Board</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''You're a Big Boy Now'', Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical ''[[Finian's Rainbow (1968 film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'', starring [[Petula Clark]] in her first American film and veteran [[Fred Astaire]]. Producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, although Clark received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him [[George Lucas]], who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ''[[The Rain People]]'' in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> The film won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of [[zoetrope]]s from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring [[Europe]], Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [[American Zoetrope|Zoetrope Studio]] became a warehouse in [[San Francisco]] on Folsom Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |title=A Brief History of American Zoetrope |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925031247/http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of [[HDTV]].

The group included [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Brian De Palma]], [[Terrence Malick]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Woody Allen]], [[William Friedkin]], [[Philip Kaufman]] and [[George Lucas]].<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redroom.com/blog/steven-robert-travers/the-kid-stays-in-the-picture |title=The kid stays in the Picture |accessdate=October 21, 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091642/http://www.redroom.com/blog/steven-robert-travers/the-kid-stays-in-the-picture |archivedate=May 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====''Patton'' (1970)====\n{{Main|Patton (film)}}\nCoppola co-wrote the script for ''Patton'' in 1970 along with [[Edmund H. North]]. This earned him his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] that [[Patton (film)#Opening|the opening scene]] would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |title=An Interview with Francis Ford Coppola |publisher=achievement.org |access-date=April 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323144840/https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |archive-date=March 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{Quotation| I wrote the script of ''Patton''.

And I remember very vividly this long, kind of being raked over the coals for this opening scene.}}\"When the title role was offered to George C. Scott, he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. 'Scott is the one who resurrected my version,' says Coppola.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Gene |title=Godfather The Intimate Francis Ford Coppola |year=2004 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-2304-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil/page/32 32] |chapter=1 Point of Departure|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil |url=https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil/page/32}}</ref>\nThe movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military \"Pep Talk\" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an [[Motion picture rating system#Restricted|R rating]]; in the opening monolog, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when criticizing ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Over the years, this opening monolog has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows.\n\n====''The Godfather'' (1972)====\n{{Main|The Godfather}}\nThe release of ''The Godfather'' in 1972 was a milestone in cinema. The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the [[Corleone family]], received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], which he shared with Mario Puzo and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s: for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. However, Coppola faced several difficulties while filming ''The Godfather''. He was not [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount's]] first choice to direct the movie; Italian director [[Sergio Leone]] was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2bo9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA215 |year=1981 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7100-0503-8 |page=215}}</ref> [[Peter Bogdanovich]] was then approached but he also declined the offer and made ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the lead had he accepted the film. According to [[Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, \"smell the spaghetti\". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.<ref>''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' (2002), documentary film about Evans' life</ref>\n\nThere was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture\". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).<ref name=\"Look\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]</ref> Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" />{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.}}\nAfter it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on the initial [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list by the [[American Film Institute]]. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web |work=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |title=Citizen Kane Stands the test of Time |access-date=October 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AtMtzUZ?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] believed that ''The Godfather'' was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast.<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm Michael Herr for Vanity Fair] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207071514/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm |date=December 7, 2009 }} \"He watched ''The Godfather'' again the night before and was reluctantly suggesting for the tenth time that it was possibly the greatest movie ever made and certainly the best-cast.\"</ref>\n\n====''The Conversation'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Conversation}}\nCoppola's next film, ''The Conversation'', further cemented his position as one of the most talented [[Auteur theory|auteurs]] of Hollywood.<ref name=\"Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time\" /> The movie was partly influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966)<ref>Murch in Ondaatje, 2002, p. 152</ref> and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for ''The Conversation'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[1968 United States Presidential election|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n====''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}\nDuring the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''. However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, \"I don't think that script was [actually] made.\"<ref>Commentary track, ''The Godfather'', ''The Godfather Collection'' 2008 Blu-ray, ASIN: B000NTPDSW,</ref>\n\n====''The Godfather Part II'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II}}\n\nCoppola shot ''The Godfather Part II'' parallel to ''The Conversation'' and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in [[Technicolor]]. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work\", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |date=July 28, 2003 |author=Stax |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115731/http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n''The Godfather Part II'' is ranked as the No. 1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's \"50 Best Movies of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |title=50 Greatest Movies (on TV and VIDEO) by TV Guide Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331175627/http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> and is ranked at No. 7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |title=100 Greates Movies of All Time by Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331185517/http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film is also featured on movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s list of the \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |title=100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century Part 2 by Leonard Maltin |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015115555/http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |archive-date=October 15, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> as well as Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105031018/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was also featured on [[Sight & Sound]]'s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |title=10 Best Films of All Time Polls by Sight & Sound Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118083212/http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |archive-date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCoppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year.

The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including [[typhoon]]s, nervous breakdowns, the firing of [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Martin Sheen]]'s heart attack, and extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels.

North]]. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the [[gangster genre]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Barry |first=Langford |title=Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond |year=2005 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=134}}</ref> and was adored by the public and critics alike. ''The Godfather'' won three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (shared with [[Mario Puzo]]).\n\n''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after [[Billy Wilder]]) to be so honored three times for the same film. ''[[The Conversation]]'', which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. His next film, ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the [[Vietnam War]]. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.\n\nHis best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (both 1983), the crime dramas ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), and the horror film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992). A number of Coppola's relatives and children have become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right: his sister is the actress [[Talia Shire]]; his daughter [[Sofia Coppola]] and granddaughter [[Gia Coppola]] are directors, and the actors [[Jason Schwartzman]] and [[Nicolas Cage]] are his nephews.

He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for ''[[The Bellboy and the Playgirls]]'', also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by [[Roger Corman]] and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, ''Nebo zovyot'', which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled ''[[Battle Beyond the Sun]]'', released in 1962.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on ''[[Tower of London (1962 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1962), sound man for ''[[The Young Racers]]'' (1963) and associate producer of ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' (1963).<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" />\n\nWhile on location in Ireland for ''The Young Racers'' in 1963, Corman, ever alert for an opportunity to produce a decent movie on a shoestring budget, persuaded Coppola to make a low-budget horror movie with funds left over from the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" /> Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night, incorporating elements from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock's]] ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'',<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\">{{cite web |title=Francis Ford Coppola Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org |publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]] |url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |access-date=April 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323144840/https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |archive-date=March 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the result impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights),<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" /> Coppola directed in a period of nine days ''[[Dementia 13]]'', his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a [[cult film]] among horror buffs. It was on the sets of ''Dementia 13'' that he met his future wife [[Eleanor Coppola|Eleanor Jessie Neil]].\n\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (''Pilma, Pilma'') written by a UCLA student.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola\" /> This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]]. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966) and ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'' (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the [[David Benedictus]] novel ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> This movie earned critical acclaim; [[Geraldine Page]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], as well as a [[Golden Globe Award]], for her performance. It also earned Coppola his Master of Fine Arts Degree from [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" /><ref name=\"UCLATFT\">[http://www.tft.ucla.edu/about/executive-board/francis-ford-coppola/ \"Profile: Francis Ford Coppola\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716061348/http://www.tft.ucla.edu/about/executive-board/francis-ford-coppola/ |date=July 16, 2014 }}, UCLA School of Theater, Film, and television, Executive Board</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''You're a Big Boy Now'', Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical ''[[Finian's Rainbow (1968 film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'', starring [[Petula Clark]] in her first American film and veteran [[Fred Astaire]]. Producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, although Clark received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him [[George Lucas]], who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ''[[The Rain People]]'' in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> The film won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of [[zoetrope]]s from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring [[Europe]], Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [[American Zoetrope|Zoetrope Studio]] became a warehouse in [[San Francisco]] on Folsom Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |title=A Brief History of American Zoetrope |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925031247/http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of [[HDTV]].

The group included [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Brian De Palma]], [[Terrence Malick]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Woody Allen]], [[William Friedkin]], [[Philip Kaufman]] and [[George Lucas]].<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redroom.com/blog/steven-robert-travers/the-kid-stays-in-the-picture |title=The kid stays in the Picture |accessdate=October 21, 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091642/http://www.redroom.com/blog/steven-robert-travers/the-kid-stays-in-the-picture |archivedate=May 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====''Patton'' (1970)====\n{{Main|Patton (film)}}\nCoppola co-wrote the script for ''Patton'' in 1970 along with [[Edmund H. North]]. This earned him his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] that [[Patton (film)#Opening|the opening scene]] would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |title=An Interview with Francis Ford Coppola |publisher=achievement.org |access-date=April 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323144840/https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |archive-date=March 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{Quotation| I wrote the script of ''Patton''.

And I remember very vividly this long, kind of being raked over the coals for this opening scene.}}\"When the title role was offered to George C. Scott, he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. 'Scott is the one who resurrected my version,' says Coppola.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Gene |title=Godfather The Intimate Francis Ford Coppola |year=2004 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-2304-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil/page/32 32] |chapter=1 Point of Departure|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil |url=https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil/page/32}}</ref>\nThe movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military \"Pep Talk\" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an [[Motion picture rating system#Restricted|R rating]]; in the opening monolog, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when criticizing ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Over the years, this opening monolog has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows.\n\n====''The Godfather'' (1972)====\n{{Main|The Godfather}}\nThe release of ''The Godfather'' in 1972 was a milestone in cinema. The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the [[Corleone family]], received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], which he shared with Mario Puzo and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s: for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. However, Coppola faced several difficulties while filming ''The Godfather''. He was not [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount's]] first choice to direct the movie; Italian director [[Sergio Leone]] was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2bo9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA215 |year=1981 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7100-0503-8 |page=215}}</ref> [[Peter Bogdanovich]] was then approached but he also declined the offer and made ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the lead had he accepted the film. According to [[Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, \"smell the spaghetti\". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.<ref>''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' (2002), documentary film about Evans' life</ref>\n\nThere was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture\". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).<ref name=\"Look\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]</ref> Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" />{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.}}\nAfter it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on the initial [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list by the [[American Film Institute]]. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web |work=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |title=Citizen Kane Stands the test of Time |access-date=October 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AtMtzUZ?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] believed that ''The Godfather'' was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast.<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm Michael Herr for Vanity Fair] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207071514/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm |date=December 7, 2009 }} \"He watched ''The Godfather'' again the night before and was reluctantly suggesting for the tenth time that it was possibly the greatest movie ever made and certainly the best-cast.\"</ref>\n\n====''The Conversation'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Conversation}}\nCoppola's next film, ''The Conversation'', further cemented his position as one of the most talented [[Auteur theory|auteurs]] of Hollywood.<ref name=\"Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time\" /> The movie was partly influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966)<ref>Murch in Ondaatje, 2002, p. 152</ref> and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for ''The Conversation'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[1968 United States Presidential election|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n====''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}\nDuring the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''. However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, \"I don't think that script was [actually] made.\"<ref>Commentary track, ''The Godfather'', ''The Godfather Collection'' 2008 Blu-ray, ASIN: B000NTPDSW,</ref>\n\n====''The Godfather Part II'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II}}\n\nCoppola shot ''The Godfather Part II'' parallel to ''The Conversation'' and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in [[Technicolor]]. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work\", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |date=July 28, 2003 |author=Stax |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115731/http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n''The Godfather Part II'' is ranked as the No. 1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's \"50 Best Movies of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |title=50 Greatest Movies (on TV and VIDEO) by TV Guide Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331175627/http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> and is ranked at No. 7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |title=100 Greates Movies of All Time by Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331185517/http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film is also featured on movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s list of the \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |title=100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century Part 2 by Leonard Maltin |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015115555/http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |archive-date=October 15, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> as well as Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105031018/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was also featured on [[Sight & Sound]]'s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |title=10 Best Films of All Time Polls by Sight & Sound Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118083212/http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |archive-date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCoppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year.

The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including [[typhoon]]s, nervous breakdowns, the firing of [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Martin Sheen]]'s heart attack, and extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels.

Harlan disagreed with the Court's rejection of Plessy's argument that the Louisiana law implied that blacks were inferior, and stated that the majority was being willfully ignorant on the subject: \n{{Quote\n|text=Every one knows that the statute in question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white people from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons. [...] The thing to accomplish was, under the guise of giving equal accommodation for whites and blacks, to compel the latter to keep to themselves while traveling in railroad passenger coaches.

There is no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved. ...

Upon being charged, Plessy's lawyers defended him by arguing that the law was unconstitutional. He lost at trial, and his conviction was affirmed on his appeal to the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]]. Plessy then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case.\n\nIn May 1896, the Supreme Court issued a 7\u20131 decision against Plessy ruling that the Louisiana law did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], stating that although the Fourteenth Amendment established the legal equality of white and black Americans, it did not and could not require the elimination of all social or other \"distinctions based upon color\". The Court rejected Plessy's lawyers' arguments that the Louisiana law inherently implied that black people were inferior, and gave great deference to American state legislatures' inherent power to make laws regulating health, safety, and morals{{mdash}}the \"[[police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]\"{{mdash}}and to determine the reasonableness of the laws they passed. Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] was the lone dissenter from the Court's decision, writing that the U.S. Constitution \"is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens\", and so the law's distinguishing of passengers' races should have been found unconstitutional. \n\n''Plessy'' is widely regarded as one of the worst decisions in U.S. Supreme Court history.<ref>{{harvp|Amar|2011|p=76}}; {{harvp|Epstein|1995|p=99}}.</ref> Despite its infamy, the decision itself has never been explicitly overruled.{{sfnp|Lofgren|1987|pp=204\u201305}} However, a series of subsequent decisions beginning with the 1954 case ''[[Brown v.
