The joint explosion of these mines ranks among the [[largest artificial non-nuclear explosions]].\n\nThe  [[tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers]] were to make two major contributions to the [[First day on the Somme|opening attack]] of the Battle of the Somme: Firstly, by preparing a number of large and small [[Mining (military)|mines]]; and secondly, by preparing a series of shallow [[Russian sap]]s from the British front line into [[no man's land]], which would be opened at [[wikt:zero hour|Zero Hour]] and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=115}}\n\nThe 19 mines consisted of eight large and eleven small charges deep in the chalky ground which were \"overcharged\" to throw up high lips for screening and to give advantage to the attackers when (or if) they captured the resulting craters.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=115}} The mines can be grouped into the large mine at Beaumont-Hamel (beneath ''[[Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt]]''), the charges near [[La Boisselle]] (consisting of the large ''[[Lochnagar mine|Lochnagar]]'' and ''[[Y Sap mine|Y Sap]]'' mines as well as the smaller [[L'\u00eelot de La Boisselle|''Glory Hole'']] charges), the three large ''Triple Tambour'' mines opposite [[Fricourt]], the ''Bulgar Point'' and ''Kasino Point'' mines, and the nine small charges placed further south. The small charges were to remove local German positions like machine gun posts and were laid from the ends of comparatively shallow tunnels.\n\nBrigadier [[James Edward Edmonds|Sir James Edmonds]] wrote in 1932 about the mines prepared for the first day of the Somme that \"Lack of manpower prevented more being undertaken\" and in 2007 [[Martin Gilbert|Sir Martin Gilbert]] wrote that although fewer mines than planned had been completed, \"... it was a formidable enterprise\". When they were fired on 1 July 1916, the ''Lochnagar'' and ''Hawthorn Ridge'' mines were the largest ever detonated and the sound of the blast was considered the loudest man-made noise in history. Reports suggested that the sound was heard in London and beyond. The mine detonations on the first day of the Somme were surpassed on 7 June 1917 by the [[mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|mines fired at the start of the Battle of Messines]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n{{main article|Battle of the Somme}}\n[[File:Mine at Leadfield.JPG|thumb|{{center|A [[mine gallery]] with timber roof support (Canada 2003)}}]]\n[[File:The Battle of the Somme, July-november 1916 Q115.jpg|thumb|Miners laying charges for one of the mines on the Somme, [[Battle of Albert (1916)|1\u201313 July 1916]].]]\n[[File:Chalk areas, northern France.jpg|thumb|{{center|Map of chalk areas in northern France}}]]\n[[File:Geological cross-section Somme area.jpg|thumb|{{center|Geological cross-section of the Somme battlefield}}]]\n\n===1914===\n\nFrench and German military operations began on the Somme in September 1914. After the German advance towards [[Albert, Somme|Albert]] had been brought to a halt at [[La Boisselle]] and attempts to resume offensive warfare in October had not been successful, both sides reduced their attacks to local operations or raids and began to fortify their remaining positions with underground works. On 18 December, the  French captured La Boisselle's village cemetery at the west end of a German salient and established an advanced post only {{convert|3|m|yd}} from the German front line. By 24 December, the French forced the Germans back from the cemetery and the western area of La Boisselle{{sfn|Whitehead|2010|pp=159\u2013174}} but their advance was stopped a short distance forward at ''[[L'\u00eelot de La Boisselle]]'', in front of German trenches protected by barbed wire. Once the location of a farm and a small number of buildings, {{lang|fr|L'\u00eelot}} became known as ''Granathof'' ([[German language|German]]: \"shell farm\") to the Germans and later as ''Glory Hole'' to the British. On Christmas Day 1914, French engineers sank a first mine shaft at La Boisselle. Local but heavy fighting underground also took place in the winter of 1914 and spring of 1915 at [[Fricourt]], [[Mametz, Somme|Bois Fran\u00e7ais]] and [[Carnoy]].{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=114}}\n\n===1915===\nFrom January 1915 to the start of the [[Battle of the Somme]] in July 1916, L'\u00eelot de La Boisselle was the scene of fierce underground fighting. Having started mining at La Boisselle shortly after the French, the Bavarian Engineer Regiment 1 continued digging eight galleries towards {{lang|fr|L'\u00eelot}}. On 5 January, French sappers were heard digging near a gallery and a {{convert|300|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[camouflet]] was quickly placed in the gallery and blown, collapsing the French digging and two German galleries in the vicinity. A {{convert|600|kg|lb|adj=on}} charge was blown on 12 January, which killed more than forty French soldiers. On the night of {{nowrap|6/7 February,}} three more German mines were sprung close to {{lang|fr|L'\u00eelot}}.{{sfn|Sheldon|2005|p=62}} On the night of {{nowrap|8/9 March,}} a German sapper at La Boisselle inadvertently broke into French gallery, which was found to have been charged with explosives; a group of volunteers took {{nowrap|45 nerve}} racking minutes to dismantle the charge and cut the firing cables. Between April 1915 and January 1916 alone, sixty-one mines were sprung around {{lang|fr|L'\u00eelot}}, some with {{convert|20000|\u2013|25000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives.{{sfn|Sheldon|2005|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nIn summer 1915, the French mine workings in the La Boisselle area were taken over by the [[Royal Engineers]] as the British moved into the Somme front. Great secrecy was maintained to prevent the discovery of the mines as no continuous front line trench ran through L'\u00eelot de La Boisselle, which was defended by posts near the mine shafts.{{sfn|Edmonds|1932|p=38}} [[George Henry Fowke|G. F. Fowke]] moved the [[174th Tunnelling Company|174th]] and [[183rd Tunnelling Company|183rd]] Tunnelling Companies into the area, but at first the British did not have enough miners to take over the large number of French shafts; the problem was temporarily solved when the French agreed to leave their engineers at work for several weeks.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=114}} On 24 July 1915, 174th Tunnelling Company established headquarters at Bray, taking over some 66 shafts at Carnoy, Fricourt, Maricourt and La Boisselle. No man's land just south-west of La Boisselle was very narrow, at one point about {{convert|50|yd|m|order=flip}} wide, and had become pockmarked by many chalk craters.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} The Germans had also dug defensive transverse tunnels about {{convert|80|ft|m|order=flip}} long, parallel to the front line.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} To provide the men needed for significant counter-mining operations against the Germans, the British formed the [[178th Tunnelling Company|178th]] and [[179th Tunnelling Company|179th]] Tunnelling Companies in August 1915, followed by the [[185th Tunnelling Company|185th]] and [[252nd Tunnelling Company|252nd]] Tunnelling Companies in October.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=114}} The [[181st Tunnelling Company]] was also present on the Somme.<ref name=REMpt14/>\n\nThe British tunnelling companies dramatically increased the scale of mining operations by extending and deepening the system, first to {{convert|24|m|ft}} and ultimately {{convert|30|m|ft}}. In August 1915, the French and Germans had been working at a depth of {{convert|12|m|ft}}; the size of their charges had reached {{convert|3000|kg|lb}}. The underground war continued with offensive mining to destroy the opponents' strong points and defensive mining to destroy tunnels, which were {{convert|30|\u2013|120|ft|m|order=flip}} long. In addition to their offensive and defensive works, the Royal Engineers also dug deep wells to supply the troops with [[drinking water]]. In October 1915, the 179th Tunnelling Company began to sink a series of deep shafts in an attempt to forestall German miners who were approaching beneath the British front line. At ''W Shaft'' they went down from {{convert|30|ft|m|order=flip}} to {{convert|80|ft|m|order=flip}} and began to drive two counter-mine tunnels towards the Germans. From the right-hand gallery the sounds of German digging grew steadily louder.{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}} On 19 November 1915, 179th Tunnelling Company's commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were 15 yards away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with {{convert|6000|lb|kg|order=flip}} of explosive. This was completed by midnight from 20\u201321 November. At 1.30 am on 22 November, the Germans blew their charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide. Both the right and left tunnels were collapsed, and it was later found that the German blow had detonated the British charge. The wrecked tunnels were gradually re-opened, but about thirty bodies still lie in the tunnels beneath La Boisselle.{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}}{{efn|See also ''The real hero tunnellers of World War One who inspired BBC's Birdsong'', www.mirror.co.uk, 21 January 2012 [https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/the-real-hero-tunnellers-of-world-war-165110 (online)], access date 6 July 2015, where the date of the detonation is given with 22 October 1915.}}\n\n==Prelude==\nAs part of the Allied preparations for the Battle of the Somme, the British intensified their underground operations in several selected front line sectors.

As the Germans in La Boisselle had fortified the cellars of ruined houses, and cratered ground made a direct infantry assault on the village impossible, two further mines, known as ''[[Y Sap mine|Y Sap]]''  and ''[[Lochnagar mine|Lochnagar]]'' after the trenches from which they were dug, were laid on the north-east and the south-east of La Boisselle to assist the attack on either side of the German salient in the village{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}}{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} \u2013 [https://lochnagarcrater.org/wp-content/uploads/LaBoisselleMap-Lochnagar-Crater.jpg see map].\n\n[[File:Battle of the Somme 1916 - Lochnagar mine, La Boisselle.jpg|thumb|{{center|Map of the ''Lochnagar'' mine; for an aerial view of the site with marked front lines, see  [https://web.archive.org/web/20161215105411/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/education/WWI/history/HL6/2d_TheGloryHole.jpg here]}}]]\nThe 185th Tunnelling Company started work on the ''Lochnagar'' mine on 11 November 1915 and handed the tunnels over to 179th Tunnelling Company in March 1916.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} A month before the handover, 18 men of the 185th Tunnelling Company (2 officers, 16 sappers) were killed on 4 February when the Germans detonated a camouflet near the British three-level mine system, starting from Inch Street, La Boisselle, the deepest level being just above the water table at around {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} The ''Lochnagar'' mine consisted of two chambers with a shared access tunnel (see map). The shaft was sunk in the communication trench called Lochnagar Street. After the [[Black Watch]] had arrived at La Boissselle at the end of July 1915, many existing Allied fortifications, originally dug by the French, had been given Scotland-related names. The ''Lochnagar'' mine probably had the first deep incline shaft, which sloped {{nowrap|1:2\u20131:3}} to a depth of about {{convert|95|ft|m|order=flip}} \u2013 [https://lochnagarcrater.org/wp-content/uploads/CraterSideElevation.jpg see map].

Starting from the inclined shaft, about {{convert|50|ft|m|order=flip}} below ground, a gallery was driven towards the German lines.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} For silence, the tunnellers used bayonets with spliced handles and worked barefoot on a floor covered with sandbags. Flints were carefully prised out of the chalk and laid on the floor; if the bayonet was manipulated two-handed, an assistant caught the dislodged material. Spoil was placed in sandbags and passed hand-by-hand, along a row of miners sitting on the floor and stored along the side of the tunnel, later to be used to [[tamp]] the charge.{{sfn|Edmonds|1932|p=375}} When about {{convert|135|ft|m|order=flip}} from the {{lang|de|Schwabenh\u00f6he}}, the tunnel was forked into two branches and the end of each branch was enlarged to form a chamber for the explosives, the chambers being about {{convert|60|ft|m|order=flip}} apart and {{convert|52|ft|m|order=flip}} deep{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} \u2013 [https://lochnagarcrater.org/wp-content/uploads/ExplosiveChambers.jpg see map].

Small charges could be blown from the end of these tunnels and they could then be used to reinforce the captured positions.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=130}} Four saps were further equipped with [[Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector]]s, ready to cover the German front line with [[Flamethrower|liquid fire]].

As in the ''Mametz East'' sector, 183rd Tunnelling Company had to stop its defensive mining activities off Carnoy so the work underground could be finished in time. All deep mining was halted, except at Kasino Point where an inclined gallery was built. As the chalk grew harder, the method of softening involved drilling holes with a carpenter's auger, into which the miners poured vinegar. When it was fired, the mine produced a crater with lips {{convert|97|ft|m|order=flip}} in diameter and {{convert|30|ft|m|order=flip}}  deep.

British troops rushed the crater where they were engaged by machine-gun and rifle fire from the far lip and the flanks. Three sections of German infantry (about thirty men) of the 9th Company were killed in the mine explosion and {{frac|1|1|2}} platoons were trapped in their {{lang|de|Unterst\u00e4nde}} (underground shelters), from which only two sections escaped.

The Germans also immediately brought down a heavy artillery barrage onto the British trenches. The 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Fusiliers]] ([[86th Brigade (United Kingdom)|86th Brigade]], 29th Division), crossing no man's land to occupy the crater, came under heavy German rifle and machine-gun fire from either flank and the rear lip. A few British soldiers managed to reach the closest lip of the crater and held on until noon when they were forced out by a German counter-attack. The failure to take the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt had a serious effect on the VIII Corps operations north of the [[River Ancre]].{{sfn|Jones|2010|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nEight minutes after the explosion of the ''Hawthorn Ridge'' mine, the ''Lochnagar'' mine was detonated at {{nowrap|7:28 a.m.}}, along with the other mines prepared for the [[First day of the Somme]]. The explosion of the ''Lochnagar'' mine was initiated by Captain James Young of the 179th Tunnelling Company, who pressed the switches and observed that the firing had been successful.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} The two charges of the ''Lochnagar'' mine obliterated {{convert|300|\u2013|400|ft|m|order=flip}} of German fortifications,{{sfn|Whitehead|2013|p=297}} including nine dugouts and the men inside them.

Four other British mines in the already cratered area between Mametz and Fricourt also exploded successfully.<ref name = \"longlongtrail101\"/>\n\nThough the mines on the British front were to be blown at {{nowrap|7:28 a.m.}} (the only exception being that at Hawthorn Ridge), the Kasino Point mine was late, because the officer in charge hesitated when he saw that British troops had left their trenches and begun to advance across no man's land. The German machine-gunners at the point opened fire and inflicted many casualties, so the officer detonated the mine which, instead of exploding upwards, sent debris outwards over wide area, causing casualties among at least four British battalions, as well as obliterating several German machine-gun nests. A witness wrote later\n\n{{quote|I looked left to see if my men were keeping a straight line.  I saw a sight I shall never forget.

In order to assess the consequences of infantry having to advance across cratered ground after a mining attack, officers from the [[Canadian Corps]] visited [[La Boisselle]] and [[Fricourt]] where the mines had been blown. Their reports and the experience of the Canadians at [[The Actions of St Eloi Craters|St Eloi in April 1916]] \u2013 where mines had so altered and damaged the landscape as to render occupation of the mine craters by the infantry all but impossible \u2013, led to the decision to remove offensive mining from the central sector allocated to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=134}} \n\n[[File:Lochnagar Crater Ovillers.JPG|thumb|{{center|The Lochnagar Crater in 2005}}]]\n[[William Orpen]], an [[British official war artists|official war artist]], saw the ''Lochnagar'' mine crater in 1916 while touring the Somme battlefield, collecting subjects for paintings and described a wilderness of chalk dotted with shrapnel.

The joint explosion of these mines ranks among the [[largest artificial non-nuclear explosions]].\n\nThe  [[tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers]] were to make two major contributions to the [[First day on the Somme|opening attack]] of the Battle of the Somme: Firstly, by preparing a number of large and small [[Mining (military)|mines]]; and secondly, by preparing a series of shallow [[Russian sap]]s from the British front line into [[no man's land]], which would be opened at [[wikt:zero hour|Zero Hour]] and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=115}}\n\nThe 19 mines consisted of eight large and eleven small charges deep in the chalky ground which were \"overcharged\" to throw up high lips for screening and to give advantage to the attackers when (or if) they captured the resulting craters.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=115}} The mines can be grouped into the large mine at Beaumont-Hamel (beneath ''[[Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt]]''), the charges near [[La Boisselle]] (consisting of the large ''[[Lochnagar mine|Lochnagar]]'' and ''[[Y Sap mine|Y Sap]]'' mines as well as the smaller [[L'\u00eelot de La Boisselle|''Glory Hole'']] charges), the three large ''Triple Tambour'' mines opposite [[Fricourt]], the ''Bulgar Point'' and ''Kasino Point'' mines, and the nine small charges placed further south. The small charges were to remove local German positions like machine gun posts and were laid from the ends of comparatively shallow tunnels.\n\nBrigadier [[James Edward Edmonds|Sir James Edmonds]] wrote in 1932 about the mines prepared for the first day of the Somme that \"Lack of manpower prevented more being undertaken\" and in 2007 [[Martin Gilbert|Sir Martin Gilbert]] wrote that although fewer mines than planned had been completed, \"... it was a formidable enterprise\". When they were fired on 1 July 1916, the ''Lochnagar'' and ''Hawthorn Ridge'' mines were the largest ever detonated and the sound of the blast was considered the loudest man-made noise in history. Reports suggested that the sound was heard in London and beyond.

After the German advance towards [[Albert, Somme|Albert]] had been brought to a halt at [[La Boisselle]] and attempts to resume offensive warfare in October had not been successful, both sides reduced their attacks to local operations or raids and began to fortify their remaining positions with underground works. On 18 December, the  French captured La Boisselle's village cemetery at the west end of a German salient and established an advanced post only {{convert|3|m|yd}} from the German front line. By 24 December, the French forced the Germans back from the cemetery and the western area of La Boisselle{{sfn|Whitehead|2010|pp=159\u2013174}} but their advance was stopped a short distance forward at ''[[L'\u00eelot de La Boisselle]]'', in front of German trenches protected by barbed wire. Once the location of a farm and a small number of buildings, {{lang|fr|L'\u00eelot}} became known as ''Granathof'' ([[German language|German]]: \"shell farm\") to the Germans and later as ''Glory Hole'' to the British. On Christmas Day 1914, French engineers sank a first mine shaft at La Boisselle. Local but heavy fighting underground also took place in the winter of 1914 and spring of 1915 at [[Fricourt]], [[Mametz, Somme|Bois Fran\u00e7ais]] and [[Carnoy]].{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=114}}\n\n===1915===\nFrom January 1915 to the start of the [[Battle of the Somme]] in July 1916, L'\u00eelot de La Boisselle was the scene of fierce underground fighting. Having started mining at La Boisselle shortly after the French, the Bavarian Engineer Regiment 1 continued digging eight galleries towards {{lang|fr|L'\u00eelot}}. On 5 January, French sappers were heard digging near a gallery and a {{convert|300|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[camouflet]] was quickly placed in the gallery and blown, collapsing the French digging and two German galleries in the vicinity. A {{convert|600|kg|lb|adj=on}} charge was blown on 12 January, which killed more than forty French soldiers. On the night of {{nowrap|6/7 February,}} three more German mines were sprung close to {{lang|fr|L'\u00eelot}}.{{sfn|Sheldon|2005|p=62}} On the night of {{nowrap|8/9 March,}} a German sapper at La Boisselle inadvertently broke into French gallery, which was found to have been charged with explosives; a group of volunteers took {{nowrap|45 nerve}} racking minutes to dismantle the charge and cut the firing cables. Between April 1915 and January 1916 alone, sixty-one mines were sprung around {{lang|fr|L'\u00eelot}}, some with {{convert|20000|\u2013|25000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives.{{sfn|Sheldon|2005|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nIn summer 1915, the French mine workings in the La Boisselle area were taken over by the [[Royal Engineers]] as the British moved into the Somme front. Great secrecy was maintained to prevent the discovery of the mines as no continuous front line trench ran through L'\u00eelot de La Boisselle, which was defended by posts near the mine shafts.{{sfn|Edmonds|1932|p=38}} [[George Henry Fowke|G. F. Fowke]] moved the [[174th Tunnelling Company|174th]] and [[183rd Tunnelling Company|183rd]] Tunnelling Companies into the area, but at first the British did not have enough miners to take over the large number of French shafts; the problem was temporarily solved when the French agreed to leave their engineers at work for several weeks.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=114}} On 24 July 1915, 174th Tunnelling Company established headquarters at Bray, taking over some 66 shafts at Carnoy, Fricourt, Maricourt and La Boisselle. No man's land just south-west of La Boisselle was very narrow, at one point about {{convert|50|yd|m|order=flip}} wide, and had become pockmarked by many chalk craters.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} The Germans had also dug defensive transverse tunnels about {{convert|80|ft|m|order=flip}} long, parallel to the front line.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} To provide the men needed for significant counter-mining operations against the Germans, the British formed the [[178th Tunnelling Company|178th]] and [[179th Tunnelling Company|179th]] Tunnelling Companies in August 1915, followed by the [[185th Tunnelling Company|185th]] and [[252nd Tunnelling Company|252nd]] Tunnelling Companies in October.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=114}} The [[181st Tunnelling Company]] was also present on the Somme.<ref name=REMpt14/>\n\nThe British tunnelling companies dramatically increased the scale of mining operations by extending and deepening the system, first to {{convert|24|m|ft}} and ultimately {{convert|30|m|ft}}. In August 1915, the French and Germans had been working at a depth of {{convert|12|m|ft}}; the size of their charges had reached {{convert|3000|kg|lb}}. The underground war continued with offensive mining to destroy the opponents' strong points and defensive mining to destroy tunnels, which were {{convert|30|\u2013|120|ft|m|order=flip}} long. In addition to their offensive and defensive works, the Royal Engineers also dug deep wells to supply the troops with [[drinking water]]. In October 1915, the 179th Tunnelling Company began to sink a series of deep shafts in an attempt to forestall German miners who were approaching beneath the British front line. At ''W Shaft'' they went down from {{convert|30|ft|m|order=flip}} to {{convert|80|ft|m|order=flip}} and began to drive two counter-mine tunnels towards the Germans. From the right-hand gallery the sounds of German digging grew steadily louder.{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}} On 19 November 1915, 179th Tunnelling Company's commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were 15 yards away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with {{convert|6000|lb|kg|order=flip}} of explosive. This was completed by midnight from 20\u201321 November. At 1.30 am on 22 November, the Germans blew their charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide. Both the right and left tunnels were collapsed, and it was later found that the German blow had detonated the British charge. The wrecked tunnels were gradually re-opened, but about thirty bodies still lie in the tunnels beneath La Boisselle.{{sfn|Banning et al.|2011|nopp=y}}{{efn|See also ''The real hero tunnellers of World War One who inspired BBC's Birdsong'', www.mirror.co.uk, 21 January 2012 [https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/the-real-hero-tunnellers-of-world-war-165110 (online)], access date 6 July 2015, where the date of the detonation is given with 22 October 1915.}}\n\n==Prelude==\nAs part of the Allied preparations for the Battle of the Somme, the British intensified their underground operations in several selected front line sectors.

Small charges could be blown from the end of these tunnels and they could then be used to reinforce the captured positions.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=130}} Four saps were further equipped with [[Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector]]s, ready to cover the German front line with [[Flamethrower|liquid fire]].

As in the ''Mametz East'' sector, 183rd Tunnelling Company had to stop its defensive mining activities off Carnoy so the work underground could be finished in time. All deep mining was halted, except at Kasino Point where an inclined gallery was built. As the chalk grew harder, the method of softening involved drilling holes with a carpenter's auger, into which the miners poured vinegar. When it was fired, the mine produced a crater with lips {{convert|97|ft|m|order=flip}} in diameter and {{convert|30|ft|m|order=flip}}  deep.

British troops rushed the crater where they were engaged by machine-gun and rifle fire from the far lip and the flanks. Three sections of German infantry (about thirty men) of the 9th Company were killed in the mine explosion and {{frac|1|1|2}} platoons were trapped in their {{lang|de|Unterst\u00e4nde}} (underground shelters), from which only two sections escaped.

The Germans also immediately brought down a heavy artillery barrage onto the British trenches. The 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Fusiliers]] ([[86th Brigade (United Kingdom)|86th Brigade]], 29th Division), crossing no man's land to occupy the crater, came under heavy German rifle and machine-gun fire from either flank and the rear lip. A few British soldiers managed to reach the closest lip of the crater and held on until noon when they were forced out by a German counter-attack. The failure to take the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt had a serious effect on the VIII Corps operations north of the [[River Ancre]].{{sfn|Jones|2010|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nEight minutes after the explosion of the ''Hawthorn Ridge'' mine, the ''Lochnagar'' mine was detonated at {{nowrap|7:28 a.m.}}, along with the other mines prepared for the [[First day of the Somme]]. The explosion of the ''Lochnagar'' mine was initiated by Captain James Young of the 179th Tunnelling Company, who pressed the switches and observed that the firing had been successful.{{sfn|Dunning|2015|nopp=y}} The two charges of the ''Lochnagar'' mine obliterated {{convert|300|\u2013|400|ft|m|order=flip}} of German fortifications,{{sfn|Whitehead|2013|p=297}} including nine dugouts and the men inside them.

Four other British mines in the already cratered area between Mametz and Fricourt also exploded successfully.<ref name = \"longlongtrail101\"/>\n\nThough the mines on the British front were to be blown at {{nowrap|7:28 a.m.}} (the only exception being that at Hawthorn Ridge), the Kasino Point mine was late, because the officer in charge hesitated when he saw that British troops had left their trenches and begun to advance across no man's land. The German machine-gunners at the point opened fire and inflicted many casualties, so the officer detonated the mine which, instead of exploding upwards, sent debris outwards over wide area, causing casualties among at least four British battalions, as well as obliterating several German machine-gun nests. A witness wrote later\n\n{{quote|I looked left to see if my men were keeping a straight line.  I saw a sight I shall never forget.

In order to assess the consequences of infantry having to advance across cratered ground after a mining attack, officers from the [[Canadian Corps]] visited [[La Boisselle]] and [[Fricourt]] where the mines had been blown. Their reports and the experience of the Canadians at [[The Actions of St Eloi Craters|St Eloi in April 1916]] \u2013 where mines had so altered and damaged the landscape as to render occupation of the mine craters by the infantry all but impossible \u2013, led to the decision to remove offensive mining from the central sector allocated to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=134}} \n\n[[File:Lochnagar Crater Ovillers.JPG|thumb|{{center|The Lochnagar Crater in 2005}}]]\n[[William Orpen]], an [[British official war artists|official war artist]], saw the ''Lochnagar'' mine crater in 1916 while touring the Somme battlefield, collecting subjects for paintings and described a wilderness of chalk dotted with shrapnel.

The show is about a group of [[goat]]s living on the Green Green Grassland ({{zh|c=\u9752\u9752\u8349\u539f}}), and the story revolving around a clumsy [[wolf]] who wants to eat them. The cartoon became enormously popular with Chinese schoolchildren after its debut in 2005. Cashing in on the cartoon's success, the producer made an animated feature in 2009. It generated a box office revenue of 79 million yuan (approx. US $11.5 million) during [[Chinese New Year]] that year.

It has broken the domestic [[box office]] record for a Chinese animated film, collecting 30 million yuan (US$4.39 million) during its opening weekend. On the first day of release alone, the movie made 8 million Yuan. According to [[Beijing]] News, the weekend's revenue was well ahead of the previous record holder for domestic animation, ''[[Storm Rider Clash of the Evils]]'' \u2013 the adaptation of the ''Storm Riders'' comic brought in 25 million Yuan in two weeks when it was released the previous summer.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nDescribing the ''Pleasant Goat'' movie as a \"dark horse\", Zhao Jun, general manager of China Film South Cinema Circuit Co. Ltd., predicted the film would make at least 60 million yuan in total box office revenue.  A manager of the Beijing-based Stellar International Cineplex said the movie theatre's biggest hall, which had been scheduled to screen ''Red Cliff II'', was reassigned to show ''Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: The Super Adventure'' in order to meet popular demand.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nChina's [[Xinhua]] news agency quoted unspecified \"insiders\" as crediting the cartoon's success to the large pool of fans who have tuned into the ''Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf'' television cartoon series over the past three years.  Based on the 530-episode television series, ''The Super Adventure'' stars the same characters but in a very different scenario. The movie's storyline tells how several goats and their old nemesis, Wolffy, join forces to defeat their common archenemy \u2013 bacteria.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nA second movie, ''[[Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: The Tiger Prowess|Desert Trek: The Adventure of the Lost Totem]]'', was also released.

The goats built a tall iron gate outside their village and called it 'Goat Village'. This leaves the wolves to try and break in any way they can. One day, a wolf suggests that they exercise, get thin and squeeze through the bars. So the wolf ancestor, Wu Dalang, manages to get through after long exercising, only to die after swallowing a huge rock covered in wool, mistaking it for a big sheep. After this incident, the wolves learned not to make the goats of Green Green Grassland angry, for there will be consequences.\n\nIn the year 3513, the descendant of Wu Dalang, Wolffy moves to the opposite of the river separating the forest and the Goat Village with his wife Wolnie, due to low hunting ability demonstrated by Wolffy and the fact that he is no longer regarded a proper wolf. They move there in hope of finding a way to eat the goats, as tales told by ancestors say that the goats there are the best and tastiest. The goats live in the Green Green Grassland happily. The main characters are depicted as school-aged goats that attend school under the tutelage of Slowy, the village elder.\n\nWolffy and Wolnie live in a castle far from the village and are constantly trying to hunt the goats for food. But the goats in this time are intelligent and powered with technology. Every time Wolffy appears at the Goat Village, he concocts a plan to catch the goats. Among the goat students, a smart young male goat named Weslie always finds a way to ruin Wolffy's plans and save the goats. With the effort of Weslie and his friends, Wolffy never captures any goats. At the end of each episode, Wolffy always promises to come back, each time shouting his catchphrase: 'Darn goats! I will definitely come back again!'\n\nThe conflict between Wolffy and Weslie never ends. Although Wolffy fails all the time, he never gives up. Although he is mean to the goats, he is a nice and timid husband to Wolnie. Wolnie is somewhat impatient and enjoys making her husband do all the work. She rarely tries to catch the goats herself (failing every time as well), but always yells at her husband. She likes fashion and behaves like a modern female adult (though sometimes her thoughts are a bit childish). She knows nothing but eating goats and she loves to hit Wolffy with her frying pan. Despite this fact, deep down Wolnie still loves her husband.\n\nWeslie and his friends are portrayed as playful primary school kids, each of whom has his/her own unique characteristic. Tibbie is a fashionable young female goat who is always worrying about her looks and esteem. Sparky is a young male goat who likes to work out; he has a crush on Tibbie. Paddi is a cute male goat who likes to relax. Paddi is one of the most popular characters in the series. There are many other young, anonymous goats, as well as their teacher Slowy, an old goat referred to as the \"Village Chief\", who is a scientist and develops machines to protect their school. He is slower than a snail and uses a walking stick.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:PleasantGoatcharacters.jpg|thumb|The main characters of the show, from left to right, top to bottom: Paddi, Tibbie, Slowly, Sparky, Weslie, Wolffy, and Wolnie]]\n\n===Goats===\n'''Happy'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\">\"[http://us.22dm.com/profiles_pleasantgoat.html Characters' Profiles of Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf].\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/69fK4Skyw?url=http://us.22dm.com/profiles_pleasantgoat.html Archive]) [[Creative Power Entertaining]].

He is a school-aged goat living in the Goat Village of Green Green Grassland. He wears a blue ribbon around his neck with a bell, which is a present from his parents. Weslie is an archetypal hero character; he's positive, intelligent and always supportive of his friends. He takes a leadership role in his class and among his peers and is Slowy's assistant. Weslie is observant and intelligent, and in general, is the often the first to detect danger and see through Wolffy's plots and traps. He also seems to be quite calm and forgiving, as he forgives Wolffy and his family at the end of the first movie for betraying them by sending them a trap-gift. He loves to play pranks and all his friends get mad at him. He also enjoys being treated with offers by Tibbie. \n'''{{Not a typo|Slowy}}'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> ({{zh|c=\u6162\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=M\u00e0n Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Slow Sheep}})\n:Voiced by: Gao Quansheng\n:Slowy is an adult goat that serves as a village elder of sorts. His name is pun on \"slow and steady\", implying that while slow, he also harbors a steady wisdom. He functions as the only adult figure in the story, and not only serving as the head of the lamb village, but also as the schoolmaster. He often uses trickery to teach his students valuable lessons about life, and often sends them on assignments.\n:Outside of the school yard, he's shown as a goat of many pursuits, creating wacky inventions and performing questionable experiments with humorous results. In addition, when he thinks too hard, his head will begin to grow leaves.\n\n:His character design is somewhat based on Albert Einstein, with wild frizzy hair, a mustache, and a pair of spectacles.\n\n'''Lazy''',<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> '''Lance''' or '''Paddi''' ({{zh|c=\u61d2\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=L\u01cen Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Lazy Sheep}})\n:Voiced by: Liang Ying\n:A small, gluttonous goat wearing a yellow drool bib. He hates working and likes to sleep, but due to his lazy nature he is often the first caught by Wolffy. Paddi is one of the most intelligent of all of the goats, although this is concealed by his laziness. He also has a habit of falling asleep whenever Wolffy kidnaps the goats. He is sometimes a bit selfish. He has been revealed to hold a varying number of hidden talents throughout the show, such as diving.

She is one of Slowy's students. She likes applying make-up and cooking. She is generally liked by all the goats in Green Green Grassland. She has a crush on Weslie, and Sparky has a crush on her. Tibbie is shown to be the most emotional goat such as crying, and her friends have to calm her down. Tibbie is shown to not really like caterpillars, roaches, or bugs crawling on her or seeing one, but she likes crafting flower wreaths, attracting other animals to her beauty. Tibbie is usually gentle, kind, and sweet to her friends, but is serious when she is angry, usually making Weslie or Sparky to calm her down. Her best friend is Jonie, and likes to do various activities with her, such as dressing up in pretty clothes.\n\n'''Fitty'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> or '''Sparky''' ({{zh|c=\u6cb8\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=F\u00e8i Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Boiling Sheep}})\n:Voiced by: Liu Hongyun\n:Sparky is the only dark-skinned goat. He is a school-aged goat that attends the same school as Weslie. Sparky is depicted as a jock character of sorts. He is the strongest of his group and enjoys sports and showing off his strength to others. He's quick-tempered and quick to act, often charging headlong into dangerous situations. He has a romantic interest in Tibbie and is always on the lookout for opportunities to impress her. He likes to pick on Paddi, but occasionally still treats him as a friend. Sparky's best friend is Weslie and likes to help him get rid of Wolffy while he tries to attack the goats. \n:Despite his strength, he is still physically weaker than Wolffy.\n\n'''Gentty'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> or '''Jonie''' ({{zh|c=\u6696\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=Nu\u01cen Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Warm Sheep}})\n:Voiced by: Deng Yuting\n:She is a docile and kind female goat who is class president to Weslie's class in school. She is revealed in the Olympics special to possess mountain goat genes, effectively making her the strongest goat in Goat Village above Sparky. She is the most sensible goat, but can sometimes be talkative. She is friends with Jay, and best friends with Tibbie, whom the two like to do various activities together. Like Tibbie, Jonie is usually gentle and kind but she tends to scold the boy goats (Weslie, Sparky and Paddi) but still hangs out and cares for them. She has a small pink heart-shaped satchel which she wears as well as a matching ribbon and red shoes. She has a pet owl which is purple called 'nuan-nuan', or warm-warm.\n\n'''Stacy''' ({{zh|c=\u82b1\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=Hu\u0101 Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Flower Goat}})\n:Voiced by: Yan Yanzi\n:She was Slowy's crush. In one episode the goats brought Stacy to Goat Village through a time machine Slowy invented. She painted her horns pink and wears pretty pink petaled flowers (with yellow smiley faces in the middle) on them. She wears a purple purse and pink shoes and a pink choker. She has short pony tails with bells on them. When she was an adult, she had pretty bangs. Tibbie became slightly jealous of her because she was more beautiful when she was in Goat Village. She is gentle and sweet, with a soft voice and a beautiful tone. \n:She is also mentioned by Slowy in  the sixth movie.\n\n===Wolves===\n'''Wolffy'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> ({{zh|c=\u7070\u592a\u72fc\uff08\u7070\u5931\u72fc\uff09|p=Hu\u012b T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Grey Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Zhang Lin\n:Wolffy is the main antagonist of the series. Like the Goats, his name is a literal pun, as \"{{lang|zh-cn|\u592a\u72fc}}\" or {{lang|ja|\u592a\u90ce}} is a common Japanese given name meaning \"first son\", (ie. how English surnames contain words like \"Wolfe\" or \"Wolfson\") with \"Grey\" being his family name.\n:Wolffy is a middle-aged, hen-pecked husband. He wears an orange cap with a yellow patch and has a scar under his eye. He lives with his demanding wife, Wolnie, in a castle on the outskirts of Lamb village. Wolffy is usually motivated solely by the fear of his wife. He is constantly under her demand to bring home goats for food.\n:A rather bumbling character, he always concocts elaborate plans and creates fanciful traps to catch the goats, with limited success. He usually ends up being outwitted by the goats, and is often unable to find loopholes in his overly complex plans. His failures to obtain food are met by angry scoldings from his wife and slapstick violence, such as being hit over the head with a frying pan. Even so, his love for Red Wolf never wavered.\n\n:It's worth noting that Wolffy himself lacked any real desire to catch the Lambs at first, and only did so in an attempt to appease and impress his wife. He will readily abandon his hunt should some other means appear that will likely impress his wife more.\n:His catchphrase (which he utters in one form or another each episode) is \"Darn goat! I'll definitely come back/ I'll come back for sure/ I'll be back/ I'll get my revenge!\" (mostly \"I'll be back\" in later seasons, which is based on ''[[The Terminator]]''.)\n\n:In China, sometimes he is seen as a respectable cartoon character/figure by older generations because of his faithfulness to his wife despite the fact that he fears her and also the fact that he has not given up yet on catching goats.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n:In one episode Wolffy invites his uncle to stay, but he fears losing face in front of him because of Wolnie's violence. He convinces his wife to pretend to be submissive while the uncle was there. However, at the end of the episode when the uncle leaves, Wolnie gives him a good thrashing \"to compensate for all the time she missed out on hitting him\".\n\n'''Wolnie'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> ({{zh|c=\u7ea2\u592a\u72fc|p=H\u00f3ng T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Red Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Zhao Na\n:The [[narcissistic]] wife of Wolffy, who dresses in a red robe with black and white trims.  She is over-demanding and abusive towards her husband, hitting him with her [[frying pan]] whenever his schemes fail; however, she does genuinely love her husband. She is actually very smart and while her husband can think of outlandish inventions to catch goats, her simple ideas are the ones that are actually successful.\n\n'''Howie''' or '''Wilie'''<ref name=\"ZhangZuo\">Zhang, Jin and Zuo Likun. \"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-04/24/content_9770127.htm Schools begin again in quake-hit region].\" ''[[China Daily]]''.

Their relationship is highlighted in the second and fifth movie. He has an attachment on Paddi, but he likes the other goats, such as dressing Weslie as \"Brother Weslie,\" and Tibbie as \"Sister Tibbie\", and so on. \n:After he is expelled from the Wolf school, his father reluctantly enrolls him in the goat school, where he becomes friends with all the other goats, occasionally aiding them in their struggle against Wolffy.\n\n'''Huang Tailang''' ({{zh|c=\u9ec4\u592a\u72fc|p=Hu\u00e1ng T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Yellow Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Zhang Lin\n:Wolffy's Grandfather.

He was the previous villain of Goat Village before the goats found a way to hex him with a cursed invention, resulting in his falling into a burning fire and meeting his end.\n\n'''Jay''' ({{zh|c=\u8549\u592a\u72fc|p=Ji\u0101o T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Banana Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Liu Hongyun\n:He is a large, mild-mannered wolf who is a vegetarian obsessed with bananas.  He befriends Jonie, who likes to provide him with bananas. He was forced to marry Fragrant Wolf but after he realizes Fragrant was a cruel as Wolnie when they were at the Central Carnival Park, he decided not to and fled from his wedding saying, \"I DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" (Even Wolffy warned him not to marry Fragrant because he got married the exact same way with his wife as Banana almost married Fragrant.) He is the nephew of Wolffy.\n\n'''Xiang Tailang''' ({{zh|c=\u9999\u592a\u72fc|p=Xi\u0101ng T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Fragrant Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Deng Yuting\n:Xiang Tailang is the cousin of Wolnie. She is a young female wolf with rainbow hoop earrings and a pink dress. She has a crush on Jay, and almost marries him, but ends up marrying Ye Tailang (Wolffy's cousin) at her wedding, who was secretly in love with her. Her name is probably a reference to [[Xiang Fei]], a favored concubine of the Qianlong Emperor. Her weapon tends to be two irons, as shown in the episode the sisters receive a mysterious apple. She is very cruel, much like her cousin Wolnie.\n\n'''Wu Dalang''' ({{zh|c=\u6b66\u5927\u72fc|p=W\u01d4 D\u00e0l\u00e1ng|l=Martial Wolf}})\n:The ancestor of the wolf clan and the archrival of Mandy. In episode 499, it was revealed that he was the one who gave Wolffy his scar during a time traveling shenanigan.\n\n===Others===\n''' Crazy Brother''' ({{zh|c=\u6f47\u6d12\u54e5|p=Xi\u0101os\u01ce G\u0113|l=Cool Bro}})\n:Voiced by: Zu Liqing\n:Crazy Brother is an egg with a face. He has a carefree and easygoing personality but is not always intelligent. An occult enthusiast and a joker, his catch phrase is \"I'll put a curse on you!\" while drawing circles into the ground with a stick. (Once, the drawn circle lit up and granted him powers to shoot laser beams out of his hands.) He enjoys teasing Paddi's pet by saying: \"you unfinished egg!\" Crazy Brother also has many costumes that he changes into in special occasions. He and his brother can merge and become an ultimate powerful egg. (When this happens, the resulting combination looks like Crazy Brother but with a red cape and a red underwear on his head.)\n'''Black Commander''' ({{zh|c=\u9ed1\u5927\u5e05|p=H\u0113i D\u00e0shu\u00e0i}})\n:Voiced by: Gao Quansheng\n:Crazy Brother's [[Century egg|black-egg]] younger brother. Has lightning powers and was evil for some time and was a team with Wolffy.\n'''Big Humphrey''' ({{zh|c=\u5305\u5305\u5927\u4eba|p=B\u0101ob\u0101o D\u00e0r\u00e9n|Lord Bobo}})\n:Voiced by: Gao Quansheng\n:An elephant that serves as the mayor and chief of justice of Green Green Grassland, which encompasses the Goat Village and the Wolf Castle as well as all the other places of residence in Green Green Grassland. His character is a parody of [[Bao Zheng]], a Chinese figure revered for his fairness and judicial judgment in court.\n'''Tai Ge''' ({{zh|c=\u6cf0\u54e5|p=T\u00e0i G\u0113|l=Ti Bro}})\n:Voiced by: Gao Quansheng\n:A Tiger, so far the only tiger in the series, strong, well-muscled, loves to show off his muscles. His name is a play on the English word ''Tiger''. It also sounds similar to the Chinese rendering of boxer [[Mike Tyson]].\n'''Flat-beak Allen''' ({{zh|c=\u6241\u5634\u4f26|p=Bi\u01cen Zu\u01d0l\u00fan|l=Flat-mouth Lun}})\n:A rather narcissistic duck. He is a superstar singer and often holds concerts at the Green-Green Grassland. Wolffy is a great fan of his, in one episode dressing in drag to get his autograph. But this is often contradicted, such as in the episode where Wolffy kidnaps Bian Zui Lun, shaves him and uses his fur to dress up as him and gain access to the goats. His name is parody of Zhou Jielun ([[Jay Chou]]).\n\n===Pets===\n*\u559c\u559c (X\u01d0x\u01d0, \"Happy\")\n:Weslie's pet (a small bouncing horse).\n*\u7f8e\u7f8e (M\u011bim\u011bi, \"Fuzzy\")\n:Tibbie's pet (a tank and dog combined).\n*\u86cb\u86cb (D\u00e0ndan, \"Egg\")\n:Paddi's pet (a flat hard-boiled egg who can fit into small openings).\n*\u6253\u6253 (D\u01ced\u01ce, \"Hittie\")\n:Sparky's pet (a pair of boxing gloves who actually wear \"Fit\").\n*\u6696\u6696 (Nu\u01cennu\u01cen, \"Warmy\")\n:Jonie's pet (a bird who can create a strong wind by flapping her wings).\n\n==Media==\n===Donghua===\n{{main|List of Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!width=\"5%\"|Season\n!width=\"20%\"|Title\n!width=\"5%\"|Total Episodes\n!Premiere Date\n!width=\"10%\"|Premiere Platform\n!width=\"10%\"|Directed by\n!Opening Theme\n!Ending Theme\n|-\n!1\n|''Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf''\n|530\n|August 3, 2005\n|Children's Channel, Hangzhou Television \u2192 [[Zhejiang Television]] (ZJTV)\n|Huang Weiming\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Ivy Koo\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Ivy Koo\n|-\n!2\n|''Pleasant Goat Sports Game''\n|60\n|October 23, 2008\n|[[CCTV-14]]\n|Huang Weiming\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Ivy Koo\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Ivy Koo\n|-\n!3\n|''Joys of Seasons''\n|100\n|May 1, 2010\n|ZJTV\n|Huang Xiaoxue\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Yang Peiyi\n|\"Dajia Yiqi Xiyangyang\"<br />by Bibi Zhou\n|-\n!4\n|''Around the World in 20 Days''\n|20\n|August 1, 2010\n|BesTV IPTV Platform\n|Huang Xiaoxue\n|None\n|None\n|-\n!5\n|''Smart Dodging''\n|60\n|July 1, 2011\n|ZJTV\n|Tan Shujun\n|\"Qisimiaoxiang Xi Yangyang\"<br />by Xiyangyang Tongxing Hechangtuan\n|\"Qisimiaoxiang Xi Yangyang\"<br />by Xiyangyang Tongxing Hechangtuan\n|-\n!6\n|''Happy, Happy, Bang!

After it became moderately successful, Creative Power Entertaining created the next 1737 episodes, including 60 exclusive Olympics episodes in 2008 an addition of 20 more episodes to the first season in 2009.\n\nIn January 2009, its first movie ''[[Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - The Super Adventure]]'' was launched in [[China]]. It has broken the domestic [[box office]] record for a Chinese animated film, collecting 30 million yuan (US$4.39 million) during its opening weekend. On the first day of release alone, the movie made 8 million Yuan. According to [[Beijing]] News, the weekend's revenue was well ahead of the previous record holder for domestic animation, ''[[Storm Rider Clash of the Evils]]'' \u2013 the adaptation of the ''Storm Riders'' comic brought in 25 million Yuan in two weeks when it was released the previous summer.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nDescribing the ''Pleasant Goat'' movie as a \"dark horse\", Zhao Jun, general manager of China Film South Cinema Circuit Co. Ltd., predicted the film would make at least 60 million yuan in total box office revenue.  A manager of the Beijing-based Stellar International Cineplex said the movie theatre's biggest hall, which had been scheduled to screen ''Red Cliff II'', was reassigned to show ''Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: The Super Adventure'' in order to meet popular demand.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nChina's [[Xinhua]] news agency quoted unspecified \"insiders\" as crediting the cartoon's success to the large pool of fans who have tuned into the ''Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf'' television cartoon series over the past three years.  Based on the 530-episode television series, ''The Super Adventure'' stars the same characters but in a very different scenario. The movie's storyline tells how several goats and their old nemesis, Wolffy, join forces to defeat their common archenemy \u2013 bacteria.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nA second movie, ''[[Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: The Tiger Prowess|Desert Trek: The Adventure of the Lost Totem]]'', was also released. The movie contains many original songs. [[Yang Peiyi]], who performed [[Ode to the Motherland]] at [[Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Opening Ceremony]], was invited to sing \"[[:zh:\u5de6\u624b\u53f3\u624b|Left hands and Right hands]]\" ({{zh|c=\u5de6\u624b\u53f3\u624b}}).\n\nIn 2010, Creative Power Entertaining Corporation (CPE) said that it had reached a television license broadcast agreement with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] affiliate [[Buena Vista (company)|Buena Vista]] to air its products. With this deal the popular Chinese cartoon show for children will be aired on [[Disney channel]]s in 52 countries and regions and in more than 10 different languages. A milestone for China's homegrown animation industry.<ref name=\"china.org.cn\"/>\n\nThe third movie, ''[[Moon Castle: The Space Adventure]]'' was launched in 2011.

The goats built a tall iron gate outside their village and called it 'Goat Village'. This leaves the wolves to try and break in any way they can. One day, a wolf suggests that they exercise, get thin and squeeze through the bars. So the wolf ancestor, Wu Dalang, manages to get through after long exercising, only to die after swallowing a huge rock covered in wool, mistaking it for a big sheep. After this incident, the wolves learned not to make the goats of Green Green Grassland angry, for there will be consequences.\n\nIn the year 3513, the descendant of Wu Dalang, Wolffy moves to the opposite of the river separating the forest and the Goat Village with his wife Wolnie, due to low hunting ability demonstrated by Wolffy and the fact that he is no longer regarded a proper wolf. They move there in hope of finding a way to eat the goats, as tales told by ancestors say that the goats there are the best and tastiest. The goats live in the Green Green Grassland happily. The main characters are depicted as school-aged goats that attend school under the tutelage of Slowy, the village elder.\n\nWolffy and Wolnie live in a castle far from the village and are constantly trying to hunt the goats for food. But the goats in this time are intelligent and powered with technology. Every time Wolffy appears at the Goat Village, he concocts a plan to catch the goats. Among the goat students, a smart young male goat named Weslie always finds a way to ruin Wolffy's plans and save the goats. With the effort of Weslie and his friends, Wolffy never captures any goats. At the end of each episode, Wolffy always promises to come back, each time shouting his catchphrase: 'Darn goats! I will definitely come back again!'\n\nThe conflict between Wolffy and Weslie never ends. Although Wolffy fails all the time, he never gives up. Although he is mean to the goats, he is a nice and timid husband to Wolnie. Wolnie is somewhat impatient and enjoys making her husband do all the work. She rarely tries to catch the goats herself (failing every time as well), but always yells at her husband. She likes fashion and behaves like a modern female adult (though sometimes her thoughts are a bit childish). She knows nothing but eating goats and she loves to hit Wolffy with her frying pan. Despite this fact, deep down Wolnie still loves her husband.\n\nWeslie and his friends are portrayed as playful primary school kids, each of whom has his/her own unique characteristic. Tibbie is a fashionable young female goat who is always worrying about her looks and esteem. Sparky is a young male goat who likes to work out; he has a crush on Tibbie. Paddi is a cute male goat who likes to relax. Paddi is one of the most popular characters in the series. There are many other young, anonymous goats, as well as their teacher Slowy, an old goat referred to as the \"Village Chief\", who is a scientist and develops machines to protect their school. He is slower than a snail and uses a walking stick.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:PleasantGoatcharacters.jpg|thumb|The main characters of the show, from left to right, top to bottom: Paddi, Tibbie, Slowly, Sparky, Weslie, Wolffy, and Wolnie]]\n\n\n===Goats===\n'''Happy'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\">\"[http://us.22dm.com/profiles_pleasantgoat.html Characters' Profiles of Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf].\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/69fK4Skyw?url=http://us.22dm.com/profiles_pleasantgoat.html Archive]) [[Creative Power Entertaining]].

He is a school-aged goat living in the Goat Village of Green Green Grassland. He wears a blue ribbon around his neck with a bell, which is a present from his parents. Weslie is an archetypal hero character; he's positive, intelligent and always supportive of his friends. He takes a leadership role in his class and among his peers and is Slowy's assistant. Weslie is observant and intelligent, and in general, is the often the first to detect danger and see through Wolffy's plots and traps. He also seems to be quite calm and forgiving, as he forgives Wolffy and his family at the end of the first movie for betraying them by sending them a trap-gift. He loves to play pranks and all his friends get mad at him. He also enjoys being treated with offers by Tibbie. \n'''{{Not a typo|Slowy}}'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> ({{zh|c=\u6162\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=M\u00e0n Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Slow Sheep}})\n:Voiced by: Gao Quansheng\n:Slowy is an adult goat that serves as a village elder of sorts. His name is pun on \"slow and steady\", implying that while slow, he also harbors a steady wisdom. He functions as the only adult figure in the story, and not only serving as the head of the lamb village, but also as the schoolmaster. He often uses trickery to teach his students valuable lessons about life, and often sends them on assignments.\n:Outside of the school yard, he's shown as a goat of many pursuits, creating wacky inventions and performing questionable experiments with humorous results. In addition, when he thinks too hard, his head will begin to grow leaves.\n\n:His character design is somewhat based on Albert Einstein, with wild frizzy hair, a mustache, and a pair of spectacles.\n\n'''Lazy''',<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> '''Lance''' or '''Paddi''' ({{zh|c=\u61d2\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=L\u01cen Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Lazy Sheep}})\n:Voiced by: Liang Ying\n:A small, gluttonous goat wearing a yellow drool bib. He hates working and likes to sleep, but due to his lazy nature he is often the first caught by Wolffy. Paddi is one of the most intelligent of all of the goats, although this is concealed by his laziness. He also has a habit of falling asleep whenever Wolffy kidnaps the goats. He is sometimes a bit selfish. He has been revealed to hold a varying number of hidden talents throughout the show, such as diving. Wolffy's son Wilie has an attachment to him, and will often address him as \"Brother Paddi\". He is also one of the most popular characters.\n\n'''Beauty'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> or '''Tibbie'''<ref>\"[http://finance.thestandard.com.hk/en/comp_profile.asp?code=00585 Imagi Int'l Business Review - For the year ended December 31, 2011].\" ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]''.

She is one of Slowy's students. She likes applying make-up and cooking. She is generally liked by all the goats in Green Green Grassland. She has a crush on Weslie, and Sparky has a crush on her. Tibbie is shown to be the most emotional goat such as crying, and her friends have to calm her down. Tibbie is shown to not really like caterpillars, roaches, or bugs crawling on her or seeing one, but she likes crafting flower wreaths, attracting other animals to her beauty. Tibbie is usually gentle, kind, and sweet to her friends, but is serious when she is angry, usually making Weslie or Sparky to calm her down. Her best friend is Jonie, and likes to do various activities with her, such as dressing up in pretty clothes.\n\n'''Fitty'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> or '''Sparky''' ({{zh|c=\u6cb8\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=F\u00e8i Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Boiling Sheep}})\n:Voiced by: Liu Hongyun\n:Sparky is the only dark-skinned goat. He is a school-aged goat that attends the same school as Weslie. Sparky is depicted as a jock character of sorts. He is the strongest of his group and enjoys sports and showing off his strength to others. He's quick-tempered and quick to act, often charging headlong into dangerous situations. He has a romantic interest in Tibbie and is always on the lookout for opportunities to impress her. He likes to pick on Paddi, but occasionally still treats him as a friend. Sparky's best friend is Weslie and likes to help him get rid of Wolffy while he tries to attack the goats. \n:Despite his strength, he is still physically weaker than Wolffy.\n\n'''Gentty'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> or '''Jonie''' ({{zh|c=\u6696\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=Nu\u01cen Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Warm Sheep}})\n:Voiced by: Deng Yuting\n:She is a docile and kind female goat who is class president to Weslie's class in school. She is revealed in the Olympics special to possess mountain goat genes, effectively making her the strongest goat in Goat Village above Sparky. She is the most sensible goat, but can sometimes be talkative. She is friends with Jay, and best friends with Tibbie, whom the two like to do various activities together. Like Tibbie, Jonie is usually gentle and kind but she tends to scold the boy goats (Weslie, Sparky and Paddi) but still hangs out and cares for them. She has a small pink heart-shaped satchel which she wears as well as a matching ribbon and red shoes. She has a pet owl which is purple called 'nuan-nuan', or warm-warm.\n\n'''Stacy''' ({{zh|c=\u82b1\u7f8a\u7f8a|p=Hu\u0101 Y\u00e1ngy\u00e1ng|l=Flower Goat}})\n:Voiced by: Yan Yanzi\n:She was Slowy's crush. In one episode the goats brought Stacy to Goat Village through a time machine Slowy invented. She painted her horns pink and wears pretty pink petaled flowers (with yellow smiley faces in the middle) on them. She wears a purple purse and pink shoes and a pink choker. She has short pony tails with bells on them. When she was an adult, she had pretty bangs. Tibbie became slightly jealous of her because she was more beautiful when she was in Goat Village. She is gentle and sweet, with a soft voice and a beautiful tone. \n:She is also mentioned by Slowy in  the sixth movie.\n\n===Wolves===\n'''Wolffy'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> ({{zh|c=\u7070\u592a\u72fc\uff08\u7070\u5931\u72fc\uff09|p=Hu\u012b T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Grey Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Zhang Lin\n:Wolffy is the main antagonist of the series. Like the Goats, his name is a literal pun, as \"{{lang|zh-cn|\u592a\u72fc}}\" or {{lang|ja|\u592a\u90ce}} is a common Japanese given name meaning \"first son\", (ie. how English surnames contain words like \"Wolfe\" or \"Wolfson\") with \"Grey\" being his family name.\n:Wolffy is a middle-aged, hen-pecked husband. He wears an orange cap with a yellow patch and has a scar under his eye. He lives with his demanding wife, Wolnie, in a castle on the outskirts of Lamb village. Wolffy is usually motivated solely by the fear of his wife. He is constantly under her demand to bring home goats for food.\n:A rather bumbling character, he always concocts elaborate plans and creates fanciful traps to catch the goats, with limited success. He usually ends up being outwitted by the goats, and is often unable to find loopholes in his overly complex plans. His failures to obtain food are met by angry scoldings from his wife and slapstick violence, such as being hit over the head with a frying pan. Even so, his love for Red Wolf never wavered.\n\n:It's worth noting that Wolffy himself lacked any real desire to catch the Lambs at first, and only did so in an attempt to appease and impress his wife. He will readily abandon his hunt should some other means appear that will likely impress his wife more.\n:His catchphrase (which he utters in one form or another each episode) is \"Darn goat! I'll definitely come back/ I'll come back for sure/ I'll be back/ I'll get my revenge!\" (mostly \"I'll be back\" in later seasons, which is based on ''[[The Terminator]]''.)\n\n:In China, sometimes he is seen as a respectable cartoon character/figure by older generations because of his faithfulness to his wife despite the fact that he fears her and also the fact that he has not given up yet on catching goats.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n:In one episode Wolffy invites his uncle to stay, but he fears losing face in front of him because of Wolnie's violence. He convinces his wife to pretend to be submissive while the uncle was there. However, at the end of the episode when the uncle leaves, Wolnie gives him a good thrashing \"to compensate for all the time she missed out on hitting him\".\n\n'''Wolnie'''<ref name=\"CharactListENG\"/> ({{zh|c=\u7ea2\u592a\u72fc|p=H\u00f3ng T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Red Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Zhao Na\n:The [[narcissistic]] wife of Wolffy, who dresses in a red robe with black and white trims.  She is over-demanding and abusive towards her husband, hitting him with her [[frying pan]] whenever his schemes fail; however, she does genuinely love her husband. She is actually very smart and while her husband can think of outlandish inventions to catch goats, her simple ideas are the ones that are actually successful.\n\n'''Howie''' or '''Wilie'''<ref name=\"ZhangZuo\">Zhang, Jin and Zuo Likun. \"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-04/24/content_9770127.htm Schools begin again in quake-hit region].\" ''[[China Daily]]''.

He is a cute cub with two big eyes. He is approximately 2-6 years old in human years. He is a rather large crybaby, but is very innocent. He likes to go out hunting with his father but gets lost most of the time.  He plays a large role in the first movie, ''The Super Adventure'', as well as in the second movie, ''Desert Trek: The Adventure of the Lost Totem'', the third movie, ''Moon Castle: The Space Adventure'', and the newly released fourth movie, ''Mission Incredible: Adventures on the Dragon's Trail''.\n:He also forms a (mostly) one-sided friendship with Paddi, and affectionately calls him \"Brother Paddi\". Their relationship is highlighted in the second and fifth movie. He has an attachment on Paddi, but he likes the other goats, such as dressing Weslie as \"Brother Weslie,\" and Tibbie as \"Sister Tibbie\", and so on. \n:After he is expelled from the Wolf school, his father reluctantly enrolls him in the goat school, where he becomes friends with all the other goats, occasionally aiding them in their struggle against Wolffy.\n\n'''Huang Tailang''' ({{zh|c=\u9ec4\u592a\u72fc|p=Hu\u00e1ng T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Yellow Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Zhang Lin\n:Wolffy's Grandfather. Like his grandson, he is often abused by his wife (usually via getting things thrown at his head).\n\n'''Hei Tailang''' ({{zh|c=\u9ed1\u592a\u72fc|p=H\u0113i T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Black Wolf}})\n:Wolffy's Father. He was the previous villain of Goat Village before the goats found a way to hex him with a cursed invention, resulting in his falling into a burning fire and meeting his end.\n\n'''Jay''' ({{zh|c=\u8549\u592a\u72fc|p=Ji\u0101o T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Banana Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Liu Hongyun\n:He is a large, mild-mannered wolf who is a vegetarian obsessed with bananas.  He befriends Jonie, who likes to provide him with bananas. He was forced to marry Fragrant Wolf but after he realizes Fragrant was a cruel as Wolnie when they were at the Central Carnival Park, he decided not to and fled from his wedding saying, \"I DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" (Even Wolffy warned him not to marry Fragrant because he got married the exact same way with his wife as Banana almost married Fragrant.) He is the nephew of Wolffy.\n\n'''Xiang Tailang''' ({{zh|c=\u9999\u592a\u72fc|p=Xi\u0101ng T\u00e0il\u00e1ng|l=Fragrant Wolf}})\n:Voiced by: Deng Yuting\n:Xiang Tailang is the cousin of Wolnie. She is a young female wolf with rainbow hoop earrings and a pink dress. She has a crush on Jay, and almost marries him, but ends up marrying Ye Tailang (Wolffy's cousin) at her wedding, who was secretly in love with her. Her name is probably a reference to [[Xiang Fei]], a favored concubine of the Qianlong Emperor. Her weapon tends to be two irons, as shown in the episode the sisters receive a mysterious apple. She is very cruel, much like her cousin Wolnie.\n\n'''Wu Dalang''' ({{zh|c=\u6b66\u5927\u72fc|p=W\u01d4 D\u00e0l\u00e1ng|l=Martial Wolf}})\n:The ancestor of the wolf clan and the archrival of Mandy. In episode 499, it was revealed that he was the one who gave Wolffy his scar during a time traveling shenanigan.\n\n===Others===\n''' Crazy Brother''' ({{zh|c=\u6f47\u6d12\u54e5|p=Xi\u0101os\u01ce G\u0113|l=Cool Bro}})\n:Voiced by: Zu Liqing\n:Crazy Brother is an egg with a face. He has a carefree and easygoing personality but is not always intelligent. An occult enthusiast and a joker, his catch phrase is \"I'll put a curse on you!\" while drawing circles into the ground with a stick. (Once, the drawn circle lit up and granted him powers to shoot laser beams out of his hands.) He enjoys teasing Paddi's pet by saying: \"you unfinished egg!\" Crazy Brother also has many costumes that he changes into in special occasions. He and his brother can merge and become an ultimate powerful egg. (When this happens, the resulting combination looks like Crazy Brother but with a red cape and a red underwear on his head.)\n'''Black Commander''' ({{zh|c=\u9ed1\u5927\u5e05|p=H\u0113i D\u00e0shu\u00e0i}})\n:Voiced by: Gao Quansheng\n:Crazy Brother's [[Century egg|black-egg]] younger brother. Has lightning powers and was evil for some time and was a team with Wolffy.\n'''Big Humphrey''' ({{zh|c=\u5305\u5305\u5927\u4eba|p=B\u0101ob\u0101o D\u00e0r\u00e9n|Lord Bobo}})\n:Voiced by: Gao Quansheng\n:An elephant that serves as the mayor and chief of justice of Green Green Grassland, which encompasses the Goat Village and the Wolf Castle as well as all the other places of residence in Green Green Grassland. His character is a parody of [[Bao Zheng]], a Chinese figure revered for his fairness and judicial judgment in court.\n'''Tai Ge''' ({{zh|c=\u6cf0\u54e5|p=T\u00e0i G\u0113|l=Ti Bro}})\n:Voiced by: Gao Quansheng\n:A Tiger, so far the only tiger in the series, strong, well-muscled, loves to show off his muscles. His name is a play on the English word ''Tiger''. It also sounds similar to the Chinese rendering of boxer [[Mike Tyson]].\n'''Flat-beak Allen''' ({{zh|c=\u6241\u5634\u4f26|p=Bi\u01cen Zu\u01d0l\u00fan|l=Flat-mouth Lun}})\n:A rather narcissistic duck. He is a superstar singer and often holds concerts at the Green-Green Grassland. Wolffy is a great fan of his, in one episode dressing in drag to get his autograph. But this is often contradicted, such as in the episode where Wolffy kidnaps Bian Zui Lun, shaves him and uses his fur to dress up as him and gain access to the goats. His name is parody of Zhou Jielun ([[Jay Chou]]).\n\n===Pets===\n*\u559c\u559c (X\u01d0x\u01d0, \"Happy\")\n:Weslie's pet (a small bouncing horse).\n*\u7f8e\u7f8e (M\u011bim\u011bi, \"Fuzzy\")\n:Tibbie's pet (a tank and dog combined).\n*\u86cb\u86cb (D\u00e0ndan, \"Egg\")\n:Paddi's pet (a flat hard-boiled egg who can fit into small openings).\n*\u6253\u6253 (D\u01ced\u01ce, \"Hittie\")\n:Sparky's pet (a pair of boxing gloves who actually wear \"Fit\").\n*\u6696\u6696 (Nu\u01cennu\u01cen, \"Warmy\")\n:Jonie's pet (a bird who can create a strong wind by flapping her wings).\n\n==Media==\n===Donghua===\n{{main|List of Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!width=\"5%\"|Season\n!width=\"20%\"|Title\n!width=\"5%\"|Total Episodes\n!Premiere Date\n!width=\"10%\"|Premiere Platform\n!width=\"10%\"|Directed by\n!Opening Theme\n!Ending Theme\n|-\n!1\n|''Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf''\n|530\n|August 3, 2005\n|Children's Channel, Hangzhou Television \u2192 [[Zhejiang Television]] (ZJTV)\n|Huang Weiming\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Ivy Koo\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Ivy Koo\n|-\n!2\n|''Pleasant Goat Sports Game''\n|60\n|October 23, 2008\n|[[CCTV-14]]\n|Huang Weiming\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Ivy Koo\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Ivy Koo\n|-\n!3\n|''Joys of Seasons''\n|100\n|May 1, 2010\n|ZJTV\n|Huang Xiaoxue\n|\"Biekan Wo Zhi Shi Yizhi Yang\"<br />by Yang Peiyi\n|\"Dajia Yiqi Xiyangyang\"<br />by Bibi Zhou\n|-\n!4\n|''Around the World in 20 Days''\n|20\n|August 1, 2010\n|BesTV IPTV Platform\n|Huang Xiaoxue\n|None\n|None\n|-\n!5\n|''Smart Dodging''\n|60\n|July 1, 2011\n|ZJTV\n|Tan Shujun\n|\"Qisimiaoxiang Xi Yangyang\"<br />by Xiyangyang Tongxing Hechangtuan\n|\"Qisimiaoxiang Xi Yangyang\"<br />by Xiyangyang Tongxing Hechangtuan\n|-\n!6\n|''Happy, Happy, Bang!

Like the WWE Championship belt, the center plate is a large cut out of the WWE logo with diamonds sitting inside an irregular heptagonal plate, but with the capital words \"Universal Champion\" in small print sitting underneath the logo. Just the same, there are gold divider bars that separate the center plate from its two side plates. Each side plate features the same default removable center section as the WWE Championship (the WWE logo over a red globe), which can be customized with the champion's logo.<ref name=\"originaldesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2016/gallery/wwe-universal-championship-photos#fid-40044827|title=An up-close look at the all-new WWE Universal Championship: photos|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=August 21, 2016|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The most prominent difference is the belt's strap, the color of which indicates the brand it is exclusive to. When the belt was first unveiled at SummerSlam 2016, the strap was red to symbolize its exclusivity to the Raw brand, and the underline of the WWE logo on the center plate was black to make it visible (essentially the reverse of the WWE Championship belt).<ref name=\"originaldesign\"/> After the title became exclusive to SmackDown in late 2019, Bray Wyatt introduced a blue strap variation and the underline of the WWE logo was changed from black to red.<ref name=\"SmackDown11152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/11/15/11-15-wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-powells-review-of-big-e-and-kofi-kingston-vs-the-revival-for-the-smackdown-tag-titles-daniel-bryan-on-miz-tv-bayley-vs-nikki-cross-mustafa-ali-and-shor/|title=11/15 WWE Friday Night Smackdown results: Powell's review of Big E and Kofi Kingston vs. The Revival for the Smackdown Tag Titles, Daniel Bryan on Miz TV, Bayley vs. Nikki Cross, Mustafa Ali and Shorty G put their Team Smackdown spots on the line vs. Robert Roode and Dolph Ziggler|date=November 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/gallery/new-look-universal-title-the-fiend-bray-wyatt#fid-40400419|title=Universal Title turns blue with \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt's reign: photos|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to the SmackDown version of the belt, Wyatt also introduced a custom version of the championship for his \"Fiend\" character on the November 29 episode of ''SmackDown''.<ref name=\"SmackDown11292019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/11/29/11-29-wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-powells-review-of-a-new-face-in-bray-wyatts-firefly-funhouse-new-days-open-challenge-for-a-smackdown-tag-title-match-roman-reigns-opening-the-show/|title=11/29 WWE Friday Night Smackdown results: Powell's review of a new face in Bray Wyatt's Firefly Funhouse, New Day's open challenge for a Smackdown Tag Title match, Roman Reigns opening the show|date=November 29, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 30, 2019}}</ref> The custom belt featured The Fiend's face in the place of the center plate.

Like the WWE Championship belt, the center plate is a large cut out of the WWE logo with diamonds sitting inside an irregular heptagonal plate, but with the capital words \"Universal Champion\" in small print sitting underneath the logo. Just the same, there are gold divider bars that separate the center plate from its two side plates. Each side plate features the same default removable center section as the WWE Championship (the WWE logo over a red globe), which can be customized with the champion's logo.<ref name=\"originaldesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2016/gallery/wwe-universal-championship-photos#fid-40044827|title=An up-close look at the all-new WWE Universal Championship: photos|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=August 21, 2016|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The most prominent difference is the belt's strap, the color of which indicates the brand it is exclusive to. When the belt was first unveiled at SummerSlam 2016, the strap was red to symbolize its exclusivity to the Raw brand, and the underline of the WWE logo on the center plate was black to make it visible (essentially the reverse of the WWE Championship belt).<ref name=\"originaldesign\"/> After the title became exclusive to SmackDown in late 2019, Bray Wyatt introduced a blue strap variation and the underline of the WWE logo was changed from black to red.<ref name=\"SmackDown11152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/11/15/11-15-wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-powells-review-of-big-e-and-kofi-kingston-vs-the-revival-for-the-smackdown-tag-titles-daniel-bryan-on-miz-tv-bayley-vs-nikki-cross-mustafa-ali-and-shor/|title=11/15 WWE Friday Night Smackdown results: Powell's review of Big E and Kofi Kingston vs. The Revival for the Smackdown Tag Titles, Daniel Bryan on Miz TV, Bayley vs. Nikki Cross, Mustafa Ali and Shorty G put their Team Smackdown spots on the line vs. Robert Roode and Dolph Ziggler|date=November 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/gallery/new-look-universal-title-the-fiend-bray-wyatt#fid-40400419|title=Universal Title turns blue with \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt's reign: photos|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to the SmackDown version of the belt, Wyatt also introduced a custom version of the championship for his \"Fiend\" character on the November 29 episode of ''SmackDown''.<ref name=\"SmackDown11292019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/11/29/11-29-wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-powells-review-of-a-new-face-in-bray-wyatts-firefly-funhouse-new-days-open-challenge-for-a-smackdown-tag-title-match-roman-reigns-opening-the-show/|title=11/29 WWE Friday Night Smackdown results: Powell's review of a new face in Bray Wyatt's Firefly Funhouse, New Day's open challenge for a Smackdown Tag Title match, Roman Reigns opening the show|date=November 29, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 30, 2019}}</ref> The custom belt featured The Fiend's face in the place of the center plate.
