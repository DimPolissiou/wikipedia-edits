Many actions aim to build social and political support to limit, and subsequently reduce, the concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], with the goal of [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating climate change]]. Other actions seek to address the ethical and moral aspects of [[climate justice]], especially with regard to the anticipated unequal impacts of [[climate change adaptation]].\n\n== Political action ==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\nPolitical action can change laws and regulations that relate to [[climate change]].\n\n[[Carbon price|Carbon pricing]] methods, such as a [[carbon tax]] or an [[emissions trading]] system, are favored by many economists as the most efficient and effective means to reduce GHG emissions, and are increasingly being deployed around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25160|title=State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2016|last=The World Bank|date=October 2016|website=The World Bank|access-date=4 Feb 2017}}</ref> In the U.S., groups such as the bipartisan legislative Climate Solutions Caucus<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/274061-creating-a-bipartisan-climate-to-discuss-climate|title=Creating a bipartisan climate to discuss climate change in Congress|last=Picard|first=Joe|date=2016-03-24|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref> and the [[Citizens' Climate Lobby]] work to build support for carbon pricing.

Political action from the community, however, is often challenged by interests within the [[fossil-fuel industry]],<ref>Hamilton, Clive (2007), \"[[Scorcher: The Dirty Politics of Climate Change]]\"</ref><ref>[[Paul R.

Political action campaigns require building a base of support at local level.\n\nThere are many facts that point to the existence of [[climate change]]. The plentiful hurricanes, droughts, and fires are all in part due to the ever changing atmosphere caused by climate change. One of the ways in which the human race can get in front of this change is through political action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asyousow.org/our-work/energy/climate-change|title=Climate Change|website=As You Sow|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref> Legislative action is one strategy that politicians are using to combat carbon emissions. The way these laws will come about is via political action. [[Greenhouse gas|Carbon emissions]] are a significant causing factor for climate change and by putting federal regulations such as a carbon tax there will overall be a decrease in carbon emissions. This allows the private sector to decide how to do so cost effectively which in turn benefits the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/content/federal-action-on-climate/|title=Federal Action on Climate|date=2017-10-21|website=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> The private sector is one deciding factor in how governments enact their policies.

[[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) from diverse fields of work have united on this issue. A [[coalition]] of 50 NGOs called [[Stop Climate Chaos]] launched in Britain in 2005 to highlight the issue of climate change.\n\nThe [[Campaign against Climate Change]] was created to focus purely on the issue of climate change and to pressure governments into action by building a protest movement of sufficient magnitude to effect political change.\n\n[[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in various cities around the world wherein [[bicyclist]]s and, less frequently, [[unicycle|unicyclists]], [[skateboard]]ers, [[inline skate]]rs, [[rollerskates|roller skaters]] and other self-propelled commuters take to the streets ''[[en masse]].''

The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC]] (COP21) in [[Paris]] and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.\n\nThe head of the Paris Conference, France's foreign minister [[Laurent Fabius]], called the plan \"ambitious and balanced\" and an \"historic turning point\" in the goal of reducing global warming. [[Paris Agreement#Concerns|Critics note]] that the agreement is not sufficient to achieve the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C warming target, and the lack of any binding enforcement mechanism. Subsequent Conference of the Parties meetings are expected to address shortcomings in the Paris Agreement.\n\nAmid fierce opposition from scientists and other leaders around the world, U.S. President Donald Trump has [[Political positions of Donald Trump#Opposition to international cooperation on climate change|pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement]].\n\n[[Paris Agreement|The Paris Agreement]], which was brought to discussion on November 12, 2016, was made with a goal in mind to unite all countries against the threat of climate change. This argument stipulates that all countries involved contribute financially and regularly report on emissions and the status of national progress. At this point, over half the countries in Convention who were responsible for over half of greenhouse emissions, had ratified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement|title=The Paris Agreement}}</ref>\n\n=== The European Union  ===\n[[File:Secretary Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon Address Reporters.jpg|thumb|Pictured above are US Secretary Kerry and the UN Secretary-General at the COP21 meeting of the UNFCCC in Paris.]]\nUnder the [[Kyoto Protocol]], countries with targets could elect to reach these targets in co-operation with other countries. The [[European Union]] has decided to work as a unit to meet its emissions targets. The European climate change program attempts to do this by utilising an emissions trading scheme known as the [[European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme]]. The principle of this scheme is quite simple: to make their legally binding commitments under Kyoto, countries can either make these savings within their own country, or they can buy these emissions reductions from other countries. These other countries would still need to meet their Kyoto targets, but the use of a [[free market]] system ensures the reductions are made for the least possible costs. Most reductions are made where these reductions are cheapest, and the excess reductions can be sold on to other countries where such cuts would be less economically viable. The EU ETS is arguably the global template for emissions trading schemes that are being implemented globally (China, South Korea, Tokyo and others).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1142/S2345748114500031|title = Framing It Right: China\u2013EU Relations and Patterns of Interaction on Climate Change|journal = Chinese Journal of Urban and Environmental Studies|volume = 02|pages = 1450003|year = 2014|last1 = Gippner|first1 = Olivia}}</ref>\n\nThe commitment of the [[European Union]] to cut back on its excessive green house gas emissions came from the implementation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Since its application, the Doha amendments, which were made to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, have come to regulate this protocol and update the Union's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This second round of the Kyoto Protocol created a legally binding agreement for participating EU countries until 2020. Under this plan, by 2030, there are hopes of the EU cutting their emissions by 40%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/eu-conclude-ratification-second-kyoto-protocol-commitment-period-end-year_en|title=EU to conclude ratification for second Kyoto Protocol commitment period by end of this year}}</ref>\n\n\nStates that become more involving or are and concerned about ability are more than likely to have more consistency; compared to the least become more refrained with agreements that comply decrease of legalization. \u201cEmpirical analyses of ratification of the FCCC and the Kyoto Protocol yield strong support for these propositions\u201d .<ref>{{cite journal |last1=von Stein |first1=Jana |title=The International Law and Politics of Climate Change |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=April 2008 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=243\u2013268 |doi=10.1177/0022002707313692 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002707313692 |issn=0022-0027}}</ref>\n\n=== Contraction and Convergence ===\nThe concept of Cap, [[Contraction and Convergence]] was proposed as a replacement to the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto agreement]]. The idea here is that the limits to carbon emissions need to be capped at 350-450 parts per million, currently{{When|date=October 2019}} considered to produce a raise in world temperatures above pre-industrial levels of between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius. It is currently{{When|date=October 2019}} believed that further increases would bring about major positive feedbacks (the burning of forests and the loss of carbon from soils and oceans) which currently limit greenhouse gas emissions, and would lead to a run-away global warming similar to the [[Eocene]] period, during which there was no ice at the poles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nTo sustain this figure, it has been proposed that on equity grounds, all people should be allocated an equal carbon footprint (currently about 2 tonnes per person, which by 2050 could fall to 1.5 tonnes per person through population increase). World per capita carbon emissions, currently in excess of 4 tonnes per person needs to contract to those levels, if these targets are to be met.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonsense.com/|title=CarbonSense|website=CarbonSense}}</ref> As a result, in the name of global and inter-generational equity, policies needing to be instituted need to converge, over a fixed period towards this figure for every country. A trading regime, whereby which countries in excess of these figures (from example the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US at 20 tonnes per capita]]), purchase [[carbon credit]]s from a country using less than its allocation (e.g. [[Kenya]] at 1.3 tonnes per capita), is considered by many as the best way of solving this problem.\n\nFor example, the Contract and Converge strategy was adopted by India, [[PRC|China]] and many African countries as the basis for future negotiations. The UK [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] said in 2000 \"the [[UK]] should be prepared to accept the contraction and convergence principle is the basis for international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions\".<ref>Meyer, Aubrey (2000), \"Contraction and Convergence:The Global Solution to Climate Change\" Schumacher Briefings 5, published by Green Books on behalf of the [[E. F. Schumacher|Schumacher]] Society</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] met in Paris to negotiate a new agreement. This meeting was the [[COP21|21st Conference of Parties]] (COP21). In this agreement, the goal was to keep temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius. While this goal was seen as progress in the fight against climate change, some more liable countries saw this as unattainable. They also thought some important steps were not taken during this meeting; however, everyone seemed optimistic for the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-ir.info/2016/04/11/climate-change-and-international-relations/|title=Climate Change and International Relations|date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Sub-national level action ==\nSome states, regions, and cities in the world are taking the lead on developing emissions reduction methods in the absence of national policy, and may provide models for future national efforts.

The project touches on five main topics: i) home energy; ii) food; iii) travel; iv) consumption and waste; and v) talking with family and friends. The project understands that individuals often fail to adopt low-carbon lifestyles not because of practical barriers to change (e.g.: there is no renewable energy available), but because of aspects related to their values, emotions, and identity. The project offers a supportive group experience that helps people reduce their personal carbon dioxide emissions by 1 tonne {{CO2}} on average and aim at halving it in the long term. They deal with the difficulties of change by connecting to values, emotions and identity. The groups are based on a [[psychosocial]] understanding of how people change. Groups of 6-8 members meet six or twelve times with trained facilitators in homes, community centres, workplaces or other venues. The meetings create a non-judgmental atmosphere where people are encouraged to make serious lifestyle changes.\n\nCarbon Conversations was cited in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as one of the 20 best ideas to tackle climate change.<ref>Katz, Ian (2009).

The biggest wellspring of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] are from human activities. Around 66% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions are connected to consuming fossil fuels for energy to utilize for warming, power, transport and industry.

Political action campaigns require building a base of support at local level.\n\nThere are many facts that point to the existence of [[climate change]]. The plentiful hurricanes, droughts, and fires are all in part due to the ever changing atmosphere caused by climate change. One of the ways in which the human race can get in front of this change is through political action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asyousow.org/our-work/energy/climate-change|title=Climate Change|website=As You Sow|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref> Legislative action is one strategy that politicians are using to combat carbon emissions. The way these laws will come about is via political action. [[Greenhouse gas|Carbon emissions]] are a significant causing factor for climate change and by putting federal regulations such as a carbon tax there will overall be a decrease in carbon emissions. This allows the private sector to decide how to do so cost effectively which in turn benefits the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/content/federal-action-on-climate/|title=Federal Action on Climate|date=2017-10-21|website=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> The private sector is one deciding factor in how governments enact their policies.

The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC]] (COP21) in [[Paris]] and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.\n\nThe head of the Paris Conference, France's foreign minister [[Laurent Fabius]], called the plan \"ambitious and balanced\" and an \"historic turning point\" in the goal of reducing global warming. [[Paris Agreement#Concerns|Critics note]] that the agreement is not sufficient to achieve the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C warming target, and the lack of any binding enforcement mechanism. Subsequent Conference of the Parties meetings are expected to address shortcomings in the Paris Agreement.\n\nAmid fierce opposition from scientists and other leaders around the world, U.S. President Donald Trump has [[Political positions of Donald Trump#Opposition to international cooperation on climate change|pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement]].\n\n[[Paris Agreement|The Paris Agreement]], which was brought to discussion on November 12, 2016, was made with a goal in mind to unite all countries against the threat of climate change. This argument stipulates that all countries involved contribute financially and regularly report on emissions and the status of national progress. At this point, over half the countries in Convention who were responsible for over half of greenhouse emissions, had ratified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement|title=The Paris Agreement}}</ref>\n\n=== The European Union  ===\n[[File:Secretary Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon Address Reporters.jpg|thumb|Pictured above are US Secretary Kerry and the UN Secretary-General at the COP21 meeting of the UNFCCC in Paris.]]\nUnder the [[Kyoto Protocol]], countries with targets could elect to reach these targets in co-operation with other countries. The [[European Union]] has decided to work as a unit to meet its emissions targets. The European climate change program attempts to do this by utilising an emissions trading scheme known as the [[European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme]]. The principle of this scheme is quite simple: to make their legally binding commitments under Kyoto, countries can either make these savings within their own country, or they can buy these emissions reductions from other countries. These other countries would still need to meet their Kyoto targets, but the use of a [[free market]] system ensures the reductions are made for the least possible costs. Most reductions are made where these reductions are cheapest, and the excess reductions can be sold on to other countries where such cuts would be less economically viable. The EU ETS is arguably the global template for emissions trading schemes that are being implemented globally (China, South Korea, Tokyo and others).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1142/S2345748114500031|title = Framing It Right: China\u2013EU Relations and Patterns of Interaction on Climate Change|journal = Chinese Journal of Urban and Environmental Studies|volume = 02|pages = 1450003|year = 2014|last1 = Gippner|first1 = Olivia}}</ref>\n\nThe commitment of the [[European Union]] to cut back on its excessive green house gas emissions came from the implementation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Since its application, the Doha amendments, which were made to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, have come to regulate this protocol and update the Union's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This second round of the Kyoto Protocol created a legally binding agreement for participating EU countries until 2020. Under this plan, by 2030, there are hopes of the EU cutting their emissions by 40%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/eu-conclude-ratification-second-kyoto-protocol-commitment-period-end-year_en|title=EU to conclude ratification for second Kyoto Protocol commitment period by end of this year}}</ref>\n\n=== Contraction and Convergence ===\nThe concept of Cap, [[Contraction and Convergence]] was proposed as a replacement to the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto agreement]]. The idea here is that the limits to carbon emissions need to be capped at 350-450 parts per million, currently{{When|date=October 2019}} considered to produce a raise in world temperatures above pre-industrial levels of between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius. It is currently{{When|date=October 2019}} believed that further increases would bring about major positive feedbacks (the burning of forests and the loss of carbon from soils and oceans) which currently limit greenhouse gas emissions, and would lead to a run-away global warming similar to the [[Eocene]] period, during which there was no ice at the poles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nTo sustain this figure, it has been proposed that on equity grounds, all people should be allocated an equal carbon footprint (currently about 2 tonnes per person, which by 2050 could fall to 1.5 tonnes per person through population increase). World per capita carbon emissions, currently in excess of 4 tonnes per person needs to contract to those levels, if these targets are to be met.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonsense.com/|title=CarbonSense|website=CarbonSense}}</ref> As a result, in the name of global and inter-generational equity, policies needing to be instituted need to converge, over a fixed period towards this figure for every country. A trading regime, whereby which countries in excess of these figures (from example the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US at 20 tonnes per capita]]), purchase [[carbon credit]]s from a country using less than its allocation (e.g. [[Kenya]] at 1.3 tonnes per capita), is considered by many as the best way of solving this problem.\n\nFor example, the Contract and Converge strategy was adopted by India, [[PRC|China]] and many African countries as the basis for future negotiations. The UK [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] said in 2000 \"the [[UK]] should be prepared to accept the contraction and convergence principle is the basis for international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions\".<ref>Meyer, Aubrey (2000), \"Contraction and Convergence:The Global Solution to Climate Change\" Schumacher Briefings 5, published by Green Books on behalf of the [[E. F. Schumacher|Schumacher]] Society</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] met in Paris to negotiate a new agreement. This meeting was the [[COP21|21st Conference of Parties]] (COP21). In this agreement, the goal was to keep temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius. While this goal was seen as progress in the fight against climate change, some more liable countries saw this as unattainable.

The project touches on five main topics: i) home energy; ii) food; iii) travel; iv) consumption and waste; and v) talking with family and friends. The project understands that individuals often fail to adopt low-carbon lifestyles not because of practical barriers to change (e.g.: there is no renewable energy available), but because of aspects related to their values, emotions, and identity. The project offers a supportive group experience that helps people reduce their personal carbon dioxide emissions by 1 tonne {{CO2}} on average and aim at halving it in the long term. They deal with the difficulties of change by connecting to values, emotions and identity. The groups are based on a [[psychosocial]] understanding of how people change. Groups of 6-8 members meet six or twelve times with trained facilitators in homes, community centres, workplaces or other venues. The meetings create a non-judgmental atmosphere where people are encouraged to make serious lifestyle changes.\n\nCarbon Conversations was cited in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as one of the 20 best ideas to tackle climate change.<ref>Katz, Ian (2009).

The biggest wellspring of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] are from human activities. Around 66% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions are connected to consuming fossil fuels for energy to utilize for warming, power, transport and industry.

It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's \nsubjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve, and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only element, of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nTheir one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]\nPius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>\n\nGreat efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>\n[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]\n\n=== Protestants and Jews ===\n{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}\nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>\n\nIn 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.\n\n==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==\n\n===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.

The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854, a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve, and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only element, of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nTheir one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]\nPius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>\n\nGreat efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>\n[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]\n\n=== Protestants and Jews ===\n{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}\nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>\n\nIn 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.\n\n==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==\n\n===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eJustice:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States_under_Pope_Pius_IX"}

[[Kalamaki, Zakynthos|Kalamaki]]. Kalamaki beach is part of the [[National Marine Park of Zakynthos]]. The endangered loggerhead sea turtles (''[[Caretta caretta]]'') lay their eggs at the beaches of the marine park at night during the summer months. This has resulted in aircraft movement restrictions. Flights are not permitted to take off or land between 10:00PM to 5:00AM. It is at the jurisdiction of the Greek authorities to allow aircraft movements at night under extenuating circumstances. The airport opened in 1972.<ref>http://www.alxd.gr/AirportGuide/zakinthos/zakinthosE.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> An expansion of the airport's apron area to 35,100 m\u00b2 was completed in 2003, and a new 22,150 m\u00b2 terminal building was completed in 2008. The airport is 4.3&nbsp;km from [[Zakynthos]] town and other seaside tourist destinations such as [[Laganas]], [[Tsilivi]] and [[Kalamaki, Zakynthos|Kalamaki]]. The main approach into the airport is Runway 34. Aircraft usually have to fly over [[Laganas]] bay and make a 180-degree turn, before their final approach over sunbathing tourists on the busy [[Kalamaki, Zakynthos|Kalamaki]] beach.\n\n== Future of
