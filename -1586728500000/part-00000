Emil Dela Rosa mixed and mastered the album with Billy Reyes at the House of Billy Gaga Studios. \"Cha-Ching!\" was one of the first songs to be recorded and utilized heavy synths, percussion tracks, and vocal stacks. Among the first tracks as well was \"Midnight Sky\" which used a Shure SM57 and an AKG C414 XLS for mics. The song is one of the more minimalist in the album, alongside \"Apoy ng Kandila\". The tracks \"Jules\" and \"Goodnight Prayer\" were mixed to mimic the panning effects of records during the early days of stereo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/unique-album-grandma-oc-records-emil-dela-rosa|first=Kara|last=Bodegon|title=Unique's solo debut album Grandma: a track-by-track guide by Emil Dela Rosa|date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = Unique\n| extra_column = \n| title1 = M\n| writer1 = Unique Salonga\n| extra1 = \n| length1 = 0:34\n| title2 = Cha-Ching!\n| writer2 = Salonga\n| extra2 = \n| length2 = 2:40\n| title3 = OZONE (Itulak Ang Pinto)\n| writer3 = Salonga\n| extra3 = \n| length3 = 3:34\n| title4 = Jules\n| writer4 = Salonga\n| extra4 = \n| length4 = 4:22\n| title5 = I'll Break Your Little Heart\n| writer5 = Salonga\n| extra5 = \n| length5 = 4:25\n| title6 = Sino\n| writer6 = Salonga\n| extra6 = \n| length6 = 4:40\n| title7 = Paalala:\n| writer7 = Salonga\n| extra7 = \n| length7 = 1:05\n| title8 = Goodnight Prayer\n| writer8 = Salonga\n| extra8 = \n| length8 = 5:19\n| title9 = Midnight Sky\n| writer9 = Salonga\n| extra9 = \n| length9 = 4:04\n| title10 = Apoy Ng Kandila\n| writer10 = Salonga\n| extra10 = \n| length10 = 4:25\n| title11 = We Know\n| writer11 = Salonga\n| extra11 = \n| length11 = 6:14\n| title12 = My Old Friend\n| writer12 = Salonga\n| extra12 = \n| length12 = 2:07\n| total_length = \n}}\n\n==Accolades==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Award\n!Category\n!Notable Works\n!Result\n! class=\"unsortable\"| {{abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2019\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 32nd [[Awit Award]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | Best Cover Art\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | \"Grandma\"\n| {{Won}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | <ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/07/23/19/awit-awards-2019-full-list-of-nominees|title=Awit Awards 2019: Full list of nominees|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=23 July 2019|accessdate=18 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/242299-list-winners-awit-awards-2019|title=FULL LIST: Winners, Awit Awards 2019|publisher=Rappler|date=11 October 2019|accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2018 debut albums]]\n[[Category:Viva Records (Philippines) albums]]\n", "name_user": "Alexander marshall 07", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandma_(Unique_album)"}

He had come to Rome to visit his sister Hayley  for the weekend and Dina had also come to visit Hayley. Before he can kiss Dina, Greg, Jack's dorm roommate from university bumps into them. Realising that Jack is also headed towards the airport, Greg offers him a ride and Jack is unable to kiss Dina or even say a proper goodbye. Saying an awkward goodbye, both men leave with Jack upset. \n\n3 years later, Jack is at his sister Hayley's wedding. Bryan ([[Joel Fry (actor)|Joel Fry]]), the maid of honor is more worried about being called the maid of honor, being seated next to Vitelli and not being seated next to Rebecca ([[Aisling Bea]]), rather than helping out the bride. He is late for the wedding ceremony because he decides to get a haircut to better prepare himself for his meeting with Vitelli. Hayley has chosen to not seat Bryan with Vitelli as she has seated all the English people on the English table, a table on which Amanda ([[Freida Pinto]]) Jack's 'nightmare of an ex-girlfriend\". \n\nAmanda has come to the wedding with her boyfriend Chaz, ([[Allan Mustafa (actor)|Allan Mustafa]]) who she has clear commitment issues with (He proposed 6 months ago and she's still 'thinking' about it). Other friends of Hayley include frank and annoying Rebecca and socially awkward Sidney ([[Tim Key]]). Rebecca, upon meeting Chaz, accidentally mistakes him for a cabaret act and mentions that Amanda called Chaz a \"Dickhead\". Sidney has worn a kilt to the wedding, despite not being Scottish and becomes easily uncomfortable in it.  \n\nAs Hayley and Jack's parents are dead, Hayley has asked Jack to walk her down the aisle. Just as they are about to, Hayley tells Jack that Dina has come to the wedding and is single.  After the wedding, Sidney and approaches Dina, which leads to an uncomfortable conversation between the two and ends with Sidney leaving to get some champgane for the both of them despite Dina not wanting any. Meanwhile Jack and Bryan are talking about how Bryan will create a good first impression on Vitelli, when Bryan learns that he has to make a maid of honor speech. Rebecca joins the conversation and while she continues to compliment him, Jack sees Dina for the first time in 3 years. Both of them talk and they confess to one another that they used to ask Hayley about the other. \n\nMarc ([[Jack Farthing]]), Hayley's school classmate arrives at the wedding venue high on coke and plans to ruin the wedding. Hayley confronts Marc and asks him to leave. Their talk is interrupted by Roberto, Hayley's now husband and he ends up having Marc stay for the celebrations. \n\nHayley tells Jack to drug Marc with her sleeping drops but some children mess around and rearrange the seating order.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Sam Claflin]] as Jack (the brother)\n*[[Olivia Munn]] as Dina \n*[[Aisling Bea]] as Rebecca\n*[[Freida Pinto]] as Amanda\n*[[Eleanor Tomlinson]] as Hayley (the sister)\n*[[Joel Fry (actor)|Joel Fry]] as Bryan\n*[[Allan Mustafa (actor)|Allan Mustafa]] as Chaz\n*[[Jack Farthing]] as Marc\n*[[Tim Key]] as Sidney\n*Tiziano Caputo as Roberto\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was announced in April 2019, with [[Olivia Munn]], [[Sam Claflin]], [[Freida Pinto]] and [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] cast.
