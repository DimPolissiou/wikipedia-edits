Its headquarters are in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].\n\n== Staff size ==\nCDCR is the 3rd largest law enforcement agency in the United States behind the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) \nwhich is an arm of Dept of Homeland Security (DHS), and the [[New York City Police Department]], which employ approximately 66,000 federal officers and 42,000 police officers respectively. CDCR correctional officers are sworn law enforcement officers with peace officer powers.\n\nAs of 2013, CDCR employed approximately 24,000 peace officers (state correctional officers), 1,800 state parole agents, and 200 criminal investigators/special agents.\n\n\n\n'''Secretary Ralph Diaz'''\n\nRalph Diaz was appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom as Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) on March 27, 2019. Most recently, he served as Undersecretary of Operations, Deputy Director of Facility Operations, and Associate Director of High Security Institutions. Before that, Mr. Diaz served as a prison Warden, Correctional Counselor Supervisor, and Correctional Counselor, after starting his career as a Correctional Officer in 1991. \n\nMr. Diaz has the honor and privilege to lead over 60,000 of the nation\u2019s finest correctional professionals, who provide outstanding levels of rehabilitative services to the offenders in our care. \n\nWith more than 29 years of diverse correctional experience, Mr. Diaz has seen first-hand how restorative justice practices can transform communities inside and outside prison walls. He believes in a holistic approach to corrections that offers a variety of educational, vocational, and therapeutic programs to offenders while also stressing individual accountability and respecting and honoring victims of crime.\n\nMr. Diaz has been instrumental in developing policies focused on staff well-being and professional development, while empowering them to serve as role models and mentors to all.\n\n==History==\nIn 1851, California activated its first state-run institution.

Selected prisons within the state are equipped with security housing units, reception centers, and/or \"condemned\" units.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates. As a result, the court ruled in June 2005 and issued an order on October 3, 2005 putting the CDCR's medical health care delivery system in [[receivership]], citing the \"depravity\" of the system.<ref>{{cite news | first= James | last= Sterngold | title= U.S. seizes state prison health care | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/07/01/MNGOCDHPP71.DTL | work= San Francisco Chronicle | date= July 5, 2005 | accessdate=December 21, 2007 }}</ref> In February 2006, the judge appointed Robert Sillen to the position<ref>{{cite news | first= Solomon | last= Moore | title= Using Muscle to Improve Health Care for Prisoners | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/us/27prisons.html | work= New York Times | date=August 27, 2007 | accessdate=December 21, 2007 }}</ref> and Sillen was replaced by J.

CDCR correctional officers are sworn law enforcement officers with peace officer powers.\n\nAs of 2013, CDCR employed approximately 24,000 peace officers (state correctional officers), 1,800 state parole agents, and 200 criminal investigators/special agents.\n\n\n'''Secretary Ralph Diaz'''\n\nRalph Diaz was appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom as Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) on March 27, 2019. Most recently, he served as Undersecretary of Operations, Deputy Director of Facility Operations, and Associate Director of High Security Institutions. Before that, Mr. Diaz served as a prison Warden, Correctional Counselor Supervisor, and Correctional Counselor, after starting his career as a Correctional Officer in 1991. \n\nMr. Diaz has the honor and privilege to lead over 60,000 of the nation\u2019s finest correctional professionals, who provide outstanding levels of rehabilitative services to the offenders in our care. \n\nWith more than 29 years of diverse correctional experience, Mr. Diaz has seen first-hand how restorative justice practices can transform communities inside and outside prison walls. He believes in a holistic approach to corrections that offers a variety of educational, vocational, and therapeutic programs to offenders while also stressing individual accountability and respecting and honoring victims of crime.\n\nMr. Diaz has been instrumental in developing policies focused on staff well-being and professional development, while empowering them to serve as role models and mentors to all.\n\n==History==\nIn 1851, California activated its first state-run institution.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]].

Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation).

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

They drew together until only two miles divided them: and then, towering gradually till their parallel parapets must have been a thousand feet above us, ran forward in an avenue for miles.

Around and about were Arab scratches, including tribe-marks, some of which were witnesses of forgotten migrations: but my attention was only for the splashing of water in a crevice under the shadow of the overhanging rock. I looked in to see the spout, a little thinner than my wrist, jetting out firmly from a fissure in the roof, and falling with that clean sound into a shallow, frothing pool, behind the step which served as entrance.

It is operated and preserved as a museum by the [http://www.crt.state.la.us/louisiana-state-parks/ Louisiana Office of State Parks] as the '''Centenary State Historic Site''', offering educational interpretive programs and guided tours.\n\n==The College of Louisiana 1825-1844==\nIn 1825, the Louisiana Legislature chartered four public colleges.  One of these was the College of Louisiana at Jackson, a small town on the border of East and West Feliciana Parishes.  Despite the tireless efforts of the trustees to maintain a college of the finest repute, in its 20-year history, the college only produced 24 graduates.  Its main contributions to the future of the campus were the East and West Wing dormitories, two impressive brick barracks-style structures built between 1832 and 1837.\n\n==Centenary College of Louisiana 1845-1861==\nSeveral institutions of higher learning sprouted in and around Jackson in the autumn of 1845, somewhat as a result of Centenary College of Louisiana's opening at that time. (Centenary College, a Methodist church-affiliated institution, was founded in Mississippi in 1839; then it relocated to Louisiana.)<ref name=ladoc>{{cite web|url=https://www.crt.state.la.us/dataprojects/hp/nhl/attachments/Parish19/Scans/19005001.pdf|title=Centenary College/The College of Louisiana|publisher=State of Louisiana's Division of Historic Preservation |author= |date=|accessdate=May 18, 2018}} with [https://www.crt.state.la.us/dataprojects/hp/nhl/view.asp?ID=276 three photos and a map]</ref><ref name=nrhpdoc>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=79001062}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form: Centenary College|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Mamie Austin Rouzan|date=|accessdate=May 18, 2018}} With {{NRHP url|id=79001062|photos=y|title=four photos from 1978}}.</ref>\n\nThe Episcopal women's academy, the Southern Institute for Young Ladies, opened the year before, under the direction of Rev. William B. Lacey\u2014who had been a president of the College of Louisiana.  The school continued in operation until 1860. The Feliciana Female Collegiate Institute opened in 1847, led by the Methodist Episcopal Rev. Benjamin Jones and his wife.  It also continued until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=ladoc/><ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nThe greatest event of the social calendar in antebellum Jackson was Centenary's annual commencement.  The small town was pushed to its limits at that time, as dignitaries from across the state and region crowded its hotels and private homes for the occasion.  More people than usual were in attendance for the 1856 commencement, as it included the ceremony of placing the cornerstone for the college's new Centre Building.\n\nIncluded in this building were all offices, classrooms, laboratories, debate halls, etc.  The building also featured a 3,000-volume library, and an auditorium which seated between two and three thousand.  When completed, the structure dwarfed the dormitories upon either side (pictured).<ref name=ladoc/><ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nThe completion of the Centre Building marked the high-water mark of Centenary's tenure in Jackson.  However, it was fated to be short-lived.  Less than three years after the building was completed, the college closed, the vast majority of its students having joined the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]].  The last entry in the minutes of the Board of Trustees in 1861 reads \"Students have all gone to War\u2014College suspended, and God Help the Right!\"\n\n==Civil War period==\nAlthough no longer a college, Centenary's campus was not altogether abandoned.  The preparatory department continued for some time, and upon its closing the campus was transformed into a Confederate hospital.  More than 500 Confederate soldiers \u2014 mostly from the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] \u2014 were treated at the Centenary hospital.  Some eighty of those sent to Centenary died there; they were buried in a cemetery on the grounds.\n\nAfter the fall of [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]], Centenary was taken over by the [[Union Army]], and used as a [[field hospital]], supply depot, and recruiting post \u2014 primarily for the [[United States Colored Troops]].  A large contingent of [[Confederate States Army]] [[cavalry]] was sent to disrupt the recruiting practices, resulting in the largest battle to occur within the town limits of Jackson.  The Confederates suffered minimal casualties, routed Union forces, and captured ammunition and other supplies.  The Union Army suffered nearly one-third of its garrison detachment killed or wounded.\n\n==Postwar struggle 1865-1908==\nCentenary College of Louisiana reopened in the autumn of 1865, in a completely different world than the one that had forced its closing four years earlier.  Whereas in 1861 there had been \"[[secession]] fever,\" and [[King Cotton|cotton was king]], there was now nothing.  The people that had been among the wealthiest in the country were reduced to selling wool and eggs.  Those who had previously sent their sons to Centenary either could no longer afford to, or they no longer had sons to send.\n\nFaced with these dire straits, the president of the college would often be away for months at a time.  He would go door-to-door, soliciting financial support, or he'd visit as many Methodist congregations as he could, \"passing the hat\"\u2014all to little avail.\n\nThe desperation reached the point of not being able to compensate the professors.  The policy was, in short: if the college had the money, the professors would be paid.  To make up for this deficiency, in the late 1890s five professors' cottages were constructed.  The sole extant cottage is one of the most visible features of the campus today.\n\nAnother move made during the 1890s to boost enrollment was the admittance of female students.  The ladies were not originally given degrees or diplomas.  They were given certificates of attendance, which, in essence, meant they were qualified to teach school.  The first degree was conferred upon a female graduate in 1901.\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn 1903, the prominent Methodist citizens of [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], offered Centenary {{convert|17|acre|m2}}, a brand new facility, and a sizeable monetary grant if they would relocate.  Given the college's difficulty in procuring financial support where they were, and the several attractive opportunities Shreveport presented, it was not a matter of ''if'' they would move, but ''when''.  This turned out to be 1906, although the college was not there in its entirety until 1908.\n\nAfter the college's departure, the campus sat unused for fifteen years.  In the mid-1920s it was used as a tuberculosis hospital.  But by 1935, the campus was in a state of extreme disrepair, and on the brink of condemnation.  The three buildings had three different owners, two of whom chose to sell the rights for demolition.  The East Wing and Centre Building were both demolished, and the salvageable materials from them were sold for scrap.  There were many buildings constructed in that time in southeast Louisiana whose materials included those of the main academic building.  The Old Centenary Inn\u2014currently a [[bed and breakfast]]\u2014in Jackson was built entirely from the remains of the East Wing dormitory.\n\nThe West Wing remained standing because its owners had come up with a way to make it far more lucrative than just knocking it down.  From 1938 to 1965, the West Wing Dormitory was low-income housing.  The campus itself was used as a trailer park.  To this day, there are visible remnants of the residences that were here during that time.\n\nIn the 1970s, the only use the campus saw was a baseball field, which happened to be on the site of the College's baseball field more than 80 years earlier.  In 1977, not long before it was to be demolished, the West Wing was saved due to the efforts of many influential citizens in and around Jackson.

One of these was the College of Louisiana at Jackson, a small town on the border of East and West Feliciana Parishes.  Despite the tireless efforts of the trustees to maintain a college of the finest repute, in its 20-year history, the college only produced 24 graduates.  Its main contributions to the future of the campus were the East and West Wing dormitories, two impressive brick barracks-style structures built between 1832 and 1837.\n\n==Centenary College of Louisiana 1845-1861==\nSeveral institutions of higher learning sprouted in and around Jackson in the autumn of 1845, somewhat as a result of Centenary College of Louisiana's opening at that time. (Centenary College, a Methodist church-affiliated institution, was founded in Mississippi in 1839; then it relocated to Louisiana.)<ref name=ladoc>{{cite web|url=https://www.crt.state.la.us/dataprojects/hp/nhl/attachments/Parish19/Scans/19005001.pdf|title=Centenary College/The College of Louisiana|publisher=State of Louisiana's Division of Historic Preservation |author= |date=|accessdate=May 18, 2018}} with [https://www.crt.state.la.us/dataprojects/hp/nhl/view.asp?ID=276 three photos and a map]</ref><ref name=nrhpdoc>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=79001062}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form: Centenary College|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Mamie Austin Rouzan|date=|accessdate=May 18, 2018}} With {{NRHP url|id=79001062|photos=y|title=four photos from 1978}}.</ref>\n\nThe Episcopal women's academy, the Southern Institute for Young Ladies, opened the year before, under the direction of Rev. William B. Lacey\u2014who had been a president of the College of Louisiana.  The school continued in operation until 1860. The Feliciana Female Collegiate Institute opened in 1847, led by the Methodist Episcopal Rev. Benjamin Jones and his wife.  It also continued until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=ladoc/><ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nThe greatest event of the social calendar in antebellum Jackson was Centenary's annual commencement.  The small town was pushed to its limits at that time, as dignitaries from across the state and region crowded its hotels and private homes for the occasion.  More people than usual were in attendance for the 1856 commencement, as it included the ceremony of placing the cornerstone for the college's new Centre Building.\n\nIncluded in this building were all offices, classrooms, laboratories, debate halls, etc.  The building also featured a 3,000-volume library, and an auditorium which seated between two and three thousand.  When completed, the structure dwarfed the dormitories upon either side (pictured).<ref name=ladoc/><ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nThe completion of the Centre Building marked the high-water mark of Centenary's tenure in Jackson.  However, it was fated to be short-lived.  Less than three years after the building was completed, the college closed, the vast majority of its students having joined the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]].  The last entry in the minutes of the Board of Trustees in 1861 reads \"Students have all gone to War\u2014College suspended, and God Help the Right!\"\n\n==Civil War period==\nAlthough no longer a college, Centenary's campus was not altogether abandoned.  The preparatory department continued for some time, and upon its closing the campus was transformed into a Confederate hospital.  More than 500 Confederate soldiers \u2014 mostly from the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] \u2014 were treated at the Centenary hospital.  Some eighty of those sent to Centenary died there; they were buried in a cemetery on the grounds.\n\nAfter the fall of [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]], Centenary was taken over by the [[Union Army]], and used as a [[field hospital]], supply depot, and recruiting post \u2014 primarily for the [[United States Colored Troops]].  A large contingent of [[Confederate States Army]] [[cavalry]] was sent to disrupt the recruiting practices, resulting in the largest battle to occur within the town limits of Jackson.  The Confederates suffered minimal casualties, routed Union forces, and captured ammunition and other supplies.  The Union Army suffered nearly one-third of its garrison detachment killed or wounded.\n\n==Postwar struggle 1865-1908==\nCentenary College of Louisiana reopened in the autumn of 1865, in a completely different world than the one that had forced its closing four years earlier.  Whereas in 1861 there had been \"[[secession]] fever,\" and [[King Cotton|cotton was king]], there was now nothing.  The people that had been among the wealthiest in the country were reduced to selling wool and eggs.  Those who had previously sent their sons to Centenary either could no longer afford to, or they no longer had sons to send.\n\nFaced with these dire straits, the president of the college would often be away for months at a time.  He would go door-to-door, soliciting financial support, or he'd visit as many Methodist congregations as he could, \"passing the hat\"\u2014all to little avail.\n\nThe desperation reached the point of not being able to compensate the professors.  The policy was, in short: if the college had the money, the professors would be paid.  To make up for this deficiency, in the late 1890s five professors' cottages were constructed.  The sole extant cottage is one of the most visible features of the campus today.\n\nAnother move made during the 1890s to boost enrollment was the admittance of female students.  The ladies were not originally given degrees or diplomas.  They were given certificates of attendance, which, in essence, meant they were qualified to teach school.  The first degree was conferred upon a female graduate in 1901.\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn 1903, the prominent Methodist citizens of [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], offered Centenary {{convert|17|acre|m2}}, a brand new facility, and a sizeable monetary grant if they would relocate.  Given the college's difficulty in procuring financial support where they were, and the several attractive opportunities Shreveport presented, it was not a matter of ''if'' they would move, but ''when''.

The Raptors compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the league's [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]]. They play their home games at the [[Scotiabank Arena]], which they share with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's [[Expansion of the National Basketball Association|expansion]] into Canada, along with the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]. Since the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|relocated]] from [[Vancouver]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years; but after the acquisition of [[Vince Carter]] through a [[1998 NBA draft|draft-day trade in 1998]], the franchise set league-attendance records and made the [[NBA playoffs]] in [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000]], [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]], and [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002]]. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the [[2002\u201303 Toronto Raptors season|2002\u201303]] and [[2003\u201304 Toronto Raptors season|2003\u201304 seasons]], they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]].\n\nAfter Carter left, [[Chris Bosh]] emerged as the team leader. For the [[2006\u201307 Toronto Raptors season|2006\u201307 season]], [[Bryan Colangelo]] was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick [[Andrea Bargnani]], and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their [[2007 NBA Playoffs|first playoff berth in five years]], capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the [[2007\u201308 Toronto Raptors season|2007\u201308 season]], they also advanced to the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] but failed to reach the post-season in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the [[2009\u201310 Toronto Raptors season|2009\u201310 season]] in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the [[Miami Heat]] in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\n\n[[Masai Ujiri]] replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Kyle Lowry]]. The Raptors returned to the [[2014 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in [[2017\u201318 Toronto Raptors season|2018]]. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach [[Dwane Casey]] after the [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018 playoffs]] concluded, and conduct the high-profile trade of DeRozan for [[Kawhi Leonard]] and [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]] later that summer, as well as acquiring [[Marc Gasol]] before the [[Trade (sports)#NBA 2|trade deadline]]. In the [[2019 NBA playoffs|2019 playoffs]], the Raptors won their first [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference]] title and advanced to their first [[2019 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Creation===\nThe Toronto Raptors were established on November 4, 1993, when the NBA, as part of its expansion into Canada, awarded its 28th [[Professional sports league organization|franchise]] to a group headed by Toronto businessman [[John Bitove]] for a then-record expansion fee of [[United States dollar|US$]]125 million.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-nba-is-coming-to-toronto|title=The NBA is coming to Toronto|date=November 14, 1993|accessdate=March 19, 2017|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref><ref name=\"groundwork\" /> Bitove and [[Allan Slaight]] of [[Slaight Communications]] each owned 44 per cent, with the [[Scotiabank|Bank of Nova Scotia]] (10 per cent), [[David Peterson]] (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners.<ref name=\"groundwork\" /><ref name=arenawars>{{cite news|title=Arena wars [The Raptors and the Leafs needed new arenas and it would have been smart to share]|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|date=December 1997|newspaper=[[Toronto Life]]}}</ref> [[Sports betting|Wagering on NBA games]] in [[Ontario]] nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling.

The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and \"Naismith silver\" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, [[James Naismith]]). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.<ref name=\"groundwork\"/> For the 2008\u221209 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".<ref name=\"NewRaptorsLogo\"/>\n\n====Court art====\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams. Beginning in [[2017\u201318 Toronto Raptors season|early 2018]], in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary [[Tangerine Bank]]'s name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly [[ING Direct]]<!--Do not bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]--> Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\n\n===Uniforms===\n====Uniform evolution====\nThe uniforms the Raptors unveiled prior to the 1995\u201396 season, and wore until 1999, had black and white tears as pinstripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw on one side of the shorts, a raptor biting the \u2018T\u2019 of the \u2018TR\u2019 franchise acronym on the other side; and featured a red giant and aggressive ''Velociraptor'' dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled these new jerseys in 1999\u22122000, launching a unique road jersey that had a purple front and a black back. In 2003\u221204, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006\u221207 onward as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme.

The uniforms were released in partnership with [[2K Sports]]' ''[[NBA 2K16]]'' video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on [[National colours of Canada|Canada's national colours of red and white]], whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jersey. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter \"T\" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's [[Name of Toronto#Nicknames|\"T-Dot\" nickname]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Raptors Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/uniforms-080315|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|date=August 3, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:left; width:35%;\">\n;2015\u22122017\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| body       = 000000\n| shorts     = 000000\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road Alt.\n}}\n|\n{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road (OVO)\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n====2017 onward====\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was alotted four primary uniforms, classified as \u201ceditions\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Nike and the NBA Reveal the First of the League\u2019s 2017-18 Game Uniforms|url=https://news.nike.com/news/nike-nba-game-uniforms|publisher=Nike|website=nike.com|date=June 18, 2017|accessdate=}}</ref> The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called \"Association edition\") and road (now the \"Icon edition\") uniforms, as well as their alternate (\"Statement edition\") uniforms.

Raptors''' are<!-- Canadian English (individual teams agree with the plural form) --> a Canadian professional [[basketball]] team based in [[Toronto]]<!-- Please don't add Ontario and/or Canada, since it is redundant -->. The Raptors compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the league's [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]]. They play their home games at the [[Scotiabank Arena]], which they share with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's [[Expansion of the National Basketball Association|expansion]] into Canada, along with the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]. Since the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|relocated]] from [[Vancouver]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years; but after the acquisition of [[Vince Carter]] through a [[1998 NBA draft|draft-day trade in 1998]], the franchise set league-attendance records and made the [[NBA playoffs]] in [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000]], [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]], and [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002]]. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the [[2002\u201303 Toronto Raptors season|2002\u201303]] and [[2003\u201304 Toronto Raptors season|2003\u201304 seasons]], they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]].\n\nAfter Carter left, [[Chris Bosh]] emerged as the team leader. For the [[2006\u201307 Toronto Raptors season|2006\u201307 season]], [[Bryan Colangelo]] was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick [[Andrea Bargnani]], and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their [[2007 NBA Playoffs|first playoff berth in five years]], capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the [[2007\u201308 Toronto Raptors season|2007\u201308 season]], they also advanced to the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] but failed to reach the post-season in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the [[2009\u201310 Toronto Raptors season|2009\u201310 season]] in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the [[Miami Heat]] in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\n\n[[Masai Ujiri]] replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Kyle Lowry]]. The Raptors returned to the [[2014 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in [[2017\u201318 Toronto Raptors season|2018]]. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach [[Dwane Casey]] after the [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018 playoffs]] concluded, and conduct the high-profile trade of DeRozan for [[Kawhi Leonard]] and [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]] later that summer, as well as acquiring [[Marc Gasol]] before the [[Trade (sports)#NBA 2|trade deadline]]. In the [[2019 NBA playoffs|2019 playoffs]], the Raptors won their first [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference]] title and advanced to their first [[2019 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Creation===\nThe Toronto Raptors were established on November 4, 1993, when the NBA, as part of its expansion into Canada, awarded its 28th [[Professional sports league organization|franchise]] to a group headed by Toronto businessman [[John Bitove]] for a then-record expansion fee of [[United States dollar|US$]]125 million.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-nba-is-coming-to-toronto|title=The NBA is coming to Toronto|date=November 14, 1993|accessdate=March 19, 2017|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref><ref name=\"groundwork\" /> Bitove and [[Allan Slaight]] of [[Slaight Communications]] each owned 44 per cent, with the [[Scotiabank|Bank of Nova Scotia]] (10 per cent), [[David Peterson]] (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners.<ref name=\"groundwork\" /><ref name=arenawars>{{cite news|title=Arena wars [The Raptors and the Leafs needed new arenas and it would have been smart to share]|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|date=December 1997|newspaper=[[Toronto Life]]}}</ref> [[Sports betting|Wagering on NBA games]] in [[Ontario]] nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling.

The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and \"Naismith silver\" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, [[James Naismith]]). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.<ref name=\"groundwork\"/> For the 2008\u221209 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".<ref name=\"NewRaptorsLogo\"/>\n\n====Court art====\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams.

Scotiabank subsidiary [[Tangerine Bank]]'s name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly [[ING Direct]]<!--Do not bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]--> Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\n\n===Uniforms===\n====Uniform evolution====\nThe uniforms the Raptors unveiled prior to the 1995\u201396 season, and wore until 1999, had black and white tears as pinstripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw on one side of the shorts, a raptor biting the \u2018T\u2019 of the \u2018TR\u2019 franchise acronym on the other side; and featured a red giant and aggressive ''Velociraptor'' dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled these new jerseys in 1999\u22122000, launching a unique road jersey that had a purple front and a black back. In 2003\u221204, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006\u221207 onward as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme.

The uniforms were released in partnership with [[2K Sports]]' ''[[NBA 2K16]]'' video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on [[National colours of Canada|Canada's national colours of red and white]], whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jersey. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter \"T\" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's [[Name of Toronto#Nicknames|\"T-Dot\" nickname]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Raptors Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/uniforms-080315|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|date=August 3, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:left; width:35%;\">\n;2015\u22122017\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| body       = 000000\n| shorts     = 000000\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road Alt.\n}}\n|\n{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road (OVO)\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n====2017 onward====\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was alotted four primary uniforms, classified as \u201ceditions\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Nike and the NBA Reveal the First of the League\u2019s 2017-18 Game Uniforms|url=https://news.nike.com/news/nike-nba-game-uniforms|publisher=Nike|website=nike.com|date=June 18, 2017|accessdate=}}</ref> The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called \"Association edition\") and road (now the \"Icon edition\") uniforms, as well as their alternate (\"Statement edition\") uniforms.

Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.\n\nThe winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds.

First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and debris and causing damage. As the pressure continues to drop, the visible funnel extends to the ground. This tornado, near [[Dimmitt, Texas]], was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.]]\n\n===Supercell relationship===\n{{See also|Supercell}}\nTornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells contain [[mesocyclone]]s, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually {{convert|1|\u2013|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.\n\nMost tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.<ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/>\n[[File:Evolution of a Tornado.jpg|thumb|left|Composite of eight images shot in sequence as a tornado formed in [[Kansas]] in 2016]]\n\n===Formation===\nAs the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.<ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title = How Tornadoes Form and Why They're so Unpredictable|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150511-tornadoes-storms-midwest-weather-science|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-05-11|first = Brian Clark|last = Howard|publisher = National Geographic |date= May 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Maturity===\nInitially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist air [[inflow (meteorology)|flowing inward]] to power it, and it grows until it reaches the \"mature stage\". This can last from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) across. The low pressured atmosphere at the base of the tornado is essential to the endurance of the system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#The%20Basics|title=The Online Tornado FAQ|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=www.spa.noaa.gov|publisher=Roger Edwards, Storm Prediction Center|access-date=27 October 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.<ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/>\n\n===Dissipation===\nAs the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the \"dissipating stage\", often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado ends. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns.<ref name=\"significant tornadoes\"/><ref name=\"PD tornado images\"/><ref name=\"target tornado\"/> Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, due to [[conservation of angular momentum]], winds can increase at this point.<ref name=\"thebible\"/>\n\nAs the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop [[wikt:cycle|cyclically]]. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.\n\nAlthough this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development\u2014however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.<ref name=\"tornadogenesis\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(2003)060<0795:TRFTTO>2.0.CO;2|title=Tornadogenesis Resulting from the Transport of Circulation by a Downdraft: Idealized Numerical Simulations|author=Markowski, Straka, and Rasmussen|journal=J.

A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path.<ref name=\"SPC FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/> This is a phenomenon that is distinct from a [[satellite tornado]], which is a smaller tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone.

However, researchers typically distinguish \"fair weather\" waterspouts from tornadic (i.e. associated with a mesocyclone) waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to [[dust devil]]s and [[landspout]]s. They form at the bases of [[cumulus congestus]] clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth [[laminar flow|laminar]] walls, and typically travel very slowly.

The name stems from their characterization as a \"fair weather waterspout on land\". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the surface. Landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage.<ref name=\"SPC FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/>\n\n===Similar circulations===\n\n====Gustnado====\n{{Main|Gustnado}}\n\nA ''gustnado'', or ''gust front tornado'', is a small, vertical swirl associated with a [[Outflow boundary|gust front]] or [[downburst]]. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a [[thunderstorm]] is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a \"rolling\" effect (often exemplified through a [[roll cloud]]). If low level [[wind shear]] is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado.<ref name=\"SPC FAQ\"/><ref name=\"gustnado AMS\">{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Gustnado|title=Gustnado|accessdate=2006-09-20|publisher=American Meteorological Society|work=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000}}</ref> They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.\n\n====Dust devil====\n{{Main|Dust devil}}\n\n[[File:Dust devil.jpg|right|thumb|A dust devil in [[Arizona]]]]\n\nA ''dust devil'' (also known as a whirlwind) resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.<ref name=\"Handy Weather Answer Book\">{{cite book|author=Walter A Lyons|title=The Handy Weather Answer Book|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Visible Ink press|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handyweatheransw00lyon/page/175 175\u2013200]|chapter=Tornadoes|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/handyweatheransw00lyon/page/175}}</ref><ref name=\"dust devil injury\">{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ssd/techmemo/sr207.htm|title=Severe Weather Climatology for New Mexico|accessdate=2006-09-29|author1=Charles H Jones |author2=Charlie A.

Those that occur near intense [[wildfire]]s are called ''fire whirls''. They are not considered tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a [[pyrocumulus]] or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.<ref name=\"significant tornadoes\"/>\n\n====Steam devils====\n{{Main|Steam devil}}\n\nA ''steam devil'' is a [[rotating]] [[updraft]] between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations do not involve high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. [[Hot springs]] and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form.

Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public [[tornado warning]]s were issued in 1950 and the first [[tornado watch]]es and [[convective outlooks]] came about in 1952. In 1953, it was confirmed that [[hook echo]]es were associated with tornadoes.<ref>{{cite web|year=2008|title=The First Tornadic Hook Echo Weather Radar Observations|publisher=Colorado State University|url=http://www.chill.colostate.edu/w/CHILL_history#The_First_Tornadic_Hook_Echo_Weather_Radar_Observations|accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from several miles away.<ref name=\"hook echoes\">{{cite journal|author=Paul M.

In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial [[direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] (towards or away from the radar) of the winds within a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from over {{convert|100|mi|km|spell=in}} away.

Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and tornado development may occasionally take place more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.

The program was called '''[[Skywarn]]''', and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, [[amateur radio operator]]s, [[civil defense]] (now [[emergency management]]) spotters, [[storm chasing|storm chasers]], and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request these spotters to look out for severe weather and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.\n\nSpotters usually are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as [[Civil defense siren|sirens]] and the [[Emergency Alert System]] (EAS), and they forward the report to the NWS.<ref name=\"spotter history\">{{cite journal|author=Charles A.

They typically look to its rear, the main region of [[updraft]] and inflow.

Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and the likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a \"beaver tail\", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud.

Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly afterwards; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also develop without wall clouds, under flanking lines and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the [[cloud base]] and surface.<ref name=\"NSSL tornadoes\">{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about Tornadoes|work=A Severe Weather Primer|publisher=National Severe Storms Laboratory|date=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_basics.html|accessdate=2007-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809070939/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_basics.html|archive-date=2012-08-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Extremes==\n{{Main|Tornado records}}\n[[File:Super Outbreak Map.jpg|thumb|left|A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak (April 3\u20134, 1974)]]\nThe tornado which holds most records in history was the [[Tri-State Tornado]], which roared through parts of [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]] on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length ({{convert|219|mi|km|disp=x|; }}), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado ({{convert|73|mph|km/h|disp=x|; |abbr=on}}) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead).<ref name=\"significant tornadoes\"/> The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it ranks third today.<ref name=\"tornado damage cost\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/damage/tdam1.html|title=Normalized Damage from Major Tornadoes in the United States: 1890\u20131999|journal=Weather Forecast.|volume=16|pages=168\u2013176|accessdate=2007-02-28|author1=Harold E Brooks|author2=Charles A.

The previous record was the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] which spawned 148 tornadoes.\n\nWhile direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional [[anemometer]]s would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by [[Doppler on Wheels|mobile Doppler radar units]], which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;20&nbsp;mph (484&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;32&nbsp;km/h) in the F5 [[1999 Bridge Creek \u2013 Moore tornado|Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma]], tornado which killed 36 people.<ref>[http://newsok.com/anatomy-of-may-3s-f5-tornado/article/3365909 Anatomy of May 3's F5 tornado], The Oklahoman Newspaper, May 1, 2009</ref> The reading was taken about {{convert|100|ft|m}} above the ground.<ref name=\"fastest wind\"/>\n\nStorms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Authorities such as the [[Storm Prediction Center]] advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued.

[[Weather radio]]s provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.<ref name=\"highway overpasses\"/>\n\n==Myths and misconceptions==\n{{Main|Tornado myths}}\nFolklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes, and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight |first=Meredith |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-if-sky-is-green-run-for-cover-tornado-is-coming |title=Fact or Fiction?: If the Sky Is Green, Run for Cover \u2013 A Tornado Is Coming |journal=Scientific American |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref> It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado.

Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.\n\nThe winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds.

First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and debris and causing damage. As the pressure continues to drop, the visible funnel extends to the ground. This tornado, near [[Dimmitt, Texas]], was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.]]\n\n===Supercell relationship===\n{{See also|Supercell}}\nTornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells contain [[mesocyclone]]s, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually {{convert|1|\u2013|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.\n\nMost tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.<ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/>\n[[File:Evolution of a Tornado.jpg|thumb|left|Composite of eight images shot in sequence as a tornado formed in [[Kansas]] in 2016]]\n\n===Formation===\nAs the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.<ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title = How Tornadoes Form and Why They're so Unpredictable|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150511-tornadoes-storms-midwest-weather-science|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-05-11|first = Brian Clark|last = Howard|publisher = National Geographic |date= May 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Maturity===\nInitially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist air [[inflow (meteorology)|flowing inward]] to power it, and it grows until it reaches the \"mature stage\". This can last from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) across. The low pressured atmosphere at the base of the tornado is essential to the endurance of the system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#The%20Basics|title=The Online Tornado FAQ|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=www.spa.noaa.gov|publisher=Roger Edwards, Storm Prediction Center|access-date=27 October 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.<ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/>\n\n===Dissipation===\nAs the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the \"dissipating stage\", often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado ends. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns.<ref name=\"significant tornadoes\"/><ref name=\"PD tornado images\"/><ref name=\"target tornado\"/> Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, due to [[conservation of angular momentum]], winds can increase at this point.<ref name=\"thebible\"/>\n\nAs the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop [[wikt:cycle|cyclically]]. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.\n\nAlthough this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development\u2014however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.<ref name=\"tornadogenesis\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(2003)060<0795:TRFTTO>2.0.CO;2|title=Tornadogenesis Resulting from the Transport of Circulation by a Downdraft: Idealized Numerical Simulations|author=Markowski, Straka, and Rasmussen|journal=J.

A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path.<ref name=\"SPC FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/> This is a phenomenon that is distinct from a [[satellite tornado]], which is a smaller tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone.

However, researchers typically distinguish \"fair weather\" waterspouts from tornadic (i.e. associated with a mesocyclone) waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to [[dust devil]]s and [[landspout]]s. They form at the bases of [[cumulus congestus]] clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth [[laminar flow|laminar]] walls, and typically travel very slowly.

The name stems from their characterization as a \"fair weather waterspout on land\". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the surface. Landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage.<ref name=\"SPC FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Advanced Spotter Guide\"/>\n\n===Similar circulations===\n\n====Gustnado====\n{{Main|Gustnado}}\n\nA ''gustnado'', or ''gust front tornado'', is a small, vertical swirl associated with a [[Outflow boundary|gust front]] or [[downburst]]. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a [[thunderstorm]] is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a \"rolling\" effect (often exemplified through a [[roll cloud]]). If low level [[wind shear]] is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado.<ref name=\"SPC FAQ\"/><ref name=\"gustnado AMS\">{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Gustnado|title=Gustnado|accessdate=2006-09-20|publisher=American Meteorological Society|work=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000}}</ref> They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.\n\n====Dust devil====\n{{Main|Dust devil}}\n\n[[File:Dust devil.jpg|right|thumb|A dust devil in [[Arizona]]]]\n\nA ''dust devil'' (also known as a whirlwind) resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.<ref name=\"Handy Weather Answer Book\">{{cite book|author=Walter A Lyons|title=The Handy Weather Answer Book|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Visible Ink press|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handyweatheransw00lyon/page/175 175\u2013200]|chapter=Tornadoes|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/handyweatheransw00lyon/page/175}}</ref><ref name=\"dust devil injury\">{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ssd/techmemo/sr207.htm|title=Severe Weather Climatology for New Mexico|accessdate=2006-09-29|author1=Charles H Jones |author2=Charlie A.

Those that occur near intense [[wildfire]]s are called ''fire whirls''. They are not considered tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a [[pyrocumulus]] or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.<ref name=\"significant tornadoes\"/>\n\n====Steam devils====\n{{Main|Steam devil}}\n\nA ''steam devil'' is a [[rotating]] [[updraft]] between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations do not involve high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. [[Hot springs]] and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form.

Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public [[tornado warning]]s were issued in 1950 and the first [[tornado watch]]es and [[convective outlooks]] came about in 1952. In 1953, it was confirmed that [[hook echo]]es were associated with tornadoes.<ref>{{cite web|year=2008|title=The First Tornadic Hook Echo Weather Radar Observations|publisher=Colorado State University|url=http://www.chill.colostate.edu/w/CHILL_history#The_First_Tornadic_Hook_Echo_Weather_Radar_Observations|accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from several miles away.<ref name=\"hook echoes\">{{cite journal|author=Paul M.

In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial [[direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] (towards or away from the radar) of the winds within a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from over {{convert|100|mi|km|spell=in}} away.

Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and tornado development may occasionally take place more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.

The program was called '''[[Skywarn]]''', and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, [[amateur radio operator]]s, [[civil defense]] (now [[emergency management]]) spotters, [[storm chasing|storm chasers]], and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request these spotters to look out for severe weather and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.\n\nSpotters usually are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as [[Civil defense siren|sirens]] and the [[Emergency Alert System]] (EAS), and they forward the report to the NWS.<ref name=\"spotter history\">{{cite journal|author=Charles A.

They typically look to its rear, the main region of [[updraft]] and inflow.

Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and the likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a \"beaver tail\", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud.

Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly afterwards; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also develop without wall clouds, under flanking lines and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the [[cloud base]] and surface.<ref name=\"NSSL tornadoes\">{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about Tornadoes|work=A Severe Weather Primer|publisher=National Severe Storms Laboratory|date=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_basics.html|accessdate=2007-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809070939/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_basics.html|archive-date=2012-08-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Extremes==\n{{Main|Tornado records}}\n[[File:Super Outbreak Map.jpg|thumb|left|A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak (April 3\u20134, 1974)]]\nThe tornado which holds most records in history was the [[Tri-State Tornado]], which roared through parts of [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]] on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length ({{convert|219|mi|km|disp=x|; }}), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado ({{convert|73|mph|km/h|disp=x|; |abbr=on}}) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead).<ref name=\"significant tornadoes\"/> The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it ranks third today.<ref name=\"tornado damage cost\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/damage/tdam1.html|title=Normalized Damage from Major Tornadoes in the United States: 1890\u20131999|journal=Weather Forecast.|volume=16|pages=168\u2013176|accessdate=2007-02-28|author1=Harold E Brooks|author2=Charles A.

The previous record was the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] which spawned 148 tornadoes.\n\nWhile direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional [[anemometer]]s would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by [[Doppler on Wheels|mobile Doppler radar units]], which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;20&nbsp;mph (484&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;32&nbsp;km/h) in the F5 [[1999 Bridge Creek \u2013 Moore tornado|Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma]], tornado which killed 36 people.<ref>[http://newsok.com/anatomy-of-may-3s-f5-tornado/article/3365909 Anatomy of May 3's F5 tornado], The Oklahoman Newspaper, May 1, 2009</ref> The reading was taken about {{convert|100|ft|m}} above the ground.<ref name=\"fastest wind\"/>\n\nStorms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Authorities such as the [[Storm Prediction Center]] advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival.<ref name=\"tornado safety\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/safety.html|title=Tornado Safety|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2009-11-17|author=Roger Edwards|authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref> In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have underground [[storm cellar]]s, which have saved thousands of lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/preparedness/brochures/storm_shelter.pdf |title=Storm Shelters|accessdate=2009-12-13|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2002-08-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060223072127/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/preparedness/brochures/storm_shelter.pdf |archivedate = 2006-02-23}}</ref>\n\nSome countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as [[tornado watch]]es and [[Tornado warning|warnings]] in the United States and Canada). [[Weather radio]]s provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.<ref name=\"highway overpasses\"/>\n\n==Myths and misconceptions==\n{{Main|Tornado myths}}\nFolklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes, and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight |first=Meredith |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-if-sky-is-green-run-for-cover-tornado-is-coming |title=Fact or Fiction?: If the Sky Is Green, Run for Cover \u2013 A Tornado Is Coming |journal=Scientific American |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref> It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado.
