After Collins played the unused sequence at rehearsal one day, Van Zant asked him to repeat it, then wrote out the melody and lyrics in three or four minutes.  The guitar solos that finish the song were added originally to give Van Zant a chance to rest, as the band was playing several sets per night at clubs at the time.  Soon afterward, the band learned piano-playing roadie [[Billy Powell]] had written an introduction to the song; upon hearing it, they included it as the finishing touch and had him formally join as their keyboardist.\n\n[[Allen Collins]]'s girlfriend, Kathy, whom he later married, asked him, \"If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?\" Collins noted the question and it eventually became the opening line of \"Free Bird\".

After Collins played the unused sequence at rehearsal one day, Van Zant asked him to repeat it, then wrote out the melody and lyrics in three or four minutes.  The guitar solos that finish the song were added originally to give Van Zant a chance to rest, as the band was playing several sets per night at clubs at the time.  Soon afterward, the band learned piano-playing roadie [[Billy Powell]] had written an introduction to the song; upon hearing it, they included it as the finishing touch and had him formally join as their keyboardist.\n\n[[Allen Collins]]'s girlfriend, Kathy, whom he later married, asked him, \"If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?\" Collins noted the question and it eventually became the opening line of \"Free Bird\". Also in an interview filmed during a fishing outing on a boat with Gary Rossington, an interviewer asked Ronnie Van Zant what the song meant. Van Zant replied that in essence, that the song is \"what it means to be free, in that a bird can fly wherever he wants to go\".

Ladner later went on to found the community of Ladner's Landing, which became the hub of the Municipality of Delta, British Columbia, on November 10, 1879.\n\nOn August 20, 1887, William McKee, the municipal clerk, was designated as a constable in addition to his duties as a clerk. On July 7, 1888, Joseph Jordan was appointed as Delta's first full-time constable, and with this appointment the Delta Municipal Police Department was formed. Over the next eight years Jordan was dismissed and re-appointed several times, depending on the department's needs and was assisted on occasion by other temporary constables.\n\nBy 1900, Jordan had been designated as the chief constable and worked full-time in this role until his retirement in 1911.\n\nThe chief constable's position remained the only regular full-time or part-time position until 1931, when the municipal council authorized the appointment of a night policeman. It was the duty of this policeman, whose salary was partly paid for by the local merchants, to patrol the streets of Ladner at night.\n\nThe 1950s was a decade of growth for the DPD as membership increased to 11 police officers, and the police station began operating on a 24-hour-a-day basis.\n\nBy 1971, the police department had grown to 45 police officers, due to the growth in community population after the opening of the [[George Massey Tunnel]].\n\n==Public Confidence==\nPublic confidence in Delta Police is high, according to the results of a public survey, released by police in March, 2019. Residents are confident in the Delta Police Department\u2019s ability to deliver urgent services, but want officers to be more visible in the community.\n\nRespondents thought the DPD did well in delivering urgent services in a timely manner; dealing with violent crime; having clear and transparent communication through strong social media programs; and consulting with the community to ensure the DPD is meeting their needs and expectations. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northdeltareporter.com/news/confidence-in-delta-police-high-survey/|title=Confidence in Delta police high: survey|date=2019-03-17|website=North Delta Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nSeventy-four per cent of residents give a good to very good rating of officers they had contact with, and 80 per cent of people feel the Delta Police do a good to very good job of delivering urgent services in a timely manner, well above the Canadian average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deltapolice.ca/portfolio-items/public-confident-in-dpds-delivery-of-urgent-services-but-wants-more-police-visibility/|title=Public Confident in DPD Delivery of Urgent Services but Wants More Police Visibility|last=|first=|date=17 April 2020|website=Delta Police|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Recent High Profile Investigations ==\n<br />\n\n=== Brother\u2019s Keeper gang arrests ===\nIn February 2019, the DPD arrested three people associated with the Brother\u2019s Keepers gang, seizing weapons and \u201ca significant quantity of drugs.\u201d\n\nThe DPD, with the RCMP\u2019s emergency response team and members of the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit\u2019s uniformed gang enforcement team, executed a search warrant at a Surrey residence that had been the target of a drug trafficking investigation involving the Brother\u2019s Keepers.\n\nPolice found a loaded firearm, a replica restricted firearm and two bullet proof vests, as well as a significant quantity of suspected heroin and cocaine packaged for sale and a suspected bulk quantity of fentanyl.\n\nThree people inside the residence \u2014 two women and a man \u2014 were arrested without incident and later released, pending charge approval by Crown Counsel.\n\n\u201cTo infiltrate a gang is pretty great work by our drug detectives,\u201d Delta Police Chief Dubord said, noting the arrests highlight the inherent dangers and violence associated with drug trafficking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/2019-a-year-of-successes-and-challenges-for-delta-police/|title=2019 a year of successes and challenges for Delta police|date=2020-01-09|website=Surrey Now-Leader|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Attack on Acting Sergeant John Jasmins ===\nIn February 2019, Delta resident Manoj George was arrested after allegedly attacking a woman outside Immaculate Conception School in North Delta.\n\nActing Sgt.

This incident occurred when McKay attended Long's residence to speak to him regarding a confrontation that occurred earlier in the day at a local gas station. On May 27, 1975 Long was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.  On July 14, 1976, Long's death sentence, along with the death sentences of ten other people convicted of murdering peace officers, were converted to life sentences. In 2002 Long was granted full parole which has since been revoked following repeated contacts with police.\n\nOn April 8, 2000, Constable Mark Nieuwenhuis was killed in a police motorcycle accident. The investigation revealed that Nieuwenhuis was attempting to stop a vehicle at the time of the accident.

Ladner later went on to found the community of Ladner's Landing, which became the hub of the Municipality of Delta, British Columbia, on November 10, 1879.\n\nOn August 20, 1887, William McKee, the municipal clerk, was designated as a constable in addition to his duties as a clerk. On July 7, 1888, Joseph Jordan was appointed as Delta's first full-time constable, and with this appointment the Delta Municipal Police Department was formed. Over the next eight years Jordan was dismissed and re-appointed several times, depending on the department's needs and was assisted on occasion by other temporary constables.\n\nBy 1900, Jordan had been designated as the chief constable and worked full-time in this role until his retirement in 1911.\n\nThe chief constable's position remained the only regular full-time or part-time position until 1931, when the municipal council authorized the appointment of a night policeman. It was the duty of this policeman, whose salary was partly paid for by the local merchants, to patrol the streets of Ladner at night.\n\nThe 1950s was a decade of growth for the DPD as membership increased to 11 police officers, and the police station began operating on a 24-hour-a-day basis.\n\nBy 1971, the police department had grown to 45 police officers, due to the growth in community population after the opening of the [[George Massey Tunnel]].\n\n==Public Confidence==\nPublic confidence in Delta Police is high, according to the results of a public survey, released by police in March, 2019. Residents are confident in the Delta Police Department\u2019s ability to deliver urgent services, but want officers to be more visible in the community.\n\nRespondents thought the DPD did well in delivering urgent services in a timely manner; dealing with violent crime; having clear and transparent communication through strong social media programs; and consulting with the community to ensure the DPD is meeting their needs and expectations. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northdeltareporter.com/news/confidence-in-delta-police-high-survey/|title=Confidence in Delta police high: survey|date=2019-03-17|website=North Delta Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nSeventy-four per cent of residents give a good to very good rating of officers they had contact with, and 80 per cent of people feel the Delta Police do a good to very good job of delivering urgent services in a timely manner, well above the Canadian average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deltapolice.ca/portfolio-items/public-confident-in-dpds-delivery-of-urgent-services-but-wants-more-police-visibility/|title=Public Confident in DPD Delivery of Urgent Services but Wants More Police Visibility|last=|first=|date=17 April 2020|website=Delta Police|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Recent High Profile Investigations ==\n<br />\n\n=== Brother\u2019s Keeper gang arrests ===\nIn February 2019, the DPD arrested three people associated with the Brother\u2019s Keepers gang, seizing weapons and \u201ca significant quantity of drugs.\u201d\n\nThe DPD, with the RCMP\u2019s emergency response team and members of the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit\u2019s uniformed gang enforcement team, executed a search warrant at a Surrey residence that had been the target of a drug trafficking investigation involving the Brother\u2019s Keepers.\n\nPolice found a loaded firearm, a replica restricted firearm and two bullet proof vests, as well as a significant quantity of suspected heroin and cocaine packaged for sale and a suspected bulk quantity of fentanyl.\n\nThree people inside the residence \u2014 two women and a man \u2014 were arrested without incident and later released, pending charge approval by Crown Counsel.\n\n\u201cTo infiltrate a gang is pretty great work by our drug detectives,\u201d Delta Police Chief Dubord said, noting the arrests highlight the inherent dangers and violence associated with drug trafficking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/2019-a-year-of-successes-and-challenges-for-delta-police/|title=2019 a year of successes and challenges for Delta police|date=2020-01-09|website=Surrey Now-Leader|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Attack on Acting Sergeant John Jasmins ===\nIn February 2019, Delta resident Manoj George was arrested after allegedly attacking a woman outside Immaculate Conception School in North Delta.\n\nActing Sgt.

This incident occurred when McKay attended Long's residence to speak to him regarding a confrontation that occurred earlier in the day at a local gas station. On May 27, 1975 Long was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.  On July 14, 1976, Long's death sentence, along with the death sentences of ten other people convicted of murdering peace officers, were converted to life sentences. In 2002 Long was granted full parole which has since been revoked following repeated contacts with police.\n\nOn April 8, 2000, Constable Mark Nieuwenhuis was killed in a police motorcycle accident. The investigation revealed that Nieuwenhuis was attempting to stop a vehicle at the time of the accident.

It is a special collection of books and manuscripts of an erotic or pornographic character which, because of their rarity and value, may be seen only with authorization.

The catalogue, which was introduced in the then Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi (\"Royal Library\"), already separated \"good\" and \"bad\" books. In 1702, orthodox and heterodox theological treatises, literary and entertaining novels, love and adventure stories were given different [[Library classification]] press marks (or \"call numbers\"). By the mid-18th century, there were 24 \"ouvrages licencieux\" (\"scandalous works\"),<ref>''Catalogue des livers imprim\u00e9s de la Biblioth\u00e8que du Roy: Belles-Lettres, 1re\u20132e partie'', Paris 1750</ref> including [[Pietro Aretino]]'s [[Whore dialogues|prostitute dialogue]] \"Ragionamenti\". These scandalous works were kept mostly in a special \"cabinet\" (a bookcase), and there are likely to have been fewer than 50 before the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 \u2013 although legal deposit was introduced  in 1537 by [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. However, \"ouvrages licencieux\" were banned in France generally; so clandestine editions were printed in Holland or Switzerland and distributed and sold in secret. Such books found their way into the Royal Library only after seizures of banned books or, more rarely, as gifts or purchases. Such books were not made available to the reading public, although they appeared in library catalogues.\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], the book collections of fleeing aristocrats and secularized monasteries contributed significantly to the growth of public libraries. However, as a result of strict censorship under [[Napoleon]], many banned books were destroyed. In the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale]] particularly notable books were first separated from the general library in 1795, and the foundations of the later R\u00e9serve (Rare Books collections) was established.  Between 1836 and 1844, the concept (not the press mark) \"Enfer\" appeared for the first time in the library inventories for morally dubious writings. The library director, [[Joseph Naudet]], characterized these works as follows: \"fort mauvais, mais quelquefois tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cieux pour les bibliophiles, et de grande valeur v\u00e9nale; cet enfer est pour les imprim\u00e9s ce qu'est le Mus\u00e9e de Naples pour les antiques.\" (\"extremely reprehensible from a book collector\u2019s view but sometimes highly valuable and of great resale value; this hell is for the pamphlets, what the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Napels Museum]] is for ancient art.\").<ref>Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Quignard, Raymond-Josu\u00e9 Seckel: ''L\u2019Enfer de la Biblioth\u00e8que. \u00c9ros au secret.'' Paris 2007. Pg. 26.</ref>  The exact circumstances under which this closed-collection of books was built up during the reign of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] are not known. However, a significant influence was likely to have been the increasing prudery of the bourgeoisie in post-revolutionary France. By establishing a sequestered collection of erotic material, the ordinary reader was screened from works that were considered objectionable and detrimental to the moral health of readers.\n\n== Name ==\nThe first collection of books called an Enfer is attributed to the [[Les Feuillants Abbey|Feuillants]] convent in Paris, on the [[Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]]. These monks reportedly kept in the attic, ironically described as \"hell\", a large number of Protestant writings that had been given to the convent in 1652. The name apparently played on the fate that frequently befell the authors and readers of [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|forbidden and heretical works]] (i.e., burning). Collections of theological writings of a similar character, not always carrying this title, were widely used, most famously in the [[Vatican Library]].\n\nAt the time of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], at the latest, the word \"enfer\" was widely used to refer to a clandestine or sequestered collection. [[Pierre Larousse]]\u2019s ''Encyclopedia Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle'' (Paris 1866\u20131877) defined the word as \"endroit ferm\u00e9 d'une biblioth\u00e8que, o\u00f9 l'on tient les livres dont on pense que la lecture est dangereuse; exemple: l'Enfer de la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale.\" (\"A closed area in a library, containing books whose reading is considered dangerous, for example: The 'hell' of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale.\").<ref>''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle''. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866\u20131877, Vol. 7, pg. 557 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k205359t/f561.chemindefer]</ref> In 1913, the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale received a huge book collection from Auguste Lesou\u00ebf and his sister (whose married name was Smith); 34 of these items were given the press mark ''Enfer Smith-Lesou\u00ebf''. The prints and photographs of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale also received a special press mark, if they were seen as morally questionable.\n\nOther libraries separated their Erotica from their general collections, in a similar way to the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale]]. These libraries often used obscure collection names and press marks, such as The Private Case at the [[British Museum]], the *** (or ''Triple star'') collection at the [[New York Public Library]], the \u0394 (Greek Delta) collection in the [[Library of Congress]] and the \u03a6 collection (Greek Phi) at the Bodleian Library.<ref>Dass die gr\u00f6\u00dfte pornografische Sammlung in der Vatikanischen Bibliothek zu finden sei, ist allerdings eine weit verbreitete Legende.</ref>\n\n== Inventory and cataloguing ==\n\nAfter the establishment of the Enfer, the public were curious about which, and how many, works were contained in the collections. It was assumed to be a very impressive collection, as many books had been seized during the French [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], at the peak of literary libertinism, during the life of authors such as the [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirab|Comte de Mirabeau]], the [[Marquis de Sade]] or [[Nicolas-Edme R\u00e9tif|R\u00e9tif de la Bretonne]]. From 1848 to 1850, the Enfer was subject to a public attack, accused of the negligent loss of a large numbers of books. Two-thirds of original 600 books were rumoured to have been lost, not least because unsupervised young employees had acted as attendants. In fact, the library then had, at most, 150 books. The first supplementary volume of the ''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle'' of 1877 discuss the popular opinions about the Enfer:\n\n\"Il existe \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale un d\u00e9p\u00f4t qui n\u2019est jamais ouvert au public; c\u2019est l\u2019Enfer, recueil de tous les d\u00e9vergondages luxurieux de la plume et du crayon. Toutefois, le chiffre de ce recueil honteux n\u2019est pas aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu\u2019on l\u2019imagine g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, puisque le nombre des ouvrages n'y est que de 340 et celui des volumes de 730. Mais il est bon de noter que cette cat\u00e9gorie ne comprend que les livres d\u2019une obsc\u00e9nit\u00e9 r\u00e9voltante, ceux qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendue de communiquer sous quelque pr\u00e9texte que ce puisse \u00eatre.\" \n(\"In the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale there is a stock that is not open to the public; it is the Enfer, the rendezvous of all the excesses of the pen and the pencil. However, the size this shameful collection is not as high as one generally imagines, as the number of books is only 340 and the volumes only 730. But it is good to note that this category includes only the repulsive obscene books, those that are forbidden to circulate under any pretext.\")<ref>''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle''. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866\u20131877, Suppl. 1, pg. 366 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k398030/f365.chemindefer]</ref>\n\nThe Enfer experienced renewed growth during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], particularly due to the tightened censorship. In 1865 and 1866, the collection grew by more than 330 items; in 1876, there were 620 titles, of which more than half originated from seizures. In 1886, the collection had increased to slightly more than 700, including many cheap reprints of Libertine novels from the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. The Enfer remained virtually inaccessible. To be allowed to consult one of his books a strongly reasoned application needed to be made to the head office, and the decision of a committee was required.\n\nBetween 1876 and 1886, the original press mark for the Enfer, which had been in use since the late 17th century, was replaced with ''Y2''. This press mark is used in 1896 in the general catalogue of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale. From 1909 to 1913, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and others prepared, without the support or knowledge of library management, a special bibliographic catalog, which recorded 854 titles and described the works. (The library had managed to stop the first, less well disguised start, made by the linguist Robert Yve-Plessis after 1900.) Apollinaire's catalog was issued in an edition of 1,500 copies, a second edition of 1919 sold 2,000 copies, clearly showing the scale of the public interest in the Enfer. The 1978 catalog of the Enfer by [[Pascal Pia]] added around 700 titles.\n\n== Repurposing ==\nThe work of Apollinaire and Pia contributed largely to publicising the Enfer and the literature it contains. The stock of the Enfer was enlarged in the 20th century mainly through acquisitions from ordinary bookstores. In the 1980s, the renowned publishing firm [[Fayard]] published a seven-volume collection of out-of-copyright novels held in the Enfer, with contemporary photographs and explanatory introductions. Book historians are concerned with the material that is preserved in the Enfer, while new cultural historians study the pre-revolutionary pornography found in it. A prominent example is [[Robert Darnton]], who points to the emancipatory potential of the texts in which social and religious criticism are often embedded in moral transgressions.\n\nThe development of the book market, changing moral standards and the widespread repeal of censorship regulations have changed the character of the Enfer. Through the mass availability of erotic and pornographic works it has lost a sense of purpose. Already in 1909, serial fiction was kept in it to protect it against theft. The further growth of this cheaply produced literature led, in 1932, to a separate press mark within the collection, replaced between 1960 and 1969 by two more specific signatures of the general catalog, which in turn were abandoned without being replaced.\n\nThe Biblioth\u00e8que nationale closed the Enfer press mark in 1969, but opened it again in 1983, for practical reasons; for librarians and library users, it was easier to find all the erotic works under a single press mark. The acquisition policy of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale is, however, no longer based only on genre. While efforts are made to continue collecting erotic material, the decisive factor now is rarity or bibliophilic quality. Besides older works that were missing from the Enfer, contemporary and foreign books are added to the Enfer. By 2013, the collection had grown to 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century.<ref>The [http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ online catalogue of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale] lists 2,706 entries, of which around 100 are empty (accessed on 9 February 2013).</ref> Since 1977, access to the Enfer is no longer stricter than for the rest of the R\u00e9serve collections.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Guillaume Apollinaire, [[Fernand Fleuret]], [[Louis Perceau]]: ''L\u2019Enfer de la Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale.''

The first supplementary volume of the ''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle'' of 1877 discuss the popular opinions about the Enfer:\n\n\"Il existe \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale un d\u00e9p\u00f4t qui n\u2019est jamais ouvert au public; c\u2019est l\u2019Enfer, recueil de tous les d\u00e9vergondages luxurieux de la plume et du crayon. Toutefois, le chiffre de ce recueil honteux n\u2019est pas aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu\u2019on l\u2019imagine g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, puisque le nombre des ouvrages n'y est que de 340 et celui des volumes de 730. Mais il est bon de noter que cette cat\u00e9gorie ne comprend que les livres d\u2019une obsc\u00e9nit\u00e9 r\u00e9voltante, ceux qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendue de communiquer sous quelque pr\u00e9texte que ce puisse \u00eatre.\" \n(\"In the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale there is a stock that is not open to the public; it is the Enfer, the rendezvous of all the excesses of the pen and the pencil. However, the size this shameful collection is not as high as one generally imagines, as the number of books is only 340 and the volumes only 730. But it is good to note that this category includes only the repulsive obscene books, those that are forbidden to circulate under any pretext.\")<ref>''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle''. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866\u20131877, Suppl. 1, pg. 366 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k398030/f365.chemindefer]</ref>\n\nThe Enfer experienced renewed growth during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], particularly due to the tightened censorship. In 1865 and 1866, the collection grew by more than 330 items; in 1876, there were 620 titles, of which more than half originated from seizures. In 1886, the collection had increased to slightly more than 700, including many cheap reprints of Libertine novels from the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. The Enfer remained virtually inaccessible. To be allowed to consult one of his books a strongly reasoned application needed to be made to the head office, and the decision of a committee was required.\n\nBetween 1876 and 1886, the original press mark for the Enfer, which had been in use since the late 17th century, was replaced with ''Y2''. This press mark is used in 1896 in the general catalogue of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale. From 1909 to 1913, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and others prepared, without the support or knowledge of library management, a special bibliographic catalog, which recorded 854 titles and described the works. (The library had managed to stop the first, less well disguised start, made by the linguist Robert Yve-Plessis after 1900.) Apollinaire's catalog was issued in an edition of 1,500 copies, a second edition of 1919 sold 2,000 copies, clearly showing the scale of the public interest in the Enfer. The 1978 catalog of the Enfer by [[Pascal Pia]] added around 700 titles.\n\n== Repurposing ==\nThe work of Apollinaire and Pia contributed largely to publicising the Enfer and the literature it contains. The stock of the Enfer was enlarged in the 20th century mainly through acquisitions from ordinary bookstores. In the 1980s, the renowned publishing firm [[Fayard]] published a seven-volume collection of out-of-copyright novels held in the Enfer, with contemporary photographs and explanatory introductions. Book historians are concerned with the material that is preserved in the Enfer, while new cultural historians study the pre-revolutionary pornography found in it. A prominent example is [[Robert Darnton]], who points to the emancipatory potential of the texts in which social and religious criticism are often embedded in moral transgressions.\n\nThe development of the book market, changing moral standards and the widespread repeal of censorship regulations have changed the character of the Enfer. Through the mass availability of erotic and pornographic works it has lost a sense of purpose. Already in 1909, serial fiction was kept in it to protect it against theft. The further growth of this cheaply produced literature led, in 1932, to a separate press mark within the collection, replaced between 1960 and 1969 by two more specific signatures of the general catalog, which in turn were abandoned without being replaced.\n\nThe Biblioth\u00e8que nationale closed the Enfer press mark in 1969, but opened it again in 1983, for practical reasons; for librarians and library users, it was easier to find all the erotic works under a single press mark. The acquisition policy of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale is, however, no longer based only on genre. While efforts are made to continue collecting erotic material, the decisive factor now is rarity or bibliophilic quality. Besides older works that were missing from the Enfer, contemporary and foreign books are added to the Enfer. By 2013, the collection had grown to 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century.<ref>The [http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ online catalogue of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale] lists 2,706 entries, of which around 100 are empty (accessed on 9 February 2013).</ref> Since 1977, access to the Enfer is no longer stricter than for the rest of the R\u00e9serve collections.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Guillaume Apollinaire, [[Fernand Fleuret]], [[Louis Perceau]]: ''L\u2019Enfer de la Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale.''

Per Klyden's wishes, but against Bortus's, the infant undergoes a procedure to transform it into a male following a controversial legal ruling on their home planet.<ref name=Episode1.3/> This development, and the attitudes prevalent among Moclans toward females that Klyden himself harbors, subsequently persist as a source of tension for the couple,<ref name=Episode2.12>\"Sanctuary\", ''The Orville'', Season 2, Episode 12.

Unbeknownst to Mercer, Grayson personally appealed to Admiral Halsey, asking him to give her ex-husband a command, insisting that, despite personal setbacks, he deserved it.

Per Klyden's wishes, but against Bortus's, the infant undergoes a procedure to transform it into a male following a controversial legal ruling on their home planet.<ref name=Episode1.3/> This development, and the attitudes prevalent among Moclans toward females that Klyden himself harbors, subsequently persist as a source of tension for the couple,<ref name=Episode2.12>\"Sanctuary\", ''The Orville'', Season 2, Episode 12.
