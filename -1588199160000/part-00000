Its international branches, Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, are respectively headquartered in [[Redmond, Washington]], and [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt, Germany]]. Nintendo is one of the world's largest [[Lists of video game companies|video game companies]] by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises of all-time, such as ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Animal Crossing]],'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''.\n\nNintendo was founded by [[Fusajiro Yamauchi]] on 23 September 1889 and originally produced handmade ''[[hanafuda]]'' [[playing card]]s. By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and [[love hotel]]s, without major success. Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo developed into a [[video game]] company in the 1970s. Supplemented since the 1980s by its regional branches Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, it ultimately became one of the most influential in the [[video game industry]] and one of Japan's most-valuable companies, with a market value of over {{USD}}37 billion by 2018.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.dfcint.com/dossier/who-is-worth-more-sony-and-nintendo-market-value/|title=Who is worth more?

Nintendo continued to produce popular toys, including the [[Ultra Machine]], [[Love Tester]] and the ''Kousenjuu'' series of [[light gun]] games.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Despite some successful products, Nintendo struggled to meet the fast development and manufacturing turnaround required in the toy market, and fell behind the well-established companies such as [[Bandai]] and [[Tomy]].<ref name=\"Business Insider, Before Mario\" /> In 1973, its focus shifted to family entertainment venues with the [[Laser Clay Shooting System]], using the same light gun technology used in Nintendo's ''Kousenjuu'' series of toys, and set up in abandoned bowling alleys. Following some success, Nintendo developed several more light gun machines (such as the [[light gun shooter]] game ''[[Wild Gunman]]'') for the emerging arcade scene.

Nintendo had some small success with this venture, but the release of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' in 1981, designed by Miyamoto, changed Nintendo's fortunes dramatically. The success of the game and many licensing opportunities (such as ports on the [[Atari 2600]], [[Intellivision]] and [[ColecoVision]]) gave Nintendo a huge boost in profit and in addition, the game also introduced an early iteration of [[Mario]], then known in Japan as Jumpman, the eventual company [[mascot]].

The Super Famicom was finally released relatively late to the market in Japan on 21 November 1990, and released as the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (officially abbreviated the Super NES or SNES and commonly shortened to Super Nintendo) in North America on 23 August 1991 and in Europe in 1992.

[[Nintendo Integrated Research & Development|Nintendo IRD]] general manager [[Genyo Takeda]] was impressed by video game development company [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s progress with real-time 3D graphics technology, using state of the art [[Silicon Graphics]] workstations.

It was released on September 20, 2019 as a handheld-only version of the Switch console, and is considered the successor to the [[New Nintendo 3DS]].\n\n== Marketing ==\n{{Main|Nintendo marketing}}\n[[Nintendo of America]] has engaged in several high-profile marketing campaigns to define and position its brand. One of its earliest and most enduring slogans was \"Now you're playing with power!\", used first to promote its Nintendo Entertainment System.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} It modified the slogan to include \"SUPER power\" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and \"PORTABLE power\" for the Game Boy.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Its 1994 \"Play It Loud!\" campaign played upon teenage rebellion and fostered an edgy reputation.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} During the Nintendo 64 era, the slogan was \"Get N or get out.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} During the GameCube era, the \"Who Are You?\" suggested a link between the games and the players' identities.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The company promoted its Nintendo DS handheld with the tagline \"Touching is Good.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} For the Wii, they used the \"Wii would like to play\" slogan to promote the console with the people who tried the games including ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''. The Nintendo 3DS used the slogan \"Take a look inside\".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The [[Wii U]] used the slogan \"How U will play next.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The [[Nintendo Switch]] uses the slogan \"Switch and Play\" in North America, and \"Play anywhere, anytime, with anyone\" in Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n=== Logos ===\nUsed since the 1960s, Nintendo's most recognizable logo is the racetrack shape, especially the red-colored wordmark on a white background, primarily used in the Western markets from 1985 to 2006. In Japan, a monochromatic version that lacks a colored background is on Nintendo's own Famicom, Super Famicom, Nintendo 64, GameCube, and handheld console packaging and marketing. Since 2006, in conjunction with the launch of the Wii, Nintendo changed its logo to a gray variant that lacks a colored background inside the wordmark, making it transparent. Nintendo's official, corporate logo remains this variation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/index.html|title=\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\uff1a\u4f1a\u793e\u60c5\u5831|website=\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30da\u30fc\u30b8}}</ref> For consumer products and marketing, a white variant on a red background has been used since 2015, and has been in full effect since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017.\n\n<gallery heights=\"100px\" widths=\"100px\">\nFile:Nintendo.png | 1889\u20131950\nFile:Nintendo - 1950.png | 1950\u20131960\nFile:Nintendo - 1960.png | 1960\u20131965\nFile:Nintendo - 1965.png | 1965\u20131970\nFile:Nintendo - 1967.png | 1967\u20131975\nFile:Nintendo - 1968.png | 1968\u20131975\nFile:Nintendo Logo 1970.png | 1970\u20131975\nFile:Nintendo - 1972.png | 1972\nFile:Nintendo red logo.svg | 1975\u20132006\nFile:Nintendo gray logo.svg | 2006\u20132016\nFile:Nintendo.svg | 2016\u2013present\n</gallery>\n\n== Company structure ==\n=== Board of directors ===\n\n==== Representative directors ====\n* [[Shuntaro Furukawa]], [[President (corporate title)|President]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/en/officer/index.html |title=Directors/Executive Officers |publisher=Nintendo |access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2018/180426_5e.pdf |title=Notice Regarding Changes of Representative Director and Other Management |date=26 April 2018 |publisher=Nintendo |access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Fellow\n\n==== Directors ====\n* Shinya Takahashi, senior managing executive officer, general manager of [[Entertainment Planning & Development]]\n* Ko Shiota, senior executive officer, general manager of [[Platform Technology Development]]\n* Satoru Shibata, senior executive officer, general manager of marketing and licensing\n\n==== Executive officers ====\n* [[Doug Bowser]], president and [[Chief operating officer|COO]] of Nintendo of America\n* [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]], [[Eiji Aonuma]], and [[Hisashi Nogami]], deputy general managers of [[Entertainment Planning & Development]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Doolan |first1=Liam |title=Eiji Aonuma And Multiple Others Have Been Promoted At Nintendo |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/eiji_aonuma_and_multiple_others_have_been_promoted_at_nintendo |website=Nintendo Life |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Takashi Tezuka]], senior officer of Entertainment Planning & Development\n\n=== Divisions ===\n{{Main|List of Nintendo development teams}}\nNintendo's internal research and development operations are divided into three main divisions: [[Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development]] (or EPD), the main software development division of Nintendo, which focuses on [[video game]] and [[software]] development; [[Nintendo Platform Technology Development]] (or PTD), which focuses on [[Home video game console|home]] and [[handheld video game console]] hardware development; and Nintendo Business Development (or NBD), which focuses on refining business strategy and is responsible for overseeing the [[smart device]] arm of the business.\n\n==== Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) ====\nThe [[Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development]] division is the primary software development division at Nintendo, formed as a merger between their former [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development|Entertainment Analysis & Development]] and [[Nintendo Software Planning & Development|Software Planning & Development]] divisions in 2015.

[[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] appointed his son-in-law [[Minoru Arakawa]] as president, who in turn hired his own wife and Yamauchi's daughter Yoko Yamauchi as the first employee. The Arakawa family moved from [[Vancouver]] to select an office in [[Manhattan]], New York, due to its central status in American commerce. Both from extremely affluent families, their goals were set more by achievement than money{{emdash}}and all their seed capital and products would now also be automatically inherited from Nintendo in Japan, and their inaugural target is the existing $8 billion-per-year [[coin-op]] [[arcade video game]] market and largest entertainment industry in the US, which already outclassed movies and television combined. During the couple's arcade research excursions, NoA hired gamer youths to work in the filthy, hot, ratty warehouse in [[New Jersey]] for the receiving and service of game hardware from Japan.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|94\u2013103}}\n\nIn late 1980 NoA contracted the Seattle-based arcade sales and distribution company Far East Video, consisting solely of experienced arcade salespeople Ron Judy and Al Stone. The two had already built a decent reputation and a distribution network, founded specifically for the independent import and sales of games from Nintendo because the Japanese company had for years been the under-represented maverick in America. Now as direct associates to the new NoA, they told Arakawa they could always clear all Nintendo inventory if Nintendo produced better games. Far East Video took NoA's  contract for a fixed per-unit commission on the exclusive American distributorship of Nintendo games, to be settled by their Seattle-based lawyer, [[Howard Lincoln]].<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|94\u2013103}}\n\nBased on favorable test arcade sites in Seattle, Arakawa wagered most of NoA's modest finances on a huge order of 3,000 ''[[Radar Scope]]'' cabinets. He panicked when the game failed in the fickle market upon its arrival from its four-month boat ride from Japan. Far East Video was already in financial trouble due to declining sales and Ron Judy borrowed his aunt's life savings of $50,000, while still hoping Nintendo would develop its first ''[[Pac-Man]]''-sized hit. Arakawa regretted founding the Nintendo subsidiary, with the distressed Yoko trapped between her arguing husband and father.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|103\u2013105}}\n\nAmid financial threat, Nintendo of America relocated from Manhattan to the Seattle metro to remove major stressors: the frenetic New York and New Jersey lifestyle and commute, and the extra weeks or months on the shipping route from Japan as was suffered by the ''Radar Scope'' disaster. With the Seattle harbor being the US's closest to Japan at only nine days by boat, and having a lumber production market for arcade cabinets, Arakawa's real estate scouts found a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} warehouse for rent containing three offices{{mdash}}one for Arakawa and one for Judy and Stone.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|105\u2013106}} This warehouse in the [[Tukwila, Washington|Tukwila]] [[suburb]] was owned by [[Mario Segale]] after whom the [[Mario]] character would be named, and was initially managed by former Far East Video employee Don James.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|109}} After one month, James recruited his college friend [[Howard Phillips (consultant)|Howard Phillips]] as assistant, who soon took over as warehouse manager.<ref name=\"MGC 2019 Howard\">{{cite video | title=MGC 2019 \u2013 Howard Phillips and Frank Cifaldi Interview | publisher=Hair of the Dogcast | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pqpQcdFDR4 | date=1 May 2019 | via=YouTube | accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref>{{rp|10:00, 17:25}}<ref name=\"Ninterview: Howard\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/10/ninterview_howard_gamemaster_phillips|title=Ninterview: Howard \"Gamemaster\" Phillips|last=McFerran|first=Damien|date=5 October 2012|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB|access-date=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Firestone2011\">{{cite book|author=Mary Firestone|title=Nintendo: The Company and Its Founders|url=https://archive.org/details/nintendocompanyi0000fire|url-access=registration|year=2011|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-61714-809-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nintendocompanyi0000fire/page/63 63]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Nintendo Frenzy\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-04-27-vw-343-story.html|title=Nintendo Frenzy : Trends: America is in the grips of a computer-game craze.

Although they all are subsidiaries of Nintendo (and therefore first party), they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with Nintendo's internal developers by the Japanese personal involved. This can be seen in the ''Iwata asks...'' interview series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wii U: Internet Browser |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wiiu/internet-browser/0/2 |accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref> [[Nintendo Software Technology]] (NST) and [[Nintendo Technology Development]] (NTD) are located in [[Redmond, Washington]], [[United States]], while [[Nintendo European Research & Development]] (''NERD'') is located in [[Paris]], [[France]], and [[Nintendo Network Service Database]] (NSD) is located in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].\n\nMost external [[First-party developer|first-party]] software development is done in [[Japan]], since the only overseas subsidiary is [[Retro Studios]] in the United States. Although these studios are all subsidiaries of Nintendo, they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with Nintendo's internal developers by the [[Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development]] (EPD) division. [[1-Up Studio]] and [[Nd Cube]] are located in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], while [[Monolith Soft]] has one studio located in Tokyo and another in [[Kyoto]]. [[Retro Studios]] is located in [[Austin]], [[Texas]].\n\nNintendo also established [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company]] alongside [[Creatures (company)|Creatures]] and [[Game Freak]] in order to effectively manage the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] brand. Similarly, Warpstar Inc. was formed through a joint investment with [[HAL Laboratory]], which was in charge of the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' animated series.\n\n===Additional distributors===\n====Bergsala====\n[[Bergsala]], a third-party company based in Sweden, exclusively handles Nintendo operations in the Scandinavian region. Bergsala's relationship with Nintendo was established in 1981 when the company sought to distribute ''Game & Watch'' units to Sweden, which later expanded to the NES console by 1986.

Although Nintendo allowed [[graphic violence]] in its video games released in Japan, [[nudity and sexuality]] were strictly prohibited. Former Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] believed that if the company allowed the licensing of [[Pornography|pornographic]] games, the company's image would be forever tarnished.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/> Nintendo of America went further in that games released for Nintendo consoles could not feature nudity, sexuality, [[profanity]] (including [[racism]], [[sexism]] or [[Hate speech|slurs]]), blood, graphic or [[domestic violence]], [[drug]]s, political messages or [[Religious symbolism|religious symbols]] (with the exception of widely unpracticed religions, such as the [[Greek mythology|Greek Pantheon]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php |title=Nintendo of America Content Guidelines |publisher=Filibustercartoons.com |date= |accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> The Japanese parent company was concerned that it may be viewed as a \"Japanese Invasion\" by forcing Japanese [[community standards]] on North American and European children. Past the strict guidelines, some exceptions have occurred: ''[[Bionic Commando (NES video game)|Bionic Commando]]'' (though [[Nazi swastika|swastikas]] were eliminated in the US version), ''[[Smash TV]]'' and ''[[Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode]]'' contain human violence, the latter also containing implied [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Smoking|tobacco use]]; ''[[River City Ransom]]'' and ''[[Taboo: The Sixth Sense]]'' contain nudity, and the latter also contains religious images, as do ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest|Castlevania II]]'' and ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|III]]''.\n\nA known side effect of this policy is the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] version of ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' having more than double the unit sales of the Super NES version, mainly because Nintendo had forced publisher [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] to recolor the red blood to look like white sweat and replace some of the more gory graphics in its release of the game, making it less violent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/919/919357p10.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017054400/http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/919/919357p10.html |archivedate=17 October 2008 |title=IGN Presents the History of Mortal Kombat \u2013 Retro Feature at IGN |website=IGN |first=Travis |last=Fahs |accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref> By contrast, [[Sega]] allowed blood and gore to remain in the Genesis version (though a code is required to unlock the gore). Nintendo allowed the Super NES version of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' to ship uncensored the following year with a content warning on the packaging.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/mortal-kombat-ii/cover-art/gameCoverId,22874|title=Mortal Kombat II (1994) Amiga box cover art|website=MobyGames}}</ref>\n\nVideo game ratings systems were introduced with the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] of 1994 and the [[Pan European Game Information]] of 2003, and Nintendo discontinued most of its censorship policies in favor of consumers making their own choices. Today, changes to the content of games are done primarily by the game's developer or, occasionally, at the request of Nintendo. The only clear-set rule is that ESRB AO-rated games will not be licensed on Nintendo consoles in North America,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/buyers_guide.jsp |title=Nintendo of America Customer Service \u2013 Nintendo Buyer's Guide |publisher=Nintendo.com |date= |accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> a practice which is also enforced by [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] and [[Microsoft]], its two greatest competitors in the present market. Nintendo has since allowed several mature-content games to be published on its consoles, including these: ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'', ''[[Doom (franchise)|Doom]]'', ''[[Doom 64]]'', ''[[BMX XXX]]'', the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series, ''[[Killer7]]'', the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series, ''[[Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem]]'', ''[[BloodRayne]]'', ''[[Geist (video game)|Geist]]'', ''[[Dementium: The Ward]]'', ''[[Bayonetta 2]]'', ''[[Devil's Third]]'', and ''[[Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water]]''. Certain games have continued to be modified, however. For example, [[Konami]] was forced to remove all references to cigarettes in the 2000 [[Game Boy Color]] game ''[[Metal Gear Solid (Game Boy)|Metal Gear Solid]]'' (although the previous NES version of ''[[Metal Gear]]'' and the subsequent GameCube game ''[[Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes]]'' both included such references, as did Wii game ''[[MadWorld]]''), and maiming and blood were removed from the Nintendo 64 [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Cruis'n USA]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060333p1.html |title=IGN: Nintendo to censor Cruis'n |date=8 October 1996 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> Another example is in the Game Boy Advance game ''[[Mega Man Zero 3]]'', in which one of the bosses, called Hellbat Schilt in the Japanese and European releases, was renamed Devilbat Schilt in the North American [[Internationalization and localization|localization]]. In North America releases of the ''[[Mega Man Zero]]'' games, enemies and bosses killed with a saber attack do not gush blood as they do in the Japanese versions. However, the release of the Wii was accompanied by a number of even more controversial games, such as ''[[Manhunt 2]]'', ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]'', ''[[The House of the Dead: Overkill]]'', and ''[[MadWorld]]'', the latter three of which were published exclusively for the console.\n\n=== License guidelines ===\nNintendo of America also had guidelines before 1993 that had to be followed by its licensees to make games for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], in addition to the above content guidelines.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/> Guidelines were enforced through the [[10NES]] lockout chip.\n* Licensees were not permitted to release the same game for a competing console until two years had passed.\n* Nintendo would decide how many cartridges would be supplied to the licensee.\n* Nintendo would decide how much space would be dedicated such as for articles and advertising in the ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine.\n* There was a minimum number of cartridges that had to be ordered by the licensee from Nintendo.\n* There was a yearly limit of five games that a licensee may produce for a Nintendo console.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/>{{rp|215}} This rule was created to prevent market over-saturation, which had contributed to the [[North American video game crash of 1983]].\n\nThe last rule was circumvented in a number of ways; for example, Konami, wanting to produce more games for Nintendo's consoles, formed [[Ultra Games]] and later [[Ultra Games|Palcom]] to produce more games as a technically different publisher.<ref name=\"Game Over\"/> This disadvantaged smaller or emerging companies, as they could not afford to start additional companies. In another side effect, [[Square (video game company)|Square Co]] (now [[Square Enix]]) executives have suggested that the price of publishing games on the [[Nintendo 64]] along with the degree of censorship and control that Nintendo enforced over its games, most notably ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', were factors in switching its focus towards [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] console.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nIn 1993, a [[class action]] suit was taken against Nintendo under allegations that their lockout chip enabled [[unfair business practices]]. The case was settled, with the condition that California consumers were entitled to a $3 discount coupon for a game of Nintendo's choice.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Nintendo May Owe You $3 |work=[[GamePro]] |issue=55 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=February 1994 |page=187}}</ref>\n\n=== Intellectual property protection ===\nNintendo has generally been proactive to assure its [[intellectual property]] in both hardware and software is protected. With the NES system, Nintendo employed a [[CIC (Nintendo)|lock-out system]] that only allowed authorizes game cartridges they manufactured to be playable on the system.\n\nNintendo has used [[Video game console emulator|emulation]] by itself or licensed from third parties to provide means to re-release games from their older platforms on newer systems, with [[Virtual Console]], which re-released classic games as downloadable titles, the NES and SNES library for [[Nintendo Switch Online]] subscribers, and with dedicated consoles like the [[NES Classic Edition|NES Mini]] and [[Super NES Classic Edition|SNES Mini]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}  However, Nintendo has taken a hard stance against unlicensed emulation of its video games and consoles, stating that it is the single largest threat to the [[intellectual property]] rights of video game developers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp#roms |title=Nintendo \u2013 Corporate Information \u2013 Legal Information (Copyrights, Emulators, ROMs, etc.) |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> Further, Nintendo has taken action against fan-made games which have used significant facets of their IP, issuing [[cease & desist]] letters to these projects or [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]-related complaints to services that host these projects.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/2/12770344/nintendo-slaps-metroid-2-remake-and-500-plus-fangames-with-takedown-orders | title = Nintendo slaps Metroid 2 remake and 500-plus fangames with takedown orders | first=  Allegra | last= Frank | date = September 2, 2016 | accessdate = September 10, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Nintendo has taken legal action against sites that knowingly distribute [[ROM image]]s of their games.

Distributed by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]], the films are based on various properties from [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] that are associated with the character [[Spider-Man]]. Sony's Marvel Universe began with the release of the film ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' in October 2018.\n\nWork on an expanded universe using supporting characters from the ''Spider-Man'' films began by December 2013. Sony planned to use ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (2014) to launch several [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] films focused on traditional Spider-Man villains from the comics, including a [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] film. After the relative critical and financial failure of ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'', these plans were abandoned and in February 2015, Sony announced a deal to collaborate with [[Marvel Studios]] on future ''Spider-Man'' films and integrate the character into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). This relationship produced ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', before being renegotiated to share [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]]'s Spider-Man between the MCU and Sony's Marvel Universe. Meanwhile, ''Venom'' was redeveloped as a separate standalone film, and was announced as the first film in Sony's shared universe in May 2017.\n\nSony is developing a number of films as part of the franchise, with ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'' and ''[[Venom: Let There Be Carnage]]'' scheduled for release in 2021. [[Sony Pictures Television]] is also developing several television series set in the shared universe, including a reworking of the planned film ''[[Silver & Black (unproduced film)|Silver & Black]]''. Additionally, the studio released the animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' in 2018, which introduced the idea of a [[multiverse]] connecting multiple universes\u2014including Sony's Marvel Universe.\n\n== Background ==\nIn January 2010, Sony announced that the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' film franchise]] would be rebooted after director [[Sam Raimi]] decided to no longer continue his version of the franchise.<ref name=\"RebootAnnouncement\" /> By March 2012, Sony was still interested in a spin-off film they had been developing centered on the character [[Venom (Marvel Comics)|Venom]], looking to capitalize on the release of the first reboot film, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012).<ref name=\"TrankMar2012\" /> That June, producers [[Avi Arad]] and [[Matt Tolmach]] discussed ''Venom'' and ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' in reference to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and how the different franchises set in that world crossed over with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), with Tolmach saying, \"Hopefully all these worlds will live together in peace someday.\"<ref name=\"AradTolmachJune2012\" /> In December 2013, Sony revealed plans to use ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (2014) to establish their own expanded universe based on the Marvel properties the studio had the film rights to, including Venom. Arad and Tolmach would produce the films as part of a franchise brain trust that also included [[Alex Kurtzman]], [[Roberto Orci]], [[Jeff Pinkner]], [[Ed Solomon]], and [[Drew Goddard]], and ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' and ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' director [[Marc Webb]].<ref name=\"UniverseAnnouncement\" /> However, after ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' underperformed and with Sony \"under tremendous pressure to perform [that has them taking] a hard look at their most important franchise\", the direction of the new shared universe was rethought.<ref name=\"VenomCarnage\" />\n\nFollowing the [[Sony Pictures hack|November 2014 hacking of Sony's computers]], emails between [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]] Co-Chairman [[Amy Pascal]] and president [[Doug Belgrad]] were released, stating that Sony was planning to \"rejuvenate\" the ''Spider-Man'' franchise by developing an animated comedy film with [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]]. Sony executives were set to discuss the project further in a discussion regarding several ''Spider-Man'' spin-off films at a summit in January 2015.<ref name=\"WSJDec2014\" /> In February 2015, Sony and Marvel Studios announced a new partnership that would see the latter produce the next Spider-Man film for Sony, and integrate the character into the MCU.<ref name=\"SpideyMCU\" /> Sony still planned to produce the spin-off films without Marvel's involvement,<ref name=\"SpinoffsStillOn\" /><ref name=\"VenomCarnage\" /> but these were believed to have been \"scrapped\" by November, with Sony instead focusing on its new reboot with Marvel.<ref name=\"SpinoffsNotOn\" /> Discussing the animated film during that year, Sony Pictures chairman [[Tom Rothman]] said it would \"co-exist\" with the live-action Spider-Man films, though Sony stated it would \"exist independently of the projects in the live-action Spider-Man universe\".<ref name=\"VarietyApr2015\" /> The animated film, ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018), is set in an alternate universe from the Marvel Spider-Man reboot,<ref name=\"SpiderVerseTrailerVerge\" /> but introduces the comic-based concept of the \"Spider-Verse\" [[multiverse]], in which different incarnations of Spider-Man can be brought together.<ref name=\"SpiderVerseCastJun2018\" />\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== ''Venom'' and Sony's Marvel Universe ===\n''Venom'' was revived by Sony in March 2016, envisioned as a standalone film unrelated from Sony and Marvel's new ''Spider-Man'' films, which would launch its own franchise and shared universe.<ref name=\"RevivedMar2016\" /><ref name=\"RevivedMar2016Collider\" /> In May 2017, Sony confirmed that ''Venom'' was not considered a spin-off of any other film, and would officially begin \"Sony's Marvel Universe\".<ref name=\"HardyFleischerDeadline\" /> With their new universe, Sony was looking to build out the concept gradually rather than rush in as they had previously tried with the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' spin-offs.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelTHRJun2017\" /> In July, [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Sanford Panitch]] explained that they were looking to \"do what\u2019s the absolute best for each individual property. I just want to honor the original DNA.\" Because of this, Sony was hoping that individual filmmakers would give each film its own distinct style rather than having a single person in charge of the universe as with the MCU's [[Kevin Feige]]. The studio also wanted to avoid \"conventional comic-book movies\", with the intention of dealing in different genres such as horror or comedy, potential R-ratings, and even lower-than-usual budgets, depending on each project.<ref name=\"PlanJul2017\" /> By March 2018, Sony's executive vice president Palak Patel was overseeing all of the universe's films for the studio.<ref name=\"PatelExecutive\" />\n\nIn July 2018, ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'' interviewed several creatives involved in the universe to try alleviate the fears of some fans concerning Sony's plans. ''Homecoming'' writer [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]] said the future of the universe would be decided by the success of ''Venom'', and noted that other studios had struggled to replicate Marvel Studios' MCU success in the past. [[Brian Michael Bendis]], comic creator of many Marvel characters that Sony planned to add to their universe, consulted on ''Into the Spider-Verse'' and was aware of Sony's plans for their overall shared universe. He described them as \"very cool. Fans wouldn\u2019t be annoyed with what they\u2019re doing.\" He added that MCU films such as ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), which he was also involved in, were considered risks due to the lack of familiarity that general audiences had with those properties, but they both went on to be successful. This could also happen to the lesser-known Spider-Man characters if the films are well-made.<ref name=\"VultureUniverseJuly2018\" /> By August, the shared universe was being referred to as \"Sony's Universe of Marvel Characters\" internally at Sony. The company was confirmed to have the rights to 900 Marvel Comics characters, and Panitch explained that \"Spider-Man connects to a lot of the characters. There are villains, heroes, and antiheroes, and a lot are female characters, many of whom are bona fide, fully dimensionalized, and utterly unique. We feel there\u2019s no reason the Marvel characters shouldn\u2019t be able to embrace diversity.\"<ref name=\"VarietyUniverseAug2018\" /> When asked whether Venom would act as the \"common thread\" throughout the shared universe, Sony said this was not necessarily the case as they wanted ''Venom'' to be standalone.<ref name=\"CrossoverSyfyAug2018\" /><ref name=\"TolmachStandaloneSep2018\" /> They did say that ''Venom'' would have \"key points of intersection\" with other films.<ref name=\"CrossoverSyfyAug2018\" />\n\nFollowing the successful release of ''Venom'', Pascal said some of Sony's \"previously shelved plans\" could now come to fruition, including a crossover based on the villainous [[Sinister Six]] team.<ref name=\"PascalDec2018\" /> In March 2019, Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman [[Tony Vinciquerra]] said that \"the next seven or eight years\" of the shared universe had been planned.<ref name=\"TVMar2019\" />\n\n=== Spider-Man and the Marvel Cinematic Universe ===\nFeige stated in June 2017 that because ''Venom'' was solely a Sony project, Marvel Studios had no plans to have it crossover with the MCU.<ref name=\"FeigeNoMCU\" /> However, producer [[Amy Pascal]] soon clarified that Sony intended to have their new Marvel-based films take place in \"the same world\" as ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), the first ''Spider-Man'' film set in the MCU, describing them as \"adjunct\" to that world. She said that ''Venom'' would have connections with the next planned film in Sony's Marvel Universe, ''[[Silver & Black (unproduced film)|Silver & Black]]'', and that there was potential for [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]]'s Spider-Man to crossover from the MCU films to the Sony MU films.<ref name=\"PascalYesMCU?\" /> Holland was not contracted to appear outside of a trilogy of ''Spider-Man'' films and several other MCU films, but Sony intended to have the actor appear in their other Marvel films eventually.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelTHRJun2017\" /> According to several reports, Holland spent several days during ''Venom''{{'}}s production filming a cameo appearance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man for the film,<ref name=\"HollandCameo\" /><ref name=\"HollandCameo2\" /> but Marvel Studios asked Sony to exclude the scene from the final film.<ref name=\"HollandCameoCut\" />\n\nBy August 2018, Sony was actively planning to crossover Spider-Man with their own Marvel films, describing the character and Venom as \"already in the same universe ... we are looking forward to the two of them eventually facing off in the future\".<ref name=\"CrossoverSyfyAug2018\" /> Sony was also open to more of their characters appearing in MCU films, while Brent Lang and Justin Kroll of ''Variety'' speculated that the studio would like more MCU characters to make cameos in their films as well.<ref name=\"VarietyUniverseAug2018\" /> In December, ''Venom'' writer [[Jeff Pinkner]] was asked if that film was set in the same universe as Holland's Spider-Man films, and he said, \"without revealing anything that I\u2019m not allowed to reveal, it is not impossible that in a future/upcoming Venom movie, Spider-Man will play a significant role\".<ref name=\"PinknerDFDec2018\" /> Pascal added, in reference to the chances of a crossover between the MCU ''Spider-Man'' films, Sony's own shared universe films, and Sony's animated ''Spider-Verse'' films, that \"there's a world in which everything comes together\", but Holland was restricted by his contract with Marvel Studios at that time.<ref name=\"PascalDec2018\" />\n\nBy August 2019, Marvel Studios and Disney had spent several months discussing expanding their deal with Sony, with the latter looking to include more films than were originally agreed upon while keeping the same terms of the original agreement. Disney expressed concern with Feige's workload producing the non-Spider-Man MCU films already, and asked for a 25\u201350% stake in any future films Feige produces for Sony.<ref name=\"NoNewSonyDealDeadline\" /><ref name=\"NoNewDealSonyResponse\" /><ref name=\"WattsDeadlineAug2019\" /> Unable to come to an agreement, Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider-Man film without Feige or Marvel. They acknowledged that this could change in the future, thanked Feige for his work on ''Homecoming'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), and stated that they appreciated \"the path [Feige] has helped put us on, which we will continue.\"<ref name=\"NoNewDealSonyResponse\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that the end of the studios' agreement \"almost certainly\" meant that Holland's Spider-Man would no longer appear in MCU films, but \"significantly increased\" the chances of the character crossing over with the rest of Sony's own Marvel films such as the Venom franchise and the then-in-production ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'' (2021).<ref name=\"NoNewSonyDealCrossoversTHR\" /> In September, Vinciquerra stated that \"for the moment the door is closed\" on Spider-Man returning to the MCU, and confirmed that the character would be integrated with Sony's own shared universe moving forward, saying \"he will play off the other characters\" that the studio owns the rights to. In response to backlash from fans following the announcement, Vinciquerra added that \"the Marvel people are terrific people, we have great respect for them, but on the other hand we have some pretty terrific people of our own. Kevin didn\u2019t do all the work ... we\u2019re pretty capable of doing what we have to do here.\"<ref name=\"VinciquerraMCUSep2019\" />\n\nFollowing a negative fan reaction at Disney's biennial convention [[D23 Expo|D23]], and at the urging of Holland who personally spoke to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] and Rothman,<ref name=\"HollandTHROct2019\" /> Disney returned to negotiations with Sony.<ref name=\"DeadlineSonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> Later that September, Sony and Disney announced a new agreement that would allow Marvel Studios and Feige to produce another Spider-Man film for Sony, keeping the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelDealSM3\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineSonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> The agreement also allowed Holland's Spider-Man to appear in a future Marvel Studios film, while Feige stated that moving forward the MCU's Spider-Man would be able to \"cross cinematic universes\" and appear in Sony's own shared universe as well.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> This interaction was said to be \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\". Sony described their previous films with Marvel Studios as a \"great collaboration\", and said \"our mutual desire to continue was equal to that of the many fans.\"<ref name=\"DeadlineSonyMarvelDealSM3\" /><!-- In January 2020, the first trailer for ''Morbius'' revealed several references to MCU ''Spider-Man'' films, including [[Michael Keaton]] reprising his role of [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes / Vulture]] from ''Spider-Man: Homecoming''.<ref name=\"KeatonM\" /><ref name=\"LetoTrailerM\" />-->\n\n=== Expansion to television ===\nVinciquerra stated in March 2019 that the universe would be expanding to television with a set of Marvel characters developed specifically by [[Sony Pictures Television]]. At the time, the studio was \"essentially internally auditioning\" characters from the 900 to decide which medium they would appear in, with Sony Pictures Television chairman Mike Hopkins describing their progress in selecting characters to star on television as being \"pretty far down the road\". Hopkins elaborated that Sony planned to have several series set in the shared universe that could \"pollinate between each other\", and that they would be released by a yet-to-be-determined network partner. An announcement of this partner was expected within the next few months, with the networks owned by Marvel's parent Disney\u2014including their new streaming service [[Disney+]]\u2014being considered alongside others. These television plans were attributed to the success of ''Venom'' and ''Into the Spider-Verse'', which \"bolstered confidence that there\u2019s an appetite for Sony\u2019s slice of Marvel\".<ref name=\"TVMar2019\" />\n\nAfter their work on ''Into the Spider-Verse'', Lord and Miller signed an overall deal with Sony Pictures Television in April 2019 to develop several television series for the studio, including their Marvel-based series which could potentially include characters from ''Into the Spider-Verse'' as well as the planned live-action properties. Select projects would be produced in conjunction with Pascal.<ref name=\"LordMillerTV\" /> Discussing these series in August, Miller could not update where or when the series would be released but said there would be several live-action series and that they would each be \"their own unique experience\" while still being related to each other.<ref name=\"LordMillerAug2019\" /> The next month, Vinciquerra stated that there were five or six individual television series in development for the universe at that time.<ref name=\"VinciquerraMCUSep2019\" /> By January 2020, one of these series was believed to be a version of ''Silver & Black'' after development on that film was canceled in August 2018.<ref name=\"S&BTVRumor\" /><ref name=\"VarietyUniverseAug2018\" /> [[Gina Prince-Bythewood]], who co-wrote and was going to direct the film version before it was canceled, confirmed in April 2020 that ''Silver & Black'' was being re-developed for television.

{"title_page": "1960s in France", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2007}}{{History of France}}\nFrance emerged from World War II in the 1960s, rebuilding the country physically and the nation's national identity through the [[French Fifth Republic]]. Under the leadership of [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] (1959\u20131969), France regained its [[Great power#The Great Powers|great power]] status.\n\n==1958\u201362: Founding of the Fifth Republic==\nIn the [[1958 French legislative election|November 1958 elections]], de Gaulle and his supporters (initially organised in the '''Union pour la Nouvelle R\u00e9publique-Union D\u00e9mocratique du Travail''', then the '''Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la V\u00e8me R\u00e9publique''', and later still the '''[[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique]]''', UDR) won a comfortable majority. In December, de Gaulle was [[1958 French presidential election|elected President by the electoral college]] with 78% of the vote, and inaugurated in January 1959.\n\nHe oversaw tough economic measures to revitalize the country, including the issuing of a new [[franc]] (worth 100 old francs). Internationally, he rebuffed both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], pushing for an independent France with its own [[nuclear weapon]]s, and strongly encouraged a \"[[United States of Europe|Free Europe]],\" believing that a confederation of all European nations would restore the past glories of the great European empires. He set about building [[Franco-German cooperation]] as the cornerstone of the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC), paying the first [[state visit]] to Germany by a French head of state since [[Napoleon]]. In 1963, Germany and France signed a treaty of friendship, the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty]]. France also reduced its dollar reserves, trading them for gold from the U.S. government, thereby reducing America's economic influence abroad.\n\nOn 23 November 1959 in a speech in [[Strasbourg]], de Gaulle announced his vision for Europe:\n<blockquote>\n''Oui, c'est l'Europe, depuis l'Atlantique jusqu'\u00e0 l'Oural, c'est toute l'Europe, qui d\u00e9cidera du destin du monde.''\n(\"Yes, it is Europe, from the Atlantic to the [[Urals]], it is Europe, it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the destiny of the world.\")</blockquote>\nHis expression, \"Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals,\" has often been cited throughout the history of [[European integration]]. It became, for the next ten years, de Gaulle's favorite political rallying cry. His vision stood in contrast to the [[Atlanticism]] of the United States, Britain and NATO, preferring instead a Europe that would act as a third [[polarity (power)|pole]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. By including in his ideal of Europe all the territory up to the Urals, de Gaulle was implicitly offering [[d\u00e9tente]] to the [[Soviets]], while his phrase was also interpreted as excluding the United Kingdom from a future Europe.\n\nHe vetoed the British application to join the EEC in 1963, because he thought that the United Kingdom lacked the political will to join the community.<ref name=a>{{cite web|title=How the EU was built|accessdate=2007-08-18|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1055729.stm | work=BBC News | date=2000-12-05}}</ref> Many Britons took de Gaulle's \"non\" as an insult, especially with the role the United Kingdom had played in the Liberation of France only 19 years earlier.\n\nDe Gaulle believed that while the war in Algeria was militarily winnable, it was not defensible internationally, and he became reconciled to the colony's eventual independence. This stance greatly angered the [[Pied-Noir|French settlers]] and their metropolitan supporters, and de Gaulle was forced to suppress two uprisings in Algeria by French settlers and troops, in the second of which (the [[Generals' Putsch]] in April 1961) France herself was threatened with invasion by rebel paratroops. De Gaulle's government also covered up the [[Paris massacre of 1961]], issued under the orders of the police prefect [[Maurice Papon]]. He was also targeted by the settler [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS) terrorist group and several assassination attempts were made on him; the most famous is that of 22 August 1962, when he and his wife narrowly escaped an assassination attempt when their [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] was targeted by [[machine gun]] fire arranged by [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]] in [[Petit-Clamart]]. After a [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|referendum on Algerian self-determination]] carried out in 1961, de Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 [[\u00c9vian Accords]], legitimated by another [[1962 French \u00c9vian Accords referendum|referendum]] a month later. Algeria became independent in July 1962, while an amnesty was later issued covering all crimes committed during the war, including the [[Torture during the Algerian War|use of torture]]. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 French settlers left the country. The exodus accelerated after the [[Oran massacre of 1962|5th of July 1962 massacre]].<ref name=b>[http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/08/01/PM200608016.html Pied-noirs breathe life back into Algerian tourism]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1962, de Gaulle sought a constitutional amendment to allow the president to be [[Direct universal suffrage|directly elected by the people]] and issued another [[1962 French presidential election referendum|referendum to this end]], approved by more than three-fifths of voters despite a broad \"coalition of no\" formed by most of the parties, opposed to a presidential regime. After a [[motion of censure]] voted by the Parliament on 4 October 1962 de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and held [[1962 French legislative election|new elections]]. Although the left progressed, the Gaullists won an increased majority, despite opposition from the Christian democratic [[Popular Republican Movement]] and the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants]] (CNIP) who criticized de Gaulle's [[euroscepticism]] and [[presidentialism]]. Although the government settled the Algerian issue, Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] resigned over the final settlement and [[Georges Pompidou]] replaced him.\n\n==1962&ndash;68: Politics of grandeur==\nWith the Algerian conflict behind him, de Gaulle achieved his two main objectives: to reform and develop the [[French economy]], and to promote an independent [[Foreign relations of France|foreign policy]] and a strong stance on the international stage. This was, as named by foreign observers, the \"politics of grandeur\" (''politique de grandeur'').\n\n==\"Thirty glorious years\"==\nIn the context of a population boom unseen in France since the 18th century, the government under prime minister [[Georges Pompidou]] oversaw a rapid transformation and expansion of the French economy. With ''[[dirigisme]]'' &mdash; a combination of capitalism and state-directed economy &mdash; the government intervened heavily in the economy, using indicative five-year plans as its main tool.\n\nHigh profile projects, mostly but not always financially successful, were launched: the extension of [[Marseille]] harbor (soon ranking third in Europe and first in the Mediterranean); the promotion of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] passenger jetliner (a predecessor of [[Airbus]]); the decision to start building the supersonic Franco-British [[Concorde]] airliner in [[Toulouse]]; the expansion of the French auto industry with state-owned [[Renault]] at its center; and the building of the first motorways between Paris and the provinces.\n\nWith these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivaled since the 19th century. In 1963, de Gaulle vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC for the first of two times. In 1964, for the first time in 200 years, France's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] overtook that of the United Kingdom, a position it held until the 1990s. This period is still remembered in France with some nostalgia as the peak of the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' (\"Thirty Glorious Years\" of economic growth between 1945 and 1974).\n\n==Fourth nuclear power==\n{{main|Nuclear power in France}}\nThis strong economic foundation enabled de Gaulle to implement his independent foreign policy. In 1960, France became the fourth state to acquire a [[France and nuclear weapons|nuclear arsenal]], detonating an [[Gerboise Bleue|atomic bomb]] in the [[Algeria]]n desert (a secret clause of the 1962 [[\u00c9vian Accords]] with the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] stated that \"Algeria concede... to France the use of certain air bases, terrains, sites and military installations which are necessary to it [France]\" during five years.) In 1968, at the insistence of de Gaulle, French scientists finally succeeded in detonating a [[Canopus (nuclear test)|hydrogen bomb]] without American assistance. In what was regarded as a snub to Britain, de Gaulle declared France to be the third big independent nuclear power, as Britain's nuclear force was closely coordinated with that of the United States.\n\nWhile grandeur was surely an essential motive in these nuclear developments, another was the concern that the U.S., involved in an unpopular and costly [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]], would hesitate to intervene in Europe should the Soviet Union decide to invade. De Gaulle wanted to develop an independent ''[[force de frappe]]''. An additional effect was that the French military, which had been demoralized and close to rebellion after the [[Algerian War of Independence|loss of Algeria]], was kept busy. In 1965, France launched [[Diamant|its first satellite into orbit]], being the third country in the world to build a complete delivery system, after the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\n==China==\nDe Gaulle was convinced that a strong and independent France could act as a balancing force between the United States and the Soviet Union, a policy seen as little more than posturing and opportunism by his critics, particularly in Britain and the United States, to which France was formally allied. In January 1964, he officially recognized the People's Republic of China, despite the opposition of the U.S. government. Eight years later U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] [[Nixon visit to China 1972|visited the PRC]] and began normalizing relations.\n\nNixon's first foreign visit after his election was to France in 1969. He and de Gaulle both shared the same non-Wilsonian approach to world affairs, believing in nations and their relative strengths, rather than in ideologies, international organizations, or multilateral agreements. De Gaulle is famously known for calling the [[United Nations]] ''le Machin'' (\"the thing\").\n\n==Second round==\nIn December 1965, de Gaulle returned as president for a second seven-year term, but this time he had to go through a second round of voting in which he defeated [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]. In February 1966, France withdrew from the common [[NATO]] military command, but remained within the organization. He also declared that all foreign military forces had to leave French territory, giving them one year to redeploy.\n\nIn September 1966, in a famous speech in [[Phnom Penh]] ([[Cambodia]]), he expressed France's disapproval of U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], calling for a U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam as the only way to ensure peace. As the Vietnam War had its roots in [[French colonialism]] in southeast Asia, this speech did little to endear de Gaulle to the Americans, even if they later came to the same conclusion.\n\n==Empty Chair Crisis==\n{{Main|Hallstein Commission}}\nDuring the establishment of the [[European Community]], de Gaulle helped precipitate one of the greatest crises in the history of the EC, the ''Empty Chair Crisis''. It involved the financing of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], but almost more importantly the use of [[qualified majority voting]] in the EC (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organization essentially unable to run its affairs until the [[Luxembourg compromise]] was reached in January 1966. De Gaulle managed to make QMV essentially meaningless for years to come, and halted more federalist plans for the EC, which he opposed.\n\n==Six-Day War==\n{{Main|Six-Day War}}\nHaving vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC a second time, in June 1967, he condemned the [[Israel]]is for their [[Military occupation|occupation]] of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] following the [[Six-Day War]], saying \"Israel is organising, on the territories which it has taken, an occupation which cannot work without oppression, repression and expulsions - and if there appears resistance to this, it will in turn be called 'terrorism'.\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080830062725/http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2636206.ece] This was a major change in French policy. Until then, France had been a staunch ally, helping Israel militarily and jointly planning the [[Suez Campaign]] in 1956.\n\nUnder de Gaulle, following the independence of [[Algeria]], France embarked on foreign policies more favourable to the [[Arab]] side, still a distinct aspect of French [[foreign policy]] today. Israel's leadership, stung by what it considered its capricious abandonment, turned towards the United States for military support. However, de Gaulle supported the principle of a just settlement for both the Arab and Jewish refugees of the Middle East within the framework of the [[United Nations]]. This was stated upon the adoption of [[UN Resolution 242]], in his press conference of 27 November 1967 and contained in his letter to [[David Ben-Gurion]] dated 9 January 1968.\n\n==Nigerian Civil War==\n{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}\nDuring Nigeria's civil war of 1967-1970, de Gaulle's government supported the Republic of [[Biafra]] in its struggle to gain independence from [[Nigeria]]. Despite lack of official recognition, de Gaulle provided covert military assistance through France's former African colonies. The United Kingdom opposed de Gaulle's stance, but he viewed the political position of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] in Nigeria as analogous to that of the French Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois living in Canada.\n\n==''Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre!''==\n{{main|Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:General Charles de Gaulle at Expo 67 e000996503.jpg|thumb|200px|A day after his ''Vive le Qu\u00e9bec Libre!'' speech, Charles de Gaulle attracts a crowd at Montreal's Expo 67 on 25 July 1967.]] -->\nIn July 1967, de Gaulle visited Canada, then-celebrating its centennial with a [[world's fair]], [[Expo 67]]. On 24 July, speaking to a large crowd from a balcony at [[Montreal]]'s city hall, de Gaulle uttered ''Vive le Qu\u00e9bec !'' (Long live Quebec!) then added, ''Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre !'' (Long live free Quebec!). Canadian media outlets strongly criticized the statement, and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Lester B. Pearson]], a soldier who had fought in World War I and a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner, stated that \"Canadians do not need to be liberated.\"[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-236-1132-10/on_this_day/politics_economy/vive_quebec_libre] De Gaulle left Canada of his own accord the next day without proceeding to [[Ottawa]] as scheduled. He never returned to Canada. The speech caused outrage in most of Canada and led to a serious diplomatic rift between the two countries. However, the event was seen as a watershed moment by the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]].\n\nIn December 1967, claiming continental European solidarity, he again rejected British entry into the [[European Economic Community]]. Many have commented that the \"policy of grandeur\" was probably too ambitious and heavy for the shoulders of France.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} This policy, it is argued, was only made possible by de Gaulle's resolve, and was not sustainable in the long run. In any case, it is still remembered in France as a defining era of modern French foreign policy, and it still largely inspires policy to this day.\n\n==May 1968==\n{{main|May 1968 events in France}}\nDe Gaulle's government was criticized within France, particularly for its heavy-handed style. While the written press and elections were free, the state had a monopoly on television and radio broadcasts (though there were private stations broadcasting from abroad; see [[ORTF]]) and the executive occasionally told public broadcasters the bias that they desired on news. In many respects, society was traditionalist and repressive. Many factors contributed to a general weariness of sections of the public, particularly the student youth, which led to the events of May 1968.\n\nThe huge demonstrations and strikes in France in May 1968 severely challenged de Gaulle's legitimacy. He briefly fled to [[Baden-Baden]] and met Massu, then French commander in Germany (to discuss possible army intervention against the protesters, according to popular unofficial accounts).\n\nIn a private meeting discussing the students' and workers' demands for direct participation in business and government he coined the phrase \"La r\u00e9forme oui, la [[chienlit]] non,\" politely translated as 'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no.' It was a [[vernacular]] [[scatological]] [[pun]] meaning '[[chienlit|chie-en-lit]], no'. The term is now common parlance in French political commentary, used both critically and ironically referring back to de Gaulle.\n\nDe Gaulle offered to accept some of the reforms the demonstrators sought. He again considered a referendum to support his moves, but Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament (in which the government had all but lost its majority in the March 1967 elections) and hold new elections instead. The June 1968 elections were a major success for the Gaullists and their allies; when shown the specter of revolution or even civil war, the majority of the country rallied to him. His party won 358 of 487 seats.

Some said the referendum was a self-conscious political suicide committed by de Gaulle after the traumatizing events of May 1968.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1960s in France| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2007}}{{History of France}}\nFrance emerged from World War II in the 1960s, rebuilding the country physically and the nation's national identity through the [[French Fifth Republic]]. Under the leadership of [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] (1959\u20131969), France regained its [[Great power#The Great Powers|great power]] status.\n\n==1958\u201362: Founding of the Fifth Republic==\nIn the [[1958 French legislative election|November 1958 elections]], de Gaulle and his supporters (initially organised in the '''Union pour la Nouvelle R\u00e9publique-Union D\u00e9mocratique du Travail''', then the '''Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la V\u00e8me R\u00e9publique''', and later still the '''[[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique]]''', UDR) won a comfortable majority. In December, de Gaulle was [[1958 French presidential election|elected President by the electoral college]] with 78% of the vote, and inaugurated in January 1959.\n\nHe oversaw tough economic measures to revitalize the country, including the issuing of a new [[franc]] (worth 100 old francs). Internationally, he rebuffed both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], pushing for an independent France with its own [[nuclear weapon]]s, and strongly encouraged a \"[[United States of Europe|Free Europe]],\" believing that a confederation of all European nations would restore the past glories of the great European empires. He set about building [[Franco-German cooperation]] as the cornerstone of the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC), paying the first [[state visit]] to Germany by a French head of state since [[Napoleon]]. In 1963, Germany and France signed a treaty of friendship, the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty]]. France also reduced its dollar reserves, trading them for gold from the U.S. government, thereby reducing America's economic influence abroad.\n\nOn 23 November 1959 in a speech in [[Strasbourg]], de Gaulle announced his vision for Europe:\n<blockquote>\n''Oui, c'est l'Europe, depuis l'Atlantique jusqu'\u00e0 l'Oural, c'est toute l'Europe, qui d\u00e9cidera du destin du monde.''\n(\"Yes, it is Europe, from the Atlantic to the [[Urals]], it is Europe, it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the destiny of the world.\")</blockquote>\nHis expression, \"Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals,\" has often been cited throughout the history of [[European integration]]. It became, for the next ten years, de Gaulle's favorite political rallying cry. His vision stood in contrast to the [[Atlanticism]] of the United States, Britain and NATO, preferring instead a Europe that would act as a third [[polarity (power)|pole]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. By including in his ideal of Europe all the territory up to the Urals, de Gaulle was implicitly offering [[d\u00e9tente]] to the [[Soviets]], while his phrase was also interpreted as excluding the United Kingdom from a future Europe.\n\nHe vetoed the British application to join the EEC in 1963, because he thought that the United Kingdom lacked the political will to join the community.<ref name=a>{{cite web|title=How the EU was built|accessdate=2007-08-18|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1055729.stm | work=BBC News | date=2000-12-05}}</ref> Many Britons took de Gaulle's \u201cnon\u201d as an insult, especially with the role the United Kingdom had played in the Liberation of France only 19 years earlier.\n\nDe Gaulle believed that while the war in Algeria was militarily winnable, it was not defensible internationally, and he became reconciled to the colony's eventual independence. This stance greatly angered the [[Pied-Noir|French settlers]] and their metropolitan supporters, and de Gaulle was forced to suppress two uprisings in Algeria by French settlers and troops, in the second of which (the [[Generals' Putsch]] in April 1961) France herself was threatened with invasion by rebel paratroops. De Gaulle's government also covered up the [[Paris massacre of 1961]], issued under the orders of the police prefect [[Maurice Papon]]. He was also targeted by the settler [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS) terrorist group and several assassination attempts were made on him; the most famous is that of 22 August 1962, when he and his wife narrowly escaped an assassination attempt when their [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] was targeted by [[machine gun]] fire arranged by [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]] in [[Petit-Clamart]]. After a [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|referendum on Algerian self-determination]] carried out in 1961, de Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 [[\u00c9vian Accords]], legitimated by another [[1962 French \u00c9vian Accords referendum|referendum]] a month later. Algeria became independent in July 1962, while an amnesty was later issued covering all crimes committed during the war, including the [[Torture during the Algerian War|use of torture]]. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 French settlers left the country. The exodus accelerated after the [[Oran massacre of 1962|5th of July 1962 massacre]].<ref name=b>[http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/08/01/PM200608016.html Pied-noirs breathe life back into Algerian tourism]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1962, de Gaulle sought a constitutional amendment to allow the president to be [[Direct universal suffrage|directly elected by the people]] and issued another [[1962 French presidential election referendum|referendum to this end]], approved by more than three-fifths of voters despite a broad \"coalition of no\" formed by most of the parties, opposed to a presidential regime. After a [[motion of censure]] voted by the Parliament on 4 October 1962 de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and held [[1962 French legislative election|new elections]]. Although the left progressed, the Gaullists won an increased majority, despite opposition from the Christian democratic [[Popular Republican Movement]] and the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants]] (CNIP) who criticized de Gaulle's [[euroscepticism]] and [[presidentialism]]. Although the government settled the Algerian issue, Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] resigned over the final settlement and [[Georges Pompidou]] replaced him.\n\n==1962&ndash;68: Politics of grandeur==\nWith the Algerian conflict behind him, de Gaulle achieved his two main objectives: to reform and develop the [[French economy]], and to promote an independent [[Foreign relations of France|foreign policy]] and a strong stance on the international stage. This was, as named by foreign observers, the \"politics of grandeur\" (''politique de grandeur'').\n\n==\"Thirty glorious years\"==\nIn the context of a population boom unseen in France since the 18th century, the government under prime minister [[Georges Pompidou]] oversaw a rapid transformation and expansion of the French economy. With ''[[dirigisme]]'' &mdash; a combination of capitalism and state-directed economy &mdash; the government intervened heavily in the economy, using indicative five-year plans as its main tool.\n\nHigh profile projects, mostly but not always financially successful, were launched: the extension of [[Marseille]] harbor (soon ranking third in Europe and first in the Mediterranean); the promotion of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] passenger jetliner (a predecessor of [[Airbus]]); the decision to start building the supersonic Franco-British [[Concorde]] airliner in [[Toulouse]]; the expansion of the French auto industry with state-owned [[Renault]] at its center; and the building of the first motorways between Paris and the provinces.\n\nWith these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivaled since the 19th century. In 1963, de Gaulle vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC for the first of two times. In 1964, for the first time in 200 years, France's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] overtook that of the United Kingdom, a position it held until the 1990s. This period is still remembered in France with some nostalgia as the peak of the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' (\u201cThirty Glorious Years\" of economic growth between 1945 and 1974).\n\n==Fourth nuclear power==\n{{main|Nuclear power in France}}\nThis strong economic foundation enabled de Gaulle to implement his independent foreign policy. In 1960, France became the fourth state to acquire a [[France and nuclear weapons|nuclear arsenal]], detonating an [[Gerboise Bleue|atomic bomb]] in the [[Algeria]]n desert (a secret clause of the 1962 [[\u00c9vian Accords]] with the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] stated that \u201cAlgeria concede... to France the use of certain air bases, terrains, sites and military installations which are necessary to it [France]\u201d during five years.) In 1968, at the insistence of de Gaulle, French scientists finally succeeded in detonating a [[Canopus (nuclear test)|hydrogen bomb]] without American assistance. In what was regarded as a snub to Britain, de Gaulle declared France to be the third big independent nuclear power, as Britain's nuclear force was closely coordinated with that of the United States.\n\nWhile grandeur was surely an essential motive in these nuclear developments, another was the concern that the U.S., involved in an unpopular and costly [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]], would hesitate to intervene in Europe should the Soviet Union decide to invade. De Gaulle wanted to develop an independent ''[[force de frappe]]''. An additional effect was that the French military, which had been demoralized and close to rebellion after the [[Algerian War of Independence|loss of Algeria]], was kept busy. In 1965, France launched [[Diamant|its first satellite into orbit]], being the third country in the world to build a complete delivery system, after the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\n==China==\nDe Gaulle was convinced that a strong and independent France could act as a balancing force between the United States and the Soviet Union, a policy seen as little more than posturing and opportunism by his critics, particularly in Britain and the United States, to which France was formally allied. In January 1964, he officially recognized the People's Republic of China, despite the opposition of the U.S. government. Eight years later U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] [[Nixon visit to China 1972|visited the PRC]] and began normalizing relations.\n\nNixon's first foreign visit after his election was to France in 1969. He and de Gaulle both shared the same non-Wilsonian approach to world affairs, believing in nations and their relative strengths, rather than in ideologies, international organizations, or multilateral agreements. De Gaulle is famously known for calling the [[United Nations]] ''le Machin'' (\"the thing\").\n\n==Second round==\nIn December 1965, de Gaulle returned as president for a second seven-year term, but this time he had to go through a second round of voting in which he defeated [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]. In February 1966, France withdrew from the common [[NATO]] military command, but remained within the organization. He also declared that all foreign military forces had to leave French territory, giving them one year to redeploy.\n\nIn September 1966, in a famous speech in [[Phnom Penh]] ([[Cambodia]]), he expressed France's disapproval of U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], calling for a U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam as the only way to ensure peace. As the Vietnam War had its roots in [[French colonialism]] in southeast Asia, this speech did little to endear de Gaulle to the Americans, even if they later came to the same conclusion.\n\n==Empty Chair Crisis==\n{{Main|Hallstein Commission}}\nDuring the establishment of the [[European Community]], de Gaulle helped precipitate one of the greatest crises in the history of the EC, the ''Empty Chair Crisis''. It involved the financing of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], but almost more importantly the use of [[qualified majority voting]] in the EC (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organization essentially unable to run its affairs until the [[Luxembourg compromise]] was reached in January 1966. De Gaulle managed to make QMV essentially meaningless for years to come, and halted more federalist plans for the EC, which he opposed.\n\n==Six-Day War==\n{{Main|Six-Day War}}\nHaving vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC a second time, in June 1967, he condemned the [[Israel]]is for their [[Military occupation|occupation]] of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] following the [[Six-Day War]], saying \"Israel is organising, on the territories which it has taken, an occupation which cannot work without oppression, repression and expulsions - and if there appears resistance to this, it will in turn be called 'terrorism'.\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080830062725/http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2636206.ece] This was a major change in French policy. Until then, France had been a staunch ally, helping Israel militarily and jointly planning the [[Suez Campaign]] in 1956.\n\nUnder de Gaulle, following the independence of [[Algeria]], France embarked on foreign policies more favourable to the [[Arab]] side, still a distinct aspect of French [[foreign policy]] today. Israel's leadership, stung by what it considered its capricious abandonment, turned towards the United States for military support. However, de Gaulle supported the principle of a just settlement for both the Arab and Jewish refugees of the Middle East within the framework of the [[United Nations]]. This was stated upon the adoption of [[UN Resolution 242]], in his press conference of 27 November 1967 and contained in his letter to [[David Ben-Gurion]] dated 9 January 1968.\n\n==Nigerian Civil War==\n{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}\nDuring Nigeria's civil war of 1967-1970, de Gaulle's government supported the Republic of [[Biafra]] in its struggle to gain independence from [[Nigeria]]. Despite lack of official recognition, de Gaulle provided covert military assistance through France's former African colonies. The United Kingdom opposed de Gaulle's stance, but he viewed the political position of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] in Nigeria as analogous to that of the French Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois living in Canada.\n\n==''Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre!''==\n{{main|Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:General Charles de Gaulle at Expo 67 e000996503.jpg|thumb|200px|A day after his ''Vive le Qu\u00e9bec Libre!'' speech, Charles de Gaulle attracts a crowd at Montreal's Expo 67 on 25 July 1967.]] -->\nIn July 1967, de Gaulle visited Canada, then-celebrating its centennial with a [[world's fair]], [[Expo 67]]. On 24 July, speaking to a large crowd from a balcony at [[Montreal]]'s city hall, de Gaulle uttered ''Vive le Qu\u00e9bec !'' (Long live Quebec!) then added, ''Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre !'' (Long live free Quebec!). Canadian media outlets strongly criticized the statement, and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Lester B. Pearson]], a soldier who had fought in World War I and a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner, stated that \"Canadians do not need to be liberated.\"[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-236-1132-10/on_this_day/politics_economy/vive_quebec_libre] De Gaulle left Canada of his own accord the next day without proceeding to [[Ottawa]] as scheduled. He never returned to Canada. The speech caused outrage in most of Canada and led to a serious diplomatic rift between the two countries. However, the event was seen as a watershed moment by the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]].\n\nIn December 1967, claiming continental European solidarity, he again rejected British entry into the [[European Economic Community]]. Many have commented that the \"policy of grandeur\" was probably too ambitious and heavy for the shoulders of France.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} This policy, it is argued, was only made possible by de Gaulle's resolve, and was not sustainable in the long run. In any case, it is still remembered in France as a defining era of modern French foreign policy, and it still largely inspires policy to this day.\n\n==May 1968==\n{{main|May 1968 events in France}}\nDe Gaulle's government was criticized within France, particularly for its heavy-handed style. While the written press and elections were free, the state had a monopoly on television and radio broadcasts (though there were private stations broadcasting from abroad; see [[ORTF]]) and the executive occasionally told public broadcasters the bias that they desired on news. In many respects, society was traditionalist and repressive. Many factors contributed to a general weariness of sections of the public, particularly the student youth, which led to the events of May 1968.\n\nThe huge demonstrations and strikes in France in May 1968 severely challenged de Gaulle's legitimacy. He briefly fled to [[Baden-Baden]] and met Massu, then French commander in Germany (to discuss possible army intervention against the protesters, according to popular unofficial accounts).\n\nIn a private meeting discussing the students' and workers' demands for direct participation in business and government he coined the phrase \"La r\u00e9forme oui, la [[chienlit]] non,\" politely translated as 'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no.' It was a [[vernacular]] [[scatological]] [[pun]] meaning '[[chienlit|chie-en-lit]], no'. The term is now common parlance in French political commentary, used both critically and ironically referring back to de Gaulle.\n\nDe Gaulle offered to accept some of the reforms the demonstrators sought. He again considered a referendum to support his moves, but Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament (in which the government had all but lost its majority in the March 1967 elections) and hold new elections instead. The June 1968 elections were a major success for the Gaullists and their allies; when shown the specter of revolution or even civil war, the majority of the country rallied to him. His party won 358 of 487 seats. [[Maurice Couve de Murville]] replaced Pompidou in July.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nDe Gaulle resigned on 29 April 1969, following the defeat of his referendum to transform [[Senate of France|the Senate]] into an advisory body while giving extended powers to regional councils. Some said the referendum was a self-conscious political suicide committed by de Gaulle after the traumatizing events of May 1968.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1960s in France| ]]\n", "name_user": "Beland", "label": "safe", "comment": "convert special characters (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s_in_France"}

Materials ideal for kite building were readily available including [[silk]] fabric for sail material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line; and resilient [[bamboo]] for a strong, lightweight framework. By 549 AD [[paper]] kites were certainly being flown, as it was recorded that in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue mission. Ancient and medieval Chinese sources describe kites being used for measuring distances, testing the wind, lifting men, signaling, and communication for military operations. The earliest known Chinese kites were flat (not bowed) and often rectangular. Later, tailless kites incorporated a stabilizing bowline. Kites were decorated with mythological motifs and legendary figures; some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying.<ref>Needham 1965, p. 576\u2013580</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sarak|first1=Sim|last2=Yarin|first2=Cheang|title=Khmer Kites|year=2002|publisher=Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts|location=Cambodia|asin=B005VDYAAW}}</ref><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/21/104991903.pdf Kite Flying for Fun and Science], 1907, The New York Times.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kite Flying by Suzuki Harunobu (\u9234\u6728 \u6625\u4fe1).jpg|thumb|''Kite Flying'' by [[Suzuki Harunobu]], 1766 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\n[[File:Image taken from page 64 of 'Travels in India, including Sinde and the Punjab; ... translated from the German, by H.

Several different designs of [[man-lifting kite]]s were developed. The period from 1860 to about 1910 became the European \"golden age of kiting\".<ref>http://www.johndobson.info/John's%20Kite%20Site/George/pdfs/Chapter%203.fm.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century many new kite designs were developed. These included [[William Abner Eddy#Kites|Eddy]]'s tailless diamond, the [[tetrahedral kite]], the [[Rogallo wing]], the [[sled kite]], the [[parafoil]], and [[power kite]]s.<ref name=\"History of Kites\">{{cite web|title=History of Kites|url=http://kites.com/history-of-kites.html|accessdate=18 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426232651/http://kites.com/history-of-kites.html|archive-date=26 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Kites were used for scientific purposes, especially in meteorology, aeronautics, wireless communications and [[kite aerial photography|photography]]. The Rogallo wing was adapted for [[stunt kite]]s and [[hang gliding]] and the parafoil was adapted for [[parachuting]] and [[paragliding]].\n\nThe rapid development of mechanically powered aircraft diminished interest in kites. [[World War II]] saw a limited use of kites for military purposes ([[survival radio]], [[Focke Achgelis Fa 330]], [[military radio antenna kites]]).\n\nKites are now mostly used for recreation. Lightweight synthetic materials ([[ripstop nylon]], [[plastic film]], [[carbon fiber]] tube and rod) are used for kite making. Synthetic rope and cord ([[nylon]], [[polyethylene]], [[kevlar]] and [[dyneema]]) are used as bridle and kite line.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Sparless Styrofoam kite in flight.jpg|thumb|Sparless [[styrofoam]] kites]]\n\nDesigns often emulate flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. The finest Chinese kites are made from split bamboo (usually golden bamboo), covered with silk, and hand painted. On larger kites, clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport. Cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed [[polyester]] rather than silk.\n\nTails are used for some [[Inflatable single-line kite|single-line kite]] designs to keep the kite's nose pointing into the wind. Spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect. There are rotating wind socks which spin like a [[turbine]]. On large display kites these tails, spinners and spinsocks can be {{convert|50|feet|m|0}} long or more.\n\nModern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kite's angle to the wind. Traction kites may have an additional line to de-power the kite and quick-release mechanisms to disengage flyer and kite in an emergency.\n\n==Practical uses==\n{{Main|Kite applications}}\n\nKites have been used for human flight, military applications, science and meteorology, photography, lifting radio antennas, generating power, aerodynamics experiments, and much more.\n\n===Military applications===\nKites have been used for [[military]] purposes in the past, such as signaling, delivery of [[ammunition]], and for [[observation]], both by lifting an observer above the field of battle and by using [[kite aerial photography]].\n\nKites were first used in warfare by the Chinese.<ref name=\"Murphy\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=jFMQBAAAQBAJ&pg=PP7&dq=kite+gunpowder&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFqL_W2ubaAhUOzKQKHfUHBXEQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=kite%20gunpowder&f=false Military Aircraft, Origins to 1918: An Illustrated History of Their Impact], Justin D.

Kites were the precursors to the traditional [[aircraft]], and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] experimented with very large [[man-lifting kite]]s, as did the [[Wright brothers]] and [[Lawrence Hargrave]]. Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for [[weather forecasting]]. [[Francis Ronalds]] and [[William Radcliffe Birt]] described a very stable kite at [[King's Observatory|Kew Observatory]] as early as 1847 that was trialled for the purpose of supporting self-registering meteorological instruments at height.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Radio aerials and light beacons===\nKites can be used for radio purposes, by kites carrying antennas for [[Medium frequency|MF]], [[Low frequency|LF]] or [[VLF]]-transmitters. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]]. [[moored balloon|Captive balloons]] may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor. It must be taken into account during experiments, that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to high voltage toward ground, which can endanger people and equipment, if suitable precautions (grounding through resistors or a [[Resonant circuit|parallel resonant circuit]] tuned to transmission frequency) are not taken.\n\nKites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.\n\n===Kite traction===\n[[File:Kite333.JPG|thumb|A quad-line traction kite, commonly used as a power source for [[kite surfing]]]]\n\nKites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient [[Foil kite|foil-type kites]] such as [[power kite]]s can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite landboarding, [[kiteboating|kite boating]] and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular in recent years.\n\nKite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:\n\n* Wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes\n* Kites may be manoeuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically\n* There is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces; vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together\n\n===Underwater kites===\n[[Tidal stream generator|Underwater kites]] are being developed to harvest renewable power from the flow of water.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/20/wales-launches-25m-underwater-kite-turbine-scheme Wales launches \u00a325m underwater kite-turbine scheme] The Guardian (retrieved 17 November 2015)</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/underwater-kites-can-harness-ocean-currents-to-create-clean-energy-180947694/?no-ist Underwater Kites Can Harness Ocean Currents to Create Clean Energy] Smithsonian.com (retrieved 17 November 2015)</ref>\n\n== Cultural uses ==\n[[List of kite festivals|Kite festivals]] are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world.

Tails are not used on fighter kites so that agility and maneuverability are not compromised.\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]], kite flying is a popular game, and is known in [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] as ''Gudiparan Bazi''. Some kite fighters pass their strings through a mixture of ground glass powder and glue, which is legal. The resulting strings are very abrasive and can sever the competitor's strings more easily. The abrasive strings can also injure people. During the [[Taliban]] rule in Afghanistan, kite flying was banned, among various other recreations.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]], kite flying is often known as Gudi-Bazi or Patang-bazi. Although kite flying is a popular ritual for the celebration of spring festival known as [[Jashn-e-Baharaan]] (lit. Spring Festival) or [[Basant (season)|Basant]], kites are flown throughout the year. [[Fighter kite|Kite fighting]] is a very popular pastime all around Pakistan, but mostly in urban centers across the country (especially [[Lahore]]).  The kite fights are at their highest during the spring celebrations and the fighters enjoy competing with rivals to cut-loose the string of the others kite, this is popularly known as \"Paecha\". During the spring festival, kite flying competitions are held across the country and the skies are colored with kites. As people cut-loose an opponents kite, shouts of 'wo kata' ring through the air. They reclaim the kites, after they have been cut-loose, by running after them. This is a popular ritual especially among the youth (similar to scenes depicted in the Kite Runner which is based in neighboring Afghanistan).  Kites and strings are a big business in the country and many types of strings are used: glass-coated strings, metal strings and tandi. However, kite flying was banned in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] due to motorcyclist deaths caused by glass-coated or metal kite-strings.  Kup, Patang, Guda, and Nakhlaoo are some of the kites used. They vary in balance, weight and speed.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]] kites are flown as both sport and recreation. One of the most popular kite variants is from [[Bali]]. Balinese kites are unique and they have different designs and forms; birds, butterflies, dragons, ships, etc. In [[Vietnam]], kites are flown without tails. Instead small flutes are attached allowing the wind to \"hum\" a musical tune. There are other forms of sound-making kites. In Bali, large bows are attached to the front of the kites to make a deep throbbing vibration, and in Malaysia, a row of gourds with sound-slots are used to create a whistle as the kite flies. Malaysia is also home to the [[Kite Museum (Malacca)|Kite Museum]] in [[Malacca]].<ref>Pogadaev, Victor.

Highly maneuverable single-string paper and bamboo kites are flown from the rooftops while using line friction in an attempt to cut each other's kite lines, either by letting the cutting line loose at high speed or by pulling the line in a fast and repeated manner. During the Indian spring festival of [[Makar Sankranti]], near the middle of January, millions of people fly kites all over northern India.  Kite flying in Hyderabad starts a month before this, but kite flying/fighting is an important part of other celebrations, including [[Republic Day]], Independence Day, [[Raksha Bandhan]], [[Vishvakarman#Vishwakarma Puja|Viswakarma Puja day]] in late September and [[Janmashtami]].

It is during this month that most people, especially the young ones would fly kites.\n\nIn [[Guyana]], kites are flown at Easter, an activity in which all ethnic and religious groups participate. Kites are generally not flown at any other time of year. Kites start appearing in the sky in the weeks leading up to Easter and school children are taken to parks for the activity. It all culminates in a massive airborne celebration on Easter Monday especially in Georgetown, the capital, and other coastal areas. The history of the practice is not entirely clear but given that Easter is a Christian festival, it is said that kite flying is symbolic of the Risen Lord. Moore<ref>Moore, Brian L. (1995).

McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, {{ISBN|978-0-7735-1354-9}}</ref> describes the phenomenon in the 19th century as follows:\n\n{{quote|A very popular Creole pastime was the flying of kites. Easter Monday, a public holiday, was the great kite-flying day on the sea wall in Georgetown and on open lands in villages. Young and old alike, male and female, appeared to be seized by kite-flying mania. Easter 1885 serves as a good example. \"The appearance of the sky all over Georgetown, but especially towards the Sea Wall, was very striking, the air being thick with kites of all shapes and sizes, covered with gaily coloured paper, all riding bravely on the strong wind.|(His quotation is from a letter to The Creole newspaper of December 29, 1858.)}}\n\nThe exact origins of the practice of kite flying (exclusively) at Easter are unclear. Brereton and Yelvington<ref>Brereton, Bridget; Yelvington, Kevin A. (1999). ''The Colonial Caribbean in Transition''. University Press of Florida, {{ISBN|978-0-8130-1696-2}}</ref> speculate that kite flying was introduced by Chinese indentured immigrants to the then colony of British Guiana in the mid 19th century. The author of an article in the ''Guyana Chronicle'' newspaper of May 6, 2007 is more certain:\n\n{{quote|Kite flying originated as a Chinese tradition to mark the beginning of spring. However, because the plantation owners were suspicious of the planter class (read \"plantation workers\"), the Chinese claimed that it represented the resurrection of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].  It was a clever argument, as at that time, Christians celebrated Easter to the glory of the risen Christ.

Kite lines can strike and tangle on electrical power lines, causing power blackouts and running the risk of electrocuting the kite flier. Wet kite lines or wire can act as a conductor for static electricity and lightning when the weather is stormy. Kites with large surface area or powerful lift can lift kite fliers off the ground or drag them into other objects. In urban areas there is usually a ceiling on how high a kite can be flown, to prevent the kite and line infringing on the airspace of helicopters and light aircraft.

Materials ideal for kite building were readily available including [[silk]] fabric for sail material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line; and resilient [[bamboo]] for a strong, lightweight framework. By 549 AD [[paper]] kites were certainly being flown, as it was recorded that in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue mission. Ancient and medieval Chinese sources describe kites being used for measuring distances, testing the wind, lifting men, signaling, and communication for military operations. The earliest known Chinese kites were flat (not bowed) and often rectangular. Later, tailless kites incorporated a stabilizing bowline. Kites were decorated with mythological motifs and legendary figures; some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying.<ref>Needham 1965, p. 576\u2013580</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sarak|first1=Sim|last2=Yarin|first2=Cheang|title=Khmer Kites|year=2002|publisher=Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts|location=Cambodia|asin=B005VDYAAW}}</ref><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/21/104991903.pdf Kite Flying for Fun and Science], 1907, The New York Times.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kite Flying by Suzuki Harunobu (\u9234\u6728 \u6625\u4fe1).jpg|thumb|''Kite Flying'' by [[Suzuki Harunobu]], 1766 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\n[[File:Image taken from page 64 of 'Travels in India, including Sinde and the Punjab; ... translated from the German, by H.

The Rogallo wing was adapted for [[stunt kite]]s and [[hang gliding]] and the parafoil was adapted for [[parachuting]] and [[paragliding]].\n\nThe rapid development of mechanically powered aircraft diminished interest in kites. [[World War II]] saw a limited use of kites for military purposes ([[survival radio]], [[Focke Achgelis Fa 330]], [[military radio antenna kites]]).\n\nKites are now mostly used for recreation. Lightweight synthetic materials ([[ripstop nylon]], [[plastic film]], [[carbon fiber]] tube and rod) are used for kite making. Synthetic rope and cord ([[nylon]], [[polyethylene]], [[kevlar]] and [[dyneema]]) are used as bridle and kite line.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Sparless Styrofoam kite in flight.jpg|thumb|Sparless [[styrofoam]] kites]]\n\nDesigns often emulate flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. The finest Chinese kites are made from split bamboo (usually golden bamboo), covered with silk, and hand painted. On larger kites, clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport. Cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed [[polyester]] rather than silk.\n\nTails are used for some [[Inflatable single-line kite|single-line kite]] designs to keep the kite's nose pointing into the wind. Spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect. There are rotating wind socks which spin like a [[turbine]]. On large display kites these tails, spinners and spinsocks can be {{convert|50|feet|m|0}} long or more.\n\nModern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kite's angle to the wind.

Kites were the precursors to the traditional [[aircraft]], and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] experimented with very large [[man-lifting kite]]s, as did the [[Wright brothers]] and [[Lawrence Hargrave]]. Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for [[weather forecasting]]. [[Francis Ronalds]] and [[William Radcliffe Birt]] described a very stable kite at [[King's Observatory|Kew Observatory]] as early as 1847 that was trialled for the purpose of supporting self-registering meteorological instruments at height.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Radio aerials and light beacons===\nKites can be used for radio purposes, by kites carrying antennas for [[Medium frequency|MF]], [[Low frequency|LF]] or [[VLF]]-transmitters. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]]. [[moored balloon|Captive balloons]] may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor. It must be taken into account during experiments, that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to high voltage toward ground, which can endanger people and equipment, if suitable precautions (grounding through resistors or a [[Resonant circuit|parallel resonant circuit]] tuned to transmission frequency) are not taken.\n\nKites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.\n\n===Kite traction===\n[[File:Kite333.JPG|thumb|A quad-line traction kite, commonly used as a power source for [[kite surfing]]]]\n\nKites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient [[Foil kite|foil-type kites]] such as [[power kite]]s can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite landboarding, [[kiteboating|kite boating]] and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular in recent years.\n\nKite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:\n\n* Wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes\n* Kites may be manoeuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically\n* There is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces; vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together\n\n===Underwater kites===\n[[Tidal stream generator|Underwater kites]] are being developed to harvest renewable power from the flow of water.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/20/wales-launches-25m-underwater-kite-turbine-scheme Wales launches \u00a325m underwater kite-turbine scheme] The Guardian (retrieved 17 November 2015)</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/underwater-kites-can-harness-ocean-currents-to-create-clean-energy-180947694/?no-ist Underwater Kites Can Harness Ocean Currents to Create Clean Energy] Smithsonian.com (retrieved 17 November 2015)</ref>\n\n== Cultural uses ==\n[[List of kite festivals|Kite festivals]] are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world.

Tails are not used on fighter kites so that agility and maneuverability are not compromised.\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]], kite flying is a popular game, and is known in [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] as ''Gudiparan Bazi''. Some kite fighters pass their strings through a mixture of ground glass powder and glue, which is legal. The resulting strings are very abrasive and can sever the competitor's strings more easily. The abrasive strings can also injure people. During the [[Taliban]] rule in Afghanistan, kite flying was banned, among various other recreations.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]], kite flying is often known as Gudi-Bazi or Patang-bazi. Although kite flying is a popular ritual for the celebration of spring festival known as [[Jashn-e-Baharaan]] (lit. Spring Festival) or [[Basant (season)|Basant]], kites are flown throughout the year. [[Fighter kite|Kite fighting]] is a very popular pastime all around Pakistan, but mostly in urban centers across the country (especially [[Lahore]]).  The kite fights are at their highest during the spring celebrations and the fighters enjoy competing with rivals to cut-loose the string of the others kite, this is popularly known as \"Paecha\". During the spring festival, kite flying competitions are held across the country and the skies are colored with kites. As people cut-loose an opponents kite, shouts of 'wo kata' ring through the air. They reclaim the kites, after they have been cut-loose, by running after them. This is a popular ritual especially among the youth (similar to scenes depicted in the Kite Runner which is based in neighboring Afghanistan).  Kites and strings are a big business in the country and many types of strings are used: glass-coated strings, metal strings and tandi. However, kite flying was banned in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] due to motorcyclist deaths caused by glass-coated or metal kite-strings.  Kup, Patang, Guda, and Nakhlaoo are some of the kites used. They vary in balance, weight and speed.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]] kites are flown as both sport and recreation. One of the most popular kite variants is from [[Bali]]. Balinese kites are unique and they have different designs and forms; birds, butterflies, dragons, ships, etc. In [[Vietnam]], kites are flown without tails. Instead small flutes are attached allowing the wind to \"hum\" a musical tune. There are other forms of sound-making kites. In Bali, large bows are attached to the front of the kites to make a deep throbbing vibration, and in Malaysia, a row of gourds with sound-slots are used to create a whistle as the kite flies. Malaysia is also home to the [[Kite Museum (Malacca)|Kite Museum]] in [[Malacca]].<ref>Pogadaev, Victor.

Highly maneuverable single-string paper and bamboo kites are flown from the rooftops while using line friction in an attempt to cut each other's kite lines, either by letting the cutting line loose at high speed or by pulling the line in a fast and repeated manner. During the Indian spring festival of [[Makar Sankranti]], near the middle of January, millions of people fly kites all over northern India.  Kite flying in Hyderabad starts a month before this, but kite flying/fighting is an important part of other celebrations, including [[Republic Day]], Independence Day, [[Raksha Bandhan]], [[Vishvakarman#Vishwakarma Puja|Viswakarma Puja day]] in late September and [[Janmashtami]]. An international kite festival is held every year before [[Uttarayan]] for three days in [[Vadodara]], [[Surat]] and [[Ahmedabad]].\n\nKites have been flown in China since ancient times.

There are kite festivals in parks and beaches mostly on August.\n\nIn [[Colombia]], kites can be seen flown in parks and recreation areas during August which is calles as windy. It is during this month that most people, especially the young ones would fly kites.\n\nIn [[Guyana]], kites are flown at Easter, an activity in which all ethnic and religious groups participate. Kites are generally not flown at any other time of year. Kites start appearing in the sky in the weeks leading up to Easter and school children are taken to parks for the activity. It all culminates in a massive airborne celebration on Easter Monday especially in Georgetown, the capital, and other coastal areas. The history of the practice is not entirely clear but given that Easter is a Christian festival, it is said that kite flying is symbolic of the Risen Lord. Moore<ref>Moore, Brian L. (1995). ''Cultural Power, Resistance, and Pluralism: Colonial Guyana 1838-1900.'' McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, {{ISBN|978-0-7735-1354-9}}</ref> describes the phenomenon in the 19th century as follows:\n\n{{quote|A very popular Creole pastime was the flying of kites. Easter Monday, a public holiday, was the great kite-flying day on the sea wall in Georgetown and on open lands in villages. Young and old alike, male and female, appeared to be seized by kite-flying mania. Easter 1885 serves as a good example. \"The appearance of the sky all over Georgetown, but especially towards the Sea Wall, was very striking, the air being thick with kites of all shapes and sizes, covered with gaily coloured paper, all riding bravely on the strong wind.|(His quotation is from a letter to The Creole newspaper of December 29, 1858.)}}\n\nThe exact origins of the practice of kite flying (exclusively) at Easter are unclear. Brereton and Yelvington<ref>Brereton, Bridget; Yelvington, Kevin A. (1999). ''The Colonial Caribbean in Transition''. University Press of Florida, {{ISBN|978-0-8130-1696-2}}</ref> speculate that kite flying was introduced by Chinese indentured immigrants to the then colony of British Guiana in the mid 19th century. The author of an article in the ''Guyana Chronicle'' newspaper of May 6, 2007 is more certain:\n\n{{quote|Kite flying originated as a Chinese tradition to mark the beginning of spring. However, because the plantation owners were suspicious of the planter class (read \"plantation workers\"), the Chinese claimed that it represented the resurrection of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

Kite lines can strike and tangle on electrical power lines, causing power blackouts and running the risk of electrocuting the kite flier. Wet kite lines or wire can act as a conductor for static electricity and lightning when the weather is stormy. Kites with large surface area or powerful lift can lift kite fliers off the ground or drag them into other objects. In urban areas there is usually a ceiling on how high a kite can be flown, to prevent the kite and line infringing on the airspace of helicopters and light aircraft.

Nonetheless, which party would be included in the coalition took a long process of negotiations. Both a four-party coalition excluding the Communist Party and a three-party coalition excluding both the [[Japanese Communist Party|Communist Party]] and the Liberal Party were suggested within the socialists. The Liberal party, led by anticommunist [[Shigeru Yoshida]] ''(\u5409\u7530\u8302)'', showed great reluctance of joining the coalition.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite book|title=Japan's postwar party politics|last=1962-|first=Kohno, Masaru|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691026299|location=|pages=50\u201353|oclc=441854586}}</ref> At a meeting between the Katayama and Yoshida in May 19, 1947, the Liberal Party asked Katayama to \"break off with the leftists\" in return of its participation in the coalition.

In order to form a coalition, Katayama had to make concessions which departed from original policy proposals, which further facilitated the split between the leftist faction and the rightist faction within the party. At the same time, policies which Katayama did implement, such as nationalization of coal and mine production, drove the conservatives away.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\n=== Yoshida Hegemony ===\n[[File:Japanese_General_election,_1949_en.svg|thumb|246x246px|House of Representatives Seat Distribution in 1949]]\nAfter the failure of Katayama cabinet, voters lost confidence in the Socialist Party, which led to the takeover of government by Yoshida Shigeru. In the [[1949 Japanese general election|general election of 1949]], the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Japan)|Democratic Liberal Party]] led by Yoshida won a majority in the House of representatives with 269 seats out of 466 seats, while the Socialist Party won only 48 seats.

The diplomatic, economic, and security policies which Yoshida adopted when he was in power were altogether referred as the \"[[Yoshida Doctrine]]\".<ref name=\":72\">{{Cite journal|last=Sugita|first=Yoneyuki|date=2016|title=The Yoshida Doctrine as a Myth|url=http://www.jaas.gr.jp/jjas/pdf/2016/06_SUGIYAMA.pdf|journal=The Japanese Journal of American Studies|volume=27|pages=|via=}}</ref> These policies remained influential even after him being voted out of the office by a no-confidence motion by the \"Yoshida students\" who followed his ideology.<ref name=\":02\" /> The Yoshida Doctrine has three major components: 1.

However, Yoshida's \"one man\" leadership and anti-communist stance was criticized and eventually led to the defection of many Diet members from his party to the new [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1954)|Democratic Party]], causing his cabinet to resign on December 7, 1954.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\n=== Fall of Yoshida Shigeru ===\n[[File:Brawling_diet_2.JPG|thumb|227x227px|Dietmembers brawl due to the steamrolling of the amendment to the Police Act.]]\nThe criticisms of Yoshida cabinet mainly focused on three issues:\n\n# In 1951, The [[Treaty of San Francisco|San Francisco Peace Treaty]] and the [[Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan]] was signed under Yoshida cabinet. The Peace Treaty was signed without the communist bloc's presence, which was condemned by the Communist Party for its anti-communist stance. The Security Treaty was criticized by both the Communist Party and the Socialist Party for the risk of remilitarization, while also criticized by the conservatives for putting Japan in a subordinate position, since Japan was asked to provide military base for the U.S.'s force.<ref name=\":82\">{{Cite book|title=\u6226\u5f8c\u6539\u9769\u3068\u9006\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9|last=\u5409\u7530|first=\u88d5|publisher=\u5409\u5ddd\u5f18\u6587\u9928|year=2004|isbn=|location=\u6771\u4eac|pages=81\u201385}}</ref>\n# During the fifth Yoshida cabinet, several bills were passed with the strong opposition of the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan, including the Strike Control Act, the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between Japan and the United States of America, two education acts which restrict the political participation of school teachers, amendment to the Police Act, Self-Defense Forces Act.

One is known as the Hozen Keizai Kai Incident ''(\u4fdd\u5168\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u4e8b\u4ef6)''. Masutomi Ito, the director of a financial institution Hozen Keizai Kai which, was accused of fraud and suspected of making political bribery, which resulted in the arrests of several conservative politicians.<ref name=\":22\" /> The other is known as the Shipbuilding Bribery ''(\u9020\u8239\u7591\u7344)'', in which the shipping business and shipbuilding business were proved to be making pay-off to conservative politicians. Influential politicians in the ruling party such as [[Eisaku Sat\u014d|Eisaku Sato]] ''(\u4f50\u85e4\u6804\u4f5c)'' and [[Hayato Ikeda]] ''(\u6c60\u7530\u52c7\u4eba)'' were suspected as bribe takers.

On October 20, 1954, anti-Yoshida conservatives formed a coalition party: the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1954)|Japan Democratic Party]] ''(\u65e5\u672c\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a)''. The Japan Democratic Party along with the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan tabled a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]] against the cabinet on December 6 and won the majority. As a result, Yoshida Cabinet resigned on December 7 after six years of rule.\n\n== Establishment of the 1955 System ==\n\n=== Merger of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) ===\nWithin the Socialist party, ideological conflicts had long been a problem. The leftists in the party adopted a Marx-Lenin ideology as China, while the rightists leaned towards a socialist welfare nation under a capitalist system. The San Francisco Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan signed in 1951 triggered the final split. The right socialists agreed on the San Francisco Peace Treaty but were against the Security Treaty, due to their constitutionalist stance, while the left socialists were against both treaties due to their exclusion of Soviet Union.<ref name=\":02\" /> On October 23, 1951, the old Socialist Party officially split into the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan]] ''(\u5de6\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a)'' and the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan]] ''(\u53f3\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a)''.\n\nAfter the split, however, the socialists soon realized the necessity of merging into one party to fight against the anti-communist approach taken by the GHQ and the conservatives, which is commonly referred to as the [[Reverse Course|reverse course]] ''(\u9006\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9)''. After the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, influential members from the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan came back from the purge and boosted the power of the rightists. The Leftist Socialist Party of Japan also expanded its power with the support of the [[General Council of Trade Unions of Japan]], also known as ''Sohyo(\u65e5\u672c\u52b4\u50cd\u7d44\u5408\u7dcf\u8a55\u8b70\u4f1a)''. Meanwhile, the conservatives were suffering criticisms from the public for the corruption scandals and Security Treaty. Sensing the possibility of success, despite their ideological differences, to take power from the political right and fight against the anti-communist movement, the socialists decided to reunite and formed the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) on October 13, 1955.<ref name=\":62\" />\n[[File:Japanese_General_election,_1955_en.svg|left|thumb|257x257px|Before the merger: House of Representative Seat Distribution in 1955]]\nOne crucial external factor that caused the merger of JSD is ''Sohyo''. ''Sohyo'', the abbreviation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, was a trade confederation in Japan which was established on July 11, 1950, soon after the start of the Korean War. It incorporated about 48% of organized workers in Japan. Initially, ''Sohyo''was the unified body of anti-communist unions, but it soon changed from a centralist stance to a left stance due to the remilitarization tendency of Japan shown in the Korean War.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Incorporating Japanese labor into the Free World: Cold War diplomacy and economic interdependence, 1949\u20131964|journal = Labor History|volume = 49|issue = 2|pages = 199\u2013222|last=Nakakita|first=Koji|date=2008|doi=10.1080/00236560801950972}}</ref> Due to the rationalization strategy taken by the conservative government, Japanese workers, particular those worked in small and median-sized factories were facing slow wage increase and even dismissals.

Meanwhile, the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan was able to win 17 more seats. The expansion of Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the soon formation of the leftists and rightists in the socialist camp into JSP became a more substantial threat for the conservatives. As a result, also in 1955, the Japan Democratic Party and the Japan Liberal Party merged as Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP).<ref name=\":82\" />\n\nThe expansion of the socialist power also worried the ''Zaikai''(business community). ''Zaikai'' had incentives to secure a conservative government since it would pump money into the big companies to keep their competitiveness, stay in a close relationship with the U.S. to maintain a liberal trade policy, and deal with the intensified anti-rationalization labor movement. Therefore, to counter the socialist power, the ''Zaikai'' pressured the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party to merge.<ref name=\":92\">{{Cite journal|last=Masumi|first=Junnosuke|date=1988|title=The 1955 System in Japan and Its Subsequent Development|journal=Asian Survey|volume=28|issue=3|pages=286\u2013306|doi=10.1525/as.1988.28.3.01p0146p|issn=0004-4687|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/ucpas/28/3/286.full.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Outcome of the merger: 1955 System ===\nAfter the formation of the two major parties, JSP and LDP, a [[1958 Japanese general election|general election]] was held in 1958.

As a result, the LDP won almost as twice as many seats as the JSP.

The conservative parties had wished to revise the constitution since its enactment, particularly [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]]. At the same time, the socialist parties opposed any revision of the constitution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Robert E.|date=1956|title=The Constitution and Current Japanese Politics|journal=Far Eastern Survey|volume=25|issue=4|pages=49\u201358|doi=10.2307/3023907|issn=0362-8949|jstor=3023907}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue was the security Treaty signed in 1951, a product of the late occupation years. Unlike the 1946 constitution, designed to wipe out [[Japanese militarism|militarism in Japan]], the Security Treaty was the result of the U.S. wishing to secure its military strength in Asia to counter the communist threat in the [[Cold War]]. The JSP strongly opposed the Security Treaty due to fears of rearmament or a revival of militarism in Japan, while the LDP argued that the presence of the U.S. army in Japan was merely for self-defense.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Protest in tokyo - the security treaty crisis of 1960.|last=R.|first=Packard, George|year=|isbn=9780691650746|location=|pages=3\u201322|oclc=1023228016}}</ref>\n\n== LDP dominance in the 1955 system ==\n\n=== Electoral system ===\nThe electoral system that was used under 1955 system is known as the [[Single non-transferable vote|Single Nontransferable Vote]] (SNTV). Under SNTV, each constituency has multiple seats to be filled. Voters instead of voting for parties, votes for individual candidates, and seats of the constituency go to whoever wins the most votes. One problem of such electoral system is that the fair allocation of seats to different parties are not taken into consideration: Since the winners of most votes eventually get the seats, candidates of one party can take all the seats of one constituency.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nUnder such electoral system, LDP with its massive political donation put other opposition parties into disadvantage. Due to LDP's ties with big companies, the party directed the financial resources to individual candidates and enabled them to promise patronage to their voters, with a focus on the agricultural population, while the reallocation of Diet seats did not keep up with the migration from rural to urban area due to industrialization. Aside from the pork-barrel spending, the LDP candidates also cultivated personalism through [[Koenkai]] ''(\u5f8c\u63f4\u4f1a)'' in their own constituency. Politicians went to the locals' wedding, funeral, birthday parties and so on. In such occasions, politicians often brought considerable amount of cash gift. Candidates would even organize activities such as hot springs for their supporters.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOn the account of its self-assertiveness, LDP unilaterally altered the rules for campaigning. Profiting of its constituted koenkai canvas, the competition rules were toughened for the Opposition. The formal campaign periods were short (and shortened further over time), television and radio advertising being prohibited and low limits placed on posters and handbills. Through the campaign, however, each candidate was granted two five-minute slots on television when a stream of candidates would line up and take turns in front of a stationary microphone to run through their list of promises right after which the next candidate would take other. Such rules of play were discouraging and difficult for a would-be challenger while LDP benefitted from the unfair restraints of participation by the sheer amount of runners.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Japanese party system : from one-party rule to coalition government|last=1945-|first=Hrebenar, Ronald J.|date=1986|publisher=Westview Press|others=Berton, Peter, 1922-2014.|isbn=978-0813303468|location=Boulder, Colo.|oclc=13455801}}</ref>\n\nAnother neglected flaw of the electoral system which bolstered LDP's dominance was the urgent need for redistricting in the wake of the post-war rapid population shifts from the rural to urban areas. The swelling urban populations were much trickier for LDP politicians to fit within the distributed koenkai grassroot structure as they were more peripatetic and atomized than the traditional rural household. These voters had new policy demands (ex. issues related to [[Environmental issues in Japan#Environment deterioration in the 1960s|environmental deterioration in the 1960s]]) which conflicted with the ones practiced by LDP for their industry and big-business support. Under the obsolete district constituencies, the farmers retained disproportionate political influence which as a consequence of pork-barrel desires rather than by concern over issues of broad social policy, stagnated democratic alternation.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite book|title=Japan transformed : political change and economic restructuring|last=McCall.|first=Rosenbluth, Frances |author-link=Frances McCall Rosenbluth|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|others=Thies, Michael F.|isbn=9780691135915|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=428926469}}</ref>\n\nUnder the current electoral rules, LDP was motivated to develop loyal personal support for the farmer's voter group. Being a nationally organized group of voters and united around the single issue of agricultural protectionism, the party could tune higher import tariffs and subsidies to support the less productive small businesses which because of their large numbers, could turn out at elections and vote in predictable ways.\n\n=== Bureaucratization of policymaking ===\nSince the institution of the 1955 system, the legislative independence has been declining in the face of a growth in the combined legislative power of the bureaucracy and the ruling conservative party. Indicators that point to this are the success rates of governmental and individual member bills; the declining rate of amendments added; and the singular lack of success for opposition-sponsored bills. For example, the mere submission of nongovernmentally sponsored measures is extremely difficult. In the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|Lower House]], at least 20 representatives must support a \"member\" bill before it can be introduced, while in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|Upper House]] ten supporters are required. Moreover, should the bill require the expenditure of state funds, fifty and twenty supporters respectively are necessary.\n\nThe chance for success of bureaucratic bills that was only 1.3 times greater than that for individual Diet-generated bills under the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation]] and about twice as great from 1952 to 1955, it augmented to 7 times greater by 1974, when approximately 90% of all successful legislation has been cabinet-sponsored.<ref name=\":102\">{{Cite journal|last=Pempel|first=T.

From 1955 to 1960 just over one-third of all successful government legislation went through one or another of these processes. In the 48th Diet (1964-1965) this rate was 17% and in the 63rd Diet (1970) it was 15%. Finally, opposition bills had no chance of success: of 317 opposition bills introduced from the 37th (1960) through the 46th (1963-1964) Diets, not one became law.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Misawa|first=Shigeo|date=1967-05-30|journal=The Annuals of Japanese Political Science Association|volume=18|pages=5\u201333, 2|doi=10.7218/nenpouseijigaku1953.18.0_5|issn=0549-4192|title=Outline of Policy-Decision Making Process Since 1955|doi-access=free}}</ref> These numbers attest that by the time bills materialize in the Diet a general agreement has already been reached, both within and between the bureaucracy and the LDP. In such an environment, opposition and the generation of successful alternatives from within the Diet itself has become extremely difficult.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\nBesides, the bureaucracy wields considerable and increasing power through the use of nonlegislative devices such a subordinances and communications, and through its varying degrees of dominance over technical and nonpartisan advisory groups.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\n=== Policy decision-making ===\nThe [[Policy Affairs Research Council]] (\u653f\u52d9\u8abf\u67fb\u4f1a ''seimu ch\u014dsakai'') or \"PARC\" was the major policymaking body within the LDP. Its members were the LDP representatives in both legislative houses, and it was the basic forum in which the party discussed and negotiated government policy. The policymaking under this system did not comply with the usual model of a parliamentary cabinet government which involves strong cabinet leadership and coordination. Instead, representatives who were not in the cabinet were often the other pivot of policy through their formal roles PARC. In consultation with bureaucrats and interest groups, the council already had input into policy before the cabinet and prime minister or upper party executives could shape it further. At its height in the mid-1980s, PARC had as many as seventeen divisions.\n\n==== Industrial policy ====\nJapan's industrial policy under the 1955 system was undergirded by a political logic that supports firms and whole industries that would not have been sustainable in a less-regulated economy, imposed high prices and taxes, limited choice in the marketplace, and rigid career paths.<ref name=\":32\" /> In spite of the fact that Japan came out of war with a theoretical comparative advantage towards light manufacturing which would match its profile of low-capital, abundant-labor economy, the war skewed its economic profile toward heavy industries. The large war companies lobbied for a development strategy favoring heavy industry and received subsidies and regulatory favoritism. In exchange, LDP members were awarded with campaign contributions to be able to stay electorally competitive against each other in the multi-member districts.\n\nThe Heavy Industries Bureau of the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] assisted the heavy industries with policies such as:\n\n* Limiting entry and often regulating the market pricing to help stabilize profits.\n* Privileging access to cheap loans from the Japan Development Bank\n* Domestic government budget subsidies and tax breaks as well as favored access to foreign exchange and tariff protections.\n\nSuch strategy of developmental policy which has strong state involvement in developmental orientation is typical of late industrialing countries and in terms of [[international political economy]], follows the model of the [[developmental state]]. Explicit implication implies a degree of corruption, which during [[Kakuei Tanaka]]'s office in 1971-1972 resulted in media noticing corruption which, in one instance, resulted in the [[Kakuei Tanaka#Lockheed scandal and aftermath|Lockheed scandal]].\n\n== The fall of the system ==\n\n=== Global Pressure and the Collapse of Bubble Economy ===\nAs a corollary of the [[Plaza Accord|Plaza Accord of 1985]] when Japan agreed to allow substantial appreciation of the yen, the Japanese government reduced the interests marginally above the rate of inflation as a domestic relief strategy. This resulted in banks and corporations going on an enormous spending spree with nearly free money, bidding up the price of real estate and other assets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unwanted company : foreign investment in American industries|last=1965-|first=Crystal, Jonathan|isbn=9781501723612|location=Ithaca|oclc=1042219263}}</ref>\n\nAgainst the faith of many people that Japan would come to dominate the world economy, the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] led to a bubble crash after the raising of interest rates of the [[Bank of Japan]] in 1990 and firms together with their jobs were in mortal danger. In this context and on the background of LDP's short-term relieved pressure from the already shaky electoral coalition between exporters and the non-traded sectors, the voting public expressed disenchantment toward the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nThe new electoral system following the [[1994 Japanese electoral reform|1994 Electoral reform]] which was claimed to reduce corruption and high elections costs, promote more policy debates, and encourage a two-party system. As a consequence of this reform as well as the change of voter behavior and the change of the international environment, the system collapsed completely following the [[2005 Japanese general election|2005]] and [[2009 Japanese general election|2009]] general elections which demonstrated significant shifts in both the foundations of party support and the importance of national swings in support for one party or another. Since 2005, urban-rural differences in the foundations of the leading parties have changed dramatically, and Japan has moved from a system dominated by locally based, individual candidacies toward a two-party system in which both party popularity and personal characteristics influence electoral success or failure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thies|first=Michael F.|last2=Scheiner|first2=Ethan|last3=Reed|first3=Steven R.|date=2012-07-14|title=The End of LDP Dominance and the Rise of Party-Oriented Politics in Japan|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=38|issue=2|pages=353\u2013376|doi=10.1353/jjs.2012.0037|issn=1549-4721}}</ref>\n\nThe specialist on theoretical knowledge of legislative institutions and electoral systems, Michael Thies, argues that majoritarian institutions of the Anglo-American variety would have pushed politics toward broader coalitions, reducing the premiums captured by organized groups with extreme preferences, and appealing more to the interests of unorganized, diverse voters.

On October 20, 1954, anti-Yoshida conservatives formed a coalition party: the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1954)|Japan Democratic Party]] ''(\u65e5\u672c\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a)''. The Japan Democratic Party along with the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan tabled a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]] against the cabinet on December 6 and won the majority. As a result, Yoshida Cabinet resigned on December 7 after six years of rule.\n\n== Establishment of the 1955 System ==\n\n=== Merger of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) ===\nWithin the Socialist party, ideological conflicts had long been a problem. The leftists in the party adopted a Marx-Lenin ideology as China, while the rightists leaned towards a socialist welfare nation under a capitalist system. The San Francisco Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan signed in 1951 triggered the final split. The right socialists agreed on the San Francisco Peace Treaty but were against the Security Treaty, due to their constitutionalist stance, while the left socialists were against both treaties due to their exclusion of Soviet Union.<ref name=\":02\" /> On October 23, 1951, the old Socialist Party officially split into the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan]] ''(\u5de6\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a)'' and the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan]] ''(\u53f3\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a)''.\n\nAfter the split, however, the socialists soon realized the necessity of merging into one party to fight against the anti-communist approach taken by the GHQ and the conservatives, which is commonly referred to as the [[Reverse Course|reverse course]] ''(\u9006\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9)''. After the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, influential members from the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan came back from the purge and boosted the power of the rightists. The Leftist Socialist Party of Japan also expanded its power with the support of the [[General Council of Trade Unions of Japan]], also known as ''Sohyo(\u65e5\u672c\u52b4\u50cd\u7d44\u5408\u7dcf\u8a55\u8b70\u4f1a)''. Meanwhile, the conservatives were suffering criticisms from the public for the corruption scandals and Security Treaty. Sensing the possibility of success, despite their ideological differences, to take power from the political right and fight against the anti-communist movement, the socialists decided to reunite and formed the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) on October 13, 1955.<ref name=\":62\" />\n[[File:Japanese_General_election,_1955_en.svg|left|thumb|257x257px|Before the merger: House of Representative Seat Distribution in 1955]]\nOne crucial external factor that caused the merger of JSD is ''Sohyo''. ''Sohyo'', the abbreviation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, was a trade confederation in Japan which was established on July 11, 1950, soon after the start of the Korean War. It incorporated about 48% of organized workers in Japan. Initially, ''Sohyo''was the unified body of anti-communist unions, but it soon changed from a centralist stance to a left stance due to the remilitarization tendency of Japan shown in the Korean War.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Incorporating Japanese labor into the Free World: Cold War diplomacy and economic interdependence, 1949\u20131964|journal = Labor History|volume = 49|issue = 2|pages = 199\u2013222|last=Nakakita|first=Koji|date=2008|doi=10.1080/00236560801950972}}</ref> Due to the rationalization strategy taken by the conservative government, Japanese workers, particular those worked in small and median-sized factories were facing slow wage increase and even dismissals.

Meanwhile, the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan was able to win 17 more seats. The expansion of Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the soon formation of the leftists and rightists in the socialist camp into JSP became a more substantial threat for the conservatives. As a result, also in 1955, the Japan Democratic Party and the Japan Liberal Party merged as Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP).<ref name=\":82\" />\n\nThe expansion of the socialist power also worried the ''Zaikai''(business community). ''Zaikai'' had incentives to secure a conservative government since it would pump money into the big companies to keep their competitiveness, stay in a close relationship with the U.S. to maintain a liberal trade policy, and deal with the intensified anti-rationalization labor movement. Therefore, to counter the socialist power, the ''Zaikai'' pressured the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party to merge.<ref name=\":92\">{{Cite journal|last=Masumi|first=Junnosuke|date=1988|title=The 1955 System in Japan and Its Subsequent Development|journal=Asian Survey|volume=28|issue=3|pages=286\u2013306|doi=10.1525/as.1988.28.3.01p0146p|issn=0004-4687|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/ucpas/28/3/286.full.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Outcome of the merger: 1955 System ===\nAfter the formation of the two major parties, JSP and LDP, a [[1958 Japanese general election|general election]] was held in 1958. Although the Socialist Party was gaining more power at the time, the conservative Liberal Party and Democratic Party had more voters from the beginning, and were able to consolidate support after their merger. As a result, the LDP won almost as twice as many seats as the JSP. The 1955 system, also known as \u201cone and a half system,\u201d was established, in which the LDP maintained its status as the dominant party, while the JSP was never able to muster enough support to seriously challenge it.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=The politics of electoral systems|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Gallagher, Michael, 1951-, Mitchell, Paul, 1964-|isbn=9780191531514|location=Oxford|oclc=68623713}}</ref>\n\nThe 1955 system centered around the two parties\u2019 confrontation over two major issues: the [[Constitution of Japan|1946 constitution]] and the security treaty.<ref name=\":92\" /> During the occupation years, Minister Matsumoto Joji ''(\u677e\u672c\u70dd\u6cbb)'' drafted the 1946 constitution under the demand of General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. Unsatisfied with the draft, SCAP revised it, and it served as the banner for SCAP's efforts to democratize and demilitarize Japan. The conservative parties had wished to revise the constitution since its enactment, particularly [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]]. At the same time, the socialist parties opposed any revision of the constitution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Robert E.|date=1956|title=The Constitution and Current Japanese Politics|journal=Far Eastern Survey|volume=25|issue=4|pages=49\u201358|doi=10.2307/3023907|issn=0362-8949|jstor=3023907}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue was the security Treaty signed in 1951, a product of the late occupation years. Unlike the 1946 constitution, designed to wipe out [[Japanese militarism|militarism in Japan]], the Security Treaty was the result of the U.S. wishing to secure its military strength in Asia to counter the communist threat in the [[Cold War]]. The JSP strongly opposed the Security Treaty due to fears of rearmament or a revival of militarism in Japan, while the LDP argued that the presence of the U.S. army in Japan was merely for self-defense.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Protest in tokyo - the security treaty crisis of 1960.|last=R.|first=Packard, George|year=|isbn=9780691650746|location=|pages=3\u201322|oclc=1023228016}}</ref>\n\n== LDP dominance in the 1955 system ==\n\n=== Electoral system ===\nThe electoral system that was used under 1955 system is known as the [[Single non-transferable vote|Single Nontransferable Vote]] (SNTV). Under SNTV, each constituency has multiple seats to be filled. Voters instead of voting for parties, votes for individual candidates, and seats of the constituency go to whoever wins the most votes. One problem of such electoral system is that the fair allocation of seats to different parties are not taken into consideration: Since the winners of most votes eventually get the seats, candidates of one party can take all the seats of one constituency.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nUnder such electoral system, LDP with its massive political donation put other opposition parties into disadvantage. Due to LDP\u2019s ties with big companies, the party directed the financial resources to individual candidates and enabled them to promise patronage to their voters, with a focus on the agricultural population, while the reallocation of Diet seats did not keep up with the migration from rural to urban area due to industrialization. Aside from the pork-barrel spending, the LDP candidates also cultivated personalism through [[Koenkai]] ''(\u5f8c\u63f4\u4f1a)'' in their own constituency. Politicians went to the locals\u2019 wedding, funeral, birthday parties and so on. In such occasions, politicians often brought considerable amount of cash gift. Candidates would even organize activities such as hot springs for their supporters.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOn the account of its self-assertiveness, LDP unilaterally altered the rules for campaigning. Profiting of its constituted koenkai canvas, the competition rules were toughened for the Opposition. The formal campaign periods were short (and shortened further over time), television and radio advertising being prohibited and low limits placed on posters and handbills. Through the campaign, however, each candidate was granted two five-minute slots on television when a stream of candidates would line up and take turns in front of a stationary microphone to run through their list of promises right after which the next candidate would take other. Such rules of play were discouraging and difficult for a would-be challenger while LDP benefitted from the unfair restraints of participation by the sheer amount of runners.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Japanese party system : from one-party rule to coalition government|last=1945-|first=Hrebenar, Ronald J.|date=1986|publisher=Westview Press|others=Berton, Peter, 1922-2014.|isbn=978-0813303468|location=Boulder, Colo.|oclc=13455801}}</ref>\n\nAnother neglected flaw of the electoral system which bolstered LDP's dominance was the urgent need for redistricting in the wake of the post-war rapid population shifts from the rural to urban areas. The swelling urban populations were much trickier for LDP politicians to fit within the distributed koenkai grassroot structure as they were more peripatetic and atomized than the traditional rural household. These voters had new policy demands (ex. issues related to [[Environmental issues in Japan#Environment deterioration in the 1960s|environmental deterioration in the 1960s]]) which conflicted with the ones practiced by LDP for their industry and big-business support. Under the obsolete district constituencies, the farmers retained disproportionate political influence which as a consequence of pork-barrel desires rather than by concern over issues of broad social policy, stagnated democratic alternation.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite book|title=Japan transformed : political change and economic restructuring|last=McCall.|first=Rosenbluth, Frances |author-link=Frances McCall Rosenbluth|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|others=Thies, Michael F.|isbn=9780691135915|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=428926469}}</ref>\n\nUnder the current electoral rules, LDP was motivated to develop loyal personal support for the farmer's voter group. Being a nationally organized group of voters and united around the single issue of agricultural protectionism, the party could tune higher import tariffs and subsidies to support the less productive small businesses which because of their large numbers, could turn out at elections and vote in predictable ways.\n\n=== Bureaucratization of policymaking ===\nSince the institution of the 1955 system, the legislative independence has been declining in the face of a growth in the combined legislative power of the bureaucracy and the ruling conservative party. Indicators that point to this are the success rates of governmental and individual member bills; the declining rate of amendments added; and the singular lack of success for opposition-sponsored bills. For example, the mere submission of nongovernmentally sponsored measures is extremely difficult. In the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|Lower House]], at least 20 representatives must support a \"member\" bill before it can be introduced, while in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|Upper House]] ten supporters are required. Moreover, should the bill require the expenditure of state funds, fifty and twenty supporters respectively are necessary.\n\nThe chance for success of bureaucratic bills that was only 1.3 times greater than that for individual Diet-generated bills under the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation]] and about twice as great from 1952 to 1955, it augmented to 7 times greater by 1974, when approximately 90% of all successful legislation has been cabinet-sponsored.<ref name=\":102\">{{Cite journal|last=Pempel|first=T. J.|date=November 1974|title=The Bureaucratization of Policymaking in Postwar Japan|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=18|issue=4|pages=647\u2013664|doi=10.2307/2110551|issn=0092-5853|jstor=2110551}}</ref> In addition, the Diet has not been notably active as a potential amender for which there are two devices open: it can either \"amend\" (''shusei''), or it can \"add supplementary resolution of clarification\" (''futai ketsugi''). From 1955 to 1960 just over one-third of all successful government legislation went through one or another of these processes. In the 48th Diet (1964-1965) this rate was 17% and in the 63rd Diet (1970) it was 15%. Finally, opposition bills had no chance of success: of 317 opposition bills introduced from the 37th (1960) through the 46th (1963-1964) Diets, not one became law.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Misawa|first=Shigeo|date=1967-05-30|journal=The Annuals of Japanese Political Science Association|volume=18|pages=5\u201333, 2|doi=10.7218/nenpouseijigaku1953.18.0_5|issn=0549-4192|title=Outline of Policy-Decision Making Process Since 1955|doi-access=free}}</ref> These numbers attest that by the time bills materialize in the Diet a general agreement has already been reached, both within and between the bureaucracy and the LDP. In such an environment, opposition and the generation of successful alternatives from within the Diet itself has become extremely difficult.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\nBesides, the bureaucracy wields considerable and increasing power through the use of nonlegislative devices such a subordinances and communications, and through its varying degrees of dominance over technical and nonpartisan advisory groups.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\n=== Policy decision-making ===\nThe [[Policy Affairs Research Council]] (\u653f\u52d9\u8abf\u67fb\u4f1a ''seimu ch\u014dsakai'') or \"PARC\" was the major policymaking body within the LDP. Its members were the LDP representatives in both legislative houses, and it was the basic forum in which the party discussed and negotiated government policy. The policymaking under this system did not comply with the usual model of a parliamentary cabinet government which involves strong cabinet leadership and coordination. Instead, representatives who were not in the cabinet were often the other pivot of policy through their formal roles PARC. In consultation with bureaucrats and interest groups, the council already had input into policy before the cabinet and prime minister or upper party executives could shape it further. At its height in the mid-1980s, PARC had as many as seventeen divisions.\n\n==== Industrial policy ====\nJapan's industrial policy under the 1955 system was undergirded by a political logic that supports firms and whole industries that would not have been sustainable in a less-regulated economy, imposed high prices and taxes, limited choice in the marketplace, and rigid career paths.<ref name=\":32\" /> In spite of the fact that Japan came out of war with a theoretical comparative advantage towards light manufacturing which would match its profile of low-capital, abundant-labor economy, the war skewed its economic profile toward heavy industries. The large war companies lobbied for a development strategy favoring heavy industry and received subsidies and regulatory favoritism. In exchange, LDP members were awarded with campaign contributions to be able to stay electorally competitive against each other in the multi-member districts.\n\nThe Heavy Industries Bureau of the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] assisted the heavy industries with policies such as:\n\n* Limiting entry and often regulating the market pricing to help stabilize profits.\n* Privileging access to cheap loans from the Japan Development Bank\n* Domestic government budget subsidies and tax breaks as well as favored access to foreign exchange and tariff protections.\n\nSuch strategy of developmental policy which has strong state involvement in developmental orientation is typical of late industrialing countries and in terms of [[international political economy]], follows the model of the [[developmental state]]. Explicit implication implies a degree of corruption, which during [[Kakuei Tanaka]]'s office in 1971-1972 resulted in media noticing corruption which, in one instance, resulted in the [[Kakuei Tanaka#Lockheed scandal and aftermath|Lockheed scandal]].\n\n== The fall of the system ==\n\n=== Global Pressure and the Collapse of Bubble Economy ===\nAs a corollary of the [[Plaza Accord|Plaza Accord of 1985]] when Japan agreed to allow substantial appreciation of the yen, the Japanese government reduced the interests marginally above the rate of inflation as a domestic relief strategy. This resulted in banks and corporations going on an enormous spending spree with nearly free money, bidding up the price of real estate and other assets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unwanted company : foreign investment in American industries|last=1965-|first=Crystal, Jonathan|isbn=9781501723612|location=Ithaca|oclc=1042219263}}</ref>\n\nAgainst the faith of many people that Japan would come to dominate the world economy, the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] led to a bubble crash after the raising of interest rates of the [[Bank of Japan]] in 1990 and firms together with their jobs were in mortal danger. In this context and on the background of LDP's short-term relieved pressure from the already shaky electoral coalition between exporters and the non-traded sectors, the voting public expressed disenchantment toward the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nThe new electoral system following the [[1994 Japanese electoral reform|1994 Electoral reform]] which was claimed to reduce corruption and high elections costs, promote more policy debates, and encourage a two-party system. As a consequence of this reform as well as the change of voter behavior and the change of the international environment, the system collapsed completely following the [[2005 Japanese general election|2005]] and [[2009 Japanese general election|2009]] general elections which demonstrated significant shifts in both the foundations of party support and the importance of national swings in support for one party or another. Since 2005, urban-rural differences in the foundations of the leading parties have changed dramatically, and Japan has moved from a system dominated by locally based, individual candidacies toward a two-party system in which both party popularity and personal characteristics influence electoral success or failure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thies|first=Michael F.|last2=Scheiner|first2=Ethan|last3=Reed|first3=Steven R.|date=2012-07-14|title=The End of LDP Dominance and the Rise of Party-Oriented Politics in Japan|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=38|issue=2|pages=353\u2013376|doi=10.1353/jjs.2012.0037|issn=1549-4721}}</ref>\n\nThe specialist on theoretical knowledge of legislative institutions and electoral systems, Michael Thies, argues that majoritarian institutions of the Anglo-American variety would have pushed politics toward broader coalitions, reducing the premiums captured by organized groups with extreme preferences, and appealing more to the interests of unorganized, diverse voters. A study on the representation of unorganized groups under [[proportional representation]] (featuring multi-member [[Electoral district|voting-districts]]) concludes that closed-list proportional representation makes legislators generally more responsive to interest groups and less responsive to unorganized voters than single-member districts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thies|first=Michael F.|last2=Bawn|first2=Kathleen|date=2003|title=A Comparative Theory of Electoral Incentives: Representing the Unorganized Under PR, Plurality, and Mixed-Member Electoral Systems.|location=Rochester, NY|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1158628|ssrn=1158628}}</ref> An even representation would have given labor a persistent and politically potent voice of the kind seen in continental Europe.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[1947 Japanese general election]]\n* [[1949 Japanese general election]]\n* [[1955 Japanese general election]]\n* [[1958 Japanese general election]]\n* [[1993 Japanese general election]]\n* [[1994 Japanese electoral reform|1994 Electoral reform]]\n* [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]\n* [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]]\n* [[Japanese economic miracle]]\n* [[Zaibatsu]]\n* [[Government-business relations in Japan]]\n* [[Kakuei Tanaka|Tanaka Kakuei]]\n* [[Koenkai]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Politics of Post-war Japan]]\n[[Category:Cold War history of Japan]]\n", "name_user": "Beland", "label": "safe", "comment": "convert special characters (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_System"}
