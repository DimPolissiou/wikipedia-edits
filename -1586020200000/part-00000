With Huaxtepec, which was the prehispanic and colonial capital of the peoples of the ''Plan de Amilpas'', its 25-human settlements including ''Cuauhtl\u00e1n'', had to pay tribute of 400 cotton blankets, 400 two-color valances, 400 bedspreads, 800 thin cotton blankets, 400 pairs of shorts (''patees''), 200 women's shirts, and 1,200 veils (''mantillas'') every 80 days. In addition, they were required to contribute labor.\n\n===Spanish Conquest & Colonial Period===\nThe ''Plan de Amilpas'' including Cuautla was conquered by Captain ''Gonzalo de Sandoval'' on March 14, 1521. \n\nAfter the conquest, Indigenous lands were confiscated, mostly for sugar cane plantations and mills (''trapiches''). Despite Indigenous protests, Viceroy ''Gaspar de Zuniga Acevedo'' ruled in favor of the colonists on July 5, 1603. As the region prospered, Cuautla was named ''Alcalde Mayor'' and separated from Oaxtepec.\n\nConstruction of the church of ''Santo Domingo'' began in the middle of the 16th century. The church and monastery of ''San Diego'' were begun by [[Franciscan]] Friars in 1640.\n\n===Independence & 19th Century===\nAfter a number of successful battles, General [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] arrived in Cuautla in December 1811. On February 19, 1812, Spanish General [[F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Calleja]] began the 72-day [[Siege of Cuautla]]. Morelos was accompanied by ''Leonardo Bravo'', [[Mariano Matamoros]], [[Hermenegildo Galeana]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], and [[Manuel de Ordiera]]. 12-year-old [[Narciso Mendoza]], known as the ''Ni\u00f1o Artillero'' (Child Gunner) is remembered for stopping an advance of royalist troops by setting off a cannon. Morelos and his army were able to break out on May 2, 1812.\n\nCuautla was designated a ''Heroic City'' (''Heroica Ciudad de Morelos'') on April 4, 1829, while Felipe B. Montero was ''Presidente Municipal'' (mayor).\n\nAn 1865 photograph shows the construction of the second floor of the ''Palacio Municipal'' (city hall) in 1865. The building was burned during the Revolution.<ref>http://revista.morelos.gob.mx/conociendo-morelos/cuautla-ciudad-historica-heroica-y-hermosa Retrieved Dec 18, 2018.</ref>\n\nThe railroad station was opened on June 18, 1881, next to the ''Convento de San Diego''.<ref>http://revista.morelos.gob.mx/conociendo-morelos/cuautla-ciudad-historica-heroica-y-hermosa (Dec 18, 2918(</ref> Tourist trains continue to operate along the line.<ref>http://www.morelosturistico.com/espanol/pagina/z_655_tren_escenico_de_cuautla.php (Retrieved Dec 18, 2018)</ref>\n\n===Revolution & 20th Century===\nAs a young man, [[Emiliano Zapata]] was concerned about land seizures in Anenecuilco, his hometown. In May 1911 he answered [[Francisco I. Madero]]'s call to arms against President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. After minor battles in ''Chietla, Iz\u00facar, Metepec'' and ''Atlixco'', Puebla; and ''Yautepec'' and ''Jonacatepec'' in Morelos, he arrived at Cuautla on May 11, 1911. With 4,000 or 5,000 troops he surrounded the city, and the week-long [[Battle of Cuautla (1911)]] began.<ref>https://www.portaloaca.com/historia/biografias/47-biografia-de-emiliano-zapata.html (Dec 18, 2018)</ref> The battle was a major turning point in the [[Mexican Revolution]], as Porfirio D\u00edaz said the battle convinced him to sign the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] and resign.\n\nNearly seven years later, in April 1919, Colonel ''Jesus Guajardo'' assassinated Zapata, apparently under orders of President [[Venustiano Carranza]] in [[Chinameca, Ciudad Ayala|Chinameca, Ayala]].

Also, many homes in this city, are made with only cinder blocks, cement, and a tin roof. Many of these homes also lack electricity and running water. Nearly all homes have a \"tinaco,\" which is a large plastic container for water, which is refilled regularly by the city. These containers let water out into pipes which can be opened or closed to wash clothes and dishes, or to bathe.\n\n==Climate==\n\nThe city is quite warm year-round.\nIn the winter, there is a slight decrease in both the daytime and nighttime temperatures, and because of Cuautla's proximity to the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and its altitude (about 4,500 feet above sea level), the nighttime temperatures year-round usually average about 57&nbsp;\u00b0F (14&nbsp;\u00b0C). On the other hand, because Cuautla is somewhat close to the [[Equator]], temperatures year-round tend to reach into the mid 80s to lower 90s\u00b0F (upper 20s\u00b0C to the lower 30s\u00b0C) even during the winter, and in spring on many days the daytime temperatures may reach well into the upper 90s\u00b0F (upper 30s\u00b0C).<ref>https://weatherspark.com/y/6484/Average-Weather-in-Cuautla-Mexico-Year-Round</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\nThe dominant religion in Cuautla is Roman Catholicism.

With Huaxtepec, which was the prehispanic and colonial capital of the peoples of the ''Plan de Amilpas'', its 25 human settlements including ''Cuauhtl\u00e1n'', had to pay tribute of 400 cotton blankets, 400 two-color valances, 400 bedspreads, 800 thin cotton blankets, 400 pairs of shorts (''patees''), 200 women's shirts, and 1,200 veils (''mantillas'') every 80 days. In addition, they were required to contribute labor.\n\n===Spanish Conquest & Colonial Period===\nThe ''Plan de Amilpas'' including Cuautla was conquered by Captain ''Gonzalo de Sandoval'' on March 14, 1521. \n\nAfter the conquest, Indigenous lands were confiscated, mostly for sugar cane plantations and mills (''trapiches''). Despite Indigenous protests, Viceroy ''Gaspar de Zuniga Acevedo'' ruled in favor of the colonists on July 5, 1603. As the region prospered, Cuautla was named ''Alcalde Mayor'' and separated from Oaxtepec.\n\nConstruction of the church of ''Santo Domingo'' began in the middle of the 16th century. The church and monastery of ''San Diego'' were begun by [[Franciscan]] Friars in 1640.\n\n===Independence & 19th Century===\nAfter a number of successful battles, General [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] arrived in Cuautla in December 1811. On February 19, 1812, Spanish General [[F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Calleja]] began the 72-day [[Siege of Cuautla]]. Morelos was accompanied by ''Leonardo Bravo'', [[Mariano Matamoros]], [[Hermenegildo Galeana]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], and [[Manuel de Ordiera]]. 12-year-old [[Narciso Mendoza]], known as the ''Ni\u00f1o Artillero'' (Child Gunner) is remembered for stopping an advance of royalist troops by setting off a cannon.

The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86-89</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.90</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.91</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.92</ref>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.103</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the Marlborough to open fire and engage the French. At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.104</ref>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.105</ref>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.107</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.110</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.113</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.117</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.119</ref>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.123</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.126</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.122</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections.\n\nIn the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.131</ref>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.133</ref>\n\n===French flight===\n\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.137</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, ''[[HMS Centaur]]'' and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul. After a further ten minutes the ship was dismasted, and Paul then surrendered to the ''Centaur''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.138</ref>\n\nAfter an afternoon of sporadic outbursts between British and French around 4pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the Ville de Pais, but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] became the third French ship to surrender, having been flanked by HMS Canada and HMS Alcide. Following the mortal wounding of the captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.140</ref>\n\nhe was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest. in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

He was created a [[Peerage|peer]] with \u00a32,000 a year settled on the title in perpetuity for this victory. Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86-89</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.90</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.91</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.92</ref>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.103</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the Marlborough to open fire and engage the French. At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.104</ref>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.105</ref>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.107</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.110</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.113</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.117</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.119</ref>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.123</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.126</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.122</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections.\n\nIn the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.131</ref>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.133</ref>\n\n===French flight===\n\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS Richmond]], now renamed Richemont, under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled Glorieux. [[French ship Souverain|Souverain]] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the Glorieux was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lt Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.137</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, ''[[HMS Centaur]]'' and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul. After a further ten minutes the ship was dismasted, and Paul then surrendered to the ''Centaur''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.138</ref>\n\nAfter an afternoon of sporadic outbursts between British and French around 4pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the Ville de Pais, but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] became the third French ship to surrender, having been flanked by HMS Canada and HMS Alcide. Following the mortal wounding of the captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.140</ref>\n\nhe was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest. in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> ''Ardent'' soon followed, being taken by the rest of the British centre.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\"/>\n[[File:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|thumb|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nAt 4 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', alone and being battered by ''Barfleur'', with little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n===End of the battle===\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line.

The following year in February 544, L\u00fd B\u00ed was declared \"Emperor\" by the people with the intention of demonstrating equal in power to China imperial rulers. He renamed the new kingdom \"[[V\u1ea1n Xu\u00e2n]]\" ([[wikt:\u842c|\u842c]][[wikt:\u6625|\u6625]], literally \"Eternal Spring\"). His imperial armies also repelled attacks from [[Champa]] in the south who had allied with Han's court at the time.\n\n== Further in his life ==\n[[File:Map of V\u1ea1n Xu\u00e2n Kingdom during Early L\u00fd dynasty.png|left|thumb|220px|Map of V\u1ea1n Xu\u00e2n Kingdom ]]\nL\u00fd Nam \u0110\u1ebf established his capital at Long Bi\u00ean (modern-day [[Hanoi]]), surrounded himself with effective leadership in military and administrative scholars.

The latter emerged as a hero in Vietnamese history and eventually succeeded L\u00fd Nam \u0110\u1ebf as ruler in 548. L\u00fd Nam \u0110\u1ebf built many fortresses at strategic locations throughout V\u1ea1n Xu\u00e2n to fend off potential threats from Han in the north and from the Champa Kingdom in the south, he also established the first national university for mandarin scholars, implemented land reforms, and promoted literacy amongst the population.

The Liang emperor sent one of his generals [[Emperor Wu of Chen|Chen Baxian]] (Tr\u1ea7n B\u00e1 Ti\u00ean) and granted him sole command of the invading Liang forces.  By spring of 545, Chen had marched his army into V\u1ea1n Xu\u00e2n territory and laid [[siege]] and devastation to many cities.  His initial invasion was stalled by L\u00fd imperial forces for months.  However, in the winter of 545, Chen laid a surprised attack on the capital during the monsoon season.  L\u00fd Nam \u0110\u1ebf's imperial forces were caught off guard and the imperial administration was forced to abandon Long Bi\u00ean and flee westward into the neighboring kingdom of Laos.  The L\u00fd imperial forces were becoming weary and exhausted and L\u00fd himself was increasingly ill due to months of being exposed in the wilderness.  L\u00fd Nam \u0110\u1ebf realized that his illness would not enable him to rally the troops and accomplish a successful resistance against the imperial Chinese forces.  In February 548, he relinquished imperial authority and transferred his power to his older brother [[L\u00fd Thi\u00ean B\u1ea3o]] (co-ruler from 548 until his death in 555) and [[Tri\u1ec7u Vi\u1ec7t V\u01b0\u01a1ng|Tri\u1ec7u Quang Ph\u1ee5c]] (r. 548\u2013571), who was his best [[lieutenant]] and [[general]].\n\nBy April 548, after suffering from serious diseases for months, L\u00fd Nam \u0110\u1ebf died in [[Laos]] while fighting the Liang forces when local Laotian tribesmen assassinated him in hope for warding off the invading Liang army.

The US has played more test matches against Canada than any other country.  The two teams first met in 1977, and have played every year since then with the exception of 2010.  As of the end of 2019, the two sides have met 58 times, with 22 wins for the U.S., 38 wins for Canada, and 2 draws.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada routinely play each other in qualifying matches for the Rugby World Cup.  They have met in the qualification stages for every tournament, except for the 1987 tournament, for which teams were invited rather than going through qualification matches, and the 1995 tournament, for which Canada had automatically qualified by finishing as a quarterfinalist in the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Since 2015, the teams play each other annually at the [[Americas Rugby Championship]].\n\nThe U.S. has been undefeated in the last 12 matches, with 11 wins and a draw. The first victory of the Eagles' current unbeaten streak ended a seven-match winning streak by Canada that lasted from 2009 through 2013.\n\n==Tournament records==\n===Honors===\n*[[2018 Americas Rugby Championship]] \u2013 Champion\n*[[2017 Americas Rugby Championship]] \u2013 Champion\n*[[Rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] \u2013 Gold Medal\n*[[Rugby union at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] \u2013 Gold Medal\n\n===Rugby World Cup===\n{{main|United States at the Rugby World Cup}}\nThe United States has qualified for every [[Rugby World Cup]] except the 1995 tournament.

The US has played more test matches against Canada than any other country.  The two teams first met in 1977, and have played every year since then with the exception of 2010.  As of the end of 2019, the two sides have met 58 times, with 22 wins for the U.S., 38 wins for Canada, and 2 draws.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada routinely play each other in qualifying matches for the Rugby World Cup.  They have met in the qualification stages for every tournament, except for the 1987 tournament, for which teams were invited rather than going through qualification matches, and the 1995 tournament, for which Canada had automatically qualified by finishing as a quarterfinalist in the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Since 2015, the teams play each other annually at the [[Americas Rugby Championship]].\n\nThe U.S. has been undefeated in the last 12 matches, with 11 wins and a draw. The first victory of the Eagles' current unbeaten streak ended a seven-match winning streak by Canada that lasted from 2009 through 2013.\n\n==Tournament records==\n===Honors===\n*[[2018 Americas Rugby Championship]] \u2013 Champion\n*[[2017 Americas Rugby Championship]] \u2013 Champion\n*[[Rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] \u2013 Gold Medal\n*[[Rugby union at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] \u2013 Gold Medal\n\n===Rugby World Cup===\n{{main|United States at the Rugby World Cup}}\nThe United States has qualified for every [[Rugby World Cup]] except the 1995 tournament.
