While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others. Players performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note|name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.\n\n== Glitches and sequence breaking ==\n{{main|Glitch|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/sekiro-speedrunners-discover-wild-techniques-to-beat-th-1833720570|title=Sekiro Speedrunners Discover Wild Techniques To Beat The Game In 40 Minutes|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>. See [[Speedrun#Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)|section \"Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)\"]] for more information on Metroid 2002.}} The original thread was called \"Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus\"; since then, the \"''x'' before ''y''\" notation has become common in the nomenclature of speedrunning. Thardus, a fictional creature in the [[Metroid|''Metroid'' series]], was designed to be a mandatory [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] before the Gravity Suit and Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. Since its initial discovery, sequence breaking has become an integral part of speedrunning and has been applied to many other games. A specific way to do sequence breaking in a specific game is usually called a skip, and well-known skips are known in their communities under names that easily identify it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/zelda-wind-waker-hd-speedrunning-community-spurred-by-new-exploit-484384.phtml|title=Zelda: Wind Waker HD speedrunning community spurred by new exploit|website=Destructoid|language=english|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>[[Image:Sm64 mips.png|thumb|Usage of a [[Speedrun#Glitches|glitch]] in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to pass through a wall, performing a sequence break.]][[Glitch|Glitches]] are often used in order to achieve sequence breaks; an example of this can be found in the \"16 Star\" run of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.

Each category specifies which glitches are permitted and what game objectives must be completed. For example, it is typically agreed that glitches arising from outside the game, such as improperly inserting the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], are impermissible. Removing or altering a game disc/cartridge/files while the game is running is forbidden. Examples of this are the crooked cartridge trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and the CD streaming trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ZeldaSpeedRuns Leaderboard Rules|url=http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|website=ZeldaSpeedRuns|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220003/http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Tool-assistance ==\n{{main|Tool-assisted speedrun}}\nAlthough most speedruns assume normal human play of a game, ''[[tool-assisted speedrun]]s'' (abbreviated ''TAS'') allow authors to use outside tools to aid their playing. For example, utilizing the [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] function of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] to go back in time and revise mistakes (known as ''re-recording''), or using software to read [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] directly from the game's memory, giving the player information not normally available to them. The result is that human limitations, such as skill and reflex, are no longer a barrier in the creation of a run; tool-assisted runs have (sometimes significantly) lower completion times than their unassisted equivalents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/speedrunner-smashes-a-computer-assisted-super-mario-bro-1834457319|title=Speedrunner Smashes A Computer-Assisted Super Mario Bros.

If the fastest way to complete the game already involves the player picking up the fewest key items or upgrades, a low% category may not exist for that game's speedruns.<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\"/> As with 100% runs, low% speedruns have requirements that vary between games.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, there can be game-specific categories that change how much of the game must be completed. These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a \"Water%\" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.<ref name=\"DKCspeedruns\">{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Randomizer}}\nA '''randomizer''' is a type of [[game mod]] that has been used in speedrunning, wherein software is used to shuffle the locations of elements (such as items) to provide an additional challenge. Popular games used for randomizer runs have included ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[Super Metroid]]'', while a notable mod combines both games\u2014with special doorways transitioning the player between them, and items from both games scattered within their respective environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/|title=How \u201crandomizers\u201d are breathing new life into old games|last=Staff|first=Ars|date=2019-12-03|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]] pertaining to video games in general. When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1|title=Smashing the Clock|author=Turner, B.|year=2005|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=August 13, 2005}}</ref> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994|title=1994 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, List of Winners|accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614193353/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994 |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}</ref> and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]]. From there on, since early 1998, it had been administered by Adam Hegyi, who was maintaining the site, but left around 2007 without notice. In 2012, COMPET-N player Zvonimir 'fx' Bu\u017eani\u0107 took over maintaining the site and re-created new database for WAD-s and PWAD-s. It is currently located at [http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n COMPET-N | news].\n\nAs of November 2007, COMPET-N contained a total amount of 6072 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 462 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds.<ref name=\"DoomStats\"/> As of January 2012, COMPET-N contains a total amount of 9122 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 749 hours, 41 minutes and 47 seconds.\n\n=== SpeedRunsLive.com ===\nIn 2009, [http://www.speedrunslive.com/ SpeedRunsLive.com] was created by Narcissa Wright and Daniel 'Jiano' Hart<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/about/|title=About SpeedRunsLive|website=www.speedrunslive.com|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> as a way for speedrunners to showcase speedrunning races in real time with a set goal consisting of various possible categories.

Not all of those newcomers agreed with the standard that runs should be made on the hardest possible difficulty level. Thus, in August 1997, ''Muad'Dib's Quake Page'' came to be, run by Gunnar \"Muad'Dib\" Andre Mo and specializing in \"Easy\" difficulty runs.<ref name=\"HistoryTXT\"/> One month after that, the ''Quake done Quick'' movie was superseded by a new movie called ''Quake done Quicker'' on September 14, 1997, which shortened the game's fastest playthrough to 0:16:35.<ref name=\"qdqr\"/>\n\nIn April 1998, Pflug and Mo merged their pages, thus creating the ''[[Speed Demos Archive]]'', which, as of 2007, is still the dominant community for ''Quake'' speedrunning and also acts as repository for demos, maps, statistics, and software pertaining to the practice.<ref name=\"HistoryTXT\"/> Ever since its creation, a large variety of tricks have been discovered in ''Quake''<nowiki/>'s physics. Despite being released as early as 1996, ''Quake'' has steadily remained popular with its players, who subsequently released the ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance'' movie on September 13, 2000, which featured a complete run through ''Quake'' in 0:12:23.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |accessdate=March 25, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423162351/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |archivedate=April 23, 2006 |title=Quake done Quick with a Vengeance}}</ref> Primarily tricks that had not been used in both its predecessors allowed for this improvement, as the run's manual states that it \"[makes] use of every known trick, including unrestricted [[Strafe-jumping|bunny-hopping]], to represent the state-of-the-art in Nightmare running\".<ref name=\"QuakeDoneQuickWithAVengeance\">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.txt | publisher = Quake done Quick | title = Quake done Quick with a Vengeance | author = Quake done Quick contributors | archivedate = April 9, 2006 | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | url-status = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060409151532/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.txt | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2014, Speed Demos Archive can be found at the web address <tt>[http://speeddemosarchive.com/ http://speeddemosarchive.com/]</tt> and contains a total amount of 9535 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of over 250 hours.<ref name=\"QuakeStats\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = https://archive.org/details/Quake_SDA_collection | title = Quake (PC) \u2013 Speed demo collection | publisher = Internet Archive | accessdate =September 10, 2014}}</ref> In December 2011, a new run was produced and called ''Quake done Quickest''.

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.\n\nAs the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.\n\nThe first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien \"Zell\" Dubois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called \"Tools-Assisted Speedruns\", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/>{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as \"tools-assisted speedrunning\", after the first site used to share these demos.

The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator. It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator.

This often takes the form of a [[fan convention]] where runners get together to speedrun video games to raise money for charity, but may also be a purely online event. The most popular speedrun marathons are the biannual [[Games Done Quick]] marathon in the United States. Before the marathons, discussions take place on a forum, and runners submit their game choices. An online schedule is created that will show who is speedrunning, when they are speedrunning, and what game they are speedrunning. Their runs are streamed live at [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and runners often provide commentary throughout the run to give viewers a better understanding of what is going on. Runners who are speedrunning often practice their game in a practice room at the event before their scheduled run as a warm up, or they practice at home beforehand. Speedrun marathons such as the Awesome Games Done Quick 2017 marathon have raised $2,222,934.52 for the [[Prevent Cancer Foundation]].<ref name=\"gdq2016total\">{{cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donations/agdq2017|title=Donation Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Games Done Quick 2017|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Competitive speedrunning ==\nThe first ever competitive speedrunning tournament was organized by the Global Speedrunning Association called PACE.

While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others.\n\nPlayers performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note |name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.\n\n== Glitches and sequence breaking ==\n{{main|Glitch|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>. See [[Speedrun#Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)|section \"Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)\"]] for more information on Metroid 2002.}} The original thread was called \"Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus\"; since then, the \"''x'' before ''y''\" notation has become common in the nomenclature of speedrunning. Thardus, a fictional creature in the [[Metroid|''Metroid'' series]], was designed to be a mandatory [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] before the Gravity Suit and Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. Since its initial discovery, sequence breaking has become an integral part of speedrunning and has been applied to many other games. A specific way to do sequence breaking in a specific game is usually called a skip, and well-known skips are known in their communities under names that easily identify it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}[[Image:Sm64 mips.png|thumb|Usage of a [[Speedrun#Glitches|glitch]] in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to pass through a wall, performing a sequence break.]][[Glitch|Glitches]] are often used in order to achieve sequence breaks; an example of this can be found in the \"16 Star\" run of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. In this game, [[Mario]] normally needs to collect at least 70 of the 120 power stars before he is allowed to challenge [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], the final boss, but a glitch makes it possible to access the final level with only 16 stars. With the right kind of movement, it is possible to pass through the boundary of a wall by pushing into it while holding onto MIPS, an [[Non-player character|NPC]] rabbit, then exploit a trick known as \"backwards long-jumping\" to bypass the 70 star door.<ref>{{Citation|title=9 Insane Tricks Used By Mario 64 Speedrunners - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/9-insane-tricks-used-by-mario-64-speedrunners|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Since then, similar tricks have been found to complete the game without collecting any stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/9/17549444/super-mario-64-speedrun-world-record-0-star|title=One of Super Mario 64's toughest speedrun records has been broken|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2018-07-09|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Glitches can also be used for purposes outside of sequence breaking, such as achieving otherwise impossible speeds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/05/half-life-2-world-record-speedrun-will-make-your-head-spin/|title=Half-Life 2 World Record Speedrun Will Make Your Head Spin|date=2015-05-06|website=Kotaku Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-wild-speedrunning-community-of-16-year-old-spongebob-battle-for-bikini-bottom/|title=Inside the wild speedrunning community of 16-year-old SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom|last=Winkie|first=Luke|date=2019-09-25|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> and duplicating resources.\n\nWhile some speedrun rules require that the skipping of such events be avoided, it is often desirable to make full use of such possibilities. Therefore, some websites, such as Speeddemosarchive,<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|title=Speed Demos Archive - Rules|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022020158/http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|archivedate=October 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> offer support for multiple speedrun categories. Each category specifies which glitches are permitted and what game objectives must be completed. For example, it is typically agreed that glitches arising from outside the game, such as improperly inserting the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], are impermissible. Removing or altering a game disc/cartridge/files while the game is running is forbidden. Examples of this are the crooked cartridge trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and the CD streaming trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ZeldaSpeedRuns Leaderboard Rules|url=http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|website=ZeldaSpeedRuns|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220003/http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Tool-assistance ==\n{{main|Tool-assisted speedrun}}\nAlthough most speedruns assume normal human play of a game, ''[[tool-assisted speedrun]]s'' (abbreviated ''TAS'') allow authors to use outside tools to aid their playing. For example, utilizing the [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] function of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] to go back in time and revise mistakes (known as ''re-recording''), or using software to read [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] directly from the game's memory, giving the player information not normally available to them. The result is that human limitations, such as skill and reflex, are no longer a barrier in the creation of a run; tool-assisted runs have (sometimes significantly) lower completion times than their unassisted equivalents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/speedrunner-smashes-a-computer-assisted-super-mario-bro-1834457319|title=Speedrunner Smashes A Computer-Assisted Super Mario Bros.

This often includes collecting all key items or upgrades, finding all secret features, or anything else that may be deemed important. Specific requirements for a 100% speedrun are different depending on the game.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=https://forum.speeddemosarchive.com/post/low100_definitions.html|title=low%/100% definitions|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref> Some games, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', have a percentage counter and therefore have an easy definition for 100%.<ref>{{cite web|title=sweetnumb's SM 100% Item Advanced Tutorial with WildAnaconda69|url=https://www.twitch.tv/sweetnumb/v/44379421|website=Twitch}}</ref> Others do not, and instead the game's community decides what the definition for 100% should be.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|title=SpeedRunsLive Speedrunning Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=SpeedRunsLive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615224214/http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|archive-date=June 15, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Any% and 100% are the most common categories for speedrunning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@CeltThulu/speedrunning-a-primer-for-beginners-by-a-beginner-76d1f2bdc|title=Speedrunning \u2014 A Primer For Beginners, By a Beginner|last=Steele|first=Brian|date=November 15, 2015|website=Medium|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''Low%''', or minimalist completion, requires the player to complete the game by obtaining the fewest key items or upgrades possible. If the fastest way to complete the game already involves the player picking up the fewest key items or upgrades, a low% category may not exist for that game's speedruns.<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\"/> As with 100% runs, low% speedruns have requirements that vary between games.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, there can be game-specific categories that change how much of the game must be completed. These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a \"Water%\" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.<ref name=\"DKCspeedruns\">{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Randomizer}}\nA '''randomizer''' is a type of [[game mod]] that has been used in speedrunning, wherein software is used to shuffle the locations of elements (such as items) to provide an additional challenge. Popular games used for randomizer runs have included ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[Super Metroid]]'', while a notable mod combines both games\u2014with special doorways transitioning the player between them, and items from both games scattered within their respective environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/|title=How \u201crandomizers\u201d are breathing new life into old games|last=Staff|first=Ars|date=2019-12-03|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]] pertaining to video games in general. When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1|title=Smashing the Clock|author=Turner, B.|year=2005|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=August 13, 2005}}</ref> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994|title=1994 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, List of Winners|accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614193353/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994 |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}</ref> and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]]. From there on, since early 1998, it had been administered by Adam Hegyi, who was maintaining the site, but left around 2007 without notice. In 2012, COMPET-N player Zvonimir 'fx' Bu\u017eani\u0107 took over maintaining the site and re-created new database for WAD-s and PWAD-s.

Not all of those newcomers agreed with the standard that runs should be made on the hardest possible difficulty level.

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.\n\nAs the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.\n\nThe first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien \"Zell\" Dubois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called \"Tools-Assisted Speedruns\", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/>{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as \"tools-assisted speedrunning\", after the first site used to share these demos.

Although it was widely believed that the video was made by an extremely skilled player, it was actually the first tool-assisted speedrun made with a special emulator to generate widespread interest.{{refn|group=Note |name=EarlyTASVideos|There is evidence that several tool-assisted speedrun videos had been made before then, including a few others by Morimoto himself, but the Super Mario Bros. 3 video was the first to become popular with a general audience.}} When Morimoto detailed the making of the run on his website,<ref name=\"MorimotoExplanation\">{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031203222907/http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archivedate = December 3, 2003 | title = emu | publisher = Internet Archive | author = \u3082\u308a\u3082\u3068 | accessdate =December 3, 2003}}</ref> many felt deceived and turned to criticizing the video's \"illegitimacy\" instead. The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator. It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator.

A method of bypassing Millau had long been considered, not only to ease the flow and reduce journey times for long-distance traffic, but also to improve the quality of access to Millau for its local businesses and residents. One of the solutions considered was the construction of a road [[bridge]] to span the river and gorge valley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.BBC.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/europe_the_millau_bridge/html/2.stm|title=The Millau Bridge, page 2|website=news.BBC.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date= |accessdate= }}</ref> The first plans for a bridge were discussed in 1987 by [[CETE]], and by October 1991 the decision was made to build a high crossing of the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]] by a structure of around {{convert|2500|m}} in length. During 1993\u20131994, the [[Government of France|government]] consulted with seven [[architect]]s and eight [[structural engineer]]s. During 1995\u20131996, a second definition study was made by five associated architect groups and structural engineers.

The decision to proceed by grant of contract was made in May 1998; then in June 2000, the contest for the [[construction contract]] was launched, open to four consortia.

Although this option was shorter and better suited to through traffic, it did not satisfactorily serve the needs of Millau and its area.\n# Great Western ({{lang-fr|grand Ouest}}) (<span style=\"color:#fff; background:#000\">&nbsp;black route&nbsp;</span>) \u2014 longer than the eastern option by {{convert|12|km|mi}}, following the [[Cernon valley]]. Technically easier (requiring four viaducts), this solution was judged to have negative impacts on the environment, in particular on the picturesque villages of [[Peyre, Aveyron|Peyre]] and Saint-Georges-de-Luzen\u00e7on.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It was more expensive than the preceding option, and served the region badly.\n# Near RN9 ({{lang-fr|proche de la RN9}}) (<span style=background:#F88>&nbsp;red route&nbsp;</span>) \u2014 would have served the town of Millau well, but presented technical difficulties,{{clarify|date=April 2017}} and would have had a strong impact on existing or planned structures.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n# Intermediate ({{lang-fr|m\u00e9diane}}), west of Millau (<span style=background:#9AF>&nbsp;blue route&nbsp;</span>) \u2014 was supported by local opinion, but presented geological difficulties, notably on the question of crossing the valley of the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]]. Expert investigation concluded that these obstacles were not insurmountable.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe fourth option was selected by [[ministerial decree]] on 28 June 1989.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">''Le viaduc de Millau : un ouvrage exceptionnel initi\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9quipement'', op. cit., p.4</ref> It encompassed two possibilities:\n# the high solution, envisaging a {{convert|2500|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} viaduct more than {{convert|200|m|ft}} above the river;\n# the low solution, descending into the valley and crossing the river on a {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} bridge, then a viaduct of {{convert|2300|m|ft}}, extended by a tunnel on the [[Larzac]] side.\n\nAfter long construction studies by the Ministry of Public Works, the low solution was abandoned because it would have intersected the [[water table]], had a negative impact on the town, cost more, and lengthened the driving distance. The choice of the 'high' solution was decided by ministerial decree on 29 October 1991.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\nAfter the choice of the high viaduct, five teams of [[architect]]s and [[researcher]]s worked on a technical solution. The concept and design for the bridge was devised by French [[design]]er and structural engineer [[Michel Virlogeux|Dr Michel Virlogeux]]. He worked with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] engineering firm [[Arcadis]], responsible for the [[structural engineering]] of the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ARCADIS.nl/Pers/archive/Pages/ARCADIStekendevoorhoogstebrugterwereld.aspx|title=ARCADIS tekende voor hoogste brug ter wereld|website=ARCADIS.nl|publisher=[[Arcadis NV|ARCADIS NV]]|date=13 December 2004|language=nl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119154613/http://www.arcadis.nl/Pers/archive/Pages/ARCADIStekendevoorhoogstebrugterwereld.aspx|archivedate=19 November 2008|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Choosing the definitive route===\n[[File:Millau trac\u00e9.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the proposed route before construction of the bridge]]\nThe 'high solution' required the construction of a {{convert|2500|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} [[viaduct]]. From 1991 to 1993, the structures division of [[S\u00e9tra]], directed by [[Michel Virlogeux]], carried out preliminary studies, and examined the feasibility of a single structure spanning the valley. Taking into account technical, architectural, and financial issues, the Administration of Roads opened the question for competition among structural engineers and [[architect]]s to widen the search for realistic designs. By July 1993, seventeen structural engineers and thirty-eight architects applied as candidates for the preliminary studies. With the assistance of a multidisciplinary commission, the Administration of Roads selected eight structural engineers for a technical study, and seven architects for the architectural study.\n\n===Choice of technical design===\nSimultaneously, a school of international experts representing a wide spectrum of expertise (technical, architectural, and landscape), chaired by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Coste, was established to clarify the choices that had to be made.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In February 1995, on the basis of proposals of the architects and structural engineers, and with support of the school of experts, five general designs were identified.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe competition was relaunched: five combinations of architects and structural engineers, drawn from the best candidates of the first phase, were formed; each was to conduct in-depth studies of one of the general designs. On 15 July 1996, [[Bernard Pons]], minister of Public Works, announced the decision of the jury, which was constituted of elected artists and experts, and chaired by Christian Leyrit, the director of highways. The solution of a multiple-span [[viaduct]] [[cable-stayed bridge]], presented by the structural engineering group Sogelerg, Europe Etudes Gecti and Serf, and the architects [[Foster + Partners]] was declared the best.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nDetailed studies were carried out by the successful consortium, steered by the highways authority until mid-1998. After undergoing [[Wind tunnel|wind tunnel tests]], the shape of the road deck was altered, and detailed corrections were made to the design of the [[Tower#Transportation support|pylons]]. When the details were eventually finalised, the whole design was approved in late 1998.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Contractors===\n[[File:Viaduc-Millau Pile-P2 Eiffel.svg|thumb|The P2 pier of the [[Viaduct]] is the tallest structure in France, 23&nbsp;m taller than the [[Eiffel Tower]]]]\nOnce the Ministry of Public Works had taken the decision to offer the construction and operation of the [[viaduct]] as a grant of contract, an international call for tenders was issued in 1999. Five consortia tendered:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n# Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau (CEVM), a new [[subsidiary]] created by [[Eiffage]];\n# PAECH Construction Enterprise, Poland;\n# a consortium led by the Spanish company [[Grupo ACS|Dragados]], with [[Skanska]], [[Sweden]], and Bec, France;\n# Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Viaduc de Millau, including the French companies ASF, Egis Projects, GTM Construction, [[Bouygues|Bouygues Travaux Publics]], SGE, CDC Projets, Tofinso, and the [[Italy|Italian]] company Autostrade;\n# a consortium led by G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Routi\u00e8re, with Via GTI (France) and [[Cintra]], Nesco, [[Acciona]], and [[Ferrovial|Ferrovial Agroman]] ([[Spain]]).\n\n[[Pier]]s were built with [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] high performance concrete. The pylons of the Millau Viaduct, which are the tallest elements (the tallest pylon&nbsp;\u2013 {{convert|244.96|m}}) were produced and mounted by PAECH Construction Enterprise from Poland.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau, working with the architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], was successful in obtaining the tender.<ref name=structurae/> Because the government had already taken the design work to an advanced stage, the technical uncertainties were considerably reduced. A further advantage of this process was to make negotiating the contract easier, reducing public expense, and speeding up construction, while minimising such design work as remained for the contractor.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAll the member companies of the [[Eiffage]] group had some role in the construction work. The construction consortium was made up of the Eiffage TP company for the concrete part, the [[Eiffel company]] for the steel roadway ([[Gustave Eiffel]] built the [[Garabit viaduct]] in 1884, a railway bridge in the neighbouring [[Cantal]] ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]''), and the [[Enerpac]] company<ref name=Enerpac>{{cite web|url=http://www.Enerpac.com/html/Projects/Millau/Millau_Closed.html|title=Final hydraulic launch successfully closes last gap in the Millau Viaduct in the south of France|website=Enerpac.com|publisher=[[Enerpac]], [[Actuant Corporation]]|date=28 May 2004|accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref> for the roadway's hydraulic supports.

The builders, [[Eiffage]], financed the construction in return for a concession to collect the tolls for 75 years,<ref name=BBC-Dec2004/><ref name=BBC-May2004/> until 2080. However, if the concession yields high revenues, the French government can assume control of the bridge as early as 2044.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe project required about {{convert|127000|m3|cuyd|lk=on}} of [[concrete]], {{convert|19000|tonne|short ton|lk=on}} of steel for the reinforced concrete, and {{convert|5000|tonne|short ton}} of pre-stressed steel for the cables and shrouds. The builder claims that the lifetime of the bridge will be at least 120&nbsp;years.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Opposition===\nNumerous organisations opposed the project, including the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF), [[France Nature Environnement]], the national federation of motorway users, and Environmental Action. Opponents advanced several arguments:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n* The westernmost route would be better, longer by {{convert|3|km}}, but a third of the cost with its three more conventional structures.\n* The objective of the viaduct would not be achieved; because of the toll, the viaduct would be little used, and the project would not solve Millau's congestion problems.\n* The project would never break even; toll income would never amortise the initial investment, and the contractor would have to be supported by subsidies.\n* The technical difficulties were too great, and the bridge would be dangerous and unsustainable; the pylons, sitting on the [[shale]] of the Tarn Valley, would not support the structure adequately.\n* The viaduct represented a detour, reducing the number of visitors passing through Millau and slowing its economy.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Millau Viaduct construction south.jpg|thumb|300px|The viaduct under construction, seen from the south in early 2004]]\nTwo weeks after the laying of the first stone on December 14, 2001, the workers started digging the deep shafts. There were four shafts per pylon; {{convert|15|m|ft}} deep and {{convert|5|m|ft}} in diameter, assuring the stability of the pylons. At the bottom of each pylon, a tread of {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|0}} in thickness was installed to reinforce the effect of the deep shafts. The {{convert|2000|m3|cuyd}} of concrete necessary for the treads was poured at the same time.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn March 2002, the pylons emerged from the ground. The speed of construction then rapidly increased. Every three days, each pylon increased in height by {{convert|4|m|ft}}. This performance was mainly due to [[Climbing formwork|sliding shuttering]]. Thanks to a system of shoe anchorages and fixed rails in the heart of the pylons, a new layer of concrete could be poured every 20 minutes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe bridge road deck was constructed on land at the ends of the Viaduct, and rolled lengthwise from one pylon to the next, with eight temporary towers providing additional support. The movement was accomplished by a computer-controlled system of pairs of wedges under the deck; the upper and lower wedges of each pair pointing in opposite directions. These were hydraulically operated, and moved repeatedly in the following sequence: the lower wedge slides under the upper wedge, raising it to the roadway above, and then forcing the upper wedge still higher to lift the roadway. Both wedges move forward together, advancing the roadway a short distance. The lower wedge retracts from under the upper wedge, lowering the roadway and allowing the upper wedge to drop away from the roadway; the lower wedge then moves back all the way to its starting position. There is now a linear distance between the two wedges equal to the distance forward the roadway has just moved. The upper wedge moves backward, placing it further back along the roadway, adjacent to the front tip of the lower wedge and ready to repeat the cycle and advance the roadway by another increment. It worked at {{convert|600|mm|in}} per cycle which was roughly four minutes long.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe mast pieces were driven over the new road deck lying down horizontally. The pieces were joined to form the one complete mast, still lying horizontally. The mast was then tilted upwards, as one piece, at one time in a tricky operation. In this way, each mast was erected on top of the corresponding concrete pylon. The stays connecting the masts and the deck were then installed, and the bridge was tensioned overall, and weight tested. After this, the temporary pylons could be removed.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Timeline===\n* 16 October 2001: work begins\n* 14 December 2001: laying of the first stone\n* January 2002: laying pier foundations\n* March 2002: start of work on the pier support C8\n* June 2002: support C8 completed, start of work on piers\n* July 2002: start of work on the foundations of temporary, height adjustable roadway supports\n* August 2002: start of work on pier support C0\n* September 2002: assembly of roadway begins\n* November 2002: first piers complete\n* 25\u201326 February 2003: laying of first pieces of roadway\n* November 2003: completion of the last piers (piers P2 at {{convert|245|m|ft}} and P3 at {{convert|221|m|ft}} are the highest piers in the world)\n* 28 May 2004: the pieces of roadway are several centimetres apart, their juncture to be accomplished within two weeks\n* 2nd half of 2004: installation of the pylons and shrouds, removal of the temporary roadway supports\n* 14 December 2004: official inauguration<ref name=BBC-Dec2004/>\n* 16 December 2004: opening of the viaduct, ahead of schedule\n* 10 January 2005: initial planned opening date\n\n[[File:Panorama Viadukt von Millau 2004 A75 Viaduc Viaduct 2460 m lang max 343 m Dep Aveyron Frankreich France - Foto Wolfgang Pehlemann DSC08281.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|<center>Panorama Millau Viaduct</center>]]\n\n===Construction records===\nThe construction Millau Viaduct broke several records:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n* The highest pylons in the world: pylons P2 and P3, {{convert|244.96|m|ftin}} and {{convert|221.05|m|ftin}} in height respectively, broke the French record previously held by the [[Tulle]] and [[Verri\u00e8res, Aveyron|Verri\u00e8res]] viaducts ({{convert|141|m|ft|disp=or}}), and the world record previously held by the [[Kochertalbr\u00fccke|Kochertal Viaduct]] (Germany), which is {{convert|181|m|ft}} at its highest;\n* The highest bridge tower in the world: the mast atop pylon P2 peaks at {{convert|336.4|m|ft}};\n* The highest road bridge deck in Europe, {{convert|270|m|ft}} above the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]] at its highest point; it is nearly twice as tall as the previous tallest vehicular bridges in Europe, the [[Europabr\u00fccke]] in [[Austria]] and the [[Italia Viaduct]] in [[Italy]]. It is slightly higher than the [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in [[West Virginia]] in the [[United States]], which is {{convert|267|m|ft}} above the [[New River (West Virginia)|New River]].\n\nSince opening in 2004, the deck height of Millau has been surpassed by several suspension bridges in China, including [[Sidu River Bridge]], [[Baling River Bridge]], and two spans ([[Beipan River Guanxing Highway Bridge]] and [[Beipan River Hukun Expressway Bridge]]) over the Beipan River. In 2012, Mexico's [[Baluarte Bridge]] surpassed Millau as the world's highest cable-stayed bridge. The [[Royal Gorge Bridge|Royal Gorge suspension bridge]] in the U.S. state of Colorado is also higher, with a bridge deck approximately {{convert|291|m|ft}} over the [[Arkansas River]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Viaduc de Millau 1.jpg|thumb|800px|center|The Millau Viaduct, and the town of [[Millau]] on the right]]\nThe Millau Viaduct is on the territory of the [[communes of France|communes]] of [[Millau]] and [[Creissels]], France, in the ''[[departments of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Aveyron]]. Before the bridge was constructed, traffic had to descend into the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]] valley and pass along the [[route nationale]] [[Route nationale 9|N9]] near the town of Millau, causing mch traffic congestion at the beginning and end of the July and August [[holiday season]]. The bridge now traverses the Tarn valley above its lowest point, linking two [[limestone]] [[plateaus]], the Causse du [[Larzac]] and the {{interlanguage link|Causse Rouge|fr}}, and is inside the perimeter of the [[Grands Causses]] regional natural park.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe Millau Viaduct forms the last link of the existing [[E11 A75 autoroute|A75]] [[Autoroutes of France|autoroute]]<ref name=BBC-Nov2003/> (known as \"la M\u00e9ridienne), from [[Clermont-Ferrand]] to [[P\u00e9zenas]] (to be extended to [[B\u00e9ziers]] by 2010). The A75, with the A10 and A71, provides a continuous high-speed route south from [[Paris]] through [[Clermont-Ferrand]] to the [[Languedoc]] region, thence to [[Spain]], considerably reducing the cost and time of vehicle traffic travelling along this route.

It comprises eight [[span (engineering)|spans]]. The six central spans measure {{convert|342|m|ft}}, and the two outer spans are {{convert|204|m|ft}}. These are composed of 173 central box beams, the spinal column of the construction, onto which the lateral floors and the lateral box beams were [[welding|welded]]. The central box beams have a {{convert|4|m|ftin}} cross-section, and a length of {{convert|15|\u2013|22|m }} for a total weight of {{convert|90|metric ton|short ton|lk=on}}. The deck has an inverse [[airfoil]] shape, providing negative lift in strong wind conditions.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Masts===\nThe seven masts, each {{convert|87|m|ft|lk=on}} high, and weighing around {{convert|700|tonne|ton|lk=on}}, are set on top of the concrete pylons. Between each of them, eleven stays (metal cables) are anchored, providing support for the road deck.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Cable stays===\nEach mast of the Viaduct is equipped with a monoaxial layer of eleven pairs of cable-stays; laid face to face. Depending on their length, the cable stays were made of 55 to 91 high tensile [[steel]] cables, or strands, themselves formed of seven strands of steel (a central strand with six intertwined strands). Each strand has triple protection against [[corrosion]] ([[galvanisation]], a coating of petroleum wax, and an extruded [[polyethylene]] sheath). The exterior envelope of the stays is itself coated along its entire length with a double helical weatherstrip. The idea is to avoid running water which, in high winds, could cause vibration{{dubious|date=January 2015}} in the stays and compromise the stability of the viaduct.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe stays were installed by the [[Freyssinet]] company.\n\n===Road surface===\nTo allow for deformations of the metal road deck under traffic, a special surface of modified [[bitumen]] was installed by research teams from {{interlanguage link|Appia (company)|fr|Eiffage Infrastructures}}. The surface is somewhat flexible to adapt to deformations in the steel deck without cracking, but it must nevertheless have sufficient strength to withstand motorway conditions (fatigue, density, texture, adherence, anti-rutting etc.). The 'ideal formula' was found after two years of research.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.brueckenweb.de/datenbank/dokumente/kostenfrei/BAS3800_journal10.pdf|title=A specific surfacing extensively tested!|journal=Le Viaduc de Millau|publisher=Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau|page=3|date=4 November 2004|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Electrical installations===\nThe [[electrical installation]]s of the viaduct are large in proportion to the size of the bridge. There are {{convert|30|km|mi}} of high-current cables, {{convert|20|km|mi}} of [[fibre optic]]s, {{convert|10|km|mi}} of low-current cables, and 357 telephone sockets; allowing maintenance teams to communicate with each other and with the command post. These are situated on the deck, on the pylons, and on the masts.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe pylons, road deck, masts, and cable stays are equipped with a multitude of sensors to enable [[structural health monitoring]]. These are designed to detect the slightest movement in the Viaduct, and measure its resistance to wear-and-tear over time. [[Anemometer]]s, [[accelerometer]]s, [[inclinometer]]s, temperature sensors are all used for the instrumentation network.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nTwelve [[fibre optic]] [[extensometer]]s were installed in the base of pylon P2. Being the tallest of all, it is therefore under the most intense [[Stress (physics)|stress]]. These sensors detect movements on the order of a [[micrometre]]. Other extensometers, electrical this time, are distributed on top of P2 and P7. This apparatus is capable of taking up to 100 readings per second. In high winds, they continuously monitor the reactions of the Viaduct to extreme conditions. Accelerometers placed strategically on the road deck monitor the [[oscillation]]s that can affect the metal structure. Displacements of the deck on the abutment level are measured to the nearest millimetre. The cable stays are also instrumented, and their ageing meticulously analysed. Additionally, two [[piezoelectric sensors]] gather traffic data: [[weight]] of vehicles, [[average speed]], density of the flow of traffic, etc. This system can distinguish between fourteen different types of vehicle.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe data is transmitted by an [[Ethernet]] [[computer network|network]] to a [[computer]] in the [[Information technology|IT]] room at the management building situated near the [[toll plaza]].\n\n===Toll plaza===\nThe [[toll plaza]] is on the [[A75 autoroute]]; the bridge toll booths and the buildings for the commercial and technical management teams are situated {{convert|4|km|mi}} north of the viaduct. The toll plaza is protected by a canopy in the shape of a leaf, formed from tendrilled [[concrete]], using the [[ceracem process]]. Consisting of 53 elements ([[voussoir]]s), the canopy is {{convert|100|m|ft}} long and {{convert|28|m|ft}} wide. It weighs around {{convert|2500|tonne|ton|lk=on}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe toll plaza can accommodate sixteen lanes of traffic, eight in each direction. At times of low [[traffic volume]], the central booth is capable of servicing vehicles in both directions. A [[car park]] and viewing station, equipped with public toilets, is situated at each side of the toll plaza.

A method of bypassing Millau had long been considered, not only to ease the flow and reduce journey times for long distance traffic, but also to improve the quality of access to Millau for its local businesses and residents. One of the solutions considered was the construction of a road [[bridge]] to span the river and gorge valley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.BBC.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/europe_the_millau_bridge/html/2.stm|title=The Millau Bridge, page 2|website=news.BBC.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date= |accessdate= }}</ref> The first plans for a bridge were discussed in 1987 by [[CETE]], and by October 1991 the decision was made to build a high crossing of the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]] by a structure of around {{convert|2500|m}} in length. During 1993\u20131994, the [[Government of France|government]] consulted with seven [[architect]]s and eight [[structural engineer]]s. During 1995\u20131996, a second definition study was made by five associated architect groups and structural engineers. In January 1995, the government issued a declaration of public interest to solicit design approaches for a competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.LegiFrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000551657|title=D\u00e9cret du 10 janvier 1995|website=LegiFrance.gouv.fr|publisher= |language=French|quote=d\u00e9clarant d'utilit\u00e9 publique les travaux de construction des sections de [[A75 autoroute|l'autoroute A 75]] comprises entre le [[Engayresque]] et [[Lasparets]] (mise aux normes autorouti\u00e8res du P.R. 23,520 au P.R. 26,580), entre Lasparets et La Cavalerie Sud (du P.R. 26,580 au P.R. 66,820) y compris les voies de raccordement \u00e0 [[Saint-Germain-Lembron|Saint-Germain]] (R.D. 911), \u00e0 la C\u00f4te rouge (R.D. 999) et \u00e0 La Cavalerie (R.N. 9), de l'\u00e9changeur d'Engayresque, des aires de repos, de la section de route \u00e0 cr\u00e9er pour assurer la continuit\u00e9 de l'itin\u00e9raire de substitution d'Engayresque \u00e0 Lasparets ainsi que des mesures d'accompagnement sur cet itin\u00e9raire \u00e0 [[Aguessac]] et \u00e0 [[Millau]], classant dans la cat\u00e9gorie des autoroutes l'ensemble de la voie comprise entre l'\u00e9changeur d'Engayresque et La Cavalerie Sud (du P.R. 22,700 au P.R. 66,820) dans le d\u00e9partement de l'[[Aveyron]] et portant mise en compatibilit\u00e9 des plans d'occupation des sols des communes d'Aguessac, Millau, [[Creissels]] et [[Saint-Georges-de-Luzen\u00e7on]]|accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nIn July 1996 the jury decided in favour of a [[Cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] design with multiple spans, as proposed by the [[Sogelerg]] consortium led by [[Michel Virlogeux]] and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]. The decision to proceed by grant of contract was made in May 1998; then in June 2000, the contest for the [[construction contract]] was launched, open to four consortia.

Although this option was shorter and better suited to through traffic, it did not satisfactorily serve the needs of Millau and its area.\n# Great Western ({{lang-fr|grand Ouest}}) (<span style=\"color:#fff; background:#000\">&nbsp;black route&nbsp;</span>) \u2014 longer than the eastern option by {{convert|12|km|mi}}, following the [[Cernon valley]]. Technically easier (requiring four viaducts), this solution was judged to have negative impacts on the environment, in particular on the picturesque villages of [[Peyre, Aveyron|Peyre]] and Saint-Georges-de-Luzen\u00e7on.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It was more expensive than the preceding option, and served the region badly.\n# Near RN9 ({{lang-fr|proche de la RN9}}) (<span style=background:#F88>&nbsp;red route&nbsp;</span>) \u2014 would have served the town of Millau well, but presented technical difficulties,{{clarify|date=April 2017}} and would have had a strong impact on existing or planned structures.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n# Intermediate ({{lang-fr|m\u00e9diane}}), west of Millau (<span style=background:#9AF>&nbsp;blue route&nbsp;</span>) \u2014 was supported by local opinion, but presented geological difficulties, notably on the question of crossing the valley of the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]]. Expert investigation concluded that these obstacles were not insurmountable.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe fourth option was selected by [[ministerial decree]] on 28 June 1989.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">''Le viaduc de Millau : un ouvrage exceptionnel initi\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9quipement'', op. cit., p.4</ref> It encompassed two possibilities:\n# the high solution, envisaging a {{convert|2500|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} viaduct more than {{convert|200|m|ft}} above the river;\n# the low solution, descending into the valley and crossing the river on a {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} bridge, then a viaduct of {{convert|2300|m|ft}}, extended by a tunnel on the [[Larzac]] side.\n\nAfter long construction studies by the Ministry of Public Works, the low solution was abandoned because it would have intersected the [[water table]], had a negative impact on the town, cost more, and lengthened the driving distance. The choice of the 'high' solution was decided by ministerial decree on 29 October 1991.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\nAfter the choice of the high viaduct, five teams of [[architect]]s and [[researcher]]s worked on a technical solution. The concept and design for the bridge was devised by French [[design]]er and structural engineer [[Michel Virlogeux|Dr Michel Virlogeux]]. He worked with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] engineering firm [[Arcadis]], responsible for the [[structural engineering]] of the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ARCADIS.nl/Pers/archive/Pages/ARCADIStekendevoorhoogstebrugterwereld.aspx|title=ARCADIS tekende voor hoogste brug ter wereld|website=ARCADIS.nl|publisher=[[Arcadis NV|ARCADIS NV]]|date=13 December 2004|language=nl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119154613/http://www.arcadis.nl/Pers/archive/Pages/ARCADIStekendevoorhoogstebrugterwereld.aspx|archivedate=19 November 2008|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Choosing the definitive route===\n[[File:Millau trac\u00e9.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the proposed route before construction of the bridge]]\nThe 'high solution' required the construction of a {{convert|2500|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} [[viaduct]]. From 1991 to 1993, the structures division of [[S\u00e9tra]], directed by [[Michel Virlogeux]], carried out preliminary studies, and examined the feasibility of a single structure spanning the valley. Taking into account technical, architectural, and financial issues, the Administration of Roads opened the question for competition among structural engineers and [[architect]]s to widen the search for realistic designs. By July 1993, seventeen structural engineers and thirty-eight architects applied as candidates for the preliminary studies. With the assistance of a multidisciplinary commission, the Administration of Roads selected eight structural engineers for a technical study, and seven architects for the architectural study.\n\n===Choice of technical design===\nSimultaneously, a school of international experts representing a wide spectrum of expertise (technical, architectural, and landscape), chaired by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Coste, was established to clarify the choices that had to be made.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In February 1995, on the basis of proposals of the architects and structural engineers, and with support of the school of experts, five general designs were identified.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe competition was relaunched: five combinations of architects and structural engineers, drawn from the best candidates of the first phase, were formed; each was to conduct in-depth studies of one of the general designs. On 15 July 1996, [[Bernard Pons]], minister of Public Works, announced the decision of the jury, which was constituted of elected artists and experts, and chaired by Christian Leyrit, the director of highways. The solution of a multiple-span [[viaduct]] [[cable-stayed bridge]], presented by the structural engineering group Sogelerg, Europe Etudes Gecti and Serf, and the architects [[Foster + Partners]] was declared the best.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nDetailed studies were carried out by the successful consortium, steered by the highways authority until mid-1998. After undergoing [[Wind tunnel|wind tunnel tests]], the shape of the road deck was altered, and detailed corrections were made to the design of the [[Tower#Transportation support|pylons]]. When the details were eventually finalised, the whole design was approved in late 1998.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Contractors===\n[[File:Viaduc-Millau Pile-P2 Eiffel.svg|thumb|The P2 pier of the [[Viaduct]] is the tallest structure in France, 23&nbsp;m taller than the [[Eiffel Tower]]]]\nOnce the Ministry of Public Works had taken the decision to offer the construction and operation of the [[viaduct]] as a grant of contract, an international call for tenders was issued in 1999. Five consortia tendered:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n# Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau (CEVM), a new [[subsidiary]] created by [[Eiffage]];\n# PAECH Construction Enterprise, Poland;\n# a consortium led by the Spanish company [[Grupo ACS|Dragados]], with [[Skanska]], [[Sweden]], and Bec, France;\n# Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Viaduc de Millau, including the French companies ASF, Egis Projects, GTM Construction, [[Bouygues|Bouygues Travaux Publics]], SGE, CDC Projets, Tofinso, and the [[Italy|Italian]] company Autostrade;\n# a consortium led by G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Routi\u00e8re, with Via GTI (France) and [[Cintra]], Nesco, [[Acciona]], and [[Ferrovial|Ferrovial Agroman]] ([[Spain]]).\n\n[[Pier]]s were built with [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] high performance concrete.

A further advantage of this process was to make negotiating the contract easier, reducing public expense, and speeding up construction, while minimising such design work as remained for the contractor.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAll the member companies of the [[Eiffage]] group had some role in the construction work. The construction consortium was made up of the Eiffage TP company for the concrete part, the [[Eiffel company]] for the steel roadway ([[Gustave Eiffel]] built the [[Garabit viaduct]] in 1884, a railway bridge in the neighbouring [[Cantal]] ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]''), and the [[Enerpac]] company<ref name=Enerpac>{{cite web|url=http://www.Enerpac.com/html/Projects/Millau/Millau_Closed.html|title=Final hydraulic launch successfully closes last gap in the Millau Viaduct in the south of France|website=Enerpac.com|publisher=[[Enerpac]], [[Actuant Corporation]]|date=28 May 2004|accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref> for the roadway's hydraulic supports.

Opponents advanced several arguments:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n* The westernmost route would be better, longer by {{convert|3|km}}, but a third of the cost with its three more conventional structures.\n* The objective of the viaduct would not be achieved; because of the toll, the viaduct would be little used, and the project would not solve Millau's congestion problems.\n* The project would never break even; toll income would never amortise the initial investment, and the contractor would have to be supported by subsidies.\n* The technical difficulties were too great, and the bridge would be dangerous and unsustainable; the pylons, sitting on the [[shale]] of the Tarn Valley, would not support the structure adequately.\n* The viaduct represented a detour, reducing the number of visitors passing through Millau and slowing its economy.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Millau Viaduct construction south.jpg|thumb|300px|The viaduct under construction, seen from the south in early 2004]]\nTwo weeks after the laying of the first stone on December 14, 2001, the workers started digging the deep shafts. There were four shafts per pylon; {{convert|15|m|ft}} deep and {{convert|5|m|ft}} in diameter, assuring the stability of the pylons. At the bottom of each pylon, a tread of {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|0}} in thickness was installed to reinforce the effect of the deep shafts. The {{convert|2000|m3|cuyd}} of concrete necessary for the treads was poured at the same time.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn March 2002, the pylons emerged from the ground. The speed of construction then rapidly increased. Every three days, each pylon increased in height by {{convert|4|m|ft}}. This performance was mainly due to [[Climbing formwork|sliding shuttering]]. Thanks to a system of shoe anchorages and fixed rails in the heart of the pylons, a new layer of concrete could be poured every 20 minutes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe bridge road deck was constructed on land at the ends of the Viaduct, and rolled lengthwise from one pylon to the next, with eight temporary towers providing additional support. The movement was accomplished by a computer-controlled system of pairs of wedges under the deck; the upper and lower wedges of each pair pointing in opposite directions. These were hydraulically operated, and moved repeatedly in the following sequence: the lower wedge slides under the upper wedge, raising it to the roadway above, and then forcing the upper wedge still higher to lift the roadway. Both wedges move forward together, advancing the roadway a short distance. The lower wedge retracts from under the upper wedge, lowering the roadway and allowing the upper wedge to drop away from the roadway; the lower wedge then moves back all the way to its starting position. There is now a linear distance between the two wedges equal to the distance forward the roadway has just moved. The upper wedge moves backward, placing it further back along the roadway, adjacent to the front tip of the lower wedge and ready to repeat the cycle and advance the roadway by another increment. It worked at {{convert|600|mm|in}} per cycle which was roughly four minutes long.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe mast pieces were driven over the new road deck lying down horizontally. The pieces were joined to form the one complete mast, still lying horizontally. The mast was then tilted upwards, as one piece, at one time in a tricky operation. In this way, each mast was erected on top of the corresponding concrete pylon. The stays connecting the masts and the deck were then installed, and the bridge was tensioned overall, and weight tested. After this, the temporary pylons could be removed.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Timeline===\n* 16 October 2001: work begins\n* 14 December 2001: laying of the first stone\n* January 2002: laying pier foundations\n* March 2002: start of work on the pier support C8\n* June 2002: support C8 completed, start of work on piers\n* July 2002: start of work on the foundations of temporary, height adjustable roadway supports\n* August 2002: start of work on pier support C0\n* September 2002: assembly of roadway begins\n* November 2002: first piers complete\n* 25\u201326 February 2003: laying of first pieces of roadway\n* November 2003: completion of the last piers (piers P2 at {{convert|245|m|ft}} and P3 at {{convert|221|m|ft}} are the highest piers in the world)\n* 28 May 2004: the pieces of roadway are several centimetres apart, their juncture to be accomplished within two weeks\n* 2nd half of 2004: installation of the pylons and shrouds, removal of the temporary roadway supports\n* 14 December 2004: official inauguration<ref name=BBC-Dec2004/>\n* 16 December 2004: opening of the viaduct, ahead of schedule\n* 10 January 2005: initial planned opening date\n\n[[File:Panorama Viadukt von Millau 2004 A75 Viaduc Viaduct 2460 m lang max 343 m Dep Aveyron Frankreich France - Foto Wolfgang Pehlemann DSC08281.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|<center>Panorama Millau Viaduct</center>]]\n\n===Construction records===\nThe construction Millau Viaduct broke several records:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n* The highest pylons in the world: pylons P2 and P3, {{convert|244.96|m|ftin}} and {{convert|221.05|m|ftin}} in height respectively, broke the French record previously held by the [[Tulle]] and [[Verri\u00e8res, Aveyron|Verri\u00e8res]] viaducts ({{convert|141|m|ft|disp=or}}), and the world record previously held by the [[Kochertalbr\u00fccke|Kochertal Viaduct]] (Germany), which is {{convert|181|m|ft}} at its highest;\n* The highest bridge tower in the world: the mast atop pylon P2 peaks at {{convert|336.4|m|ft}};\n* The highest road bridge deck in Europe, {{convert|270|m|ft}} above the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]] at its highest point; it is nearly twice as tall as the previous tallest vehicular bridges in Europe, the [[Europabr\u00fccke]] in [[Austria]] and the [[Italia Viaduct]] in [[Italy]]. It is slightly higher than the [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in [[West Virginia]] in the [[United States]], which is {{convert|267|m|ft}} above the [[New River (West Virginia)|New River]].\n\nSince opening in 2004, the deck height of Millau has been surpassed by several suspension bridges in China, including [[Sidu River Bridge]], [[Baling River Bridge]], and two spans ([[Beipan River Guanxing Highway Bridge]] and [[Beipan River Hukun Expressway Bridge]]) over the Beipan River. In 2012, Mexico's [[Baluarte Bridge]] surpassed Millau as the world's highest cable-stayed bridge. The [[Royal Gorge Bridge|Royal Gorge suspension bridge]] in the U.S. state of Colorado is also higher, with a bridge deck approximately {{convert|291|m|ft}} over the [[Arkansas River]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Viaduc de Millau 1.jpg|thumb|800px|center|The Millau Viaduct, and the town of [[Millau]] on the right]]\nThe Millau Viaduct is on the territory of the [[communes of France|communes]] of [[Millau]] and [[Creissels]], France, in the ''[[departments of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Aveyron]]. Before the bridge was constructed, traffic had to descend into the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]] valley and pass along the [[route nationale]] [[Route nationale 9|N9]] near the town of Millau, causing mch traffic congestion at the beginning and end of the July and August [[holiday season]]. The bridge now traverses the Tarn valley above its lowest point, linking two [[limestone]] [[plateaus]], the Causse du [[Larzac]] and the {{interlanguage link|Causse Rouge|fr}}, and is inside the perimeter of the [[Grands Causses]] regional natural park.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe Millau Viaduct forms the last link of the existing [[E11 A75 autoroute|A75]] [[Autoroutes of France|autoroute]]<ref name=BBC-Nov2003/> (known as \"la M\u00e9ridienne), from [[Clermont-Ferrand]] to [[P\u00e9zenas]] (to be extended to [[B\u00e9ziers]] by 2010). The A75, with the A10 and A71, provides a continuous high-speed route south from [[Paris]] through [[Clermont-Ferrand]] to the [[Languedoc]] region, thence to [[Spain]], considerably reducing the cost and time of vehicle traffic travelling along this route. Many tourists heading to southern [[France]] and [[Spain]] follow this route because it is direct and without [[toll road|tolls]] for the {{convert|340|km|mi}} between Clermont-Ferrand and P\u00e9zenas, except for the bridge.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe [[Eiffage]] group, which constructed the Viaduct  also operates it, under a government contract, which allows the company to collect tolls for up to 75 years.<ref name=BBC-Dec2004/><ref name=BBC-Nov2003/> As of 2018, the [[toll bridge]] costs [[Euro|\u20ac]]8.30 for light automobiles (\u20ac10.40 during the peak season of 15 June to 15 September).<ref name=TollRates>{{cite web |url=https://www.leviaducdemillau.com/en/getting-around/toll-charges |title=Toll charges \u2013 Getting around |publisher=Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau |accessdate=19 August 2018 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n===Pylons and abutments===\nEach of the seven pylons<ref name=BBC-Nov2003/> is supported by four deep shafts, {{convert|15|m|ft|lk=on}} deep and {{convert|5|m|ft}} in diameter.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; width:600px; text-align:center\"\n|+heights of the piers\n!P1!!P2!!P3!!P4!!P5!!P6!!P7\n|-\n|{{convert|94.501|m|ftin|1|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|244.96|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|221.05|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|144.21|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|136.42|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|111.94|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|77.56|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|}\n[[File:Viaduc de Millau (7).jpg|thumb|A pylon under construction]]\n\nThe [[abutment]]s are concrete structures that provide anchorage for the road deck to the ground in the [[Causse du Larzac]] and the Causse Rouge.\n\n===Road deck===\nThe metallic road deck, which appears very light despite its total mass of around {{convert|36000|tonne|short ton|lk=on}}, is {{convert|2460|m|ft}} long and {{convert|32|m|ftin}} wide. It comprises eight [[span (engineering)|spans]]. The six central spans measure {{convert|342|m|ft}}, and the two outer spans are {{convert|204|m|ft}}. These are composed of 173 central box beams, the spinal column of the construction, onto which the lateral floors and the lateral box beams were [[welding|welded]]. The central box beams have a {{convert|4|m|ftin}} cross-section, and a length of {{convert|15|\u2013|22|m }} for a total weight of {{convert|90|metric ton|short ton|lk=on}}. The deck has an inverse [[airfoil]] shape, providing negative lift in strong wind conditions.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Masts===\nThe seven masts, each {{convert|87|m|ft|lk=on}} high, and weighing around {{convert|700|tonne|ton|lk=on}}, are set on top of the concrete pylons. Between each of them, eleven stays (metal cables) are anchored, providing support for the road deck.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Cable stays===\nEach mast of the Viaduct is equipped with a monoaxial layer of eleven pairs of cable-stays; laid face to face. Depending on their length, the cable stays were made of 55 to 91 high tensile [[steel]] cables, or strands, themselves formed of seven strands of steel (a central strand with six intertwined strands). Each strand has triple protection against [[corrosion]] ([[galvanisation]], a coating of petroleum wax, and an extruded [[polyethylene]] sheath). The exterior envelope of the stays is itself coated along its entire length with a double helical weatherstrip. The idea is to avoid running water which, in high winds, could cause vibration{{dubious|date=January 2015}} in the stays and compromise the stability of the viaduct.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe stays were installed by the [[Freyssinet]] company.\n\n===Road surface===\nTo allow for deformations of the metal road deck under traffic, a special surface of modified [[bitumen]] was installed by research teams from {{interlanguage link|Appia (company)|fr|Eiffage Infrastructures}}. The surface is somewhat flexible to adapt to deformations in the steel deck without cracking, but it must nevertheless have sufficient strength to withstand motorway conditions (fatigue, density, texture, adherence, anti-rutting etc.). The 'ideal formula' was found after two years of research.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.brueckenweb.de/datenbank/dokumente/kostenfrei/BAS3800_journal10.pdf|title=A specific surfacing extensively tested!|journal=Le Viaduc de Millau|publisher=Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau|page=3|date=4 November 2004|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Electrical installations===\nThe [[electrical installation]]s of the viaduct are large in proportion to the size of the bridge. There are {{convert|30|km|mi}} of high-current cables, {{convert|20|km|mi}} of [[fibre optic]]s, {{convert|10|km|mi}} of low-current cables, and 357 telephone sockets; allowing maintenance teams to communicate with each other and with the command post. These are situated on the deck, on the pylons, and on the masts.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe pylons, road deck, masts, and cable stays are equipped with a multitude of sensors to enable [[structural health monitoring]]. These are designed to detect the slightest movement in the Viaduct, and measure its resistance to wear-and-tear over time. [[Anemometer]]s, [[accelerometer]]s, [[inclinometer]]s, temperature sensors are all used for the instrumentation network.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nTwelve [[fibre optic]] [[extensometer]]s were installed in the base of pylon P2. Being the tallest of all, it is therefore under the most intense [[Stress (physics)|stress]]. These sensors detect movements on the order of a [[micrometre]]. Other extensometers, electrical this time, are distributed on top of P2 and P7. This apparatus is capable of taking up to 100 readings per second. In high winds, they continuously monitor the reactions of the Viaduct to extreme conditions. Accelerometers placed strategically on the road deck monitor the [[oscillation]]s that can affect the metal structure. Displacements of the deck on the abutment level are measured to the nearest millimetre. The cable stays are also instrumented, and their ageing meticulously analysed. Additionally, two [[piezoelectric sensors]] gather traffic data: [[weight]] of vehicles, [[average speed]], density of the flow of traffic, etc. This system can distinguish between fourteen different types of vehicle.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe data is transmitted by an [[Ethernet]] [[computer network|network]] to a [[computer]] in the [[Information technology|IT]] room at the management building situated near the [[toll plaza]].\n\n===Toll plaza===\nThe [[toll plaza]] is on the [[A75 autoroute]]; the bridge toll booths and the buildings for the commercial and technical management teams are situated {{convert|4|km|mi}} north of the viaduct. The toll plaza is protected by a canopy in the shape of a leaf, formed from tendrilled [[concrete]], using the [[ceracem process]]. Consisting of 53 elements ([[voussoir]]s), the canopy is {{convert|100|m|ft}} long and {{convert|28|m|ft}} wide. It weighs around {{convert|2500|tonne|ton|lk=on}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe toll plaza can accommodate sixteen lanes of traffic, eight in each direction. At times of low [[traffic volume]], the central booth is capable of servicing vehicles in both directions. A [[car park]] and viewing station, equipped with public toilets, is situated at each side of the toll plaza.

Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end markets. Video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings. Gaming PCs are often also suitable for other intensive tasks, like video editing.<ref>{{cite web |last=D. |first=Pablo |url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO/ |title=GPU battle: 4670 vs. 9600GSO |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2011-01-21 |publisher=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120224434/http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO |archive-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are frequently custom-assembled, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies that specialize in producing custom gaming machines. In order to generate interest, gaming computer manufacturers that sell complete systems often produce boutique models, allowing them to compete on aesthetic design in addition to the hardware inside.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, gaming computers had several distinct hardware components that set them apart from a typical PC. The push for better graphics began with color fidelity, from display systems such as [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] eventually graduating to [[VGA]], which was adopted for the mass market. Gaming also led the push for the adoption of [[sound card]]s, a component that is now commonly integrated onto [[motherboard]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, several non-[[IBM PC compatible]] platforms gained a measure of popularity due to advanced graphics and sound capabilities, starting with the Atari 400/800 and the TI 99/4, and then continuing with others such as the [[Commodore 64]] and eventually the [[Amiga]]. [[Video game developer]]s of the time targeted these platforms for their games, though typically they would later port their games to the more common PC and Apple platforms as well. The [[MSX]] was also popular in Japan, where it preceded the [[video game console]] revolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Most Popular Computers in History|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/10-most-popular-computers-in-history.htm#page=3|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=Discovery|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> Japan also had several other popular gaming computers during the 1980s to early 1990s, including the very popular [[PC-88]] and [[PC-98]] as well as the powerful [[X68000]] and [[FM Towns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm |title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nBy 1993, PC-compatibles were the standard for gaming in the US.

This equipment is now commonly used by non-gamers with [[broadband Internet access]] to share the connection with multiple computers in the home. Like sound cards, network adapters are now commonly integrated onto motherboards.\n\nIn modern times, the primary difference between a gaming computer and a comparable mainstream PC is the inclusion of a performance-oriented [[video card]], which hosts a [[graphics processor]] and dedicated memory. These are generally a requirement to play modern games on the market.\n\nForays into [[physics processing]] have also been made, though with [[Nvidia]]'s buyout of [[PhysX]]<ref>{{cite web|title=NVIDIA completes Acquisition of AGEIA Technologies|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1202895129984.html|publisher=Nvidia Corporation|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>  and [[Intel]]'s buyout of [[Havok (software)|Havok]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Intel wreaks Havok for $110M|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/intel-wreaks-havok-for-110m/1100-6178911/|work=Gamespot.com|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> plans are that this functionality will be combined with existing CPU or GPU technologies.\n\n==Custom-built gaming computers==\nBy 2012, it had become increasingly popular for [[gamer]]s to custom-build their own PC, allowing for more budget control and easier upgradability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/dell_drop_kicks_proprietary_parts|title=Dell Drop Kicks Proprietary Parts|publisher=PCWorld|accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref> More often than not, it is possible to maximize performance for the best value when building a gaming computer. There are several components that must be considered when building a gaming computer, which include [[CPU]]s, [[RAM|memory]], a [[motherboard]], [[video card]]s, [[solid-state drive]]s, [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]], and [[Computer chassis|cases]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-a-gaming-pc-parts-youll-need-where-to-buy-them-2016-12/|title=Building your own gaming PC is incredibly rewarding \u2014 here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen building a custom-built gaming PC, builders usually turn to independent benchmarks to help make their hardware selection. Organizations such as [[AnandTech]] and [[Tom's Hardware Guide]] provide such benchmarks and hardware reviews. The benchmarks include ratings for PC components that are necessary to build a gaming computer. It is also crucial to consider [[computer cooling]], as this is required to remove the [[waste heat]] produced by a computer's components.\n\n===Video cards===\n[[File:NVIDIA-GTX-1070-FoundersEdition-FL.jpg|thumb|225px|An example of an [[NVIDIA]] GPU ([[GeForce 10 series]]).]]\nA [[video card]] is essential to any gaming computer, and connects to a motherboard using the [[PCI Express|Peripheral Component Interconnect Express]] (PCI Express or PCI-E). There are two major manufacturers of GPUs for a gaming computer, [[AMD]] and [[NVIDIA]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-graphics-cards/|title=The best graphics card|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> These companies provide GPUs which other companies, such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] and [[ASUS]], then design circuit boards and cooling shrouds for.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most video cards cost from $200 to $2,000. Modern consumer-grade CPUs often have on-[[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] [[Integrated graphics|integrated GPUs]]; however, these GPUs typically do not provide the adequate performance for playing graphics-intensive games, and are instead aimed primarily for less demanding workloads such as [[graphical user interface]] rendering for \"everyday\" tasks, video playback, and [[Casual game|light gaming]].\n\n===Processors===\nA major component of a gaming computer is the processor, or [[Central processing unit|CPU (central processing unit)]]. There are two major brands that manufacture CPUs, [[AMD]] and [[Intel]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-pc-gaming-cpus-processors/|title=The best PC gaming processor|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> As of 2019, most gaming computers are built with Intel's [[Ice Lake (microarchitecture)|Ice Lake]] or AMD's [[Zen 2|Ryzen 2]] CPUs.<ref name=\":1\" /> While a powerful CPU is important to avoid [[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]], after a certain level of CPU power, diminishing returns become evident if the PC is not being used for other, more CPU-intensive purposes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Motherboards===\n[[Motherboard]]s that are designed for gaming computers are differentiated from their normal counterparts by being created with case windows in mind; having more visually appealing designs, sturdier materials, and, in some models, built-in [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-motherboards/|title=The best gaming motherboards|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> They also have the capability to [[Overclocking|overclock]] certain models of CPUs, and an increased number of various connection ports.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Memory===\n[[Random-access memory]] (RAM) is one of the most important components for a gaming computer. Computers designed for playing games often are supplied with a high amount of RAM.\n\n==== DDR memory ====\n[[Double data rate|DDR]] (double data rate) [[Computer memory|memory]] is essential for any computer system. Adding more memory allows the CPU to address more data for it to quickly access instead of reading off a comparatively slow disk drive or [[solid-state storage device]]. [[DDR SDRAM]] also has much lower latency than its GDDR counterpart and much lower bandwidth as the CPU relies on being able to change small amounts of data quickly. The latest standard of DDR memory is DDR4L.\n\n==== GDDR memory ====\nGDDR (graphical double data rate) memory is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card and is built directly onto the card itself. The amount of RAM built onto a graphics card allows the GPU to quickly access data such as textures instead of reading from a much slower storage device. Having more GDDR memory allows the system to handle higher levels of [[spatial anti-aliasing]] and more complex textures. GDDR memory has a much higher latency when compared to DDR memory but also has a much larger bandwidth, thus allowing the GPU to deal with larger amounts of data at a slower rate when compared to a CPU. The latest revision of GDDR memory is GDDR6.\n\n==== High bandwidth memory (HBM) ====\n[[High Bandwidth Memory|HBM]] is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card, and is placed directly beside the GPU itself on the graphics card. This is different from standard GDDR as standard GDDR memory sits on the PCB of the graphics card. The main advantages of having the memory mounted so close to the GPU itself are as follows; reduced latency due to signals traveling a shorter distance, more bandwidth due to more space for data lanes, and decreased power consumption due to inherent differences to GDDR on the microscopic level. The latest revision of HBM is HBM2.\n\n===Solid-state drives===\n[[Solid-state drive]]s (SSD) are a newer form of data storage that is gaining in popularity. The more common and traditional [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs in favor of the advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to operating specifications. An SSD can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD. For an SSD, files open almost instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |title=SSD Drive vs Hard Drive |publisher=Gaming Laptop |access-date=2015-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222141728/http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |archive-date=2015-02-22 |df= }}</ref> This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santo |first=Joel |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404260,00.asp |title=Advantages/Disadvantages - SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference? |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order to load items from the game such as level files and texture images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |title=Computer memory articles for SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM from |publisher=Crucial.com |date= |access-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203003057/http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-03 |df= }}</ref> However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost-effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs.\n\n===Power supply units===\nAlthough occasionally overlooked, the power supply unit (PSU) is still an important component to consider. The wattage needed to run a system is dependent on the hardware, so often a PSU calculator is used to determine the wattage needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Power-Supply |title=How to Buy a Power Supply: 7 Steps (with Pictures) |publisher=wikiHow |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> In addition, future upgrades to a gaming rig will possibly require more power, and PSUs lose power as they age, so it is often a good idea to buy a PSU that has the capability of lasting through several years and upgrades. The PSU must also be compatible with the other hardware\npieces.\n\nThere are two types of PSUs, modular PSUs (MPSU) and non-modular PSUs. Non-modular PSUs come with fixed cables, meaning unused ones will be left unconnected. Modular power supplies have cables that are detachable so unused cables do not create excess clutter but are often more expensive than their non-modular counterparts.<ref name=\"support.nzxt.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://support.nzxt.com/hc/en-us/articles/202798380-Full-Vs-Semi-Vs-Non-Modular-What-Are-The-Differences-|title=Full Vs Semi Vs Non Modular. What Are The Differences?|website=NZXT Support Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref> Both fulfill the same purpose, but often Modular PSUs are preferred because they allow for better cable management, as they remove the issue of unused cable clutter that non-modular PSUs often have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingupdate.com/articles/105/The-Modular-PSU-and-the-Modern-Gaming-Rig-A-Replaceme |title=The Modular PSU and the Modern Gaming Rig - A Replacement Tale |publisher=Gamingupdate.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Semi-modular power supplies come with only the necessary cables fixed, while cables that are not necessarily needed are able to be detached.<ref name=\"support.nzxt.com\"/>\n\n===Cooling systems===\nMany gamers and computer enthusiasts choose to overclock their CPU(s) and GPU(s) in order to gain extra performance. The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, [[air cooling]] and [[water cooling]]. Air cooling,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Jeremy|title=Air Cooling Vs Liquid Cooling|url=http://gamesngearselite.com/air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling/|website=Games and Gears Elite|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with fans, heat pipes and/or vapor chambers to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, pumps, tubing and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation. Watercooling is available as either a ready-to-use system (aio coolers) or as kits that need to be assembled and can be customized for expanding cooling capacity, cooling additional components or for aesthetic reasons.<ref name=\"CPU Cooling\">{{cite web|last1=Lloyd|first1=Chris|title=How do CPU coolers work?|url=http://www.techradar.com/au/news/computing-components/processors/how-do-cpu-coolers-work-721366|website=techradar|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Case===\nChoosing a computer case involves several considerations. For one, there is a large range of sizes. A larger gaming tower will allow for future upgrades and more movement. The case must also be compatible with the motherboard's form factor. Because games are oftentimes demanding on a system, one of the most important factors of choosing a case is cooling. In order to avoid the risk of overheating hardware, a computer case with good airflow and a quality fan will go a long way in ensuring proper cooling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/869-choosing-the-best-gaming-case |title=Picking the Best Gaming PC Case &#124; Gamers Nexus - Gaming PC Builds & Hardware Benchmarks |publisher=Gamers Nexus |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Other additional features such as fan speed controllers, filters for dust management, and clear side panels are all useful as well. Custom-building allows a builder to personalize their case if they so desire for aesthetic purposes. There are many designs for computer cases so the builder can choose to their liking.\n\n==Pre-built computers==\n[[File:Chillblast Fusion Tracer with green case lighting.jpg|thumb|An example of a pre-built gaming computer showing the case lighting used for the rig.]]\nWhile many \"advanced\" gamers build their gaming PCs themselves, some choose to go with pre-built or custom-built gaming PCs. These PCs can often be more expensive than building one's own, with higher premiums attached to high-end brands with varying levels of customer service.\n\nDifferent companies offer varying degrees of customization. While established gaming computers such as [[Alienware]] offer unique case designs and little customization from the user prior to purchase, other smaller firms allow a greater degree of customization and better value-for-money, often to the same extent as if the user were to build the computer themselves.\n\nThere are, however, drawbacks to building one's own computer. Assembling a computer means being personally responsible for any problems that may arise, both during the assembly phase, and after it is in regular use. Instead of using a single technical support hotline to cover the entire system, often one will have to deal with individual component manufacturers.\n\nDue to the wide inconsistencies in after-purchase support from component manufacturers, trying to get support can be a daunting task. Customer support is a major reason why even extreme gaming enthusiasts may look to a system integrator for their custom PC builds. There are many positive aspects in choosing to build one's own system, such as no longer being tied to specific configurations. Pricing on individual components is often better and thus can save quite a lot of money on a comparable pre-built system. Warranties are often included with the price of each individual piece of hardware when building a PC, whereas a prebuilt PC's warranty may cost an additional fee or maybe as little as 1 or 2 years for the entire system. Those who choose to build their own PC often seek help from an online community or forum in the absence of a consumer helpline.<ref>[http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/ Build Your Own PC]. PCMech. Retrieved on 2012-06-11.</ref>\n\nOne major drawback of buying a prebuilt gaming PC aside from the extra cost is that they are often built with a very powerful CPU, but with a relatively weak graphics card. This results in a \"gaming\" PC that performs poorly in gaming for the price paid. Most games today do not benefit much from having a very powerful CPU with more than 4 [[Multi-core processor|CPU cores]] and hyper-threading,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVl8Eupbr_E CPU Cores for Gaming: How many do you need? - Q1 2015 Update]</ref> but benefits greatly with a more powerful graphics card.\n\n==Gaming laptop computers==\n\nGaming [[laptop]]s such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] are the mobile equivalent of gaming desktops and are usually more expensive than their desktop counterparts. Currently, most gaming laptops like [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] feature more power-efficient versions of high-end desktop [[Video card|graphics card]]s, which nevertheless still significantly drain the battery, and necessitate more advanced systems. One recent development by [[Nvidia]] is [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] for laptops. Generally, gaming laptops are not considered \"rigs\" as the term can also refer to the physical size of the system. Modern gaming laptops can achieve respectable game performance, but never quite match desktops in a class to class comparison, and most do not feature upgradeable graphics cards.\n\nDue to the relatively small size that the hardware has to fit in, cooling the heat-intensive components is a major problem affecting the performance of such laptops, usually causing degraded value for money performance-wise. Attempts at using the same performance hardware as desktops usually end in a decreased clock frequency of graphics chips to reduce heat, causing the poor value for money.\n\nOne can find many value recommendations across the [[World Wide Web]] on [[website]]s like ''[[TechRadar]]'' or ''[[Tom's Hardware]]''.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Nvidia]] GTX 900M series of mobile GPUs in late 2014 represented a significant advancement from the previous 800M series, lessening the gap with desktop systems and making gaming laptops a more viable alternative to desktop PCs.\n\nA newer approach in the gaming PC industry is to create [[small form factor]] desktops that are more compact and easier to transport than a normal full-sized system.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{Portal bar|Video games|Electronics}}\n[[Category:Personal computing]]\n[[Category:Video game hardware]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=June 2017}}\n{{tone|date=June 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:Gaming PC set up.jpg|thumb|350px|An example of a dedicated gaming-PC rig.]]\n{{Video Games}}\nA '''gaming computer''', also known as a '''gaming PC''' or '''gaming rig''', is a [[personal computer]] designed for playing [[video game]]s that require a high amount of [[computing]] power. A modern gaming computer is comparable to a mainstream computer with the addition of performance-oriented components, such as high-performance [[video card]]s and high core-count [[central processing unit]]s, that sacrifice power efficiency for raw performance. Gaming computers are often associated with [[enthusiast computing]] due to an overlap in interests; however, while a gaming computer is built to achieve performance for actual gameplay, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a real application [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]. Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end markets. Video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings. Gaming PCs are often also suitable for other intensive tasks, like video editing.<ref>{{cite web |last=D. |first=Pablo |url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO/ |title=GPU battle: 4670 vs. 9600GSO |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2011-01-21 |publisher=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120224434/http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO |archive-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are frequently custom-assembled, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies that specialize in producing custom gaming machines. In order to generate interest, gaming computer manufacturers that sell complete systems often produce boutique models, allowing them to compete on aesthetic design in addition to the hardware inside.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, gaming computers had several distinct hardware components that set them apart from a typical PC. The push for better graphics began with color fidelity, from display systems such as [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] eventually graduating to [[VGA]], which was adopted for the mass market. Gaming also led the push for the adoption of [[sound card]]s, a component that is now commonly integrated onto [[motherboard]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, several non-[[IBM PC compatible]] platforms gained a measure of popularity due to advanced graphics and sound capabilities, starting with the Atari 400/800 and the TI 99/4, and then continuing with others such as the [[Commodore 64]] and eventually the [[Amiga]]. [[Video game developer]]s of the time targeted these platforms for their games, though typically they would later port their games to the more common PC and Apple platforms as well. The [[MSX]] was also popular in Japan, where it preceded the [[video game console]] revolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Most Popular Computers in History|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/10-most-popular-computers-in-history.htm#page=3|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=Discovery|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> Japan also had several other popular gaming computers during the 1980s to early 1990s, including the very popular [[PC-88]] and [[PC-98]] as well as the powerful [[X68000]] and [[FM Towns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm |title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nBy 1993, PC-compatibles were the standard for gaming in the US.

These are generally a requirement to play modern games on the market.\n\nForays into [[physics processing]] have also been made, though with [[Nvidia]]'s buyout of [[PhysX]]<ref>{{cite web|title=NVIDIA completes Acquisition of AGEIA Technologies|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1202895129984.html|publisher=Nvidia Corporation|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>  and [[Intel]]'s buyout of [[Havok (software)|Havok]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Intel wreaks Havok for $110M|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/intel-wreaks-havok-for-110m/1100-6178911/|work=Gamespot.com|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> plans are that this functionality will be combined with existing CPU or GPU technologies.\n\n==Custom-built gaming computers==\nBy 2012, it had become increasingly popular for [[gamer]]s to custom-build their own PC, allowing for more budget control and easier upgradability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/dell_drop_kicks_proprietary_parts|title=Dell Drop Kicks Proprietary Parts|publisher=PCWorld|accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref> More often than not, it is possible to maximize performance for the best value when building a gaming computer. There are several components that must be considered when building a gaming computer, which include [[CPU]]s, [[RAM|memory]], a [[motherboard]], [[video card]]s, [[solid-state drive]]s, [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]], and [[Computer chassis|cases]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-a-gaming-pc-parts-youll-need-where-to-buy-them-2016-12/|title=Building your own gaming PC is incredibly rewarding \u2014 here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen building a custom-built gaming PC, builders usually turn to independent benchmarks to help make their hardware selection. Organizations such as [[AnandTech]] and [[Tom's Hardware Guide]] provide such benchmarks and hardware reviews. The benchmarks include ratings for PC components that are necessary to build a gaming computer. It is also crucial to consider [[computer cooling]], as this is required to remove the [[waste heat]] produced by a computer's components.\n\n===Video cards===\n[[File:NVIDIA-GTX-1070-FoundersEdition-FL.jpg|thumb|225px|An example of an [[NVIDIA]] GPU ([[GeForce 10 series]]).]]\nA [[video card]] is essential to any gaming computer, and connects to a motherboard using the [[PCI Express|Peripheral Component Interconnect Express]] (PCI Express or PCI-E). There are two major manufacturers of GPUs for a gaming computer, [[AMD]] and [[NVIDIA]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-graphics-cards/|title=The best graphics card|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> These companies provide GPUs which other companies, such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] and [[ASUS]], then design circuit boards and cooling shrouds for.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most video cards cost from $200 to $2,000. Modern consumer-grade CPUs often have on-[[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] [[Integrated graphics|integrated GPUs]]; however, these GPUs typically do not provide the adequate performance for playing graphics-intensive games, and are instead aimed primarily for less demanding workloads such as [[graphical user interface]] rendering for \"everyday\" tasks, video playback, and [[Casual game|light gaming]].\n\n===Processors===\nA major component of a gaming computer is the processor, or [[Central processing unit|CPU (central processing unit)]]. There are two major brands that manufacture CPUs, [[AMD]] and [[Intel]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-pc-gaming-cpus-processors/|title=The best PC gaming processor|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> As of 2019, most gaming computers are built with Intel's [[Ice Lake (microarchitecture)|Ice Lake]] or AMD's [[Zen 2|Ryzen 2]] CPUs.<ref name=\":1\" /> While a powerful CPU is important to avoid [[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]], after a certain level of CPU power, diminishing returns become evident if the PC is not being used for other, more CPU-intensive purposes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Motherboards===\n[[Motherboard]]s that are designed for gaming computers are differentiated from their normal counterparts by being created with case windows in mind; having more visually appealing designs, sturdier materials, and, in some models, built-in [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-motherboards/|title=The best gaming motherboards|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> They also have the capability to [[Overclocking|overclock]] certain models of CPUs, and an increased number of various connection ports.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Memory===\n[[Random-access memory]] (RAM) is one of the most important components for a gaming computer. Computers designed for playing games often are supplied with a high amount of RAM.\n\n==== DDR memory ====\n[[Double data rate|DDR]] (double data rate) [[Computer memory|memory]] is essential for any computer system. Adding more memory allows the CPU to address more data for it to quickly access instead of reading off a comparatively slow disk drive or [[solid-state storage device]]. [[DDR SDRAM]] also has much lower latency than its GDDR counterpart and much lower bandwidth as the CPU relies on being able to change small amounts of data quickly. The latest standard of DDR memory is DDR4L.\n\n==== GDDR memory ====\nGDDR (graphical double data rate) memory is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card and is built directly onto the card itself. The amount of RAM built onto a graphics card allows the GPU to quickly access data such as textures instead of reading from a much slower storage device. Having more GDDR memory allows the system to handle higher levels of [[spatial anti-aliasing]] and more complex textures. GDDR memory has a much higher latency when compared to DDR memory but also has a much larger bandwidth, thus allowing the GPU to deal with larger amounts of data at a slower rate when compared to a CPU. The latest revision of GDDR memory is GDDR6.\n\n==== High bandwidth memory (HBM) ====\n[[High Bandwidth Memory|HBM]] is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card, and is placed directly beside the GPU itself on the graphics card. This is different from standard GDDR as standard GDDR memory sits on the PCB of the graphics card. The main advantages of having the memory mounted so close to the GPU itself are as follows; reduced latency due to signals traveling a shorter distance, more bandwidth due to more space for data lanes, and decreased power consumption due to inherent differences to GDDR on the microscopic level. The latest revision of HBM is HBM2.\n\n===Solid-state drives===\n[[Solid-state drive]]s (SSD) are a newer form of data storage that is gaining in popularity. The more common and traditional [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs in favor of the advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to operating specifications. An SSD can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD. For an SSD, files open almost instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |title=SSD Drive vs Hard Drive |publisher=Gaming Laptop |access-date=2015-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222141728/http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |archive-date=2015-02-22 |df= }}</ref> This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santo |first=Joel |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404260,00.asp |title=Advantages/Disadvantages - SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference? |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order to load items from the game such as level files and texture images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |title=Computer memory articles for SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM from |publisher=Crucial.com |date= |access-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203003057/http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-03 |df= }}</ref> However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost-effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs.\n\n===Power supply units===\nAlthough occasionally overlooked, the power supply unit (PSU) is still an important component to consider. The wattage needed to run a system is dependent on the hardware, so often a PSU calculator is used to determine the wattage needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Power-Supply |title=How to Buy a Power Supply: 7 Steps (with Pictures) |publisher=wikiHow |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> In addition, future upgrades to a gaming rig will possibly require more power, and PSUs lose power as they age, so it is often a good idea to buy a PSU that has the capability of lasting through several years and upgrades. The PSU must also be compatible with the other hardware\npieces.\n\nThere are two types of PSUs, modular PSUs (MPSU) and non-modular PSUs.

The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, [[air cooling]] and [[water cooling]]. Air cooling,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Jeremy|title=Air Cooling Vs Liquid Cooling|url=http://gamesngearselite.com/air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling/|website=Games and Gears Elite|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with fans, heat pipes and/or vapor chambers to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, pumps, tubing and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation. Watercooling is available as either a ready-to-use system (aio coolers) or as kits that need to be assembled and can be customized for expanding cooling capacity, cooling additional components or for aesthetic reasons.<ref name=\"CPU Cooling\">{{cite web|last1=Lloyd|first1=Chris|title=How do CPU coolers work?|url=http://www.techradar.com/au/news/computing-components/processors/how-do-cpu-coolers-work-721366|website=techradar|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Case===\nChoosing a computer case involves several considerations. For one, there is a large range of sizes. A larger gaming tower will allow for future upgrades and more movement. The case must also be compatible with the motherboard's form factor. Because games are oftentimes demanding on a system, one of the most important factors of choosing a case is cooling. In order to avoid the risk of overheating hardware, a computer case with good airflow and a quality fan will go a long way in ensuring proper cooling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/869-choosing-the-best-gaming-case |title=Picking the Best Gaming PC Case &#124; Gamers Nexus - Gaming PC Builds & Hardware Benchmarks |publisher=Gamers Nexus |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Other additional features such as fan speed controllers, filters for dust management, and clear side panels are all useful as well. Custom-building allows a builder to personalize their case if they so desire for aesthetic purposes. There are many designs for computer cases so the builder can choose to their liking.\n\n==Pre-built computers==\n[[File:Chillblast Fusion Tracer with green case lighting.jpg|thumb|An example of a pre-built gaming computer showing the case lighting used for the rig.]]\nWhile many \"advanced\" gamers build their gaming PCs themselves, some choose to go with pre-built or custom-built gaming PCs. These PCs can often be more expensive than building one's own, with higher premiums attached to high-end brands with varying levels of customer service.\n\nDifferent companies offer varying degrees of customization. While established gaming computers such as [[Alienware]] offer unique case designs and little customization from the user prior to purchase, other smaller firms allow a greater degree of customization and better value-for-money, often to the same extent as if the user were to build the computer themselves.\n\nThere are, however, drawbacks to building one's own computer. Assembling a computer means being personally responsible for any problems that may arise, both during the assembly phase, and after it is in regular use. Instead of using a single technical support hotline to cover the entire system, often one will have to deal with individual component manufacturers.\n\nDue to the wide inconsistencies in after-purchase support from component manufacturers, trying to get support can be a daunting task. Customer support is a major reason why even extreme gaming enthusiasts may look to a system integrator for their custom PC builds. There are many positive aspects in choosing to build one's own system, such as no longer being tied to specific configurations. Pricing on individual components is often better and thus can save quite a lot of money on a comparable pre-built system. Warranties are often included with the price of each individual piece of hardware when building a PC, whereas a prebuilt PC's warranty may cost an additional fee or maybe as little as 1 or 2 years for the entire system. Those who choose to build their own PC often seek help from an online community or forum in the absence of a consumer helpline.<ref>[http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/ Build Your Own PC]. PCMech. Retrieved on 2012-06-11.</ref>\n\nOne major drawback of buying a prebuilt gaming PC aside from the extra cost is that they are often built with a very powerful CPU, but with a relatively weak graphics card. This results in a \"gaming\" PC that performs poorly in gaming for the price paid. Most games today do not benefit much from having a very powerful CPU with more than 4 [[Multi-core processor|CPU cores]] and hyper-threading,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVl8Eupbr_E CPU Cores for Gaming: How many do you need? - Q1 2015 Update]</ref> but benefits greatly with a more powerful graphics card.\n\n==Gaming laptop computers==\n\nGaming [[laptop]]s such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] are the mobile equivalent of gaming desktops and are usually more expensive than their desktop counterparts. Currently, most gaming laptops like [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] feature more power-efficient versions of high-end desktop [[Video card|graphics card]]s, which nevertheless still significantly drain the battery, and necessitate more advanced systems. One recent development by [[Nvidia]] is [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] for laptops. Generally, gaming laptops are not considered \"rigs\" as the term can also refer to the physical size of the system. Modern gaming laptops can achieve respectable game performance, but never quite match desktops in a class to class comparison, and most do not feature upgradeable graphics cards.\n\nDue to the relatively small size that the hardware has to fit in, cooling the heat-intensive components is a major problem affecting the performance of such laptops, usually causing degraded value for money performance-wise. Attempts at using the same performance hardware as desktops usually end in a decreased clock frequency of graphics chips to reduce heat, causing the poor value for money.\n\nOne can find many value recommendations across the [[World Wide Web]] on [[website]]s like ''[[TechRadar]]'' or ''[[Tom's Hardware]]''.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Nvidia]] GTX 900M series of mobile GPUs in late 2014 represented a significant advancement from the previous 800M series, lessening the gap with desktop systems and making gaming laptops a more viable alternative to desktop PCs.\n\nA newer approach in the gaming PC industry is to create [[small form factor]] desktops that are more compact and easier to transport than a normal full-sized system.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{Portal bar|Video games|Electronics}}\n[[Category:Personal computing]]\n[[Category:Video game hardware]]\n", "name_user": "FactualNumber717171", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer"}

A third season was renewed one year after,<ref>https://www.deadline.com/2018/03/disney-junior-renews-mickey-and-the-roadster-racers-for-season-3-1202338230/amp/</ref> leading to the series being renamed as ''Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures''. The first episode under the new title aired on October 14, 2019.<ref>https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/disney-s-new-mickey-mouse-mixed-up-adventures-premieres-in-oct/</ref>\n\nThis show features some of [[Russi Taylor]]'s final performances as [[Minnie Mouse]] before she died of colon cancer in 2019.<!--Russi may have recorded some episodes before her death, so don't put her years yet.-->\n\n==Plot==\n''Mickey and the Roadster Racers'' is about the Sensational Six ([[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], [[Goofy]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]], and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]) as they race around their town of Hot Dog Hills and around the world (Pluto does not race in any way). Unlike the previous series, this show contains two 11-minute stories as opposed to a full-length 22-minute story. In the first half, Billy Beagle announces Mickey and his friends' races whether the race is in Hot Dog Hills or anywhere around the world. \n\nIn the second half, Minnie and Daisy work as the Happy Helpers alongside Cuckoo Loca (from ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'') where they help out different residents of Hot Dog Hills. Minnie and Daisy use the Turnstyler located in the office and the Happy Helper Van to assume the clothes associated with their jobs that they are hired to help out on. \n\nIn Season 2, the Roadster Racers get their roadsters modified by [[Ludwig Von Drake]] so that they can perform Supercharged moves.\n\nIn Season 3, Mickey builds a mixed-up motor lab that mixes up and transforms cars. It starts to use the classic \"Hot Dog\" song originally written and performed by [[They Might Be Giants]] for ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''. This new version of the song is placed between the two segments of each episode and at the end of the final segment.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main article|List of Mickey and the Roadster Racers episodes}}\n{{:List of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Mickey Mouse]] (voiced by [[Bret Iwan]]) \u2013 The leader of the Roadster Racers and owner of Mickey's garage.

American [[Computer animation|computer]]-[[Animated series|animated]] [[children's television series]] produced by [[Disney Television Animation]]. It is a spin-off of ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''. The series (at the time as ''Mickey and the Roadster Racers'' for its first two seasons{{refn|The first two seasons were retroactively titled ''Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures'' upon the third season's premiere.|group=note|name=first}})  debuted on [[Disney Junior]] in the United States on January 15, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Ross A.|title=Disney Junior Sets October Launch For \u2018Mickey Mous Mixed-Up Adventures\u2019|url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/disney-juniors-mickey-and-the-roadster-racers-to-debut-in-january-1201862550/|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=December 2, 2016|date=December 1, 2016}}</ref> \n\nThe series was renewed for a second season on March 15, 2017,<ref>https://deadline.com/2017/03/disney-junior-renews-mickey-and-the-roadster-racers-the-lion-guard-1202043582/</ref> which premiered on April 13, 2018. A third season was renewed one year after,<ref>https://www.deadline.com/2018/03/disney-junior-renews-mickey-and-the-roadster-racers-for-season-3-1202338230/amp/</ref> leading to the series being renamed as ''Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures''. The first episode under the new title aired on October 14, 2019.<ref>https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/disney-s-new-mickey-mouse-mixed-up-adventures-premieres-in-oct/</ref>\n\nThis show features some of [[Russi Taylor]]'s final performances as [[Minnie Mouse]] before she died of colon cancer in 2019.<!--Russi may have recorded some episodes before her death, so don't put her years yet.-->\n\n==Plot==\n''Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures'' is about the Sensational Six ([[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], [[Goofy]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]], and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]) as they race around their town of Hot Dog Hills and around the world (Pluto does not race in any way). Unlike the previous series, this show contains two 11-minute stories as opposed to a full-length 22-minute story. In the first half, Billy Beagle announces Mickey and his friends' races whether the race is in Hot Dog Hills or anywhere around the world. \n\nIn the second half, Minnie and Daisy work as the Happy Helpers alongside Cuckoo Loca (from ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'') where they help out different residents of Hot Dog Hills. Minnie and Daisy use the Turnstyler located in the office and the Happy Helper Van to assume the clothes associated with their jobs that they are hired to help out on. \n\nIn Season 2, the Roadster Racers get their roadsters modified by [[Ludwig Von Drake]] so that they can perform Supercharged moves.\n\nIn Season 3, Mickey builds a mixed-up motor lab that mixes up and transforms cars. It starts to use the classic \"Hot Dog\" song originally written and performed by [[They Might Be Giants]] for ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''. This new version of the song is placed between the two segments of each episode and at the end of the final segment.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main article|List of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures episodes}}\n{{:List of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Mickey Mouse]] (voiced by [[Bret Iwan]]) \u2013 The leader of the Roadster Racers and owner of Mickey's garage.

{"title_page": "Quotation", "text_new": "{{short description|Repetition of one expression as part of another one}}\n{{About|quoting text and speech|information about the punctuation mark|Quotation mark|economic usage|Financial quote|7=Quotation (disambiguation)|10=other uses|11=Quotation (disambiguation)}}\n\nA '''quotation''' is the repetition of a sentence, phrase, or passage from speech or text that someone has said or written.<ref name=\"oxford\">{{cite book |editor1-last=McArthur |editor1-first=Tom |editor2-last=Lam-McArthur |editor2-first=Jacqueline |editor3-last=Fontaine |editor3-first=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> In oral speech, it is the representation of an utterance (i.e. of something that a speaker actually said) that is introduced by a quotative marker, such as a verb of saying. For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\">Frederica Barbieri.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

The first is as the complement of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative adjunct (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The verb phrase can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: ''\"They'll never make it!\" cried John to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried to Mary John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the simple present or the simple past. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a nominal subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, noun phrases are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:\"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:\"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:''*''\"Why?\" asked Gabrielle the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\nIn English, both subject-verb and verb-subject word orders are permitted:\n\n:\"Don't turn back!\" warned Marcel <ref name=\"collins\"/>\n:\"Who's on first?\" Joe demanded <ref name=\"collins\"/>\n\nThis however, is not the case in all languages.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\">Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier ''zoiets'' to be [[grammaticality|well-formed]].<ref name=\"haddican et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Haddican |first1=William |last2=Zweig |first2=Eytan |last3=Johnson |first3=Daniel Ezra |title=The syntax of be like quotatives |journal=Proceedings of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics |date=2012 |page=81-89 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/29/paper2690.pdf}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
