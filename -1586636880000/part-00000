singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]], originally released on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior.<ref name=MEMag>\"Watch that Man\" by Tina Clarke, Music Express magazine, March 1990, page 9</ref> \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}}\n\nBowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989).

The Call of Duty League follows the model of the [[Overwatch League]] as well as other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. In addition, the league plays in a tournament point system and [[playoffs]] format rather than the use of [[promotion and relegation]] used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues, with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary, benefits, and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on how that team performs. The League was announced in 2019 with its inaugural season starting in 2020. The events are hosted by teams in their home cities, beginning with the Launch Weekend event hosted by the Minnesota ROKKR and taking place in Minneapolis, Minnesota on January 24\u201326, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hume |first1=Mike |last2=Klimentov |first2=Mikhail |title=Call of Duty League to start 2020 season in Minnesota Jan. 24 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/esports/2019/10/29/call-duty-league-start-season-minnesota-jan/ |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=The Washington Post |date=October 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rand |first1=Emily |title=Call of Duty League opener was not the disaster that social media advertised |url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28557181/call-duty-league-opener-was-not-disaster-social-media-advertised |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=ESPN |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Pei |first1=Annie |title=Activision Blizzard's next esports bet hinges on the power of the Call of Duty franchise |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/activision-blizzard-is-kicks-off-their-call-of-duty-esports-league.html |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=CNBC |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe Call of Duty League is owned by [[Activision Blizzard]] as that company's second franchise-based esports organization. The league plays out similar to most North American professional sports leagues, in which all teams play scheduled games against other teams to vie for position in the season's playoffs, rather than the approach of team [[promotion and relegation]] more commonly used in other esports leagues.

The inaugural season used the 2019 release, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]'', played on standard [[PlayStation 4]] consoles and other equivalent equipment for all players. The three multiplayer modes used by the CDL include: \"Search & Destroy\", where one team attempts to plant a bomb and defend it at one of two control points while the other team tries to eliminate the bomb team, or if the bomb is activated, to defuse it in time; \"Hardpoint\", where a rotation control point appears on the map, and teams earn points for maintaining control on that point; and \"Domination\", where three control points appear on the map, and teams are awarded points by maintaining control of one or more of these points. In the case of \"Search & Destroy\" and \"Domination\", multiple rounds are played, switching the role of each team, while \"Hardpoint\" is played until a point limit is reached. Once a team has won three games in a match, the match is over, and that team given the match victory.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/about | title = Call of Duty League - About | accessdate = January 27, 2020 | publisher = [[Activision Blizzard]] }}</ref> Coaches for teams have a limited number of [[time out (sport)|time outs]] which they can use during a game, and can substitute players during this time; this is in contrast to the OWL format where play substitutions may only occur between games.<ref name=\"thr cdl\"/>\n\nThe 2020 season schedule is evenly divided into two splits for spring and summer, with a mid-season all-star event taking place after the spring split, and culminates in the Championship Weekend.<ref name=\"Business Insider\" /> Each team will host a weekend tournament-style event in their home city, and the top teams from the weekend earns points.

The Call of Duty League follows the model of the [[Overwatch League]] as well as other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. In addition, the league plays in a tournament point system and [[playoffs]] format rather than the use of [[promotion and relegation]] used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues, with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary, benefits, and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on how that team performs. The League was announced in 2019 with its inaugural season starting in 2020. The events are hosted by teams in their home cities, beginning with the Launch Weekend event hosted by the Minnesota ROKKR and taking place in Minneapolis, Minnesota on January 24\u201326, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hume |first1=Mike |last2=Klimentov |first2=Mikhail |title=Call of Duty League to start 2020 season in Minnesota Jan. 24 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/esports/2019/10/29/call-duty-league-start-season-minnesota-jan/ |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=The Washington Post |date=October 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rand |first1=Emily |title=Call of Duty League opener was not the disaster that social media advertised |url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28557181/call-duty-league-opener-was-not-disaster-social-media-advertised |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=ESPN |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Pei |first1=Annie |title=Activision Blizzard's next esports bet hinges on the power of the Call of Duty franchise |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/activision-blizzard-is-kicks-off-their-call-of-duty-esports-league.html |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=CNBC |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe Call of Duty League is owned by [[Activision Blizzard]] as that company's second franchise-based esports organization. The league plays out similar to most North American professional sports leagues, in which all teams play scheduled games against other teams to vie for position in the season's playoffs, rather than the approach of team [[promotion and relegation]] more commonly used in other esports leagues. The league currently features twelve teams.<ref name=\"Business Insider\">{{cite news |last1=Webb |first1=Kevin |title=12 teams reportedly paid $25 million each to join a new esports league that starts today \u2014 here's everything you need to know about Call of Duty League |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/call-of-duty-league-teams-schedule-salary-rules-format-2019-11 |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=Business Insider |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEach match between two teams consists of a best-of-five through different games based on gameplay modes and maps within the ''Call of Duty'' game. The inaugural season used the 2019 release, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]'', played on standard [[PlayStation 4]] consoles and other equivalent equipment for all players. The three multiplayer modes used by the CDL include: \"Search & Destroy\", where one team attempts to plant a bomb and defend it at one of two control points while the other team tries to eliminate the bomb team, or if the bomb is activated, to defuse it in time; \"Hardpoint\", where a rotation control point appears on the map, and teams earn points for maintaining control on that point; and \"Domination\", where three control points appear on the map, and teams are awarded points by maintaining control of one or more of these points. In the case of \"Search & Destroy\" and \"Domination\", multiple rounds are played, switching the role of each team, while \"Hardpoint\" is played until a point limit is reached. Once a team has won three games in a match, the match is over, and that team given the match victory.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/about | title = Call of Duty League - About | accessdate = January 27, 2020 | publisher = [[Activision Blizzard]] }}</ref> Coaches for teams have a limited number of [[time out (sport)|time outs]] which they can use during a game, and can substitute players during this time; this is in contrast to the OWL format where play substitutions may only occur between games.<ref name=\"thr cdl\"/>\n\nThe 2020 season schedule is evenly divided into two splits for spring and summer, with a mid-season all-star event taking place after the spring split, and culminates in the Championship Weekend.<ref name=\"Business Insider\" /> Each team will host a weekend tournament-style event in their home city, and the top teams from the weekend earns points.

At least 50% of the winnings a team earns must be shared with the team members. Players are not required to live in the city/region that the team represents.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

It is characterised by the presence of abundant Cuartz sediments, along with the pesence of Red Clays. Along the meridional border of the [[Guettioua Formation]], on the same Stratigraphic tendence is developed a red Sandstone-Pelitic deposition, that changes from Quartzo-[[Conglomerate]]s to grains and fragments of Quartz, dispossed with liassic Calcareous strata.<ref name=Taquet1 /><ref name=Taquet2 /> is equivalent to the main Azilal \"Marnes Chocolat\".<ref name=Taquet1 /><ref name=Taquet2 /> The Main sector occurs near Acfarcid, with an expossure of ~800 m, recovering the most detritic sector. Along this expossure, the Wazzant member appaears at the right lateral, along massive calcareous [[Dolomite]]s, over the Latest [[Pliensbachian]] strata, where the lower Toarcian strata is missing.<ref name=Taquet1 /> The Wazzant facies never exceed 50 m, getting it\u00b4s maximum exposure at the north of the [[Guettioua Formation]].<ref name=Taquet1 /> The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys Ocean]] to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).

Union casualties were relatively light: Union losses were seven enlisted men (six African Americans: Corp.

Dedication ceremonies were held for the site on October 26\u201327, 2012, nearly 150&nbsp;years to the day of the battle.<ref name=dedication/>\n\nIn May 2013, the site was accepted into the [[National Park Service]]'s \"National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom,\" a series of locations deemed to be significant to African-American history in their struggle for freedom, including the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name=Freedom/>\n{{gallery|width=250|height=135|align=center\n|File:View from the Viewing Station at Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site.jpg|The central attraction of the Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site is its viewing station, which contains several informational signs and offers this framed view of the site and a split rail fence.\n|File:Split Rail Fence at Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site.jpg|The site of much of the fighting at Island Mound is now covered in prairie foliage, as was about three-quarters of Bates County in the mid 19th Century.

Cockrell|Vard Cockrell]] and Bill Truman (who was related to future President [[Harry S. Truman]]). The Union forces had crossed into Missouri on a mission to clear Confederate guerrillas from their base known as \"Hog Island\" in the [[Osage River]].<ref name=Battle/>\n\nFinding themselves outnumbered in an early sortie, the Union troops commandeered and fortified the homestead of Confederate guerrilla Enoch John Toothman, and a one-day siege ensued. Part of the regiment was caught out on the tall-grass prairie by mounted Confederate guerrillas. They stood their ground through several volleys of gunfire and a cavalry charge, before the Confederates withdrew from the area on October 29. Union casualties were relatively light: Union losses were seven enlisted men (six African Americans: Corp. Joseph Talbot, Privates Samuel Davis, Thomas Lane, Marlon Barber, Allen Rhodes, Henry Gash, all of Co F; Cherokee John Six-Killer of Seaman's Battalion) and Captain A.G. Crew of Co. A.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Confederate losses are estimated at more than thirty.<ref name=General/>\n\nThe clash was significant as the first time African-American troops engaged Confederate forces during the Civil War.<ref name=\"Battle\"/><ref name=Tabor/> It was covered by a correspondent of the ''[[New York Times]]'' who was with the regiment, and he praised the men's \"desperate bravery.\" He also noted that Bill Truman had told men in Butler that the blacks had fought \"like tigers.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/> The battle was also covered by ''[[Harper's Weekly]].'' Such positive reports provided encouragement to other African-American units that were forming across the northern states and petitioning the Union government to fight in combat.<ref name=General/> The [[United States Colored Troops]] were established, contributing critical fighting and support to the Union effort.\n\n==Activities and amenities==\nThe site offers hiking and picnic opportunities as a day-use facility, open from sunrise to sunset.<ref name=MSHS/> A central kiosk provides information about the battle. It is adjacent to a .6&nbsp;mile looping trail where the \"Courage Monument\" and interpretive panels are found. A picnic shelter that can accommodate up to fifty, toilet facilities, and drinking fountain are located near the kiosk.<ref name=Access/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=MSHS>{{cite web |url=https://mostateparks.com/park/battle-island-mound-state-historic-site |title=Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=parkdata>{{cite web |url=https://mostateparks.com/sites/mostateparks/files/battleislandmound_datasheet_01_2018.pdf |title=Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site: Data Sheet |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |date=November 2017 |accessdate=May 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=acquisition>{{cite web |url=https://mostateparks.com/page/59045/state-park-land-acquisition-summary |title=State Park Land Acquisition Summary |publisher=Missouri State Parks |accessdate=May 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/19/news/affairs-west-negro-regiment-action-battle-island-mounds-desperate-bravery-negros.html?emc=eta1 |title=AFFAIRS IN THE WEST.; A Negro Regiment in Action--The Battle of Island Mounds--Desperate Bravery of the Negros--Defeat of the Guerrillas--An Attempted Fraud |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 19, 1862 |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Battle>{{cite web |url=http://www.batescounty.net/island_mound.php |title=The Battle of Island Mound |publisher=Bates County, Missouri |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=General>{{cite web |url=https://mostateparks.com/page/60129/historic-site-history |title=Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site: History |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=May 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Access>{{cite web |url=https://mostateparks.com/page/66461/accessibility-information |title=Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site: Accessibility Information |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=May 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=dedication>{{cite pressrelease |url=http://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/MODNR/bulletins/579fd5 |title=Missouri State Parks hosts Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site dedication Oct. 27 in Bates County |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |date=October 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Freedom>{{cite pressrelease |url=http://www.freedomsfrontier.org/News/News-Releases/Detail.aspx?ID=99 |title=Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site accepted into National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources / Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=May 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Tabor>{{cite web |url=http://islandmound.tripod.com/index1.htm |title=The Skirmish at Island Mound |author=Chris Tabor |date=2000 |publisher=Chris Tabor}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://mostateparks.com/park/battle-island-mound-state-historic-site Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site] Missouri Department of Natural Resources\n*[https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID=4436894&SPFTerritory=Missouri&SPFType=Site&SPFKeywords=NULL Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site] National Park Service\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3661190/ \"The Battle of Island Mound\"] IMDb\n\n{{Missouri in the Civil War}}\n{{Protected Areas of Missouri}}\n{{Portal bar|American Civil War|United States|National Register of Historic Places}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Missouri State Historic Sites]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 2008]]\n[[Category:African Americans in the American Civil War|Island Mound State Historic Site]]\n[[Category:Battlefields of the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Island Mound State Historic Site]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Bates County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:1862 in Missouri]]\n[[Category:2008 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Missouri in the American Civil War|Island Mound State Historic Site]]\n", "name_user": "Alaney2k", "label": "safe", "comment": "the work's name is \"The New York Times\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Island_Mound_State_Historic_Site"}
