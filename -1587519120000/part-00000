Cohen|David S. Cohen]], [[Jonathan Collier]], [[Jennifer Crittenden]], [[Greg Daniels]], [[Brent Forrester]], [[Dan Greaney]], [[Rachel Pulido]], [[Steve Tompkins]], [[Josh Weinstein]], [[Bill Oakley]], and [[Matt Groening]], with the writing being supervised by Daniels. The episode was directed by [[Jim Reardon]].<ref name=\"book\"/> [[Phil Hartman]] guest starred as [[Lionel Hutz]] and the hospital board chairman.<ref name=\"book\"/><ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nThe episode depicts brief incidents experienced by a wide array of Springfield residents in a series of interconnected stories that take place over a single day. The episode's concept originated from the end segment of the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] episode \"[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]\", and serves as a loose parody of ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which gave the staff the idea of a possible spin-off from ''The Simpsons''. The title is a reference to the film ''[[Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould]]''. \n\nThe episode received positive reviews from critics, and is noted for its popularity among fans.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode is a series of shorts ranging in length from under half a minute to over two and half minutes, each showing daily life in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] after [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] wonders if anything interesting happens to the town's citizens.\n\n# Bart and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] squirt condiments from a highway overpass onto cars, then go to the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Kwik-E Mart|Kwik-E-Mart]].\n# [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] closes the Kwik-E-Mart for five minutes to attend a party at [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon|Sanjay's]] house, trapping [[Hans Moleman|Moleman]] in the store.\n# Bart unknowingly throws [[Chewing gum|gum]] in [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa's]] hair, and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] tries to remove the gum by putting peanut butter and mayonnaise on her hair.\n# While outside, Lisa's hair attracts a swarm of bees, one of which flies away.\n# [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] gets stung by the bee while bike riding with [[Mr. Burns]], and suffers an allergic reaction.\n# [[Nick Riviera|Dr. Nick]] is criticized by the hospital board for his [[Quackery|unorthodox medical procedures]].\n# Dr. Nick treats [[Grampa Simpson|Grampa]] with an electric light socket and saves his medical career.\n# [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] gets robbed by [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Snake|Snake]] after [[Barney Gumble|Barney]] gives him $2,000 to pay for a portion of his bar tab.\n# While hosting [[Superintendent Chalmers]] for lunch, [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] burns his roast and bluffs his way through the meal.\n# [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] accidentally traps [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] in a newspaper vending box.\n# [[Chief Wiggum]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]], and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Eddie|Eddie]] compare [[McDonald's]] and [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Krusty Burger|Krusty Burger]].\n# [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Bumblebee Man|Bumblebee Man]] arrives home after a horrible day at work and his house is destroyed, causing his wife to leave him.\n# Snake runs Wiggum over, and their ensuing fight ends with [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Herman Hermann|Herman]] capturing them at gunpoint in his store.\n# [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy|Reverend Lovejoy]] urges his pet [[Old English Sheepdog]] to use [[Ned Flanders]]'s lawn as a toilet.\n# Various townspeople advise Marge and Lisa how to remove the gum stuck in Lisa's hair.\n# [[Cletus Spuckler|Cletus]] offers [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Brandine|Brandine]] some shoes he found on a [[telephone line]].\n# Milhouse tries to use the bathroom in [[Comic Book Guy|Comic Book Guy's]] [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop|Android's Dungeon]], but is forced to leave the store before he can use it.\n# Milhouse goes with [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Kirk Van Houten|his father]] to use the bathroom in Herman's store and accidentally knocks out Herman with a [[Flail (weapon)|flail]], saving his father, Snake, and Wiggum.\n# [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Old Barber|Jake the barber]] cuts the gum out of Lisa's hair, leaving her with a different hairstyle.\n# [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] laughs at an extremely tall man in a small car, who then humiliates Nelson to teach him a lesson.\n# Bart and Milhouse squirt ketchup and mustard onto Nelson from the overpass, and conclude that life is interesting in their town after all. \n# [[Professor Frink]] attempts to tell his story but is cut off by the ending credits.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n==Production==\nThe episode's principal idea came from the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] episode \"[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]\", which contained a short sequence entitled \"The Adventures of [[Ned Flanders]]\", featuring its own title card and theme song, at its conclusion. The scene has no relevance to the main plot of the episode and was designed solely as [[Filler (media)|filler]] to accommodate the episode's short runtime.<ref name=Oakley>{{cite video |last=Oakley|first=Bill|author-link=Bill Oakley|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The staff loved the concept and attempted to fit similar scenes into other episodes, but none were short enough to require one. [[Show runner]]s [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] decided to make an entire episode of linked short scenes involving many of the show's characters, in a similar style to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''.<ref name=Oakley/> The title \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" was decided upon from the start of the episode's production,<ref name=Oakley/> even though there are not actually twenty-two stories in it.<ref name=Weinstein>{{cite video|last=Weinstein|first=Josh|author-link=Josh Weinstein|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Originally there were more scenes, but several of them had to be cut out for time.<ref name=Oakley/> To decide who would write each of the segments, all of the writers chose their top three favorite characters and put them into a hat, the names were drawn out and the writers were assigned their parts.<ref name=Oakley/> Oakley wrote the [[Superintendent Chalmers]] story,<ref name=Oakley/> Weinstein did the [[Comic Book Guy]] and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] scene,<ref name=Weinstein/> [[David X.

The main reason he loved him was that, until Frank Grimes was created for the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]] episode \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\", Chalmers was the only character that \"seemed to operate in the normal human universe\".<ref name=Oakley/> In previous episodes, Skinner and Chalmers' scenes together revolved around one joke: Skinner tells Chalmers an unbelievable lie, but Chalmers believes him anyway. So, their scene in this episode is made up of a string of thirteen interconnected lies.<ref name=Oakley/> The dialogue between him and Skinner was something that had never been done before, in that it is just a long relaxed conversation with nothing important being said at all.<ref name=Cohen/>\n\nIn the Mr. Burns story, every single word he yells at Smithers is real and used correctly. To maintain accuracy, the writers used a 19th-century slang thesaurus to look up words.<ref name=Weinstein/> Many of the Spanish words used in Bumblebee Man's segment are easily understood cognates of English and not accurate Spanish; this was done deliberately so that non-Spanish speakers could understand the dialogue without subtitles.<ref name=Weinstein/><ref name=Pulido>{{cite video|last=Pulido|first=Rachel|author-link=Rachel Pulido|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The very tall man was a caricature of writer [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]],<ref name=Weinstein/> and the crowd on the street who laugh at Nelson includes caricatures of [[Matt Groening]], Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein. Oakley wrote in the script that the street was filled with Springfield's biggest idiots and so the animators drew him, Weinstein, and Groening into the scene.<ref name=Oakley/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe episode contains numerous references to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''. Like the film, the episode's plot is episodic, though the stories are interconnected. The policemen's conversation about McDonald's parallels the famous \"Royale With Cheese\" discussion,<ref name=\"book\"/><ref name=av/> and the music played during the segment's beginning was also taken from the film.<ref name=Weinstein/> The story involving Chief Wiggum and Snake is a direct parody of the \"Gold Watch\" segment of the film. Snake runs over Wiggum at a red light, alluding to the segment of the film where the character of Butch Coolidge did the same to Marsellus Wallace, before crashing into a fire hydrant and beginning an on-foot chase.<ref name=Weinstein/><ref name=av/> The two run into [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Herman Hermann|Herman]]'s Military Antique shop, where Herman beats, ties up and gags the two, then waits for \"Zed\" to arrive, exactly as Maynard does in ''Pulp Fiction''.<ref name=\"book\"/><ref name=av>{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-simpsons-22-short-films-about-springfield,39518/|title=The Simpsons, \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"|work=[[The A.V.

Cohen|David S. Cohen]], [[Jonathan Collier]], [[Jennifer Crittenden]], [[Greg Daniels]], [[Brent Forrester]], [[Dan Greaney]], [[Rachel Pulido]], [[Steve Tompkins]], [[Josh Weinstein]], [[Bill Oakley]], and [[Matt Groening]], with the writing being supervised by Daniels. The episode was directed by [[Jim Reardon]].<ref name=\"book\"/> [[Phil Hartman]] guest starred as [[Lionel Hutz]] and the hospital board chairman.<ref name=\"book\"/><ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nThe episode depicts brief incidents experienced by a wide array of Springfield residents in a series of interconnected stories that take place over a single day. The episode's concept originated from the end segment of the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] episode \"[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]\", and serves as a loose parody of ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which gave the staff the idea of a possible spin-off from ''The Simpsons''. The title is a reference to the film ''[[Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould]]''. \n\nThe episode received positive reviews from critics, and is noted for its popularity among fans.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode is a series of shorts ranging in length from under half a minute to over two and half minutes, each showing daily life in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] after [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] wonders if anything interesting happens to the town's citizens.\n\n# Bart and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] squirt condiments from a highway overpass onto cars, then go to the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Kwik-E Mart|Kwik-E-Mart]].\n# [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] closes the Kwik-E-Mart for five minutes to attend a party at [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon|Sanjay's]] house, trapping [[Hans Moleman|Moleman]] in the store.\n# Bart unknowingly throws [[Chewing gum|gum]] in [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa's]] hair, and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] tries to remove the gum by putting peanut butter and mayonnaise on her hair.\n# While outside, Lisa's hair attracts a swarm of bees, one of which flies away.\n# [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] gets stung by the bee while bike riding with [[Mr. Burns]], and suffers an allergic reaction.\n# [[Nick Riviera|Dr. Nick]] is criticized by the hospital board for his [[Quackery|unorthodox medical procedures]].\n# Dr. Nick treats [[Grampa Simpson|Grampa]] with an electric light socket and saves his medical career.\n# [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] gets robbed by [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Snake|Snake]] after [[Barney Gumble|Barney]] gives him $2,000 to pay for a portion of his bar tab.\n# While hosting [[Superintendent Chalmers]] for lunch, [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] burns his roast and bluffs his way through the meal.\n# [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] accidentally traps [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] in a newspaper vending box.\n# [[Chief Wiggum]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]], and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Eddie|Eddie]] compare [[McDonald's]] and [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Krusty Burger|Krusty Burger]].\n# [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Bumblebee Man|Bumblebee Man]] arrives home after a horrible day at work and his house is destroyed, causing his wife to leave him.\n# Snake runs Wiggum over, and their ensuing fight ends with [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Herman Hermann|Herman]] capturing them at gunpoint in his store.\n# [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy|Reverend Lovejoy]] urges his pet [[Old English Sheepdog]] to use [[Ned Flanders]]'s lawn as a toilet.\n# Various townspeople advise Marge and Lisa how to remove the gum stuck in Lisa's hair.\n# [[Cletus Spuckler|Cletus]] offers [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Brandine|Brandine]] some shoes he found on a [[telephone line]].\n# Milhouse tries to use the bathroom in [[Comic Book Guy|Comic Book Guy's]] [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop|Android's Dungeon]], but is forced to leave the store before he can use it.\n# Milhouse goes with [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Kirk Van Houten|his father]] to use the bathroom in Herman's store and accidentally knocks out Herman with a [[Flail (weapon)|flail]], saving his father, Snake, and Wiggum.\n# [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Old Barber|Jake the barber]] cuts the gum out of Lisa's hair, leaving her with a different hairstyle.\n# [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] laughs at an extremely tall man in a small car, who then humiliates Nelson to teach him a lesson.\n# Bart and Milhouse squirt ketchup and mustard onto Nelson from the overpass, and conclude that life is interesting in their town after all. \n# [[Professor Frink]] attempts to tell his story but is cut off by the ending credits.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n==Production==\nThe episode's principal idea came from the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] episode \"[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]\", which contained a short sequence entitled \"The Adventures of [[Ned Flanders]]\", featuring its own title card and theme song, at its conclusion. The scene has no relevance to the main plot of the episode and was designed solely as [[Filler (media)|filler]] to accommodate the episode's short runtime.<ref name=Oakley>{{cite video |last=Oakley|first=Bill|author-link=Bill Oakley|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The staff loved the concept and attempted to fit similar scenes into other episodes, but none were short enough to require one. [[Show runner]]s [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] decided to make an entire episode of linked short scenes involving many of the show's characters, in a similar style to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''.<ref name=Oakley/> The title \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" was decided upon from the start of the episode's production,<ref name=Oakley/> even though there are not actually twenty-two stories in it.<ref name=Weinstein>{{cite video|last=Weinstein|first=Josh|author-link=Josh Weinstein|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Originally there were more scenes, but several of them had to be cut out for time.<ref name=Oakley/> To decide who would write each of the segments, all of the writers chose their top three favorite characters and put them into a hat, the names were drawn out and the writers were assigned their parts.<ref name=Oakley/> Oakley wrote the [[Superintendent Chalmers]] story,<ref name=Oakley/> Weinstein did the [[Comic Book Guy]] and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] scene,<ref name=Weinstein/> [[David X.

The main reason he loved him was that, until Frank Grimes was created for the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]] episode \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\", Chalmers was the only character that \"seemed to operate in the normal human universe\".<ref name=Oakley/> In previous episodes, Skinner and Chalmers' scenes together revolved around one joke: Skinner tells Chalmers an unbelievable lie, but Chalmers believes him anyway. So, their scene in this episode is made up of a string of thirteen interconnected lies.<ref name=Oakley/> The dialogue between him and Skinner was something that had never been done before, in that it is just a long relaxed conversation with nothing important being said at all.<ref name=Cohen/>\n\nIn the Mr. Burns story, every single word he yells at Smithers is real and used correctly. To maintain accuracy, the writers used a 19th-century slang thesaurus to look up words.<ref name=Weinstein/> Many of the Spanish words used in Bumblebee Man's segment are easily understood cognates of English and not accurate Spanish; this was done deliberately so that non-Spanish speakers could understand the dialogue without subtitles.<ref name=Weinstein/><ref name=Pulido>{{cite video|last=Pulido|first=Rachel|author-link=Rachel Pulido|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The very tall man was a caricature of writer [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]],<ref name=Weinstein/> and the crowd on the street who laugh at Nelson includes caricatures of [[Matt Groening]], Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein. Oakley wrote in the script that the street was filled with Springfield's biggest idiots and so the animators drew him, Weinstein, and Groening into the scene.<ref name=Oakley/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe episode contains numerous references to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''. Like the film, the episode's plot is episodic, though the stories are interconnected. The policemen's conversation about McDonald's parallels the famous \"Royale With Cheese\" discussion,<ref name=\"book\"/><ref name=av/> and the music played during the segment's beginning was also taken from the film.<ref name=Weinstein/> The story involving Chief Wiggum and Snake is a direct parody of the \"Gold Watch\" segment of the film. Snake runs over Wiggum at a red light, alluding to the segment of the film where the character of Butch Coolidge did the same to Marsellus Wallace, before crashing into a fire hydrant and beginning an on-foot chase.<ref name=Weinstein/><ref name=av/> The two run into [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Herman Hermann|Herman]]'s Military Antique shop, where Herman beats, ties up and gags the two, then waits for \"Zed\" to arrive, exactly as Maynard does in ''Pulp Fiction''.<ref name=\"book\"/><ref name=av>{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-simpsons-22-short-films-about-springfield,39518/|title=The Simpsons, \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"|work=[[The A.V.
