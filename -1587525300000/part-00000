A parallel event for women's teams, now known as the [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup]], is also held quadrennially. From 1986 through 2014, the men's and women's championships were held in the same year, though in different countries. The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation. The winning team receives the [[Naismith Trophy]], first awarded in [[1967 FIBA World Championship|1967]]. The current champions are [[Spain men's national basketball team|Spain]], who defeated [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]] in the final of the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nFollowing the 2014 FIBA championships for men and women, the men's World Cup was scheduled on a new four-year cycle to avoid conflict with the FIFA World Cup. The men's World Cup was held in 2019, in the year following the FIFA World Cup. The women's championship, which was renamed from \"FIBA World Championship for Women\" to \"FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup\", after its 2014 edition, will remain on the previous four-year cycle, with championships in the same year as the FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe [[1994 FIBA World Championship]], which was held in [[Canada]], was the first FIBA World Cup tournament in which currently active US [[NBA]] players, that had also already played in an official NBA regular season game, were allowed to participate. All FIBA World Championship/World Cup tournaments since then, are thus considered as fully [[professional sports|professional]] level tournaments.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the FIBA Basketball World Cup}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:FIBA World Cup host countries.png|thumb|300px|World map depicting the number of times a country has hosted the World Cup.

The FIBA Congress, seeing how successful the 23-team [[Basketball at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]] was that year, agreed to the proposal, beginning with a tournament in [[1950 FIBA World Championship|1950]].

Between 1963 and 1990, the tournament was dominated by the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]], the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]], [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavia]], and [[Brazil national basketball team|Brazil]] who together accounted for every medal at the tournament.\n\nThe [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] held in [[Toronto]] marked the beginning of a new era, as currently active American [[NBA]] players participated in the tournament for the first time (prior to that only European and South American professionals were allowed to participate as they were still classified as amateurs<ref>https://www.usab.com/history/why-can-pros-complete-in-international-events.aspx</ref>),<ref>{{cite news |first=Jack |last=McCallum |title=Lords of the Rings |date=18 February 1991 |work=Sports Illustrated |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1118882/1/index.htm |accessdate=7 September 2010 }}</ref> while the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia]] split into many new states. The United States dominated that year and won gold, while the former states of the USSR and Yugoslavia, [[Russia national basketball team|Russia]] and [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatia]], won silver and bronze. The [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], held in [[Greece]] ([[Athens]] and [[Piraeus]]), lost some of its luster when the [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout]] prevented [[NBA]] players from participating. The new [[Serbia national basketball team|Yugoslavian]] team, now consisting of the former Yugoslav republics of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], won the gold medal over Russia, while the USA, with professional basketball players playing in Europe and two college players, finished third.\n\nIn [[2002 FIBA World Championship|2002]], other nations eventually caught up to the four powerhouse countries and their successor states. [[FR Yugoslavia national basketball team|FR Yugoslavia]], led by [[Peja Stojakovi\u0107]] of the [[Sacramento Kings]] and [[Dejan Bodiroga]] of [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|FC Barcelona]] won the final game against [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]], while [[Dirk Nowitzki]], who was the [[FIBA World Cup MVP|tournament's MVP]], led [[Germany national basketball team|Germany]] to the bronze, its first ever World Championship medal.  Meanwhile, the United States team, this time made up of NBA players, struggled to a sixth-place finish. This new era of parity convinced FIBA to expand the tournament to 24 teams for the 2006, [[2010 FIBA World Championship|2010]], and [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2014]] editions of the tournament.<ref name=\"Secretary\">{{cite news |first=FIBA |last=Secretary |title=Press Release no. 42: \"BAD Badtz-Maru\" launched as official mascot for Japan 2006 |date=13 December 2005 |publisher=FIBA |url=http://www.fiba.com/ce/pages/en/events/blockbusters/world_champ_men_06/article_World_Champ_Men.asp?cookietest=done&r_act_news=10383&r_cat=8 |accessdate=7 September 2010 |location=Geneva/Tokyo }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=FIBA |last=Secretary |title=ESP&nbsp;\u2013 Spain selected to host 2014 World Championship |date=5 May 2009 |publisher=[[FIBA]] |url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/30278/arti.html |accessdate=7 September 2010 |location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nIn [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]], emerging powerhouse [[Spain national basketball team|Spain]] beat [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]] in the first appearance in the final for both teams.

At the first tournament, FIBA intended for the three Olympic medalists to compete, plus the host Argentina and two teams each from Europe, Asia, and South America. However, no Asian team was willing to travel to the event, so six of the ten teams were from the Americas (all three Olympic medalists were from the Americas, plus the zone received two continental berths and an Asia's berth). The former European powerhouse [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]], later made their first tournament appearance in [[1959 FIBA World Championship|1959]], after missing the first two events.\n\nIn the tournament's early years, only [[EuroBasket|Europe]] and [[South American Basketball Championship|South America]] had established continental tournaments, so participation in the tournament was largely by invitation.  Later, [[FIBA Asia Championship|Asia]] added a continental championship in 1960, followed by [[FIBA Africa Championship|Africa]] in 1962, [[Centrobasket|Central America]] in 1965, and [[FIBA Oceania Championship|Oceania]] in 1971, As a result of these changes, qualification became more formalized starting with the [[1967 FIBA World Championship|1967 tournament]].  In that year, the Asian champion received an automatic berth in the tournament, joining the top European and South American teams.  In [[1970 FIBA World Championship|1970]], the African and Oceanian champion each received a berth, while the Centrobasket champion and runner-up were each invited.  For most of these years, the tournament host, defending World Champion, and top [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournament]] finishers also qualified for the event.\n\nFrom 1970 through the 2014 World Cup, qualification continued to be based on the continental competitions and the Olympic tournament.  The only major change came in the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]], when the tournament started taking qualifiers from the newly redesigned [[FIBA Americas Championship]] rather than from North, Central, and South America individually.  After the tournament expanded to 24 teams in [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]], the tournament allocated qualification as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/Qualifiers/p/qualifiers.html |title=How they got there |publisher=FIBA.com |accessdate=8 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910175341/http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/Qualifiers/p/qualifiers.html |archive-date=10 September 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n* '''[[EuroBasket|FIBA EuroBasket]] (Europe)'''&nbsp;\u2013 6 berths\n* '''[[AfroBasket|FIBA AfroBasket]] (Africa)'''&nbsp;\u2013 3 berths\n* '''[[FIBA Asia Cup]] (Asia) '''&nbsp;\u2013 3 berths\n* '''[[FIBA AmeriCup]] (Americas)'''&nbsp;\u2013 5 berths\n* '''[[FIBA Oceania Championship]] (Oceania)'''&nbsp;\u2013 2 berths\n* '''[[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Defending Olympic Champion]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 1 berth, removed from the zone of the Olympic champion\n* '''Host team'''&nbsp;\u2013 1 berth\n* '''FIBA-selected [[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 4 berths\n\nEach of the five continental championships also served as qualification for the Olympics, so all were held every two years.

For example, all of the berths at the [[2010 FIBA World Championship]] were determined by continental championships held in [[2010 FIBA World Championship qualification|2009]].  After the first 20 teams qualified, FIBA then selected four wild card teams, based on sporting, economic, and governance criteria, as well as a required registration fee from each team to be considered by the FIBA board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/event-guide/p/wild-card.html |title=Wild cards for Turkey 2010 |publisher=FIBA.com |accessdate=8 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830145914/http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/event-guide/p/wild-card.html |archive-date=30 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Of the four wild cards, only three could come from one continental zone.

In each qualifying zone, nations are divided into Division A and Division B, with [[promotion and relegation]] between the two.

The first tournament, in [[1950 FIBA World Championship|1950]], began with a ten-team [[double-elimination tournament]], followed by a six-team [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] round to determine the champion.  Between 1954 and 1974, each tournament started with a group stage preliminary round; the top teams in each preliminary round group then moved on to a final round robin group to determine the champion.  In [[1978 FIBA World Championship|1978]], FIBA added a gold medal game between the top two finishers in the final group and a bronze medal game between the third and fourth place teams.  In each year between 1959 and 1982, the host team received a bye into the final group.  Of the seven host teams in this era, only three won medals, despite the head start.  As a result, FIBA made the host team compete in the preliminary round starting in [[1986 FIBA World Championship|1986]].\n\nIn 1986, the tournament briefly expanded to 24 teams.  Four groups of six teams each competed in the preliminary round group stage.  The top three teams in each group then competed in the second group stage, followed by a four-team knockout tournament between the top two finishers in each group.  The championship contracted back down to 16 teams for the [[1990 FIBA World Championship|1990 tournament]].  The three tournaments between 1990 and 1998, each had two group stages followed by a four-team knockout tournament to determine the medalists.  The [[2002 FIBA World Championship|2002 tournament]] expanded the knockout round to eight teams.\n\nIn [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]], FIBA made the decision to expand back to 24 teams and introduced the format that was in place through [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2014]].<ref name=\"Secretary\"/> Under that format, the teams were divided into four preliminary round groups of six teams each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/p/system-competition.html |title=System of Competition |work=FIBA.com |publisher=[[FIBA]] |accessdate=7 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711190225/http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/p/system-competition.html |archive-date=11 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019]], the final tournament will expand to 32 teams.<ref name=\"New calendar\"/><br/>\nIf the teams should be tied at the end of the preliminary round, the ties are broken by the following criteria in order:\n#Game results between tied teams\n#[[Goal average]] between games of the tied teams\n#Goal average for all games of the tied teams\n#Drawing of lots\nThe top two teams in each group then advance to a sixteen-team single-elimination knockout round.  It begins with the eighth finals, where the top teams in each group play the fourth-placed teams in another group and the second and third-placed teams in each group face off.  This is followed by the quarterfinals, semi-finals, and final.  The semi-final losers play in the bronze medal game, while the quarterfinal losers play in a consolation bracket to determine fifth through eighth places.\n\n==Naismith Trophy==\n{{main|Naismith Trophy}}\n[[File:FIBA Basketball Championships countries.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of best finishes per team.

A trophy had been planned since the [[1950 FIBA World Championship|first World Championship in 1950]], but did not come to fruition until FIBA finally commissioned a trophy in 1965, after receiving a US$1,000 donation.  The original trophy was used from 1967 through [[1994 FIBA World Championship|1994]].

At the first tournament, FIBA intended for the three Olympic medalists to compete, plus the host Argentina and two teams each from Europe, Asia, and South America. However, no Asian team was willing to travel to the event, so six of the ten teams were from the Americas (all three Olympic medalists were from the Americas, plus the zone received two continental berths and an Asia's berth). The former European powerhouse [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]], later made their first tournament appearance in [[1959 FIBA World Championship|1959]], after missing the first two events.\n\nIn the tournament's early years, only [[EuroBasket|Europe]] and [[South American Basketball Championship|South America]] had established continental tournaments, so participation in the tournament was largely by invitation.  Later, [[FIBA Asia Championship|Asia]] added a continental championship in 1960, followed by [[FIBA Africa Championship|Africa]] in 1962, [[Centrobasket|Central America]] in 1965, and [[FIBA Oceania Championship|Oceania]] in 1971, As a result of these changes, qualification became more formalized starting with the [[1967 FIBA World Championship|1967 tournament]].  In that year, the Asian champion received an automatic berth in the tournament, joining the top European and South American teams.  In [[1970 FIBA World Championship|1970]], the African and Oceanian champion each received a berth, while the Centrobasket champion and runner-up were each invited.  For most of these years, the tournament host, defending World Champion, and top [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournament]] finishers also qualified for the event.\n\nFrom 1970 through the 2014 World Cup, qualification continued to be based on the continental competitions and the Olympic tournament.  The only major change came in the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]], when the tournament started taking qualifiers from the newly redesigned [[FIBA Americas Championship]] rather than from North, Central, and South America individually.  After the tournament expanded to 24 teams in [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]], the tournament allocated qualification as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/Qualifiers/p/qualifiers.html |title=How they got there |publisher=FIBA.com |accessdate=8 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910175341/http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/Qualifiers/p/qualifiers.html |archive-date=10 September 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n* '''[[EuroBasket|FIBA EuroBasket]] (Europe)'''&nbsp;\u2013 6 berths\n* '''[[AfroBasket|FIBA AfroBasket]] (Africa)'''&nbsp;\u2013 3 berths\n* '''[[FIBA Asia Cup]] (Asia) '''&nbsp;\u2013 3 berths\n* '''[[FIBA AmeriCup]] (Americas)'''&nbsp;\u2013 5 berths\n* '''[[FIBA Oceania Championship]] (Oceania)'''&nbsp;\u2013 2 berths\n* '''[[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Defending Olympic Champion]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 1 berth, removed from the zone of the Olympic champion\n* '''Host team'''&nbsp;\u2013 1 berth\n* '''FIBA-selected [[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 4 berths\n\nEach of the five continental championships also served as qualification for the Olympics, so all were held every two years.

The first tournament, in [[1950 FIBA World Championship|1950]], began with a ten-team [[double-elimination tournament]], followed by a six-team [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] round to determine the champion.  Between 1954 and 1974, each tournament started with a group stage preliminary round; the top teams in each preliminary round group then moved on to a final round robin group to determine the champion.  In [[1978 FIBA World Championship|1978]], FIBA added a gold medal game between the top two finishers in the final group and a bronze medal game between the third and fourth place teams.  In each year between 1959 and 1982, the host team received a bye into the final group.  Of the seven host teams in this era, only three won medals, despite the head start.  As a result, FIBA made the host team compete in the preliminary round starting in [[1986 FIBA World Championship|1986]].\n\nIn 1986, the tournament briefly expanded to 24 teams.  Four groups of six teams each competed in the preliminary round group stage.  The top three teams in each group then competed in the second group stage, followed by a four-team knockout tournament between the top two finishers in each group.  The championship contracted back down to 16 teams for the [[1990 FIBA World Championship|1990 tournament]].  The three tournaments between 1990 and 1998, each had two group stages followed by a four-team knockout tournament to determine the medalists.  The [[2002 FIBA World Championship|2002 tournament]] expanded the knockout round to eight teams.\n\nIn [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]], FIBA made the decision to expand back to 24 teams and introduced the format that was in place through [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2014]].<ref name=\"Secretary\"/> Under that format, the teams were divided into four preliminary round groups of six teams each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/p/system-competition.html |title=System of Competition |work=FIBA.com |publisher=[[FIBA]] |accessdate=7 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711190225/http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/p/system-competition.html |archive-date=11 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019]], the final tournament will expand to 32 teams.<ref name=\"New calendar\"/><br/>\nIf the teams should be tied at the end of the preliminary round, the ties are broken by the following criteria in order:\n#Game results between tied teams\n#[[Goal average]] between games of the tied teams\n#Goal average for all games of the tied teams\n#Drawing of lots\nThe top two teams in each group then advance to a sixteen-team single-elimination knockout round.  It begins with the eighth finals, where the top teams in each group play the fourth-placed teams in another group and the second and third-placed teams in each group face off.

FIBA's original name (Federation Internationale de Basketball Amateur) is also engraved at the trophy's \"hoop\". The trophy was designed by Radiant, and handcrafted by the silversmith [[Thomas Lyte]].\n\n==Summary==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n!rowspan=2

The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colors). They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the [[tepals]] (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily [[family (biology)|family]], [[Liliaceae]], along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to ''[[Amana (plant)|Amana]]'', ''[[Erythronium]]'' and ''[[Gagea]]'' in the tribe [[Lilieae]]. There are about 75 [[species]], and these are divided among four [[subgenera]]. The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a [[Persian language|Persian]] word for [[turban]], which it may have been thought to resemble. Tulips originally were found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to [[Central Asia]], but since the seventeenth century have become widely [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] and cultivated (''see map''). In their natural state they are adapted to [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|steppes]] and [[mountainous]] areas with [[temperate climates]]. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\n\nTulips grew wild in the [[Tien Shan]] Mountains and were cultivated in Istanbul in 1055. In the 15th century, tulips were among the most prized flowers; the flower was the symbol of the Ottomans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/|title=There Never Was a Real Tulip Fever|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> While tulips had probably been cultivated in Persia from the tenth century, they did not come to the attention of the West until the sixteenth century, when Western diplomats to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court observed and reported on them.  They were rapidly introduced into Europe and became a frenzied commodity during [[Tulip mania]]. Tulips were frequently depicted in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s, and have become associated with the Netherlands, the major producer for world markets, ever since. In the seventeenth century Netherlands, during the time of the Tulip mania, an infection of tulip bulbs by the [[tulip breaking virus]] created [[variegation|variegated]] patterns in the tulip flowers that were much admired and valued. While truly broken tulips do not exist anymore, the closest available specimens today are part of the  group known as the Rembrandts \u2013 so named because [[Rembrandt]] painted some of the most admired breaks of his time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBreeding programs have produced thousands of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] and [[cultivar]]s in addition to the original species (known in [[horticulture]] as botanical tulips).  They are popular throughout the world, both as [[ornamental garden plants]] and as [[cut flowers]].\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| header    = Tulip [[plant morphology|morphology]]\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 130\n| image1    = Tulipa fringed - burgundy lace - bulbs.jpg\n| caption1  = '''[[Bulbs]]''', showing [[tunica (biology)|tunic]] and scales\n| alt1      = Collection of tulip bulbs, some sliced to show interior scales\n| image2    = Tulipa orphanidea 060506.jpg\n| caption2  = Cup-shaped flower of ''[[Tulipa orphanidea]]''\n| alt2      = Flower of Tulipa orphanidea, showing cup shape\n| image3    = Tulip Tulipa clusiana 'Lady Jane' Rock Ledge Flower 2000px.jpg\n| caption3  = Star-shaped flower of ''[[Tulipa clusiana]]'' with three [[sepals]] and three [[petals]], forming six identical [[tepals]]\n| alt3      = Photograph of Tulipa clusiana, showing six identical tepals (petals and sepals)\n}}\n''Tulipa'' (tulips) is a genus of spring-blooming [[perennial]] [[herbaceous]] [[bulb]]iferous [[geophytes]], dying back after flowering to an underground storage bulb.  Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between {{convert|4|in|cm}} and {{convert|28|in|cm}} high.\n\n[[Flowers]]: The tulip's flowers are usually large and are [[actinomorphic]] (radially symmetric) and [[hermaphrodite]] (contain both male ([[androecium]]) and female ([[gynoecium]]) characteristics), generally erect, or more rarely [[pendulous]], and are arranged more usually as a single terminal flower, or when [[pluriflor]] as two to three (e.g. ''[[Tulipa turkestanica]]''), but up to four, flowers on the end of a [[:wikt:floriferous|floriferous]] [[Plant stem|stem]] ([[scape (botany)|scape]]), which is single arising from amongst the basal leaf rosette. In structure, the flower is generally cup or star shaped. As with other members of [[Liliaceae]] the [[perianth]] is undifferentiated ([[perigonium]]) and biseriate (two [[Whorl (botany)|whorled]]), formed from six free (i.e. [[perianth#Flowering plants|apotepalous]]) [[caducous]] [[tepals]] arranged into two separate whorls of three parts ([[Merosity|trimerous]]) each. The two whorls represent three [[petal]]s and three [[sepals]], but are termed [[tepal]]s because they are nearly identical. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal like), being brightly coloured, but each whorl may be different, or have different coloured blotches at their bases, forming darker colouration on the interior surface. The inner petals have a small, delicate cleft at the top, while the sturdier outer ones form uninterrupted ovals.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Botany of Desire|last=Pollan|first=Michael|publisher=Random House|year=2002|isbn=0-375-76039-3|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesire00poll/page/95 95]|url=https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesire00poll/page/95}}</ref> Tulip flowers come in a wide variety of colours, except pure blue (several tulips with \"blue\" in the name have a faint violet hue), and have absent [[nectaries]].{{sfn|King|2005|p=164}}{{sfn|Tenenbaum|2003|p=395}}{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}{{sfn|Grey-Wilson|Matthews|1980}} Tulip flowers are generally bereft of scent and are the coolest of floral characters. The Dutch regarded this lack of scent as a virtue, as it demonstrates the flower's chasteness.<ref name=\":1\" />\n \n[[Androecium]]: The flowers have six distinct, basifixed [[introrse]] [[stamen]]s arranged in two whorls of three, which vary in length and may be glabrous or hairy.

Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip's leaf is [[glossary of botanical terms#cauline|cauline]] (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem.

Within Liliaceae, Tulipa is placed within [[Lilioideae]], one of three subfamilies, with two [[tribe (biology)|tribes]]. Tribe [[Lilieae]] includes seven other genera in addition to Tulipa.\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n\nThe genus, which includes about 75 [[species]], is divided into four [[subgenera]].{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n* Clusianae (4 species)\n* Orithyia (4 species)\n* Tulipa (52 species)\n* Eriostemones (16 species)\n\n===Etymology===\nThe word ''tulip'', first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \"Turkish Letters\" of diplomat [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], first appeared in English as ''tulipa'' or ''tulipant'', entering the language by way of {{lang-fr|tulipe}} and its obsolete form ''tulipan'' or by way of Modern Latin ''tulipa'', from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''t\u00fclbend'' (\"[[muslin]]\" or \"[[gauze]]\"), and may be ultimately derived from the {{lang-fa|\u062f\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f}} ''delband'' (\"[[Turban]]\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tulip&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Tulip |website=Etymplogy Online |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}</ref> This may have been due to a translation error in early times when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans.

From there it extends eastwards through [[Jerevan]], (Armenia) and [[Baku]] ([[Azerbaijan]]) and on the eastern shore of the [[Caspian Sea]] through [[Turkmenistan]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Tashkent]] (Uzbekistan), to  the eastern end of the range in the [[Pamir-Alai]] and [[Tien-Shan]] mountains in [[Central Asia]], which form the [[centre of diversity]].<ref name=pavord6/> Further to the east, ''Tulipa'' is found in the western [[Himalayas]], southern [[Siberia]], Inner Mongolia, and as far as the northwest of China.

In addition to these regions in the west tulips have been identified in Greece, Cyprus and the [[Balkans]]. In the south, Iran marks its furthest extent, while the northern limit is the Ukraine.{{sfn|King|2005|p=16}} Although tulips are also throughout most of the Mediterranean and Europe, these regions do not form part of the natural distribution. Tulips were brought to Europe by travellers and merchants from [[Anatolia]] and Central Asia for cultivation, from where they escaped and naturalised (''see map''). For instance, less than half of those species found in Turkey are actually native.{{sfn|Marais|1984}} These have been referred to as neo-tulipae.{{sfn|Hall|1940}}{{sfn|Eker et al|2014}}{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n\nTulips are indigenous to [[mountainous]] areas with [[temperate climate]]s, where they are a common element of [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|steppe]] and winter-rain [[Mediterranean vegetation]].

While the virus produces fantastically streaked flowers, it also weakens plants and reduces the number of offsets produced. Dutch growers would go to extraordinary lengths during tulipomania to make tulips break, borrowing alchemists\u2019 techniques and resorting to sprinkling paint powders of the desired hue or pigeon droppings onto flower roots.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTulips affected by the mosaic virus are called \"broken\"; while such plants can occasionally revert to a plain or solid colouring, they will remain infected and have to be destroyed. Today the virus is almost eradicated from tulip growers' fields. The multicoloured patterns of modern varieties result from breeding; they normally have solid, un-feathered borders between the colours.\n\nTulip growth is also dependent on temperature conditions. Slightly germinated plants show greater growth if subjected to a period of cool dormancy, known as [[vernalization|vernalisation]]. Furthermore, although flower development is induced at warmer temperatures (20\u201325\u2009\u00b0C), elongation of the flower stalk and proper flowering is dependent on an extended period of low temperature (<10\u2009\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rietveld|first=Patrick L.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Clare|date=March 2000|title=Low temperature sensing in tulip (Tulipa gesneriana L.) is mediated through an increased response to auxin|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=51|issue=344|pages=587\u2013594|doi=10.1093/jexbot/51.344.587|pmid=10938815|doi-access=free}}</ref> Tulip bulbs imported to warm-winter areas are often planted in autumn to be treated as annuals.\n\nThe colour of tulip flowers also vary with growing conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Nard|first=M.|last2=Biot|first2=E.|title=Measurement of Colour Variation of Tulip Flowers Grown in Different Conditions|date=1997|doi=10.17660/ActaHortic.1997.430.133|journal=International Society for Horticultural Science|volume=10|issue=430|pages=837\u2013842}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\n===History===\n\n====Islamic World====\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 717) (8447528823).jpg|thumb|upright|''Tulipa sylvestris'' subsp.

He planted tulips at the Vienna Imperial Botanical Gardens in 1573. He finished the first major work on tulips in 1592 and made note of the variations in colour. After he was appointed the director of the [[Leiden University]]'s newly established [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]], he planted both a teaching garden and his private garden with tulips in late 1593. Thus, 1594 is considered the date of the tulip's first flowering in the [[Netherlands]], despite reports of the cultivation of tulips in private gardens in [[Antwerp]] and [[Amsterdam]] two or three decades earlier. These tulips at Leiden would eventually lead to both the [[tulip mania]] and the tulip industry in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/magazine/how-a-turkish-blossom-enflamed-the-dutch-landscape.html |title=How A Turkish Blossom Enflamed the Dutch Landscape |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-03-04 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> Over two raids, in 1596 and in 1598, more than one hundred bulbs were stolen from his garden.\n\nTulips spread rapidly across Europe and more opulent varieties such as double tulips were already known in Europe by the early 17th century.

N''ouveaux riches'' seeking wealthy displays embraced the exotic plant market, especially in the Low Countries where gardens had become fashionable. A craze for bulbs soon grew in France, where in the early 17th century, entire properties were exchanged as payment for a single tulip bulb. The value of the flower gave it a special \u2018aura\u2019 of mystique, and numerous publications describing varieties in lavish garden manuals were published, cashing in on the value of the flower.

''Tulipa \u00d7gesneriana'' is in itself an early hybrid of complex origin and is probably not the same taxon as was described by [[Conrad Gessner]] in the 16th century.{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n\n====Introduction to the United States====\n[[File:The_Dallas_Arboretum_and_Botanical_Garden.jpg|thumb|The [[Dallas]] Arboretum and Botanical Garden]]\nIt is believed the first tulips in the [[United States]] were grown near [[Spring Pond]] at the Fay Estate in [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]]. From 1847 to 1865, Richard Sullivan Fay, Esq., one of Lynn's wealthiest men, settled on {{convert|500|acre|km2}} located partly in present-day Lynn and partly in present-day Salem. Mr. Fay imported many different trees and plants from all parts of the world and planted them among the meadows of the Fay Estate.<ref>The Daily Item, Lynn, Mass.

Seeds are most often used to propagate [[species]] and [[subspecies]] or to create new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]. Many tulip species can [[cross-pollination|cross-pollinate]] with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]].\n\nOffsets require a year or more of growth before plants are large enough to flower. Tulips grown from seeds often need five to eight years before plants are of flowering size. To prevent cross-pollination, increase the growth rate of bulbs and increase the vigour and size of offsets, the flower and stems of a field of commercial tulips are usually [[Topping (agriculture)|topped]] using large tractor-mounted mowing heads. The same goals can be achieved by a private gardener by clipping the stem and flower of an individual specimen. Commercial growers usually harvest the tulip bulbs in late summer and grade them into sizes; bulbs large enough to flower are sorted and sold, while smaller bulbs are sorted into sizes and replanted for sale in the future.\n\nBecause of the fact that tulip bulbs don't reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct. Unlike other flowers that do not suffer this same limitation, the Tulip's historical forms do not survive alongside their modern incarnations.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Horticultural classification===\n[[File:Tulip Gavota.jpg|thumb|'Gavota', a division 3 cultivar]]\n[[File:Yonina Tulip.jpg|thumb|'Yonina', a division 6 cultivar]]\n[[File:Kvetouc\u00ed tulip\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|'Texas Flame', a division 10 cultivar]]\nIn horticulture, tulips are divided into fifteen groups (Divisions) mostly based on flower morphology and plant size.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brickell |first1=Christopher |first2=Judith D. |last2=Zuk |year=1997 |title=The American Horticultural Society A\u2013Z encyclopedia of garden plants |location=New York, N.Y. |publisher=DK Pub. |isbn=978-0-7894-1943-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanhorticul00chri/page/1028 1028] |url=https://archive.org/details/americanhorticul00chri/page/1028 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theplantexpert.com/springbulbs/TulipIntro.html |title=Tulips |publisher=The Plant Expert |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref>\n*'''Div. 1: Single early''' \u2013 with cup-shaped single flowers, no larger than 8&nbsp;cm across (3&nbsp;inches).

Therefore, larger tulip bulbs would require deeper holes.

In the poem ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' by [[Sa'di (poet)|Musharrifu'd-din Saadi]], described a visionary garden paradise with \"The murmur of a cool stream / bird song, ripe fruit in plenty / bright multicoloured tulips and fragrant roses...\"{{sfn|Pavord|1999|p=31}} In recent times, tulips have featured in the poems of [[Simin Behbahani]].\n\nTulips are called ''lale'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (from [[Persian language|Persian]]: \"laleh\" \u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647). When written in Arabic letters, \"lale\" has the same letters as ''Allah'', which is why the flower became a holy symbol. It was also associated with the House of [[Ottoman dynasty|Osman]], resulting in tulips being widely used in decorative motifs on tiles, mosques, fabrics, crockery, etc. in the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}} The tulip was seen as a symbol of abundance and indulgence. The era during which the Ottoman Empire was wealthiest is often called the [[Tulip era]] or ''Lale Devri'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].\n\nThe shape of [[emblem of Iran]] is chosen to resemble a tulip, in memory of the people who died for Iran. According to Iranian folklore, when a martyr dies, a red tulip grows from where he has fallen.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nTulips became popular garden plants in east and west, but, whereas the tulip in Turkish culture was a [[symbol]] of [[paradise]] on earth and had almost a divine status, in the Netherlands it represented the briefness of life.{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n\n''[[The Black Tulip]]'' is a historical romance by [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]. The story takes place in the Dutch city of [[Haarlem]], where a reward is offered to the first grower who can produce a truly black tulip.\n\nWhile tulips can be bred to display a wide variety of colours, black tulips have historically been difficult to achieve. The Queen of the Night tulip is as close to black as a flower gets, though it is, in fact, a dark and glossy maroonish purple - nonetheless, an effect prized by the Dutch.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe first truly black tulip was bred in 1986 by a Dutch flower grower in Bovenkarspel, Netherlands. The specimen was created by cross-breeding two deep purple tulips, the Queen of the Night and Wienerwald tulips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/02/20/Worlds-first-black-tulip-grown-in-Holland/4964509259600/|title=World's first black tulip grown in Holland|date=United Press International Archives|website=United Press International|archive-url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/02/20/Worlds-first-black-tulip-grown-in-Holland/4964509259600/|archive-date=Feb 20, 1986|url-status=|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Semper Augustus was the most expensive tulip during tulip mania. \u201cThe colour is white, with Carmine on a blue base, and with an unbroken flame right to the top\u201d \u2013 wrote Nicolas van Wassenaer in 1624 after seeing the tulip in the garden of one Dr Adriaen Pauw, a director of the new East India Company. With limited specimens in existence at the time and most owned by Pauw, his refusal to sell any flowers, despite wildly escalating offers, is believed by some to have sparked the mania.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy contrast to other flowers such as the coneflower or lotus, tulips have historically been capable of genetically reinventing themselves to suit changes in aesthetic values. In his 1597 herbal, John Gerard says of the tulip that \u201cnature seems to play more with this flower than with any other that I do know.\u201d When in the Netherlands, beauty was defined by marbleized swirls of vivid contrasting colours, the petals of tulips were able to become \"feathered\" and \"flamed.\" However, in the 19th century, when the English desired tulips for carpet bedding and massing, the tulips were able to once again accommodate this by evolving into \u201cpaint filled boxes with the brightest, fattest dabs of pure pigment.\u201d This inherent mutability of the tulip even led the Ottoman Turks to believe that nature cherished this flower above all others.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Tulip is also viewed prominently in a number of the Major Arcana cards of the Oswald Wirth Tarot deck.

The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colors). They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the [[tepals]] (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily [[family (biology)|family]], [[Liliaceae]], along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to ''[[Amana (plant)|Amana]]'', ''[[Erythronium]]'' and ''[[Gagea]]'' in the tribe [[Lilieae]]. There are about 75 [[species]], and these are divided among four [[subgenera]]. The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a [[Persian language|Persian]] word for [[turban]], which it may have been thought to resemble. Tulips originally were found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to [[Central Asia]], but since the seventeenth century have become widely [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] and cultivated (''see map''). In their natural state they are adapted to [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|steppes]] and [[mountainous]] areas with [[temperate climates]]. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\n\nTulips grew wild in the [[Tien Shan]] Mountains and were cultivated in Istanbul in 1055. In the 15th century, tulips were among the most prized flowers; the flower was the symbol of the Ottomans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/|title=There Never Was a Real Tulip Fever|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> While tulips had probably been cultivated in Persia from the tenth century, they did not come to the attention of the West until the sixteenth century, when Western diplomats to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court observed and reported on them.  They were rapidly introduced into Europe and became a frenzied commodity during [[Tulip mania]]. Tulips were frequently depicted in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s, and have become associated with the Netherlands, the major producer for world markets, ever since. In the seventeenth century Netherlands, during the time of the Tulip mania, an infection of tulip bulbs by the [[tulip breaking virus]] created [[variegation|variegated]] patterns in the tulip flowers that were much admired and valued. While truly broken tulips do not exist anymore, the closest available specimens today are part of the  group known as the Rembrandts \u2013 so named because [[Rembrandt]] painted some of the most admired breaks of his time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBreeding programs have produced thousands of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] and [[cultivar]]s in addition to the original species (known in [[horticulture]] as botanical tulips).  They are popular throughout the world, both as [[ornamental garden plants]] and as [[cut flowers]].\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| header    = Tulip [[plant morphology|morphology]]\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 130\n| image1    = Tulipa fringed - burgundy lace - bulbs.jpg\n| caption1  = '''[[Bulbs]]''', showing [[tunica (biology)|tunic]] and scales\n| alt1      = Collection of tulip bulbs, some sliced to show interior scales\n| image2    = Tulipa orphanidea 060506.jpg\n| caption2  = Cup-shaped flower of ''[[Tulipa orphanidea]]''\n| alt2      = Flower of Tulipa orphanidea, showing cup shape\n| image3    = Tulip Tulipa clusiana 'Lady Jane' Rock Ledge Flower 2000px.jpg\n| caption3  = Star-shaped flower of ''[[Tulipa clusiana]]'' with three [[sepals]] and three [[petals]], forming six identical [[tepals]]\n| alt3      = Photograph of Tulipa clusiana, showing six identical tepals (petals and sepals)\n}}\n''Tulipa'' (tulips) is a genus of spring-blooming [[perennial]] [[herbaceous]] [[bulb]]iferous [[geophytes]], dying back after flowering to an underground storage bulb.  Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between {{convert|4|in|cm}} and {{convert|28|in|cm}} high.\n\n[[Flowers]]: The tulip's flowers are usually large and are [[actinomorphic]] (radially symmetric) and [[hermaphrodite]] (contain both male ([[androecium]]) and female ([[gynoecium]]) characteristics), generally erect, or more rarely [[pendulous]], and are arranged more usually as a single terminal flower, or when [[pluriflor]] as two to three (e.g. ''[[Tulipa turkestanica]]''), but up to four, flowers on the end of a [[:wikt:floriferous|floriferous]] [[Plant stem|stem]] ([[scape (botany)|scape]]), which is single arising from amongst the basal leaf rosette. In structure, the flower is generally cup or star shaped. As with other members of [[Liliaceae]] the [[perianth]] is undifferentiated ([[perigonium]]) and biseriate (two [[Whorl (botany)|whorled]]), formed from six free (i.e. [[perianth#Flowering plants|apotepalous]]) [[caducous]] [[tepals]] arranged into two separate whorls of three parts ([[Merosity|trimerous]]) each. The two whorls represent three [[petal]]s and three [[sepals]], but are termed [[tepal]]s because they are nearly identical. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal like), being brightly coloured, but each whorl may be different, or have different coloured blotches at their bases, forming darker colouration on the interior surface. The inner petals have a small, delicate cleft at the top, while the sturdier outer ones form uninterrupted ovals.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Botany of Desire|last=Pollan|first=Michael|publisher=Random House|year=2002|isbn=0-375-76039-3|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesire00poll/page/95 95]|url=https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesire00poll/page/95}}</ref> Tulip flowers come in a wide variety of colours, except pure blue (several tulips with \"blue\" in the name have a faint violet hue), and have absent [[nectaries]].{{sfn|King|2005|p=164}}{{sfn|Tenenbaum|2003|p=395}}{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}{{sfn|Grey-Wilson|Matthews|1980}} Tulip flowers are generally bereft of scent and are the coolest of floral characters.

Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip's leaf is [[glossary of botanical terms#cauline|cauline]] (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem.

Within Liliaceae, Tulipa is placed within [[Lilioideae]], one of three subfamilies, with two [[tribe (biology)|tribes]]. Tribe [[Lilieae]] includes seven other genera in addition to Tulipa.\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n\nThe genus, which includes about 75 [[species]], is divided into four [[subgenera]].{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n* Clusianae (4 species)\n* Orithyia (4 species)\n* Tulipa (52 species)\n* Eriostemones (16 species)\n\n===Etymology===\nThe word ''tulip'', first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \"Turkish Letters\" of diplomat [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], first appeared in English as ''tulipa'' or ''tulipant'', entering the language by way of {{lang-fr|tulipe}} and its obsolete form ''tulipan'' or by way of Modern Latin ''tulipa'', from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''t\u00fclbend'' (\"[[muslin]]\" or \"[[gauze]]\"), and may be ultimately derived from the {{lang-fa|\u062f\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f}} ''delband'' (\"[[Turban]]\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tulip&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Tulip |website=Etymplogy Online |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}</ref> This may have been due to a translation error in early times when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans.

From there it extends eastwards through [[Jerevan]], (Armenia) and [[Baku]] ([[Azerbaijan]]) and on the eastern shore of the [[Caspian Sea]] through [[Turkmenistan]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Tashkent]] (Uzbekistan), to  the eastern end of the range in the [[Pamir-Alai]] and [[Tien-Shan]] mountains in [[Central Asia]], which form the [[centre of diversity]].<ref name=pavord6/> Further to the east, ''Tulipa'' is found in the western [[Himalayas]], southern [[Siberia]], Inner Mongolia, and as far as the northwest of China. While authorities have stated that no tulips west of the Balkans are native,{{sfn|Marais|1984}} subsequent identification of ''[[Tulipa sylvestris]]'' [[subsp.]] ''australis'' as a native of the [[Iberian peninsula]] and adjacent [[North Africa]] shows that this may be a simplification. In addition to these regions in the west tulips have been identified in Greece, Cyprus and the [[Balkans]]. In the south, Iran marks its furthest extent, while the northern limit is the Ukraine.{{sfn|King|2005|p=16}} Although tulips are also throughout most of the Mediterranean and Europe, these regions do not form part of the natural distribution. Tulips were brought to Europe by travellers and merchants from [[Anatolia]] and Central Asia for cultivation, from where they escaped and naturalised (''see map''). For instance, less than half of those species found in Turkey are actually native.{{sfn|Marais|1984}} These have been referred to as neo-tulipae.{{sfn|Hall|1940}}{{sfn|Eker et al|2014}}{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n\nTulips are indigenous to [[mountainous]] areas with [[temperate climate]]s, where they are a common element of [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|steppe]] and winter-rain [[Mediterranean vegetation]].

While the virus produces fantastically streaked flowers, it also weakens plants and reduces the number of offsets produced. Dutch growers would go to extraordinary lengths during tulipomania to make tulips break, borrowing alchemists\u2019 techniques and resorting to sprinkling paint powders of the desired hue or pigeon droppings onto flower roots.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTulips affected by the mosaic virus are called \"broken\"; while such plants can occasionally revert to a plain or solid colouring, they will remain infected and have to be destroyed. Today the virus is almost eradicated from tulip growers' fields. The multicoloured patterns of modern varieties result from breeding; they normally have solid, un-feathered borders between the colours.\n\nTulip growth is also dependent on temperature conditions. Slightly germinated plants show greater growth if subjected to a period of cool dormancy, known as [[vernalization|vernalisation]]. Furthermore, although flower development is induced at warmer temperatures (20\u201325\u2009\u00b0C), elongation of the flower stalk and proper flowering is dependent on an extended period of low temperature (<10\u2009\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rietveld|first=Patrick L.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Clare|date=March 2000|title=Low temperature sensing in tulip (Tulipa gesneriana L.) is mediated through an increased response to auxin|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=51|issue=344|pages=587\u2013594|doi=10.1093/jexbot/51.344.587|pmid=10938815|doi-access=free}}</ref> Tulip bulbs imported to warm-winter areas are often planted in autumn to be treated as annuals.\n\nThe colour of tulip flowers also vary with growing conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Nard|first=M.|last2=Biot|first2=E.|date=1997|title=MEASUREMENT OF COLOUR VARIATION OF TULIP FLOWERS GROWN IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS|url=https://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=430_133|journal=International Society for Horticultural Science|volume=10|pages=837\u2013842|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\n===History===\n\n====Islamic World====\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 717) (8447528823).jpg|thumb|upright|''Tulipa sylvestris'' subsp.

[[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]] illustrated a tulip in 1565 but identified it as a [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]].\n\n[[Carolus Clusius]] is largely responsible for the spread of tulip bulbs in the final years of the sixteenth century. He planted tulips at the Vienna Imperial Botanical Gardens in 1573. He finished the first major work on tulips in 1592 and made note of the variations in colour. After he was appointed the director of the [[Leiden University]]'s newly established [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]], he planted both a teaching garden and his private garden with tulips in late 1593. Thus, 1594 is considered the date of the tulip's first flowering in the [[Netherlands]], despite reports of the cultivation of tulips in private gardens in [[Antwerp]] and [[Amsterdam]] two or three decades earlier. These tulips at Leiden would eventually lead to both the [[tulip mania]] and the tulip industry in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/magazine/how-a-turkish-blossom-enflamed-the-dutch-landscape.html |title=How A Turkish Blossom Enflamed the Dutch Landscape |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-03-04 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> Over two raids, in 1596 and in 1598, more than one hundred bulbs were stolen from his garden.\n\nTulips spread rapidly across Europe and more opulent varieties such as double tulips were already known in Europe by the early 17th century. These curiosities fitted well in an age when natural oddities were cherished and especially in the Netherlands, France, Germany and England, where the spice trade with the East Indies had made many people wealthy. N''ouveaux riches'' seeking wealthy displays embraced the exotic plant market, especially in the Low Countries where gardens had become fashionable. A craze for bulbs soon grew in France, where in the early 17th century, entire properties were exchanged as payment for a single tulip bulb. The value of the flower gave it a special \u2018aura\u2019 of mystique, and numerous publications describing varieties in lavish garden manuals were published, cashing in on the value of the flower. An export business was built up in France, supplying Dutch, Flemish, German and English buyers.

Tulip bulbs had become so expensive that they were treated as a form of currency, or rather, as futures, forcing the Dutch government to introduce trading restrictions on the bulbs.<ref name=\":0\" /> Around this time, the [[ceramic]] [[tulipiere]] was devised for the display of cut flowers stem by stem. Vases and bouquets, usually including tulips, often appeared in [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Still lives|Dutch still-life painting]]. To this day, tulips are associated with the Netherlands, and the cultivated forms of the tulip are often called \"Dutch tulips.\" The Netherlands has the world's largest permanent display of tulips at the [[Keukenhof]].\n\nThe majority of tulip cultivars are classified in the taxon ''[[Tulipa \u00d7gesneriana]]''. They have usually several species in their direct background, but most have been derived from ''[[Tulipa schrenkii|Tulipa suaveolens]]'' (today often regarded as a synonym with ''[[Tulipa schrenkii]]'').

Many tulip species can [[cross-pollination|cross-pollinate]] with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]].\n\nOffsets require a year or more of growth before plants are large enough to flower. Tulips grown from seeds often need five to eight years before plants are of flowering size. To prevent cross-pollination, increase the growth rate of bulbs and increase the vigour and size of offsets, the flower and stems of a field of commercial tulips are usually [[Topping (agriculture)|topped]] using large tractor-mounted mowing heads. The same goals can be achieved by a private gardener by clipping the stem and flower of an individual specimen. Commercial growers usually harvest the tulip bulbs in late summer and grade them into sizes; bulbs large enough to flower are sorted and sold, while smaller bulbs are sorted into sizes and replanted for sale in the future.\n\nBecause of the fact that tulip bulbs don't reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct.

When written in Arabic letters, \"lale\" has the same letters as ''Allah'', which is why the flower became a holy symbol.
