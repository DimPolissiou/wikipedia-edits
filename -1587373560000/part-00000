They are considered to be among the earliest aboriginal inhabitants of the place, and the indigenous traditional Assamese culture of the place grew with them. They have become a minority in the district due to influx of immigrants like Bengalis(both Hindu and Muslim), Biharis, Marwaris etc.\n\n====The Gorkha====\nThe immigrant [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speaking [[Indian Gorkha|Gorkha]] community with a population of over 350,000 (nearly one-fifth of the district's population), is fairly dominant in the central and southern part of the district, especially in the Biswanath Chariali, Gohpur, and Jamugurihat subdivisions.

Later, on account of the partition of India, Hindu people from Bangladesh coming as refugees added significantly to the community. Though their primary language is Bengali most of them speak Assamese too. They are mostly urbanised having a sizeable population in towns of Rangapara, Tezpur, Dhekiajuli, Biswanath Chariali, and Balipara. The population of immigrant Bengali Hindus is over 100,000 in the district.\n\n====Bengali Muslims====\nThere has a sizeable population of immigrant Bengali speaking Muslims living since colonial times in the district mainly in and around char areas of Brahmaputra river and surrounding areas of Dhekiajuli, Thelamara, and Tezpur (Napam).

They are considered to be among the earliest aboriginal inhabitants of the place, and the indigenous traditional Assamese culture of the place grew with them.

Later, on account of the partition of India, Hindu people from Bangladesh coming as refugees added significantly to the community. Though their primary language is Bengali most of them speak Assamese too. They are mostly urbanised having a sizeable population in towns of Rangapara, Tezpur, Dhekiajuli, Biswanath Chariali, and Balipara. The population of immigrant Bengali Hindus is over 100,000 in the district.\n\n====Bengali Muslims====\nThere has a sizeable population of immigrant Bengali speaking Muslims living since colonial times in the district mainly in and around char areas of Brahmaputra river and surrounding areas of Dhekiajuli, Thelamara, and Tezpur (Napam).

[[Military aid]] is material or logistical assistance given to strengthen the military capabilities of an [[Alliance|ally]] country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Securing tyrants or fostering reform? : U.S. internal security assistance to repressive and transitioning regimes|date=2006|publisher=RAND Corp|others=Jones, Seth G., 1972-, International Security and Defense Policy Center., Open Society Institute.|isbn=9780833042620|location=Santa Monica, CA|oclc=184843895}}</ref> [[Humanitarian aid]] is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises such as a [[natural disaster]] or a [[man-made disaster]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/data-guides/defining-humanitarian-aid|title=Defining humanitarian assistance|work=Development Initiatives|access-date=28 May 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Terms or conditions of receipt===\nAid can also be classified according to the terms agreed upon by the [[Donation|donor]] and receiving countries. In this classification, aid can be a [[gift]], a [[Grant (money)|grant]], a low or no interest loan, or a combination of these. The terms of foreign aid are oftentimes influenced by the motives of the giver: a sign of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] approval, to reward a [[government]] for behaviour desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to enhance [[infrastructure]] needed by the donor for the extraction of resources from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of [[commerce|commercial]] access.{{efn|name=Lancaster, pp. 4\u20135}}\n\n===Sources===\nAid can also be classified according to its source. While government aid is generally called foreign aid, aid that originates in institutions of a religious nature is often termed [[faith-based foreign aid]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=8 October 2006|url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/08/bush_brings_faith_to_foreign_aid/?page=2|title=Bush brings faith to foreign aid|work=Boston.com|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> Aid from various sources can reach recipients through bilateral or multilateral delivery systems. \"Bilateral\" refers to government to government transfers. \"Multilateral\" institutions, such as the World Bank or [[UNICEF]], pool aid from one or more sources and disperse it among many recipients.\n\nInternational aid in the form of gifts by individuals or businesses (aka, \"private giving\") are generally administered by [[charities]] or [[philanthropic organization]]s who batch them and then channel these to the recipient country.\n\n===Urgency===\nAid may be also classified based on urgency into emergency aid and development aid. Emergency aid is rapid assistance given to a people in immediate distress by individuals, organizations, or governments to relieve suffering, during and after man-made emergencies (like [[war]]s) and [[natural disaster]]s. The term often carries an international connotation, but this is not always the case. It is often distinguished from [[development aid]] by being focused on relieving suffering caused by natural disaster or conflict, rather than removing the root causes of poverty or vulnerability. Development aid is aid given to support development in general which can be [[economic development]] or social development in [[developing countries]]. It is distinguished from [[humanitarian aid]] as being aimed at alleviating poverty in the long term, rather than alleviating suffering in the short term.\n\n====Emergency aid====\n[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Humanitarian aid in Rajan Kala, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|250px|U.S. soldiers unload humanitarian aid for distribution to the town of Rajan Kala, Afghanistan, 5 December 2009]] The provision of emergency humanitarian aid consists of the provision of vital services (such as food aid to prevent [[starvation]]) by aid agencies, and the provision of funding or in-kind services (like logistics or transport), usually through aid agencies or the government of the affected country. Humanitarian aid is distinguished from [[humanitarian intervention]], which involves armed forces protecting civilians from violent oppression or [[genocide]] by state-supported actors.\n\nThe United Nations [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) is mandated to coordinate the international humanitarian response to a natural disaster or complex emergency acting on the basis of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182|title=A/RES/46/182 - E|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> The [[Geneva Conventions]] give a mandate to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Committee of the Red Cross]] and other impartial humanitarian organizations to provide assistance and protection of civilians during times of war.

[[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) is a commonly used measure of developmental aid.\n\n===Intended use===\nAid given is generally intended for use by a specific end. From this perspective it may be called: \n* Project aid: Aid given for a specific purpose; e.g. building materials for a new school.\n* Programme aid: Aid given for a specific sector; e.g. funding of the education sector of a country.\n** [[Budget support]]: A form of Programme Aid that is directly channelled into the financial system of the recipient country.\n* Sector-wide Approaches (SWAPs): A combination of Project aid and Programme aid/Budget Support; e.g.  support for the education sector in a country will include both funding of education projects (like school buildings) and provide funds to maintain them (like school books).\n* [[Technical assistance]]: Aid involving highly educated or trained personnel, such as doctors, who are moved into a developing country to assist with a program of development. Can be both programme and project aid.\n* Food aid: Food is given to countries in urgent need of food supplies, especially if they have just experienced a natural disaster. Food aid can be provided by importing food from the donor, buying food locally, or providing cash.\n* [[Medical research|International research]], such as research that used for the [[green revolution]] or [[vaccine]]s.\n\n==Official development assistance==\n{{Main|Official development assistance}}\n\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) is a term coined by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) to measure aid. ODA refers to aid from national governments for promoting economic development and welfare in low and middle income countries. ODA can be bilateral or multilateral. This aid is given as either [[grant (money)|grants]], where no repayment is required, or as concessional [[loan]]s, where interest rates are lower than market rates.{{efn|name=Table 1 p. 13|Lancaster uses either ODA or ODA plus OA (\"Official Assistance\" \u2013 another DAC government-aid category) as her main statistic. She considers it better to add the OA but very often just uses the ODA figure alone; e.g., for Table 1.1 (p. 13), Table 2.2 (p. 39) and Table 2.3 (p. 43). In any case the difference is now moot since the DAC recently merged the two categories.}}\n\nLoan repayments to multilateral institutions are pooled and redistributed as new loans. Additionally, debt relief, partial or total cancellation of loan repayments, is often added to total aid numbers even though it is not an actual transfer of funds. It is compiled by the Development Assistance Committee. The [[United Nations]], the [[World Bank]], and many [[Expert|scholars]] use the DAC's ODA figure as their main aid figure because it is easily available and reasonably consistently calculated over time and between countries.{{efn|name=Table 1 p. 13}} The DAC classifies aid in three categories:\n* [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA): Development aid provided to [[developing countries]] (on the \"Part I\" list) and [[international organizations]] with the clear aim of [[economic development]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Official development assistance \u2013 definition and coverage|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm|publisher=OECD|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>\n* ''Official Aid'' (OD): Development aid provided to developed countries (on the \"Part II\" list).\n* ''Other Official Flows'' (OOF): Aid which does not fall into the other two categories, either because it is not aimed at development, or it consists of more than 75% loan (rather than grant).\n\nAid is often ''pledged'' at one point in time, but ''disbursements'' (financial transfers) might not arrive until later.\n\nIn 2009, [[South Korea]] became the first major recipient of ODA from the [[OECD]] to turn into a major donor. The country now provides over $1 billion in aid annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2011/11/30/giving-foreign-aid-helps-korea/|title=Giving Foreign Aid Helps Korea - The Asia Foundation|date=30 November 2011|website=asiafoundation.org}}</ref>\n\n==Not included as international aid==\nMost monetary flows between nations are not counted as aid. These include market-based flows such as [[foreign direct investment]]s and [[portfolio investment]]s, [[remittance]]s from [[migrant worker]]s to their families in their home countries, and [[military aid]]. In 2009, aid in the form of remittances by migrant workers in the [[United States]] to their international families was twice as large as that country's humanitarian aid.<ref name=\"economist.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=894664&story_id=14586906|title=Migration and development: The aid workers who really help|work=economist|accessdate=16 January 2012|date=8 October 2009}}</ref> [[The World Bank]] reported that, worldwide, foreign workers sent $328 billion from richer to poorer countries in 2008, over twice as much as official aid flows from OECD members.<ref name=\"economist.com\"/> The United States does not count military aid in its foreign aid figures.\n\n==Improving aid effectiveness==\n{{Further|Aid effectiveness}}\nThe [[Aid effectiveness#Historical background|High Level Forum]] is a gathering of aid officials and representatives of donor and recipient countries.

Aid is \"stovepiped\" towards narrow, short-term goals relating to particular programs or diseases such as increasing the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatment, and increasing distribution of bed nets. These are band aid solutions to larger problems, as it takes healthcare systems and infrastructure to create significant change.  Donors lack the understanding that effort should be focused on broader measures that affect general well being of the population, and substantial change will take generations to achieve. Aid often does not provide maximum benefit to the recipient, and reflects the interests of the donor.<ref name=\"Garrett\">{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=86|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, consider the breakdown, where aid goes and for what purposes.  In 2002, total gross foreign aid to all developing countries was $76 billion.  Dollars that do not contribute to a country's ability to support basic needs interventions are subtracted.  Subtract $6 billion for debt relief grants. Subtract $11 billion, which is the amount developing countries paid to developed nations in that year in the form of loan repayments.  Next, subtract the aid given to middle income countries, $16 billion.  The remainder, $43 billion, is the amount that developing countries received in 2002.  But only $12 billion went to low-income countries in a form that could be deemed budget support for basic needs.<ref name=\"Sachs\"/> When aid is given to the [[Least Developed Countries]] who have good governments and strategic plans for the aid, it is thought that it is more effective.<ref name=\"Sachs\"/>\n\n===Logistics===\n[[Humanitarian aid]] is argued to often not reach those who are intended to receive it. For example, a report composed by the World Bank in 2006 stated that an estimated half of the funds donated towards health programs in sub-Saharan Africa did not reach the clinics and hospitals. Money is paid out to fake accounts, prices are increased for transport or warehousing, and drugs are sold to the black market. Another example is in Ghana, where approximately 80% of donations do not go towards their intended purposes. This type of corruption only adds to the criticism of aid, as it is not helping those who need it, and may be adding to the problem.<ref name=\"Garrett\"/> Only about one fifth of U.S. aid goes to countries classified by the OECD as 'least developed.'<ref name=\"Singer\"/> This \"pro-rich\" trend is not unique to the United States.<ref name=\"Sachs\">Sachs, Jeffrey D. 2005. The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time. New York: Penguin Books.</ref><ref name=\"Singer\">Singer, Peter. 2009. [[The Life You Can Save]].

For example, an earthquake in 2003 in [[Bam, Iran]] left tens of thousands of people in need of disaster zone aid. Although aid was flown in rapidly, regional belief systems, cultural backgrounds and even language seemed to have been omitted as a source of concern. Items such as religiously prohibited pork, and non-generic forms of medicine that lacked multilingual instructions came flooding in as relief. An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing more problems than it solves.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Habibzadeh|first=Farrokh|last2=Yadollahie|first2=Mahboobeh|last3=Kucheki|first3=Maryam|date=August 2008|title=International aid in disaster zones: help or headache?|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|issue=9636|pages=374|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61157-5|pmid=18675688|issn=0140-6736}}</ref>\n\nConsidering transparency, the amount of aid that is recorded accurately has risen from 42% in 2005 to 48% in 2007.<ref name=Economist/>\n\n===Improving the economic efficiency of aid===\nCurrently, donor institutions make proposals for aid packages to recipient countries.  The recipient countries then make a plan for how to use the aid based on how much money has been given to them.  Alternatively, [[Non-governmental organizations|NGO]]'s receive funding from private sources or the government and then implement plans to address their specific issues. According to Sachs, in the view of some scholars, this system is inherently ineffective.<ref name=\"Sachs\"/>\n\nAccording to Sachs, we should redefine how we think of aid.  The first step should be to learn what developing countries hope to accomplish and how much money they need to accomplish those goals.

The logic of food export inherently entails some effort to change consumers' preferences, to introduce recipients to new foods and thereby stimulate demand for foods with which recipients were previously unfamiliar or which otherwise represent only a small portion of their diet.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMassive shipments of wheat and rice into the [[Sahel|West African Sahel]] during the food crises of the mid-1970s and mid-1980s were widely believed to stimulate a shift in consumer demand from indigenous coarse grains \u2013 [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] \u2013 to western crops such as [[wheat]]. During the 2000 drought in northern [[Kenya]], the price of [[changaa]] (a locally distilled alcohol) fell significantly and consumption seems to have increased as a result. This was a result of grain food aid inflows increasing the availability of low-cost inputs to the informal distilling industry.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0ebgfiiMn0C|title=Food Aid After Fifty Years: Recasting Its Role|last=Barrett|first=Christopher Brendan|last2=Maxwell|first2=Daniel G.|date=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415701259|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Natural resource overexploitation ====\nRecent research suggests that patterns of food aid distribution may inadvertently affect the natural environment, by changing consumption patterns and by inducing locational change in [[grazing]] and other activities. A pair of studies in Northern Kenya found that food aid distribution seems to induce greater spatial concentration of [[livestock]] around distribution points, causing localized [[rangeland]] degradation, and that food aid provided as whole grain requires more cooking, and thus more fuelwood, stimulating local [[deforestation]].<ref>McPeak J.G.

It may also be given with the intention of influencing the political process in the receiving nation. Whether one considers such aid helpful may depend on whether one agrees with the agenda being pursued by the donor nation in a particular case. During the conflict between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]] in the twentieth century, the champions of those ideologies \u2013 the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] \u2013 each used aid to influence the internal politics of other nations, and to support their weaker allies. Perhaps the most notable example was the [[Marshall Plan]] by which the [[United States]], largely successfully, sought to pull [[Europe]]an nations toward capitalism and away from communism. Aid to underdeveloped countries has sometimes been criticized as being more in the interest of the donor than the recipient, or even a form of [[neocolonialism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asante|first=S.K.B.|year=1985|url=https://www.econbiz.de/Record/international-assistance-and-international-capitalism-supportive-or-counterproductive-asante/10001860645|title=International Assistance and international Capitalism : Supportive or Counterproductive?|journal=African Independence : The First Twenty-Five Years|access-date=28 May 2018|series=African independence : The first twenty-five years. - Bloomington, Ind. : Indiana Univ.

Some analysts, such as researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]], argue that current support for the developing world suffers from a '''policy incoherence''' and that while some policies are designed to support the third world, other domestic policies undermine its impact,<ref name=ODI>{{Cite web|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/3288-beyond-aid-sustainable-development|title='Beyond Aid' for sustainable development|date=April 2009|website=ODI|language=en|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> examples include:\n* encouraging developing economies to develop their agriculture with a focus on exports is not effective on a global market where key players, such as the US and EU, heavily subsidise their products\n* providing aid to developing economies' health sectors and the training of personnel is undermined by migration policies in developed countries that encourage the migration of skilled health professionals\n\nOne measure of this policy incoherence is the [[Commitment to Development Index|Commitment to Development Index (CDI)]] published by the [[Center for Global Development]] .  The index measures and evaluates 22 of the world's richest countries on policies that affect developing countries, in addition to simply aid.  It shows that development policy is more than just aid; it also takes into account trade, investment, migration, environment, security, and technology.\n\nThus, some states are beginning to go ''Beyond Aid'' and instead seek to ensure there is a policy coherence, for example see [[Common Agricultural Policy]] reform or [[Doha Development Round]]. This approach might see the nature of aid change from loans, debt cancellation, budget support etc., to supporting developing countries. This requires a strong political will, however, the results could potentially make aid far more effective and efficient.<ref name=ODI/>\n\n===The \"aid industry\" ===\nPrivate giving includes aid from charities, philanthropic organizations or businesses to recipient countries or programs within recipient countries. Garrett has observed that aid donor organizations have developed their own industry known as the ''\"aid industry\"''. Private donors to countries in need of aid are a large part of this, by making money while finding the next best solution for the country in need of aid. These private outside donors take away from local entrepreneurship leaving countries in need of aid reliant on them.<ref name=\"Garrett\"/>\n\n==Transition out of aid==\nResearchers looked at how Ghana compares with groups of other countries that have been transitioning out of aid. They talk about how the [[World Bank]] reclassified Ghana from a low income country to a lower middle income country in 2010. They found Ghana experiencing significant improvements across development indicators since early 2000s with different changes for different indicators which is consistent or better than lower middle income country averages.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Hou|first1=Zhenbo|last2=Kennan|first2=Jane|date=October 2013|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/8065-graduation-out-aid|title=Graduation out of aid|website=ODI|language=en|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Marshall Plan==\n{{Main|Marshall Plan}}\nAfter World War II the Marshall Plan (and similar programs for Asia, and the Point Four program for Latin America) became the major American aid program, and became a model for its foreign aid policies for decades.<ref>{{cite book|author=Raymond H.

Historian Michael J. Hogan argues that American aid was critical in stabilizing the economy and politics of Western Europe. It brought in modern management that dramatically increased productivity, and encouraged cooperation between labor and management, and among the member states.  Local Communist parties were opposed, and they lost prestige and influence and a role in government.  In strategic terms, says Hogan, the Marshall Plan strengthened the West against the possibility of a communist invasion or political takeover.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947\u20131952'' (1989) pp. 26\u201328, 430\u2013443.</ref> However, the Marshall Plan's role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs from the United States.  Economic historians Bradford De Long and [[Barry Eichengreen]] conclude it was, \"History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program.\" They state:\n:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

It seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It used trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the Soviet Union.  Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes:\n:The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.<ref>Mark Kramer, \"The Soviet Bloc and the Cold War in Europe,\" {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyNcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|title=A Companion to Europe Since 1945|last=Larres|first=Klaus|date=7 January 2014|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118890240|language=en|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==Academic theories==\nSince the 1960s, improving the efficiency of foreign aid has been a common topic of academic research. There is debate on whether foreign aid is efficacious, but for the purposes of this article we will ignore that. Given that schema, a common debate is over which factors influence the overall economic efficiency of foreign aid. Indeed, there is debate about whether aid impact should be measured empirically at all, but again, we will limit our scope to increasing the economic efficiency.\n\nAt the forefront of the aid debate has been the conflict between professor [[William Easterly]] of New York University<ref>{{cite web|url=http://williameasterly.org|title=About|website=William Easterly}}</ref> and his ideological opposite, Jeffrey Sachs, from Columbia University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/1770|title=Full Bio - Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs, Columbia University|date=15 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622165502/http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/1770|archivedate=22 June 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> Easterly advocates the \"searcher's\" approach, while Sachs advocates a more top down, broad planned approach. We will discuss both of these at length.\n\n===\"Searchers Approach\"===\nWilliam Easterly offers a nontraditional, and somewhat controversial \"searching\" approach to dealing with poverty, as opposed to the \"planned\" approach in his famous critique of the more traditional Owen/Sachs, The White Man's Burden. Traditional [[poverty reduction]], Easterly claims is based on the idea that we know what is best for impoverished countries. He claims that they know what is best. Having a top down \"master plan,\" he claims, is inefficient. His alternative, called the \"Searchers\" approach, uses a bottom up strategy.  That is, this approach starts by surveying the poor in the countries in question, and then tries to directly aid individuals, rather than governments. Local markets are a key incentive structure. The primary example is of mosquito nets in Malawi. In this example, an [[NGO]] sells mosquito nets to rich Malawians, and uses the profits to subsidize cheap sales to the impoverished. Hospital nurses are used as middle-women, profiting a few cents on every net sold to a patient. This incentive structure has seen the usage of nets in Malawi spike over 40% in less than seven years.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\">{{Cite book|title=The white man's burden : why the West's efforts to aid the rest have done so much ill and so little good|last=1957-|first=Easterly, William|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199210824|location=Oxford|oclc=70399016}}</ref>\n\nOne of the central tenets in Easterly's approach is a more bottom up philosophy of aid. This applies not only to the identification of problems, but to the actual distribution of capital to the areas in need. In effect, Easterly would have countries go to the area which needed aid, collect information about the problem, find out what the population wanted, and then work from there. In keeping with this, funds would also be distributed from the bottom up, rather than being given to a specific government.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nEasterly also advocates working through currently existing Aid organizations, and letting them compete for funding. Utilizing pre-existing national organizations and local frameworks would not only help give target populations a voice in implementation and goal setting, but is more efficient economically. Easterly argues that the preexisting frameworks already \"know\" what the problems are, as opposed to outside [[NGO]]s who tend to \"guess\".<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nEasterly strongly discourages aid to government as a rule. He believes, for several reasons, that aid to small \"bottom up\" organizations and individual groups is a better philosophy than to large governments.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nEasterly states that for far too long, inefficient aid organizations have been funded, and that this is a problem. The current system of evaluation for most aid\norganizations is internal. Easterly claims that the process is biased because organizations have a large incentive to represent their progress in a positive light. What he proposes as an alternative is an independent auditing system for aid organizations. Before receiving funding, the organization would state their goals and how they expect to measure and achieve them. If they do not meet their goals, Easterly proposes we shift our funding to organizations who are successful. This would prompt organizations to either become efficient, or obsolete.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nEasterly believes that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, one of the main failings of aid lies in the fact that we create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nThe \"Searching Approach\" is intrinsically tied to the market. Easterly claims that the only way for poverty to truly end is for the poor to be given the capability to lift themselves out of poverty, and then for it to happen. Philosophically, this sounds like the traditional [[bootstrapping|\"bootstrap\" theory]], but it is not. What he says is that the poor should be given the fiscal support to create their market, which would give them the ability to become self-reliant in the future.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nIn the end of his book, Easterly proposes a voucher system for foreign aid. The poor would be distributed a certain number of vouchers, which would act as currency, redeemable to aid organizations for services, medicines, and the like. These vouchers would then be redeemed by the aid organizations for more funding. In this way, the aid organization would be forced to compete, if by proxy.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\n===Proscriptive \"Ladder Approach\"===\nSachs presents a near dichotomy to Easterly. Sachs presents a broad, proscriptive solution to poverty. In his book, The End of Poverty, he explains how throughout history, countries have ascended from poverty by following a relatively simple model. First, you promote agricultural development, then industrialize, embrace technology, and finally become modern. This is the standard \"western\" model of development that has been followed by countries such as China and Brazil. Sachs main idea is that there should be a broad analytical \"checklist\" of things a country must attain before it can reach the next step on the ladder to development. Western nations should donate a percentage of their GDP as determined by the UN, and pump money into helping impoverished countries climb the ladder. Sachs insists that if followed, his strategy would eliminate poverty by 2025.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\">{{Cite book|title=The end of poverty : economic possibilities for our time|last=Jeffrey.|first=Sachs|date=2005|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=978-1594200458|location=New York|oclc=57243168|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/endofpovertyecon00sach}}</ref>\n\nSachs advocates using a top down methodology, utilizing broad ranging plans developed by external aid organizations like the UN and World Bank. To Sachs, these plans are essential to a coherent and timely eradication of poverty. He surmises that if donor and recipient countries follow the plan, they will be able to climb out of poverty.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\nPart of Sachs' philosophy includes strengthening the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the United Nations. If those institutions are given the power to enact change, and freed from mitigating influences, then they will be much more effective. Sachs does not find fault in the international organizations themselves. Instead, he blames the member nations who compose them. The powerful nations of the world must make a commitment to end poverty, then stick to it.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\nSachs believes it is best to empower countries by utilizing their existing governments, rather than trying to circumnavigate them. He remarks that while the corruption argument is logically valid in that corruption harms the efficiency of aid, levels of corruption tend to be much higher on average for countries with low levels of GDP. He contends that this hurdle in government should not disqualify entire populations for much needed aid from the west.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\nSachs does not see the need for independent evaluators, and sees them as a detractor to proper progress. He argues that many facets of aid cannot be effectively quantified, and thus it is not fair to try to put empirical benchmarks on the effectiveness of aid.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\nSachs' view makes it a point to attack and attempt to disprove many of the ideas that the more \"pessimistic\" Easterly stands on.\n\nFirst, he points to economic freedom. One of the common threads of logic in aid is that countries need to develop economically in order to rise from poverty. On this, there is not a ton of debate. However, Sachs contends that Easterly, and many other neo-Liberal economists believe high levels of economic freedom in these emerging markets is almost a necessity to development. Sachs himself does not believe this. He cites the lack of correlation between the average degrees of Economic Freedom in countries and their yearly GDP growth, which in his data set is completely inconclusive.\n\nAlso, Sachs contends that democratization is not an integral part of having efficient aid distribution. Rather than attach strings to our aid dollars, or only working with democracies or \"good governments\", Sachs believes we should consider the type of government in the needy country as a secondary concern.\n\nSachs' entire approach stands on the assertion that abject poverty could be ended worldwide by 2025.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\n====David Dollar====\nDollar/Collier showed that current allocations of aid are allocated inefficiently. They came to the conclusion that aid money is given in many cases as an incentive to change policy, and for political reasons, which in many cases can be less efficient than the optimal condition. They agree that bad policy is detrimental to economic growth, which is a key component of poverty reduction, but have found that aid dollars do not significantly incentivize governments to change policy. In fact, they have negligible impact. As an alternative, Dollar proposes that aid be funneled more towards countries with \"good\" policy and less than optimal amounts of aid for their massive amounts of poverty. With respect to \"optimal amounts\" Dollar calculated the marginal productivity of each additional dollar of foreign aid for the countries sampled, and saw that some countries had very high rates of marginal productivity (each dollar went further), while others [with particularly high amounts of aid, and lower levels of poverty] had low [and sometimes negative] levels of [[marginal productivity]]. In terms of economic efficiency, aid funding would be best allocated towards countries whose marginal productivities per dollar were highest, and away from those countries who had low to negative marginal productivities.  The conclusion was that while an estimated 10 million people are lifted from poverty with current aid policies, that number could be increased to 19 million with efficient aid allocation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Paul|last2=Dollar|first2=David|date=September 2002|title=Aid allocation and poverty reduction|journal=European Economic Review|volume=46|issue=8|pages=1475\u20131500|doi=10.1016/s0014-2921(01)00187-8|issn=0014-2921|citeseerx=10.1.1.194.7379}}</ref>\n\n====\"New Conditionality\"====\nNew Conditionality is the term used in a paper to describe somewhat of a compromise between Dollar and Hansen. Paul Mosely describes how policy is important, and that aid distribution is improper. However, unlike Dollar, \"New Conditionality\" claims that the most important factors in efficiency of aid are income distributions in the recipient country and corruption.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Paul|last2=Hudson|first2=John|last3=Verschoor|first3=Arjan|date=27 May 2004|title=Aid, Poverty Reduction and the 'New Conditionality'*|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=114|issue=496|pages=F217\u2013F243|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00220.x|issn=0013-0133}}</ref>\n\n====McGillivray====\nOne of the problems in foreign aid allocation is the marginalization of the fragile state. The fragile state, with its high volatility, and risk of failure scares away donors. The people of those states feel harm and are marginalized as a result. Additionally, the fate of neighboring states is important, as economies of the directly adjacent states to those impoverished, volatile \"fragile states\" can be negatively impacted by as much as 1.6% of their GDP per year. This is no small figure.  McGillivray advocates for the reduced volatility of aid flows, which can only be attained through analysis and coordination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aid Allocation and Fragile States|last=McGillivray|first=Mark|publisher=UNU-WIDER|year=2006|location=Helsinki}} in {{Cite book|title=Fragile states : causes, costs, and responses : a study prepared by the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University (UNU-WIDER)|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Naud\u00e9, Wim A., Santos Paulino, Amelia Uliafnova., McGillivray, Mark., World Institute for Development Economics Research.|isbn=9780199693153|location=Oxford|oclc=713186756}}</ref>\n\n===''Aid on the Edge of Chaos''===\nA persistent problem in foreign aid is what some have called a 'neo-Newtonian' paradigm for thinking and action. Development and humanitarian problems are frequently dealt with as if they are simple, linear, and best addressed through the application of 'best practices' developed in Western countries and then applied ad infinitum by aid agencies. This approach has come under sustained criticism in Ben Ramalingam's ''[[Aid on the Edge of Chaos]]''. This work advocates that aid agencies should embrace the ideas and principles of [[complex adaptive system]]s research in order to improve how they think about and act on development problems.\n\n==Public attitudes==\nAcademic research has suggested that members of the public overestimate how much their governments spend on aid.

Countries may provide aid for further diplomatic reasons. [[Humanitarianism|Humanitarian]] and [[altruism|altruistic]] purposes are often reasons for foreign assistance.{{efn|name=Lancaster, pp. 4\u20135|Lancaster, pp. 4\u20135.}}\n\nAid may be given by individuals, private organizations, or governments. Standards delimiting exactly the types of transfers considered \"aid\" vary from country to country. For example, the United States government discontinued the reporting of military aid as part of its foreign aid figures in 1958.{{efn|Lancaster, p. 67: \"In 1957 the administration (with congressional support) separated economic from military assistance and created a Development Loan Fund (DLF) to provide concessional credits to developing countries world-wide (i.e. not, as in the past, just those in areas of potential conflict with Moscow) to promote their long-term growth.\"}} The most widely used measure of aid is \"[[Official Development Assistance]]\" (ODA).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Definitions and purpose==\nThe [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines its aid measure, Official Development Assistance (ODA), as follows: \"ODA consists of flows to developing countries and multilateral institutions provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies, each transaction of which meets the following test: a) it is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective, and b) it is concessional in character and contains a grant element of at least 25% (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/dac-glossary.htm#ODA|title=DAC Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896808.pdf|title=The DAC in Dates, 2006 Edition.

Chenerya and Strout (1966) claimed that foreign aid promotes development by adding to domestic savings as well as to foreign exchange availability, this helping to close either the savings-investment gap or the export-import gap. (Isse 129).\n\nCarol Lancaster defines ''foreign aid'' as \"a voluntary transfer of public resources, from a government to another independent government, to an NGO, or to an international organization (such as the World Bank or the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Program]]) with at least a 25 percent grant element, one goal of which is to better the human condition in the country receiving the aid.\"{{efn|Carol Lancaster. ''Foreign Aid.'' 2007. p.9.}}\n\nLancaster also states that for much of the period of her study (World War II to the present) \"foreign aid was used for four main purposes: diplomatic [including military/security and political interests abroad], developmental, humanitarian relief and commercial.\"{{efn|Carol Lancaster. ''Foreign Aid.'' 2007. p.13.}}\n\n==Extent of aid==\nMost [[official development assistance]] (ODA) comes from the 30 members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/dacmembers.htm#members|title=DAC members - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=12 April 2018}}</ref> or about $135&nbsp;billion in 2013.

[[Military aid]] is material or logistical assistance given to strengthen the military capabilities of an [[Alliance|ally]] country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Securing tyrants or fostering reform? : U.S. internal security assistance to repressive and transitioning regimes|date=2006|publisher=RAND Corp|others=Jones, Seth G., 1972-, International Security and Defense Policy Center., Open Society Institute.|isbn=9780833042620|location=Santa Monica, CA|oclc=184843895}}</ref> [[Humanitarian aid]] is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises such as a [[natural disaster]] or a [[man-made disaster]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/data-guides/defining-humanitarian-aid|title=Defining humanitarian assistance|work=Development Initiatives|access-date=28 May 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Terms or conditions of receipt===\nAid can also be classified according to the terms agreed upon by the [[Donation|donor]] and receiving countries. In this classification, aid can be a [[gift]], a [[Grant (money)|grant]], a low or no interest loan, or a combination of these. The terms of foreign aid are oftentimes influenced by the motives of the giver: a sign of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] approval, to reward a [[government]] for behaviour desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to enhance [[infrastructure]] needed by the donor for the extraction of resources from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of [[commerce|commercial]] access.{{efn|name=Lancaster, pp. 4\u20135}}\n\n===Sources===\nAid can also be classified according to its source. While government aid is generally called foreign aid, aid that originates in institutions of a religious nature is often termed [[faith-based foreign aid]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=8 October 2006|url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/08/bush_brings_faith_to_foreign_aid/?page=2|title=Bush brings faith to foreign aid|work=Boston.com|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> Aid from various sources can reach recipients through bilateral or multilateral delivery systems. \"Bilateral\" refers to government to government transfers. \"Multilateral\" institutions, such as the World Bank or [[UNICEF]], pool aid from one or more sources and disperse it among many recipients.\n\nInternational aid in the form of gifts by individuals or businesses (aka, \"private giving\") are generally administered by [[charities]] or [[philanthropic organization]]s who batch them and then channel these to the recipient country.\n\n===Urgency===\nAid may be also classified based on urgency into emergency aid and development aid. Emergency aid is rapid assistance given to a people in immediate distress by individuals, organizations, or governments to relieve suffering, during and after man-made emergencies (like [[war]]s) and [[natural disaster]]s. The term often carries an international connotation, but this is not always the case. It is often distinguished from [[development aid]] by being focused on relieving suffering caused by natural disaster or conflict, rather than removing the root causes of poverty or vulnerability. Development aid is aid given to support development in general which can be [[economic development]] or social development in [[developing countries]]. It is distinguished from [[humanitarian aid]] as being aimed at alleviating poverty in the long term, rather than alleviating suffering in the short term.\n\n====Emergency aid====\n[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Humanitarian aid in Rajan Kala, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|250px|U.S. soldiers unload humanitarian aid for distribution to the town of Rajan Kala, Afghanistan, 5 December 2009]] The provision of emergency humanitarian aid consists of the provision of vital services (such as food aid to prevent [[starvation]]) by aid agencies, and the provision of funding or in-kind services (like logistics or transport), usually through aid agencies or the government of the affected country. Humanitarian aid is distinguished from [[humanitarian intervention]], which involves armed forces protecting civilians from violent oppression or [[genocide]] by state-supported actors.\n\nThe United Nations [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) is mandated to coordinate the international humanitarian response to a natural disaster or complex emergency acting on the basis of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182|title=A/RES/46/182 - E|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> The [[Geneva Conventions]] give a mandate to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Committee of the Red Cross]] and other impartial humanitarian organizations to provide assistance and protection of civilians during times of war.

[[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) is a commonly used measure of developmental aid.\n\n===Intended use===\nAid given is generally intended for use by a specific end. From this perspective it may be called: \n* Project aid: Aid given for a specific purpose; e.g. building materials for a new school.\n* Programme aid: Aid given for a specific sector; e.g. funding of the education sector of a country.\n** [[Budget support]]: A form of Programme Aid that is directly channelled into the financial system of the recipient country.\n* Sector-wide Approaches (SWAPs): A combination of Project aid and Programme aid/Budget Support; e.g.  support for the education sector in a country will include both funding of education projects (like school buildings) and provide funds to maintain them (like school books).\n* [[Technical assistance]]: Aid involving highly educated or trained personnel, such as doctors, who are moved into a developing country to assist with a program of development. Can be both programme and project aid.\n* Food aid: Food is given to countries in urgent need of food supplies, especially if they have just experienced a natural disaster. Food aid can be provided by importing food from the donor, buying food locally, or providing cash.\n* [[Medical research|International research]], such as research that used for the [[green revolution]] or [[vaccine]]s.\n\n==Official development assistance==\n{{Main|Official development assistance}}\n\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) is a term coined by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) to measure aid. ODA refers to aid from national governments for promoting economic development and welfare in low and middle income countries. ODA can be bilateral or multilateral. This aid is given as either [[grant (money)|grants]], where no repayment is required, or as concessional [[loan]]s, where interest rates are lower than market rates.{{efn|name=Table 1 p. 13|Lancaster uses either ODA or ODA plus OA (\"Official Assistance\" \u2013 another DAC government-aid category) as her main statistic. She considers it better to add the OA but very often just uses the ODA figure alone; e.g., for Table 1.1 (p. 13), Table 2.2 (p. 39) and Table 2.3 (p. 43). In any case the difference is now moot since the DAC recently merged the two categories.}}\n\nLoan repayments to multilateral institutions are pooled and redistributed as new loans. Additionally, debt relief, partial or total cancellation of loan repayments, is often added to total aid numbers even though it is not an actual transfer of funds.

Aid is \"stovepiped\" towards narrow, short-term goals relating to particular programs or diseases such as increasing the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatment, and increasing distribution of bed nets. These are band aid solutions to larger problems, as it takes healthcare systems and infrastructure to create significant change.  Donors lack the understanding that effort should be focused on broader measures that affect general well being of the population, and substantial change will take generations to achieve. Aid often does not provide maximum benefit to the recipient, and reflects the interests of the donor.<ref name=\"Garrett\">{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=86|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, consider the breakdown, where aid goes and for what purposes.  In 2002, total gross foreign aid to all developing countries was $76 billion.  Dollars that do not contribute to a country's ability to support basic needs interventions are subtracted.  Subtract $6 billion for debt relief grants. Subtract $11 billion, which is the amount developing countries paid to developed nations in that year in the form of loan repayments.  Next, subtract the aid given to middle income countries, $16 billion.  The remainder, $43 billion, is the amount that developing countries received in 2002.  But only $12 billion went to low-income countries in a form that could be deemed budget support for basic needs.<ref name=\"Sachs\"/> When aid is given to the [[Least Developed Countries]] who have good governments and strategic plans for the aid, it is thought that it is more effective.<ref name=\"Sachs\"/>\n\n===Logistics===\n[[Humanitarian aid]] is argued to often not reach those who are intended to receive it. For example, a report composed by the World Bank in 2006 stated that an estimated half of the funds donated towards health programs in sub-Saharan Africa did not reach the clinics and hospitals. Money is paid out to fake accounts, prices are increased for transport or warehousing, and drugs are sold to the black market. Another example is in Ghana, where approximately 80% of donations do not go towards their intended purposes. This type of corruption only adds to the criticism of aid, as it is not helping those who need it, and may be adding to the problem.<ref name=\"Garrett\"/> Only about one fifth of U.S. aid goes to countries classified by the OECD as 'least developed.'<ref name=\"Singer\"/> This \"pro-rich\" trend is not unique to the United States.<ref name=\"Sachs\">Sachs, Jeffrey D. 2005. The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time. New York: Penguin Books.</ref><ref name=\"Singer\">Singer, Peter. 2009. [[The Life You Can Save]].

For example, an earthquake in 2003 in [[Bam, Iran]] left tens of thousands of people in need of disaster zone aid. Although aid was flown in rapidly, regional belief systems, cultural backgrounds and even language seemed to have been omitted as a source of concern. Items such as religiously prohibited pork, and non-generic forms of medicine that lacked multilingual instructions came flooding in as relief. An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing more problems than it solves.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Habibzadeh|first=Farrokh|last2=Yadollahie|first2=Mahboobeh|last3=Kucheki|first3=Maryam|date=August 2008|title=International aid in disaster zones: help or headache?|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|issue=9636|pages=374|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61157-5|pmid=18675688|issn=0140-6736}}</ref>\n\nConsidering transparency, the amount of aid that is recorded accurately has risen from 42% in 2005 to 48% in 2007.<ref name=Economist/>\n\n===Improving the economic efficiency of aid===\nCurrently, donor institutions make proposals for aid packages to recipient countries.  The recipient countries then make a plan for how to use the aid based on how much money has been given to them.  Alternatively, [[Non-governmental organizations|NGO]]'s receive funding from private sources or the government and then implement plans to address their specific issues. According to Sachs, in the view of some scholars, this system is inherently ineffective.<ref name=\"Sachs\"/>\n\nAccording to Sachs, we should redefine how we think of aid.  The first step should be to learn what developing countries hope to accomplish and how much money they need to accomplish those goals.  Goals should be made with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in mind for these furnish real metrics for providing basic needs.  The \"actual transfer of funds must be based on rigorous, country-specific plans that are developed through open and consultative processes, backed by [[good governance]] in the recipient countries, as well as careful planning and evaluation.\"<ref name=\"Sachs\"/>\n\nPossibilities are also emerging as some developing countries are experiencing rapid economic growth, they are able to provide their own expertise gained from their recent transition. This knowledge transfer can be seen in donors, such as Brazil, whose $1 billion in aid outstrips that of many traditional donors.<ref name=\"ODI1\">{{Cite web|author1=Lidia Cabral|author2=Julia Weinstock|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/5120-brazil-emerging-aid-player|title=Brazil: an emerging aid player|date=October 2010|website=ODI|language=en|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> Brazil provides most of its aid in the form of technical expertise and knowledge transfers.<ref name=\"ODI1\"/> This has been described by some observers as a 'global model in waiting'.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Cabral|first=Lidia|date=21 July 2010|url=https://www.odi.org/comment/4952-brazils-development-cooperation-south-global-model-waiting|title=Brazil's development cooperation with the South: a global model in waiting|work=ODI|access-date=28 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nA very wide range of interpretations are in play ranging from the argument that foreign aid has been a primary driver of development, to a complete waste of money.

It must be admitted, however, that the pattern of development is complex and the effect upon it of foreign assistance is still not clearly determined. But the limited evidence available suggests that the forms in which foreign resources have been extended to Africa over the past twenty-five years, insofar as they are concerned with economic development, are, to a great extent, counterproductive.{{efn|Asante, p. 265}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Peter Singer]] argues that over the last three decades, \"aid has added around one percentage point to the annual growth rate of the bottom billion.\" He argues that this has made the difference between \"stagnation and severe cumulative decline.\"<ref name=\"Singer\"/> Aid can make progress towards reducing poverty worldwide, or at least help prevent cumulative decline. Despite the intense criticism on aid, there are some promising numbers.

Maternal deaths have dropped from 543,000 in 1990 to 287,000 in 2010.

These issues arise from targeting inefficacy and poor timing of aid programs. [[Food aid]] can harm producers by driving down prices of local products, whereas the producers are not themselves beneficiaries of food aid. Unintentional harm occurs when food aid arrives or is purchased at the wrong time, when food aid distribution is not well-targeted to food-insecure households, and when the local market is relatively poorly integrated with broader national, regional and global markets. The use of food aid for emergencies can reduce the unintended consequences, although it can contribute to other associated with the use of food as a weapon or prolonging or intensifying the duration of [[Civil war|civil conflicts]]. Also, aid attached to institution building and democratization can often result in the consolidation of autocratic governments when effective monitoring is absent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nieto|first=Camilo|last2=Schenoni|first2=Luis|date=24 December 2018|title=Backing Despots?|journal=Democracy and Security|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=153\u2013184|doi=10.1111/obes.12012|issn=0305-9049|hdl=10.1111/obes.12012|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==== Increasing conflict duration ====\n[[International aid agencies|International aid organizations]] identify theft by armed forces on the ground as a primary unintended consequence through which food aid and other types of humanitarian aid promote conflict.

However, aid can fuel conflict even if successfully delivered to the intended population as the recipient populations often include members of [[rebel groups]] or [[militia groups]], or aid is \"taxed\" by such groups.\n\nAcademic research emphatically demonstrates that on average food aid promotes civil conflict. Namely, increase in [[US aid|US food aid]] leads to an increase in the incidence of armed civil conflict in the recipient country.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another correlation demonstrated is food aid prolonging existing conflicts, specifically among countries with a recent history of civil conflict.

Targeting errors of inclusion are said to magnify the [[labor market]] disincentive effects inherent to food aid (or any other form of transfer) by providing benefits to those who are most able and willing to turn transfers into leisure instead of increased food consumption.\n\nLabor distortion can arise when [[National Food For Work Programme|Food-For-Work (FFW) Programs]] are more attractive than work on recipients' own farms/businesses, either because the FFW pays immediately, or because the household considers the payoffs to the FFW project to be higher than the returns to labor on its own plots. Food aid programs hence take productive inputs away from local private production, creating a distortion due to substitution effects, rather than income effects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBeyond labor [[Disincentive|disincentive effects]], food aid can have the unintended consequence of discouraging household-level production. Poor timing of aid and FFW wages that are above market rates cause negative dependency by diverting labor from local private uses, particularly if FFW obligations decrease labor on a household's own enterprises during a critical part of the production cycle.This type of disincentive impacts not only food aid recipients but also producers who sell to areas receiving food aid flows.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/againstgraindile0000jack|url-access=registration|title=Against the grain: the dilemma of project food aid|last=Jackson|first=Tony|last2=Eade|first2=Deborah|date=1982|publisher=OXFAM|isbn=9780855980634|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skW5AAAAIAAJ|title=Feeding dependency, starving democracy: USAID policies in Haiti|last=Richardson|first=Laurie|last2=International|first2=Grassroots|date=1997|publisher=Grassroots International|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJ3mswEACAAJ|title=Food First: Beyond the Myth of Scarcity|last=Lapp\u00e9|first=Frances Moore|last2=Collins|first2=Joseph|last3=Fowler|first3=Cary|date=1979|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=9780345251503|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPw9AAAAYAAJ|title=Politics of food aid: case of Bangladesh|last=Molla|first=Md Gyasuddin|date=1990|publisher=Academic Publishers|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Development Sustainability and Eliminating Food Aid Dependency: Lessons from the World Food Programme|last=Salisbury|first=L.N.|publisher=Cornell University|year=1992|location=Ithaca, NY}}</ref>\n\nFFW programs are often used to counter a perceived dependency syndrome associated with freely distributed food.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, poorly designed FFW programs may cause more risk of harming local production than the benefits of free food distribution.

In order to be granted the right to monetize, operational agencies must demonstrate that the recipient country has adequate storage facilities and that the monetized [[commodity]] will not result in a substantial disincentive in either domestic agriculture or domestic marketing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=P.L. 480 Title II Cooperating Sponsor Monetization Manual|last=Ralyea|first=B.|author2=Food Aid Management Monetization Working Group|year=1999}}</ref>\n#Second, households receiving aid may decrease demand for the [[commodity]] received or for locally produced [[Substitute good|substitutes]] or, if they produce substitutes or the commodity received, they may sell more of it. This can be most easily understood by dividing a population in a food aid recipient area into subpopulations based on two criteria: whether or not they receive food aid (recipients vs. non-recipients) and whether they are net sellers or net buyers of food. Because the price they receive for their output is lower, however, net sellers are unambiguously worse off if they do not receive food aid or some other form of compensatory transfer.<ref name=\":3\" />\n#Finally, recipients may sell food aid to purchase other necessities or [[Complement (economics)|complements]], driving down prices of the food aid commodity and its substitutes, but also increasing demand for complements. Most recipient economies are not robust and food aid inflows can cause large price decreases, decreasing producer profits, limiting producers' abilities to pay off debts and thereby diminishing both capacity and incentives to invest in improving agricultural productivity. However, food aid distributed directly or through FFW programs to households in northern [[Kenya]] during the lean season can foster increased purchase of agricultural inputs such as improved seeds, [[fertilizer]] and hired labor, thereby increasing [[agricultural productivity]].<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bezuneh|first=Mesfin|last2=Deaton|first2=Brady J.|last3=Norton|first3=George W.|date=1 February 1988|title=Food Aid Impacts in Rural Kenya|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=181\u2013191|doi=10.2307/1241988|issn=0002-9092|jstor=1241988}}</ref>\n\n==== Changed consumption patterns ====\nFood aid that is relatively inappropriate to local uses can distort consumption patterns.\n\nFood aid is usually exported from [[temperate climate]] zones and is often different than the staple crops grown in recipient countries, which usually have a [[tropical climate]]. The logic of food export inherently entails some effort to change consumers' preferences, to introduce recipients to new foods and thereby stimulate demand for foods with which recipients were previously unfamiliar or which otherwise represent only a small portion of their diet.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMassive shipments of wheat and rice into the [[Sahel|West African Sahel]] during the food crises of the mid-1970s and mid-1980s were widely believed to stimulate a shift in consumer demand from indigenous coarse grains \u2013 [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] \u2013 to western crops such as [[wheat]]. During the 2000 drought in northern [[Kenya]], the price of [[changaa]] (a locally distilled alcohol) fell significantly and consumption seems to have increased as a result. This was a result of grain food aid inflows increasing the availability of low-cost inputs to the informal distilling industry.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0ebgfiiMn0C|title=Food Aid After Fifty Years: Recasting Its Role|last=Barrett|first=Christopher Brendan|last2=Maxwell|first2=Daniel G.|date=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415701259|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Natural resource overexploitation ====\nRecent research suggests that patterns of food aid distribution may inadvertently affect the natural environment, by changing consumption patterns and by inducing locational change in [[grazing]] and other activities. A pair of studies in Northern Kenya found that food aid distribution seems to induce greater spatial concentration of [[livestock]] around distribution points, causing localized [[rangeland]] degradation, and that food aid provided as whole grain requires more cooking, and thus more fuelwood, stimulating local [[deforestation]].<ref>McPeak J.G.

It may also be given with the intention of influencing the political process in the receiving nation. Whether one considers such aid helpful may depend on whether one agrees with the agenda being pursued by the donor nation in a particular case. During the conflict between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]] in the twentieth century, the champions of those ideologies \u2013 the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] \u2013 each used aid to influence the internal politics of other nations, and to support their weaker allies. Perhaps the most notable example was the [[Marshall Plan]] by which the [[United States]], largely successfully, sought to pull [[Europe]]an nations toward capitalism and away from communism. Aid to underdeveloped countries has sometimes been criticized as being more in the interest of the donor than the recipient, or even a form of [[neocolonialism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asante|first=S.K.B.|year=1985|url=https://www.econbiz.de/Record/international-assistance-and-international-capitalism-supportive-or-counterproductive-asante/10001860645|title=International Assistance and international Capitalism : Supportive or Counterproductive?|journal=African Independence : The First Twenty-Five Years|access-date=28 May 2018|series=African independence : The first twenty-five years. - Bloomington, Ind. : Indiana Univ.

Some analysts, such as researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]], argue that current support for the developing world suffers from a '''policy incoherence''' and that while some policies are designed to support the third world, other domestic policies undermine its impact,<ref name=ODI>{{Cite web|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/3288-beyond-aid-sustainable-development|title='Beyond Aid' for sustainable development|date=April 2009|website=ODI|language=en|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> examples include:\n* encouraging developing economies to develop their agriculture with a focus on exports is not effective on a global market where key players, such as the US and EU, heavily subsidise their products\n* providing aid to developing economies' health sectors and the training of personnel is undermined by migration policies in developed countries that encourage the migration of skilled health professionals\n\nOne measure of this policy incoherence is the [[Commitment to Development Index|Commitment to Development Index (CDI)]] published by the [[Center for Global Development]] .  The index measures and evaluates 22 of the world's richest countries on policies that affect developing countries, in addition to simply aid.  It shows that development policy is more than just aid; it also takes into account trade, investment, migration, environment, security, and technology.\n\nThus, some states are beginning to go ''Beyond Aid'' and instead seek to ensure there is a policy coherence, for example see [[Common Agricultural Policy]] reform or [[Doha Development Round]]. This approach might see the nature of aid change from loans, debt cancellation, budget support etc., to supporting developing countries. This requires a strong political will, however, the results could potentially make aid far more effective and efficient.<ref name=ODI/>\n\n===The \"aid industry\" ===\nPrivate giving includes aid from charities, philanthropic organizations or businesses to recipient countries or programs within recipient countries. Garrett has observed that aid donor organizations have developed their own industry known as the ''\"aid industry\"''. Private donors to countries in need of aid are a large part of this, by making money while finding the next best solution for the country in need of aid. These private outside donors take away from local entrepreneurship leaving countries in need of aid reliant on them.<ref name=\"Garrett\"/>\n\n==Transition out of aid==\nResearchers looked at how Ghana compares with groups of other countries that have been transitioning out of aid.

Historian Michael J. Hogan argues that American aid was critical in stabilizing the economy and politics of Western Europe. It brought in modern management that dramatically increased productivity, and encouraged cooperation between labor and management, and among the member states.  Local Communist parties were opposed, and they lost prestige and influence and a role in government.  In strategic terms, says Hogan, the Marshall Plan strengthened the West against the possibility of a communist invasion or political takeover.<ref>Michael J.

Most reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs from the United States.  Economic historians Bradford De Long and [[Barry Eichengreen]] conclude it was, \"History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program.\" They state:\n:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

Indeed, there is debate about whether aid impact should be measured empirically at all, but again, we will limit our scope to increasing the economic efficiency.\n\nAt the forefront of the aid debate has been the conflict between professor [[William Easterly]] of New York University<ref>{{cite web|url=http://williameasterly.org|title=About|website=William Easterly}}</ref> and his ideological opposite, Jeffrey Sachs, from Columbia University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/1770|title=Full Bio - Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs, Columbia University|date=15 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622165502/http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/1770|archivedate=22 June 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> Easterly advocates the \"searcher's\" approach, while Sachs advocates a more top down, broad planned approach. We will discuss both of these at length.\n\n===\"Searchers Approach\"===\nWilliam Easterly offers a nontraditional, and somewhat controversial \"searching\" approach to dealing with poverty, as opposed to the \"planned\" approach in his famous critique of the more traditional Owen/Sachs, The White Man's Burden. Traditional [[poverty reduction]], Easterly claims is based on the idea that we know what is best for impoverished countries. He claims that they know what is best. Having a top down \"master plan,\" he claims, is inefficient. His alternative, called the \"Searchers\" approach, uses a bottom up strategy.  That is, this approach starts by surveying the poor in the countries in question, and then tries to directly aid individuals, rather than governments. Local markets are a key incentive structure. The primary example is of mosquito nets in Malawi. In this example, an [[NGO]] sells mosquito nets to rich Malawians, and uses the profits to subsidize cheap sales to the impoverished. Hospital nurses are used as middle-women, profiting a few cents on every net sold to a patient. This incentive structure has seen the usage of nets in Malawi spike over 40% in less than seven years.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\">{{Cite book|title=The white man's burden : why the West's efforts to aid the rest have done so much ill and so little good|last=1957-|first=Easterly, William|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199210824|location=Oxford|oclc=70399016}}</ref>\n\nOne of the central tenets in Easterly's approach is a more bottom up philosophy of aid. This applies not only to the identification of problems, but to the actual distribution of capital to the areas in need. In effect, Easterly would have countries go to the area which needed aid, collect information about the problem, find out what the population wanted, and then work from there. In keeping with this, funds would also be distributed from the bottom up, rather than being given to a specific government.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nEasterly also advocates working through currently existing Aid organizations, and letting them compete for funding. Utilizing pre-existing national organizations and local frameworks would not only help give target populations a voice in implementation and goal setting, but is more efficient economically. Easterly argues that the preexisting frameworks already \"know\" what the problems are, as opposed to outside [[NGO]]s who tend to \"guess\".<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nEasterly strongly discourages aid to government as a rule. He believes, for several reasons, that aid to small \"bottom up\" organizations and individual groups is a better philosophy than to large governments.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nEasterly states that for far too long, inefficient aid organizations have been funded, and that this is a problem. The current system of evaluation for most aid\norganizations is internal. Easterly claims that the process is biased because organizations have a large incentive to represent their progress in a positive light. What he proposes as an alternative is an independent auditing system for aid organizations. Before receiving funding, the organization would state their goals and how they expect to measure and achieve them. If they do not meet their goals, Easterly proposes we shift our funding to organizations who are successful. This would prompt organizations to either become efficient, or obsolete.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nEasterly believes that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, one of the main failings of aid lies in the fact that we create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nThe \"Searching Approach\" is intrinsically tied to the market. Easterly claims that the only way for poverty to truly end is for the poor to be given the capability to lift themselves out of poverty, and then for it to happen. Philosophically, this sounds like the traditional [[bootstrapping|\"bootstrap\" theory]], but it is not. What he says is that the poor should be given the fiscal support to create their market, which would give them the ability to become self-reliant in the future.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\nIn the end of his book, Easterly proposes a voucher system for foreign aid. The poor would be distributed a certain number of vouchers, which would act as currency, redeemable to aid organizations for services, medicines, and the like. These vouchers would then be redeemed by the aid organizations for more funding. In this way, the aid organization would be forced to compete, if by proxy.<ref name=\"Easterly 2007\"/>\n\n===Proscriptive \"Ladder Approach\"===\nSachs presents a near dichotomy to Easterly. Sachs presents a broad, proscriptive solution to poverty. In his book, The End of Poverty, he explains how throughout history, countries have ascended from poverty by following a relatively simple model. First, you promote agricultural development, then industrialize, embrace technology, and finally become modern. This is the standard \"western\" model of development that has been followed by countries such as China and Brazil. Sachs main idea is that there should be a broad analytical \"checklist\" of things a country must attain before it can reach the next step on the ladder to development. Western nations should donate a percentage of their GDP as determined by the UN, and pump money into helping impoverished countries climb the ladder. Sachs insists that if followed, his strategy would eliminate poverty by 2025.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\">{{Cite book|title=The end of poverty : economic possibilities for our time|last=Jeffrey.|first=Sachs|date=2005|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=978-1594200458|location=New York|oclc=57243168|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/endofpovertyecon00sach}}</ref>\n\nSachs advocates using a top down methodology, utilizing broad ranging plans developed by external aid organizations like the UN and World Bank. To Sachs, these plans are essential to a coherent and timely eradication of poverty. He surmises that if donor and recipient countries follow the plan, they will be able to climb out of poverty.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\nPart of Sachs' philosophy includes strengthening the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the United Nations. If those institutions are given the power to enact change, and freed from mitigating influences, then they will be much more effective. Sachs does not find fault in the international organizations themselves. Instead, he blames the member nations who compose them. The powerful nations of the world must make a commitment to end poverty, then stick to it.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\nSachs believes it is best to empower countries by utilizing their existing governments, rather than trying to circumnavigate them. He remarks that while the corruption argument is logically valid in that corruption harms the efficiency of aid, levels of corruption tend to be much higher on average for countries with low levels of GDP. He contends that this hurdle in government should not disqualify entire populations for much needed aid from the west.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\nSachs does not see the need for independent evaluators, and sees them as a detractor to proper progress. He argues that many facets of aid cannot be effectively quantified, and thus it is not fair to try to put empirical benchmarks on the effectiveness of aid.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\nSachs' view makes it a point to attack and attempt to disprove many of the ideas that the more \"pessimistic\" Easterly stands on.\n\nFirst, he points to economic freedom. One of the common threads of logic in aid is that countries need to develop economically in order to rise from poverty. On this, there is not a ton of debate. However, Sachs contends that Easterly, and many other neo-Liberal economists believe high levels of economic freedom in these emerging markets is almost a necessity to development. Sachs himself does not believe this. He cites the lack of correlation between the average degrees of Economic Freedom in countries and their yearly GDP growth, which in his data set is completely inconclusive.\n\nAlso, Sachs contends that democratization is not an integral part of having efficient aid distribution. Rather than attach strings to our aid dollars, or only working with democracies or \"good governments\", Sachs believes we should consider the type of government in the needy country as a secondary concern.\n\nSachs' entire approach stands on the assertion that abject poverty could be ended worldwide by 2025.<ref name=\"Sachs 2005\"/>\n\n====David Dollar====\nDollar/Collier showed that current allocations of aid are allocated inefficiently. They came to the conclusion that aid money is given in many cases as an incentive to change policy, and for political reasons, which in many cases can be less efficient than the optimal condition. They agree that bad policy is detrimental to economic growth, which is a key component of poverty reduction, but have found that aid dollars do not significantly incentivize governments to change policy. In fact, they have negligible impact. As an alternative, Dollar proposes that aid be funneled more towards countries with \"good\" policy and less than optimal amounts of aid for their massive amounts of poverty. With respect to \"optimal amounts\" Dollar calculated the marginal productivity of each additional dollar of foreign aid for the countries sampled, and saw that some countries had very high rates of marginal productivity (each dollar went further), while others [with particularly high amounts of aid, and lower levels of poverty] had low [and sometimes negative] levels of [[marginal productivity]]. In terms of economic efficiency, aid funding would be best allocated towards countries whose marginal productivities per dollar were highest, and away from those countries who had low to negative marginal productivities.  The conclusion was that while an estimated 10 million people are lifted from poverty with current aid policies, that number could be increased to 19 million with efficient aid allocation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Paul|last2=Dollar|first2=David|date=September 2002|title=Aid allocation and poverty reduction|journal=European Economic Review|volume=46|issue=8|pages=1475\u20131500|doi=10.1016/s0014-2921(01)00187-8|issn=0014-2921|citeseerx=10.1.1.194.7379}}</ref>\n\n====\"New Conditionality\"====\nNew Conditionality is the term used in a paper to describe somewhat of a compromise between Dollar and Hansen. Paul Mosely describes how policy is important, and that aid distribution is improper. However, unlike Dollar, \"New Conditionality\" claims that the most important factors in efficiency of aid are income distributions in the recipient country and corruption.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Paul|last2=Hudson|first2=John|last3=Verschoor|first3=Arjan|date=27 May 2004|title=Aid, Poverty Reduction and the 'New Conditionality'*|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=114|issue=496|pages=F217\u2013F243|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00220.x|issn=0013-0133}}</ref>\n\n====McGillivray====\nOne of the problems in foreign aid allocation is the marginalization of the fragile state. The fragile state, with its high volatility, and risk of failure scares away donors. The people of those states feel harm and are marginalized as a result. Additionally, the fate of neighboring states is important, as economies of the directly adjacent states to those impoverished, volatile \"fragile states\" can be negatively impacted by as much as 1.6% of their GDP per year. This is no small figure.  McGillivray advocates for the reduced volatility of aid flows, which can only be attained through analysis and coordination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aid Allocation and Fragile States|last=McGillivray|first=Mark|publisher=UNU-WIDER|year=2006|location=Helsinki}} in {{Cite book|title=Fragile states : causes, costs, and responses : a study prepared by the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University (UNU-WIDER)|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Naud\u00e9, Wim A., Santos Paulino, Amelia Uliafnova., McGillivray, Mark., World Institute for Development Economics Research.|isbn=9780199693153|location=Oxford|oclc=713186756}}</ref>\n\n===''Aid on the Edge of Chaos''===\nA persistent problem in foreign aid is what some have called a 'neo-Newtonian' paradigm for thinking and action. Development and humanitarian problems are frequently dealt with as if they are simple, linear, and best addressed through the application of 'best practices' developed in Western countries and then applied ad infinitum by aid agencies. This approach has come under sustained criticism in Ben Ramalingam's ''[[Aid on the Edge of Chaos]]''. This work advocates that aid agencies should embrace the ideas and principles of [[complex adaptive system]]s research in order to improve how they think about and act on development problems.\n\n==Public attitudes==\nAcademic research has suggested that members of the public overestimate how much their governments spend on aid. There is significant opposition to spending on aid but experiments have demonstrated that providing people with more information about correct levels of spending reduces this opposition.<ref name=\"ScottoReifler2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Scotto|first1=Thomas J.|last2=Reifler|first2=Jason|last3=Hudson|first3=David|last4=vanHeerde-Hudson|first4=Jennifer|title=We Spend How Much?
