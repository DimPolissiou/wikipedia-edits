Based on the 1997 [[Anastasia (1997 film)|film of the same name]], the musical adapts the legend of [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], who could have possibly escaped the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of her family]]. Years later in the musical adaptation, an [[amnesia]]c orphan named Anya appears as the main character. Anya hopes to find some trace of the family she has lost by siding with two con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess. Over the course of the adventures in the musical it is strongly assumed that Anya is in fact the lost Duchess, though it is never stated explicitly. The show has gone through many adaptions and opened on Broadway with Christie Altomare as Anya on April 24th, 2017. There it lived for 2 years before closing on March 31st, 2019. It received mixed reviews along the way, but was sustained by the female audiences that grew up with the 1997 [[20th Century Studios|FOX]] [[Anastasia (1997 film)|film]].\n\nAfter completing a pre-Broadway run in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the show premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] in April 2017, and since then it has spawned multiple productions worldwide.\n\n==Background==\nA reading was held in 2012, featuring Kelli Barret as Anya (Anastasia), [[Aaron Tveit]] as Dmitry, Patrick Page as Vladimir, and [[Angela Lansbury]] as the Empress Maria. A workshop was held on June 12, 2015, in New York City, and included [[Elena Shaddow]] as Anya, [[Ramin Karimloo]] as Gleb Vaganov, a new role, and Douglas Sills as Vlad.<ref name=workshop/>\n\nThe original stage production of ''Anastasia'' premiered at the Hartford Stage in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] on May 13, 2016 (previews). The show was directed by [[Darko Tresnjak]] and choreography by Peggy Hickey, with [[Christy Altomare]] and [[Derek Klena]] starring as Anya and Dmitry, respectively.<ref name=songs>{{cite web | url=https://www.hartfordstage.org/anastasia | title=Anastasia| publisher=Hartford Stage | work=hartfordstage.org.com | date=15 May 2016 | accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/photos-meet-the-cast-of-broadways-anastasia|title=Photos: Meet the Cast of Broadway\u2019s Anastasia|last=Vine|first=Hannah|date=22 February 2017|website=Playbill|accessdate=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\nDirector Tresnjak explained: \"We\u2019ve kept, I think, six songs from the movie, but there are 16 new numbers.

Before leaving, the Dowager Empress gives Anastasia a music box as a parting gift (\"Prologue: Once Upon a December\"). Eleven years later, 17 year-old Anastasia is attending a ball with her [[House of Romanov|family]] when the [[Bolsheviks]] invade the palace. As the Romanovs attempt to escape, Anastasia tries to retrieve her music box only to be shot and presumed dead along with the rest of her family (\"The Last Dance of the Romanovs\").\n\n===Act I===\nIn 1927, Gleb Vaganov, a general for the Bolsheviks who now control Russia, announces to the gloomy Russians that the now-poor Saint Petersburg has been renamed [[Saint Petersburg, Russia|Leningrad]], and he promises a bright and peaceful future. The Russians protest this change, but are uplifted by a rumor that Anastasia may have survived the Bolshevik's attacks. Two wanted con men, the handsome young Dmitry and an ex-member of the Imperial Court named Vlad Popov, hear the rumors and brainstorm \u201cthe biggest con in history\u201d: they will groom a naive girl to become Anastasia in order to extract money from the Dowager Empress (\u201cA Rumor in St. Petersburg\").\n\nDmitry and Vlad hold unsuccessful auditions for the scheme at the theater in the abandoned [[Moika Palace|Yusupov Palace]]. Just as they are about to give up hope of finding a suitable impostor, a street sweeper named Anya walks in to ask Dmitry about paperwork to get tickets for Paris. Dmitry and Vlad become fascinated as Anya explains that she doesn't remember who she is due to her [[amnesia]] and has very few memories of her past (\u201cIn My Dreams\u201d). Amazed by her memory loss and resemblance to Anastasia, they select Anya as their impostor.\n\nAt the capital, government workers sort through rumors and reports for any that require further action. Three bitter actresses report Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad's plot to Gleb, but he dismisses them and files a case for Anya (\u201cThe Rumors Never End\u201d). Back at the palace, Vlad and Dmitry groom a feisty Anya to become Anastasia through history, dining, and dancing lessons (\u201cLearn to Do It\u201d).\n\nGleb orders Anya's arrest, and she is brought to his office in the [[Nevsky Prospect]]. The general interrogates the girl and warns her about the consequences of pretending to be Anastasia. He tries to convince her that Anastasia is really dead. He reveals that his father was the one who shot the Romanovs and, as a boy, he heard the gunshots and their screams. However, Gleb notices that Anya has the \"Romanov eyes\" and realizes that Anya could indeed be Anastasia. As he harbors feelings for her, he lets her off with a warning (\"The Neva Flows\").\n\nAnya reunites with Dmitry and they are teased and attacked by his old con partners, whom they must fight off (\u201cThe Neva Flows Reprise\u201d). Impressed by Anya's fighting skills, Dmitry opens up to her for the first time and tells her about his childhood in the streets of St. Petersburg and how he had to take care of himself as an orphan (\u201cMy Petersburg\u201d). Dmitry begins to trust her enough to show her a music box that he's failed to open, unaware it is the memento that was given to Anastasia by the Dowager Empress. Anya easily winds and opens the box and begins to vaguely remember her past, including an imperial ball many years earlier (\u201cOnce Upon a December\u201d). After this episode, Anya is more resolute than ever in her desire to get to Paris, but Dmitry tells her that they don't have enough money to buy the train tickets. Then she gives him her most prized possession, a diamond that was found sewn to her dress when she was discovered years earlier (\u201cA Secret She Kept\u201d).\n\nAt the [[Finland Station|train station]], Count Ipolitov recognizes Anya as Anastasia and kisses her hand. As they board the train to Paris, Count Ipolitov leads everyone in a prayer of farewell to Russia (\u201cStay, I Pray You\u201d). During the train ride, Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad reflect on what they hope to accomplish in Paris: Anya hoping to discover that she is actually Anastasia, Dmitry's desire for the money, and Vlad hoping to win back Countess Lily Malevsky-Malevitch (\"Sophie\" in the [[Anastasia (1997 film)|1997 animated film]]), the Dowager Empress's lady-in-waiting with whom he had an affair (\u201cWe\u2019ll Go From There\u201d). Count Ipolitov is fatally shot by the police for illegally boarding the train. The police officers then go after Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad since they are wanted criminals in Russia, but they all jump off the train, narrowly avoiding capture.\n\nAs they travel across Russia by foot, Gleb receives orders to follow Anya and kill her if she is the real Anastasia (\u201cTraveling Sequence\u201d). Gleb agrees to the task, but he realizes that he is in love with Anya and questions his heart (\"Still\"). Anya, Vlad, and Dmitry finally arrive in France, and as they travel to Paris, Anya summons the courage to continue on with the hope that she will finally discover who she is (\u201cJourney to the Past\u201d).\n\n===Act II===\nAnya, Vlad, and Dmitry arrive in Paris and are swept up by the sights and sounds of the city (\u201cParis Holds the Key (to Your Heart)\u201d). When Vlad and Dmitry go off on their own, Anya visits the [[Pont Alexandre III]] bridge, named after Anastasia's grandfather and she feels a strong connection to it (\u201cCrossing a Bridge\u201d).\n\nNow a bitter, elderly woman, Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna reads the letters of various Anastasia impersonators and, heartbroken, gives up hope of finding Anastasia (\u201cClose the Door\u201d). As Gleb arrives in Paris, Lily parties at the Neva Club, where rich and noble Russians reminisce about the old Russia (\u201cLand of Yesterday\u201d). Lily is reunited with Vlad, with whom she is angry for stealing her jewelry when they were lovers. The two rekindle their scandalous romance and Vlad convinces her to let Anya meet the Dowager Empress at the ballet the next week (\u201cThe Countess and the Common Man\u201d). However, Vlad accidentally drops the ballet tickets and Gleb, overhearing their plans, picks up their tickets (\u201cLand of Yesterday\u201d Reprise).\n\nAt the hotel, Anya has a nightmare about the execution of the Romanovs (\u201cA Nightmare\u201d). Dmitry comforts her and recounts a story of how he bowed to Anastasia at a parade as a young boy. Anya vividly remembers this, and the two realize that Anya is indeed the Grand Duchess Anastasia (\u201cIn a Crowd of Thousands\u201d).\n\nAt the ballet, Vlad suspects that Anya and Dmitry are falling in love and is heartbroken that the two can never be together (\u201cMeant to Be\u201d). During the performance of \u201c[[Swan Lake]]\u201d, Anya sees the Dowager Empress and remembers her. The Dowager Empress also sees Anya and recognizes her, but clings to denial. Dmitry and Gleb (who is conflicted about whether or not to shoot Anya) reflect on their romantic feelings (\u201cQuartet at the Ballet\u201d).\n\nAfter the ballet, Lily also recognizes Anya as Anastasia and immediately takes her to the Dowager Empress. Dmitry is anxious about the meeting and realizes that he is in love with Anya, but knows he must let her go to her family (\u201cEverything to Win\u201d). Anya leaves the meeting enraged, having learned from the Dowager Empress that Vlad and Dmitry intended to use her in their scheme for money. As she storms off, Dmitry waits for the Dowager Empress. Marie coldly dismisses him, but Dmitry disrespectfully stops her. He begs her to see Anya, but she refuses again.\n\nBack at their hotel, Anya starts her packing, but she is interrupted by the Dowager Empress, who impressed by Dmitry's courage, has come to give her an opportunity. Anya is shocked by the Dowager Empress's cruelty, asserting that she isn't the nana that Anya remembered. The Dowager Empress angrily questions Anya about her past and the Romanov family, but Anya compels her to reflect on the person she has become over last two decades. Anya suddenly remembers the night that the Dowager Empress left her for Paris. When Anya produces the music box and sings the lullaby, the Dowager Empress finally realizes that Anya really is Anastasia and the two embrace, now reunited after twenty years (\u201cOnce Upon a December Reprise\u201d).\n\nA press conference is held the next morning, where Vlad and Lily try to fend off the hungry reporters (\u201cThe Press Conference\u201d). Before appearing in public, the Dowager Empress tells Anya that Dmitry did not take the reward after all and reveals her respect for him. Anya expresses misgivings about her future life as a princess and the Dowager Empress insists that no matter what she chooses, they'll always be together. Anya runs off to think; she realizes that she is in love with Dmitry, and decides that she must go after him (\u201cEverything to Win Reprise\u201d). As she turns to leave, Anya sees that Gleb has slipped in and locked them in the room. She realizes why he is there and Gleb says that he must kill her to complete his father's mission. Anya now clearly remembers the day her family was killed and, without fear, taunts him to kill her so that she can be with her family. Overcome with emotion and not willing to bear the shame of his father, Gleb is unable to kill Anya (\u201cStill/The Neva Flows Reprise\u201d). Anya comforts Gleb and they call a truce.\n\nVlad, Lily, and the palace staff search for Anya and the Dowager Empress is joyful, knowing that Anya is now where she belongs. She and Gleb announce to their people that the rumors of Anastasia will now cease; the reward for finding her will be donated to charity. Anya discovers Dmitry at Pont Alexandre III, where they embrace. The couple leaves Paris as the spirits of the Romanovs celebrate the life that Anya and Dmitry will have together (\u201cFinale\u201d).\n\n==Musical numbers==\n''Titles of songs which appeared in the original 1997 animated film are in '''bold'''.<br/>\n''Renamed from the Hartford production (#)''<br/>\n''Not featured in the cast recordings (+)<ref>http://www.broadwayrecords.com/cds/anastasia-original-broadway-cast-recording</ref>''<br/>\n''Replaced by a reprise of \"Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)\" in the US tour and international productions (\u221e)''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n\n''Saint Petersburg, 1907, 1917, and 1927''\n* '''\"Prologue: Once Upon a December\"''' - Dowager Empress and Little Anastasia'''\n* \"The Last Dance of the Romanovs\" - Ensemble #+\n* '''\"A Rumor in St. Petersburg\"''' - Dmitry, Vlad and Ensemble\n* \"In My Dreams\" - Anya\n* \"The Rumors Never End\" - Gleb and Ensemble +\n* '''\"Learn to Do It\"''' - Vlad, Anya, and Dmitry\n* \"The Neva Flows\" - Gleb and Anya #\n* \"The Neva Flows (Reprise)\" - Men +\n* \"My Petersburg\" - Dmitry and Anya\n* '''\"[[Once Upon a December]]\"''' - Anya and Ensemble\n* \"A Secret She Kept\" - Anya # +\n* \"Stay, I Pray You\" - Count Ipolitov, Anya, Dmitry, Vlad, and Ensemble\n* \"We'll Go From There\" - Vlad, Anya, Dmitry, and Ensemble\n* \"Traveling Sequence\" - Gleb, Gorlinsky, Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad +\n* \"Still\" - Gleb\n* \"'''[[Journey to the Past]]'''\" \u2013 Anya\n{{col-break}}\n; Act II\n''Paris, 1927''\n* \"'''Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)'''\" \u2013 Vlad, Dmitry, Anya and Ensemble\n* \"Crossing a Bridge\" \u2013 Anya \u221e\n* \"Close the Door\" \u2013 Dowager Empress\n* \"Land of Yesterday\" \u2013 Lily and Ensemble\n* \"The Countess and the Common Man\" \u2013 Vlad and Lily\n* \"Land of Yesterday (Reprise)\" - Gleb +\n* \"A Nightmare\" \u2013 Romanov Children, Tsar and Tsarina +\n* \"In a Crowd of Thousands\" \u2013 Dmitry and Anya\n* \"'''Meant to Be'''\" \u2013 Vlad #\n* \"Quartet at the Ballet\" \u2013 Anya, Dmitry, Dowager Empress, and Gleb\n* \"Everything to Win\" \u2013 Dmitry\n* \"'''Once Upon a December (Reprise)'''\" \u2013 Anya and Dowager Empress\n* \"The Press Conference\" \u2013 Lily, Vlad and Ensemble\n* \"Everything to Win (Reprise)\" \u2013 Anya\n* \"Still/The Neva Flows (Reprise)\" \u2013 Gleb, Anya, and Ensemble #\n* \"Finale\" \u2013 Dowager Empress, Gleb and Ensemble{{col-end}}\n\n==Characters and casts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\" | Character\n! width=\"15%\" | Reading<ref name=reading>{{cite web | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Exclusive-Crawford-Barrett-Halston-Page-Join-Tveit-Lansbury-Lazar-in-ANASTASIA-Reading-20120728| title=Exclusive: Crawford, Barrett, Halston, Page Join Tveit, Lansbury, Lazar in ANASTASIA Reading!| publisher=BroadwayWorld | work=broadwayworld.com | date=28 July 2012 | accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><br />{{small|(2012)}}\n! width=\"15%\" | Workshop<ref name=workshop>{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/article/tony-winning-director-says-ahrens-and-flahertys-stage-anastasia-will-be-a-whole-new-musical-com-351490| title=Tony-Winning Director Says Ahrens and Flaherty's Stage Anastasia Will Be a Whole \"New Musical\"| last=Viagas |first=Robert | publisher=[[Playbill]] | work=playbill.com | date=1 March 2016 | accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=official/><br />{{small|(2015)}}\n! width=\"15%\" | Hartford Stage<ref name=\"hartford\">{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/article/cast-announced-for-ahrens-and-flahertys-stage-anastasia-com-351490 | title=Cast Announced for Ahrens and Flaherty's Stage Anastasia | last=Viagas | first=Robert | publisher=[[Playbill]] | work=playbill.com | date=9 March 2016 | accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><br />{{small|(2016)}}\n! width=\"15%\" | Broadway<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/article/mary-beth-piel-returns-for-broadways-anastasia# |title=Mary Beth Peil Returns for Broadway's Anastasia |last=Hetrick |first=Adam | publisher=Playbill | work=playbill.com | date=October 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-News-Have-You-Heard-ANASTASIA-Has-Found-Its-Full-Broadway-Cast-20170111 \"Have You Heard 'Anastasia' Has Found Its Full Broadway Cast\"] broadwayworld.com, January 11, 2017</ref><ref name=official>[http://www.anastasiabroadway.com/cast-and-creative/ \"Cast and Creative\"] anastasiabroadway.com</ref><br />{{small|(2017)}}\n! width=\"15%\" | U.S. Tour<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatermania.com/broadway/news/anastasia-first-national-tour-complete-casting_85963.html|title=Anastasia Announces Complete Casting for First National Tour|website=www.theatermania.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref><br />{{small|(2018)}}\n|-\n!

Based on the 1997 [[Anastasia (1997 film)|film of the same name]], the musical adapts the legend of [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], who could have possibly escaped the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of her family]]. Years later in the musical adaptation, an [[amnesia]]c orphan named Anya appears as the main character. Anya hopes to find some trace of the family she has lost by siding with two con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess. Over the course of the adventures in the musical it is strongly assumed that Anya is in fact the lost Duchess, though it is never stated explicitly. The show has gone through many adaptions and opened on Broadway with Christie Altomare as Anya on April 24th, 2017. There it lived for 2 years before closing on March 31st, 2019.

Before leaving, the Dowager Empress gives Anastasia a music box as a parting gift (\"Prologue: Once Upon a December\"). Eleven years later, 17 year-old Anastasia is attending a ball with her [[House of Romanov|family]] when the [[Bolsheviks]] invade the palace. As the Romanovs attempt to escape, Anastasia tries to retrieve her music box only to be shot and presumed dead along with the rest of her family (\"The Last Dance of the Romanovs\").\n\n===Act I===\nIn 1927, Gleb Vaganov, a general for the Bolsheviks who now control Russia, announces to the gloomy Russians that the now-poor Saint Petersburg has been renamed [[Saint Petersburg, Russia|Leningrad]], and he promises a bright and peaceful future. The Russians protest this change, but are uplifted by a rumor that Anastasia may have survived the Bolshevik's attacks. Two wanted con men, the handsome young Dmitry and an ex-member of the Imperial Court named Vlad Popov, hear the rumors and brainstorm \u201cthe biggest con in history\u201d: they will groom a naive girl to become Anastasia in order to extract money from the Dowager Empress (\u201cA Rumor in St. Petersburg\").\n\nDmitry and Vlad hold unsuccessful auditions for the scheme at the theater in the abandoned [[Moika Palace|Yusupov Palace]]. Just as they are about to give up hope of finding a suitable impostor, a street sweeper named Anya walks in to ask Dmitry about paperwork to get tickets for Paris. Dmitry and Vlad become fascinated as Anya explains that she doesn't remember who she is due to her [[amnesia]] and has very few memories of her past (\u201cIn My Dreams\u201d). Amazed by her memory loss and resemblance to Anastasia, they select Anya as their impostor.\n\nAt the capital, government workers sort through rumors and reports for any that require further action. Three bitter actresses report Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad's plot to Gleb, but he dismisses them and files a case for Anya (\u201cThe Rumors Never End\u201d). Back at the palace, Vlad and Dmitry groom a feisty Anya to become Anastasia through history, dining, and dancing lessons (\u201cLearn to Do It\u201d).\n\nGleb orders Anya's arrest, and she is brought to his office in the [[Nevsky Prospect]]. The general interrogates the girl and warns her about the consequences of pretending to be Anastasia. He tries to convince her that Anastasia is really dead. He reveals that his father was the one who shot the Romanovs and, as a boy, he heard the gunshots and their screams. However, Gleb notices that Anya has the \"Romanov eyes\" and realizes that Anya could indeed be Anastasia. As he harbors feelings for her, he lets her off with a warning (\"The Neva Flows\").\n\nAnya reunites with Dmitry and they are teased and attacked by his old con partners, whom they must fight off (\u201cThe Neva Flows Reprise\u201d). Impressed by Anya's fighting skills, Dmitry opens up to her for the first time and tells her about his childhood in the streets of St. Petersburg and how he had to take care of himself as an orphan (\u201cMy Petersburg\u201d). Dmitry begins to trust her enough to show her a music box that he's failed to open, unaware it is the memento that was given to Anastasia by the Dowager Empress. Anya easily winds and opens the box and begins to vaguely remember her past, including an imperial ball many years earlier (\u201cOnce Upon a December\u201d). After this episode, Anya is more resolute than ever in her desire to get to Paris, but Dmitry tells her that they don't have enough money to buy the train tickets. Then she gives him her most prized possession, a diamond that was found sewn to her dress when she was discovered years earlier (\u201cA Secret She Kept\u201d).\n\nAt the [[Finland Station|train station]], Count Ipolitov recognizes Anya as Anastasia and kisses her hand. As they board the train to Paris, Count Ipolitov leads everyone in a prayer of farewell to Russia (\u201cStay, I Pray You\u201d). During the train ride, Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad reflect on what they hope to accomplish in Paris: Anya hoping to discover that she is actually Anastasia, Dmitry's desire for the money, and Vlad hoping to win back Countess Lily Malevsky-Malevitch (\"Sophie\" in the [[Anastasia (1997 film)|1997 animated film]]), the Dowager Empress's lady-in-waiting with whom he had an affair (\u201cWe\u2019ll Go From There\u201d). Count Ipolitov is fatally shot by the police for illegally boarding the train. The police officers then go after Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad since they are wanted criminals in Russia, but they all jump off the train, narrowly avoiding capture.\n\nAs they travel across Russia by foot, Gleb receives orders to follow Anya and kill her if she is the real Anastasia (\u201cTraveling Sequence\u201d). Gleb agrees to the task, but he realizes that he is in love with Anya and questions his heart (\"Still\"). Anya, Vlad, and Dmitry finally arrive in France, and as they travel to Paris, Anya summons the courage to continue on with the hope that she will finally discover who she is (\u201cJourney to the Past\u201d).\n\n===Act II===\nAnya, Vlad, and Dmitry arrive in Paris and are swept up by the sights and sounds of the city (\u201cParis Holds the Key (to Your Heart)\u201d). When Vlad and Dmitry go off on their own, Anya visits the [[Pont Alexandre III]] bridge, named after Anastasia's grandfather and she feels a strong connection to it (\u201cCrossing a Bridge\u201d).\n\nNow a bitter, elderly woman, Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna reads the letters of various Anastasia impersonators and, heartbroken, gives up hope of finding Anastasia (\u201cClose the Door\u201d). As Gleb arrives in Paris, Lily parties at the Neva Club, where rich and noble Russians reminisce about the old Russia (\u201cLand of Yesterday\u201d). Lily is reunited with Vlad, with whom she is angry for stealing her jewelry when they were lovers. The two rekindle their scandalous romance and Vlad convinces her to let Anya meet the Dowager Empress at the ballet the next week (\u201cThe Countess and the Common Man\u201d). However, Vlad accidentally drops the ballet tickets and Gleb, overhearing their plans, picks up their tickets (\u201cLand of Yesterday\u201d Reprise).\n\nAt the hotel, Anya has a nightmare about the execution of the Romanovs (\u201cA Nightmare\u201d). Dmitry comforts her and recounts a story of how he bowed to Anastasia at a parade as a young boy. Anya vividly remembers this, and the two realize that Anya is indeed the Grand Duchess Anastasia (\u201cIn a Crowd of Thousands\u201d).\n\nAt the ballet, Vlad suspects that Anya and Dmitry are falling in love and is heartbroken that the two can never be together (\u201cMeant to Be\u201d). During the performance of \u201c[[Swan Lake]]\u201d, Anya sees the Dowager Empress and remembers her. The Dowager Empress also sees Anya and recognizes her, but clings to denial. Dmitry and Gleb (who is conflicted about whether or not to shoot Anya) reflect on their romantic feelings (\u201cQuartet at the Ballet\u201d).\n\nAfter the ballet, Lily also recognizes Anya as Anastasia and immediately takes her to the Dowager Empress. Dmitry is anxious about the meeting and realizes that he is in love with Anya, but knows he must let her go to her family (\u201cEverything to Win\u201d). Anya leaves the meeting enraged, having learned from the Dowager Empress that Vlad and Dmitry intended to use her in their scheme for money. As she storms off, Dmitry waits for the Dowager Empress. Marie coldly dismisses him, but Dmitry disrespectfully stops her. He begs her to see Anya, but she refuses again.\n\nBack at their hotel, Anya starts her packing, but she is interrupted by the Dowager Empress, who impressed by Dmitry's courage, has come to give her an opportunity. Anya is shocked by the Dowager Empress's cruelty, asserting that she isn't the nana that Anya remembered. The Dowager Empress angrily questions Anya about her past and the Romanov family, but Anya compels her to reflect on the person she has become over last two decades. Anya suddenly remembers the night that the Dowager Empress left her for Paris. When Anya produces the music box and sings the lullaby, the Dowager Empress finally realizes that Anya really is Anastasia and the two embrace, now reunited after twenty years (\u201cOnce Upon a December Reprise\u201d).\n\nA press conference is held the next morning, where Vlad and Lily try to fend off the hungry reporters (\u201cThe Press Conference\u201d). Before appearing in public, the Dowager Empress tells Anya that Dmitry did not take the reward after all and reveals her respect for him. Anya expresses misgivings about her future life as a princess and the Dowager Empress insists that no matter what she chooses, they'll always be together. Anya runs off to think; she realizes that she is in love with Dmitry, and decides that she must go after him (\u201cEverything to Win Reprise\u201d). As she turns to leave, Anya sees that Gleb has slipped in and locked them in the room. She realizes why he is there and Gleb says that he must kill her to complete his father's mission. Anya now clearly remembers the day her family was killed and, without fear, taunts him to kill her so that she can be with her family. Overcome with emotion and not willing to bear the shame of his father, Gleb is unable to kill Anya (\u201cStill/The Neva Flows Reprise\u201d). Anya comforts Gleb and they call a truce.\n\nVlad, Lily, and the palace staff search for Anya and the Dowager Empress is joyful, knowing that Anya is now where she belongs. She and Gleb announce to their people that the rumors of Anastasia will now cease; the reward for finding her will be donated to charity. Anya discovers Dmitry at Pont Alexandre III, where they embrace. The couple leaves Paris as the spirits of the Romanovs celebrate the life that Anya and Dmitry will have together (\u201cFinale\u201d).\n\n==Musical numbers==\n''Titles of songs which appeared in the original 1997 animated film are in '''bold'''.<br/>\n''Renamed from the Hartford production (#)''<br/>\n''Not featured in the cast recordings (+)<ref>http://www.broadwayrecords.com/cds/anastasia-original-broadway-cast-recording</ref>''<br/>\n''Replaced by a reprise of \"Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)\" in the US tour and international productions (\u221e)''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n\n''Saint Petersburg, 1907, 1917, and 1927''\n* '''\"Prologue: Once Upon a December\"''' - Dowager Empress and Little Anastasia'''\n* \"The Last Dance of the Romanovs\" - Ensemble #+\n* '''\"A Rumor in St. Petersburg\"''' - Dmitry, Vlad and Ensemble\n* \"In My Dreams\" - Anya\n* \"The Rumors Never End\" - Gleb and Ensemble +\n* '''\"Learn to Do It\"''' - Vlad, Anya, and Dmitry\n* \"The Neva Flows\" - Gleb and Anya #\n* \"The Neva Flows (Reprise)\" - Men +\n* \"My Petersburg\" - Dmitry and Anya\n* '''\"[[Once Upon a December]]\"''' - Anya and Ensemble\n* \"A Secret She Kept\" - Anya # +\n* \"Stay, I Pray You\" - Count Ipolitov, Anya, Dmitry, Vlad, and Ensemble\n* \"We'll Go From There\" - Vlad, Anya, Dmitry, and Ensemble\n* \"Traveling Sequence\" - Gleb, Gorlinsky, Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad +\n* \"Still\" - Gleb\n* \"'''[[Journey to the Past]]'''\" \u2013 Anya\n{{col-break}}\n; Act II\n''Paris, 1927''\n* \"'''Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)'''\" \u2013 Vlad, Dmitry, Anya and Ensemble\n* \"Crossing a Bridge\" \u2013 Anya \u221e\n* \"Close the Door\" \u2013 Dowager Empress\n* \"Land of Yesterday\" \u2013 Lily and Ensemble\n* \"The Countess and the Common Man\" \u2013 Vlad and Lily\n* \"Land of Yesterday (Reprise)\" - Gleb +\n* \"A Nightmare\" \u2013 Romanov Children, Tsar and Tsarina +\n* \"In a Crowd of Thousands\" \u2013 Dmitry and Anya\n* \"'''Meant to Be'''\" \u2013 Vlad #\n* \"Quartet at the Ballet\" \u2013 Anya, Dmitry, Dowager Empress, and Gleb\n* \"Everything to Win\" \u2013 Dmitry\n* \"'''Once Upon a December (Reprise)'''\" \u2013 Anya and Dowager Empress\n* \"The Press Conference\" \u2013 Lily, Vlad and Ensemble\n* \"Everything to Win (Reprise)\" \u2013 Anya\n* \"Still/The Neva Flows (Reprise)\" \u2013 Gleb, Anya, and Ensemble #\n* \"Finale\" \u2013 Dowager Empress, Gleb and Ensemble{{col-end}}\n\n==Characters and casts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\" | Character\n! width=\"15%\" | Reading<ref name=reading>{{cite web | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Exclusive-Crawford-Barrett-Halston-Page-Join-Tveit-Lansbury-Lazar-in-ANASTASIA-Reading-20120728| title=Exclusive: Crawford, Barrett, Halston, Page Join Tveit, Lansbury, Lazar in ANASTASIA Reading!| publisher=BroadwayWorld | work=broadwayworld.com | date=28 July 2012 | accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><br />{{small|(2012)}}\n! width=\"15%\" | Workshop<ref name=workshop>{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/article/tony-winning-director-says-ahrens-and-flahertys-stage-anastasia-will-be-a-whole-new-musical-com-351490| title=Tony-Winning Director Says Ahrens and Flaherty's Stage Anastasia Will Be a Whole \"New Musical\"| last=Viagas |first=Robert | publisher=[[Playbill]] | work=playbill.com | date=1 March 2016 | accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=official/><br />{{small|(2015)}}\n! width=\"15%\" | Hartford Stage<ref name=\"hartford\">{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/article/cast-announced-for-ahrens-and-flahertys-stage-anastasia-com-351490 | title=Cast Announced for Ahrens and Flaherty's Stage Anastasia | last=Viagas | first=Robert | publisher=[[Playbill]] | work=playbill.com | date=9 March 2016 | accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><br />{{small|(2016)}}\n! width=\"15%\" | Broadway<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/article/mary-beth-piel-returns-for-broadways-anastasia# |title=Mary Beth Peil Returns for Broadway's Anastasia |last=Hetrick |first=Adam | publisher=Playbill | work=playbill.com | date=October 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-News-Have-You-Heard-ANASTASIA-Has-Found-Its-Full-Broadway-Cast-20170111 \"Have You Heard 'Anastasia' Has Found Its Full Broadway Cast\"] broadwayworld.com, January 11, 2017</ref><ref name=official>[http://www.anastasiabroadway.com/cast-and-creative/ \"Cast and Creative\"] anastasiabroadway.com</ref><br />{{small|(2017)}}\n! width=\"15%\" | U.S. Tour<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatermania.com/broadway/news/anastasia-first-national-tour-complete-casting_85963.html|title=Anastasia Announces Complete Casting for First National Tour|website=www.theatermania.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref><br />{{small|(2018)}}\n|-\n!
