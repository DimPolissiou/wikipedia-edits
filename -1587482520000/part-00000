The Second World War involved global conflict on an unprecedented scale; the absolute urgency of mobilizing the entire population made the expansion of the role of women inevitable, although the particular roles varied from country to country. Millions of women of various ages died as a result of the war.\n\n==World patterns==\n\nSeveral hundred thousand women served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units. The Soviet Union, for example, integrated women directly into their army units. The United States, by comparison, elected not to use women in combat because public opinion would not tolerate it.<ref>D'Ann Campbell, [http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/ww2/combat.pdf online edition \"Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union\"], ''[[Journal of Military History]]'' (April 1993), 57:301-323</ref> Instead, like in other nations, approximately 350,000 women served as uniformed auxiliaries in non-combat roles in the U.S. armed forces. These roles included: administration, nurses, truck drivers, mechanics, electricians, and auxiliary pilots.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brock|first1=Julia|last2=Dickey|first2=Jennifer|last3=Harker|first3=Richard|last4=Lewis|first4=Catherine|title=Beyond Rosie: A Documentary History of Women and World War II|date=2015|publisher=The University of Arkansas Press|isbn=978-1-55728-670-3}}</ref>\n\nWomen also took part outside of formal military structure in the resistances of [[French Resistance|France]], [[Italian Resistance|Italy]], and [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Poland]], as well as in the British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] and American [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] which aided these.\n\nWomen were forced into [[sexual slaves|sexual slavery]]; the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] forced hundreds of thousands in Asia to become [[comfort women]], before and throughout World War II.\n\n==Allies==\n===Australia===\n{{Main article|Australian women during World War II}}\n\nAustralian women played a larger role in World War 2 than they had done in [[World War I]]. Many women wanted to play an active role, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940. A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Canadian women during the World Wars}}\n\n[[File:Locomotive fast freight cleaning.png|thumb|right|300px|Women replaced men in many of the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] jobs during World War II. Photo taken January, 1943.]]\n\nWhen war began to look unavoidable in the late 1930s, Canadian women felt obligated to help the fight. In October 1938, the [[Women's Royal Voluntary Service|Women's Volunteer Service]] was established in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. Soon, all the provinces and territories followed suit and  similar volunteer groups were emerged. \"Husbands, brothers, fathers, boyfriends were all joining up, doing something to help win the war. Surely women could help as well!\"<ref name=\"gossage\">Gossage, Carolyn. \u2018\u2019Greatcoats and Glamour Boots\u2019\u2019. (Toronto:Dundurn Press Limited, 1991)</ref> In addition to the [[Red Cross]], several volunteer corps had designed themselves after auxiliary groups from Britain. These corps had uniforms, marching drills and a few had rifle training. It became clear, that a unified governing system would be beneficial to the corps. The volunteers in [[British Columbia]] donated two dollars each to pay the expenses so a representative could talk to politicians in [[Ottawa]]. Although all of the politicians appeared sympathetic to the cause, it remained \"premature\" in terms of national necessity.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nIn June  1941, the [[Canadian Women's Army Corps]] was established. The women who enlisted would take over\n*Drivers of light mechanical transport vehicles\n*Cooks in hospitals and messes\n*Clerks, typists, and stenographers at camps and training centres\n*Telephone operators and messengers\n*Canteen helpers<ref name=\"gossage\" />\nOn July 2, 1942 women were given permission to enlist in what would be known as the [[Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force]]. Lastly the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] created the [[Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service]] (WRENS).<ref name=\"gossage\" /> The WRENS were the only corps that were officially a part of their sanctioning body as a women's division. This led to bureaucratic issues that would be solved most easily by absorbing the civilian corps governed by military organizations, into women's divisions as soldiers.\nAccording to the [[RCAF]] the following are the requirements of an enlisted woman:\n#Must be at least 18 years of age, and younger than 41 years of age\n#Must be of medical category A4B (equivalent of A1)\n#Must be equal to or over 5 feet (152&nbsp;cm), and fall within the appropriate weight for her height, not being too far above or below the standard\n#Must have a minimum education of entrance into high school\n#Be able to pass the appropriate trades test\n#Be of good character with no record of conviction for an indictable offence<ref name=\"gossage\" />\nWomen would not be considered for enlistment if they were married and had children dependent on them. Training centres were required for all of the new recruits. They could not be sent to the existing centres as it was necessary that they be separated from male recruits. The Canadian Women's Army Corps set up centres in [[Vermilion, Alberta]] and [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. [[Ottawa]] and [[Toronto]] were the locations of the training centres for the Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force. The WRENS were outfitted in [[Galt, Ontario]].<ref name=\"gossage\" /> Each service had to come up with the best possible appeal to the women joining, for they all wanted them. In reality, the women went where their fathers, brothers and boyfriends were.<ref name=\"gossage\" /> Women had numerous reasons for wanting to join the effort; whether they had a father, husband, or brother in the forces, or simply felt it a duty to help. One woman blatantly exclaimed that she could not wait to turn eighteen to enlist, because she had fantasies of assassinating Hitler. Many women aged 16 or 17 lied about their age in order to enlist. The United States would allow only women who were at least twenty-one to join. For their young female citizens, Canada was the logical option. Recruitment for the different branches of the Canadian Forces was set up in places like Boston and New York. Modifications were made to girls with US citizenship, having their records marked, \"Oath of allegiance not taken by virtue of being a citizen of The United States of America\".<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nWomen had to undergo to medical examinations and meet fitness requirements as well as training in certain trades, depending on the aspect of the armed forces of which they wanted to be a part. Enlisted women were issued entire uniforms minus the undergarments, for which they would receive a quarterly allowance.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nTo be an enlisted woman during the creation stages was not easy. Besides the fact that everyone was learning as they went, they did not receive the support they needed from the male recruits. To begin with, women were initially paid two-thirds of what a man at the same level would make.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://ww2db.com/event/timeline/1942/ |title=1942 Timeline |publisher=WW2DB |accessdate=2011-02-09}}</ref> As the war progressed the military leaders began to see the substantial impact the women could make. This was taken into account and the women received a raise to four-fifths of the wages of a man.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> A female doctor however, would receive equal financial compensation to her male counterpart. The negative reaction of men towards the female recruits was addressed in [[propaganda]] films. ''[[Canada Carries On#1943|Proudly She Marches]]'' and ''[[Wings on Her Shoulder]]'' were made to show the acceptance of female recruits, while showing the men that although they were taking jobs traditionally intended for men, they would be able to retain their femininity.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nOther problems faced early on for these women were those of a more racial nature. An officer of the [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]] had to write to her superiors regarding whether or not a girl of \"[[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indian nationality]]\" would be objected to for enlistment. Because of Canada's large population of immigrants, German women also enlisted, creating great animosity between recruits.<ref name=\"gossage\" /> The biggest difficulty was the French-Canadian population. In a document published on the 25 November 1941, it was declared that enlisted women should \"unofficially\" speak English. However, seeing the large number of capable women that this left out, a School of English was stabled for recruits in mid-1942.<ref name=\"gossage\" /> In 1942, [[Mary Greyeyes|Mary Greyeyes-Reid]] became the first First Nations woman to join the [[Canadian Forces]].<ref name=\"forces\">{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.ca/en/page/aboriginals-93#aproudhistory-2 | title=Aboriginal Programs, A Proud History | publisher=[[Canadian Forces]] | accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref> She was featured in photographs to represent native people in the forces, yet at the same time was not welcome in the barracks due to discrimination.<ref name=\"legion\">{{cite web | url=http://legionmagazine.com/en/index.php/2012/08/historical-record-corrected-after-nearly-70-years/ | title=Historical record corrected after nearly 70 years | publisher=[[Legion Magazine]] | date=August 10, 2012 | accessdate=January 25, 2013 | author=Adams, Sharon}}</ref>\n\nOnce in training, some women felt that they had made a mistake. Several women cracked under the pressure and were hospitalized. Other women felt the need to escape, and ran away. The easiest and fastest way out of the service was pregnancy. Women who found out that they were expecting were given a special, quickly executed, discharge.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nThe women who successfully graduated from training had to find ways to entertain themselves to keep morale up. Softball, badminton, tennis, and hockey were among popular pastimes for recruits.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nReligion was of a personal matter to the recruits. A minister of sorts was usually on site for services. For Jewish women, it was custom that they were able to get back to their barracks by sundown on Sabbath and holidays; a [[rabbi]] would be made available if possible.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nAt the beginning of the war 600,000 women in Canada held permanent jobs in the private sector, by the peak in 1943 1.2 million women had jobs.<ref name=\"fact\">[[Veterans Affairs Canada]], [http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/second-world-war/fact_sheets/women \"Women at War,\"] Government of Canada, 2013-08-02</ref> Women quickly gained a good reputation for their mechanical dexterity and fine precision due to their smaller stature.\n\nWomen also had to keep their homes together while the men were away. \"An Alberta mother of nine boys, all away at either war or factory jobs \u2013 drove the tractor, plowed the fields, put up hay, and hauled grain to the elevators, along with tending her garden, raising chickens, pigs, and turkeys, and canned hundreds of jars of fruits and vegetables\".<ref name=\"fact\" />\n\nIn addition to physical jobs, women were also asked to cut back and ration. Silk and nylon were used for the war efforts, creating a shortage of stockings. Many women painted lines down the back of their legs to create the illusion of wearing the fashionable stockings of the time.<ref name=\"fact\" />\n\n===India===\n{{See also|Indian Army during World War II#Women's Auxiliary Corps}}\n\nIn India, policies resembled those of Great Britain, except that women were not used in anti-aircraft units, and there was no conscription of women for munitions work.<ref>Yasmin Khan, ''The Raj At War: A People's History Of India's Second World War'' (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Women's Auxiliary Corps operated from 1939 to 1947, with peak strength of 850 officers and 7,200 auxiliaries in the Indian army. A small naval section operated in the Royal Indian Navy.<ref>Alan Harfield, \"The Women's Auxiliary Corps (India),\" ''Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research'' 83, no 335 (Autumn 2005), pp 243-254</ref>\n\nThe nationalist movements in India during the war split on military service. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] opposed fascism and on his advice youths from India joined the armed forces to fight with Britain along with allies.\n\nOne faction of Congress led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] was so opposed that it cooperated with Nazi Germany, and actually enlisted soldiers who fought alongside Japanese soldiers against the British and Indians in Burma. The \"Rani of Jhansi Regiment\" involved these women in combat on behalf of the [[Indian National Army]]. It was active from 1943-45. Bose spent a good deal of effort on him developing anti-British anti-imperialist ideology designed to mobilize models of women as mothers and sisters in Indian tradition. Bose argued that the direct involvement of women was necessary to achieve total independence of India from the colonial powers. Bose articulated a modern definition of female heroism that involved combat. In actual practice, very few of his female soldiers were directly involved in combat; they largely had support roles in logistics and medical care.<ref>Carol Hills and Daniel C. Silverman, 1993. \u201cNationalism and Feminism in Late Colonial India: The Rani of Jhansi Regiment\u201d, ''Modern Asian Studies'' 27#4 (1993) pp 741-760.</ref><ref>Joyce C. Lebra, ''Women Against the Raj: The Rani of Jhansi Regiment'' (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2008).</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nAfter 1943 Italian women joined the anti-fascist resistance, and also served in the fascist army of Mussolini's rump state that formed in 1943. They did not serve in the main Italian army. Some 35,000 women (and 170,000 men) joined in the Resistance. The women were used as auxiliary support and were not allowed in senior ranks. Most did cooking and laundry duty.   Some were guides, messengers, and couriers near the front lines. A few were attached to small attack groups of five or six men engaged in sabotage. Some all-female units, engaged in civilian and political action. The Germans aggressively tried to suppress them, sending 5000 to prison, deporting 3000 to Germany. About 650 died in combat or by execution. On a much larger scale, non-military auxiliaries of the Catholic Centro Italiano Femminile (CIF) and the leftist Unione Donne Italiane (UDI) were new organizations that gave women political legitimacy after the war.<ref>Dan A.

During the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]] they saw combat, playing auxiliary roles in defensive action. [[Janina Lewandowska]] was a pilot. Marianna Cel was a member of [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]]'s guerilla unit 1939-1940.\n\n====Underground====\n[[Krystyna Skarbek]] worked for Polish underground in Hungary and later joined SOE. Writer [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]] helped Jews during the Holocaust, was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. [[Wanda Jakubowska]] survived Auschwitz and directed  [[The Last Stage]], a concentration camp film. [[El\u017cbieta Zawacka]] was a [[Cichociemni|paratrooper]], courier and fighter.

Their most important role was as couriers carrying messages between cells of the resistance movement and distributing news broadsheets and operating clandestine printing presses. During partisan attacks on Nazi forces and installations they served as scouts. About 40,000 of Polish women were imprisoned in [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]]. [[Zofia Posmysz]] survived two camps and described her story, inspiring [[Passenger (1963 film)|Passenger]] 1953 film.  [[Wanda Jakubowska]] was imprisoned in Auschwitz and after the war directed a classic film ''[[The Last Stage]]''.\n\nJewish women fought in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and several smaller fights.<ref>[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/women-in-the-holocaust/partisans/index.asp Yad Vashem, Partisans and Underground]</ref> The Stroop Report contains a picture of [[HeHalutz]] female fighters captured with weapons.\n\nDuring the [[Warsaw Rising]] of 1944, female members of the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] were couriers and medics, but many carried weapons and took part in the fighting. Among the more notable women of the Home Army was [[Wanda Gertz]] who created and commanded ''DYSK'' (Women's sabotage unit). For her bravery in these activities and later in the Warsaw Uprising she was awarded Poland's highest awards - [[Virtuti Militari]] and [[Polonia Restituta]]. Many nurses were murdered on September the 2nd, 1944. [[Anna \u015awirszczy\u0144ska]] was a nurse and expected to be executed. She described later the Rising in her poems. One of the articles of the capitulation was that the German Army recognized them as full members of the armed forces and needed to set up separate [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s to hold over 2000 female prisoners-of-war.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ney-Krwawicz |first=Marek |url=http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm |title=Women Soldiers of the Polish Home Army |publisher=Polishresistance-ak.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref>\n\n[[Ma\u0142gorzata Fornalska]] was one of important Communist activists, arrested and killed by Germans.

These included the [[Anders Army]], the [[Women's Auxiliary Service (Poland)|Women's Auxiliary Service]] which was deployed in Italy and served across the Polish Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Soviet [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|First Polish Army]] had the [[Emilia Plater Independent Women's Battalion]], whose members took part in fighting as part of sentry duties.\n\n====Extermination====\n*The Holocaust \n{{Main|The Holocaust in Poland}}\n[[Stefania Wilczy\u0144ska]] cooperated with [[Janusz Korczak]] working in a Jewish orphanage in [[Warsaw Ghetto]], they died in [[Treblinka extermination camp]].\n*Romani genocide\n{{Main|Romani genocide}}\n*Gentiles\nThousands of women were killed during [[Pacification actions in German-occupied Poland]].\nTens of thousands were killed by Ukrainian nationalists in [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|Volhynia and Eastern Galicia]].\nTens of thousands of non-Jewish women were shot in August 1944 at Warsaw during [[Ochota massacre]] and [[Wola massacre]].\n\n====Concentration camps and slave work====\n[[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]], [[Seweryna Szmaglewska]], Krystyna \u017bywulska were imprisoned in Auschwitz and later described their experiences in novels.\nMany women were [[Zivilarbeiter]]s or camp or prison inmates who had to work for Germans.

Web.</ref> Women took on the responsibility of managing the home and became the heroines of the home front.  According to Carruthers, this industrial employment of women significantly raised women's self-esteem as it allowed them to carry out their full potential and do their part in the war. During the war, women's normative roles of \"house wife\" transformed into a patriotic duty. As Carruthers put it, the housewife has become a heroine in the defeat of Hitler.<ref name=\"Carruthers, Susan L 1947\"/> \nThe roles of women shifting from domestic to masculine and dangerous jobs in the workforce made for important changes in workplace structure and society. During the Second World War, society had specific ideals for the jobs in which both women and men participated. When women began to enter into the masculine workforce and munitions industries previously dominated by men, women's segregation began to diminish. Increasing numbers of women were forced into industry jobs between 1940-1943.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\">Gazeley, Ian. \"Women\u2019s pay in British Industry during the second world War.\" ''[[Economic History Review]]''.

Women were the target audience in the various forms of propaganda because they were paid substantially less than men.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/> It was of no concern whether women were filling the same jobs that men previously held. Even if women were replacing jobs with the same skill level as a man, they were still paid significantly less due to their gender. In the engineering industry alone, the number of skilled and semi-skilled female workers increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent from 1940-1942.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/> According to Gazeley, even though women were paid less than men, it is clear that women engaging in war work and taking on jobs preserved by men reduced industrial segregation.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/>\n\n[[File:UK worker meets Roosevelt - Toni Frissell LC-F9-01-4211-92-2.jpg|thumb|portrait|right| A female machinist talking with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] during her goodwill tour of Great Britain in 1942]]\n[[File:War Office Second World War Official Collection H28513.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pte Elizabeth Gourlay transmitting a radio message.]]\n[[File:Hrh Princess Elizabeth in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, April 1945 TR2832.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Elizabeth in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]], April 1945]]\nIn [[United Kingdom|Britain]], women were essential to the war effort. The contribution by civilian men and women to the British war effort was acknowledged with the use of the words \"[[home front]]\" to describe the battles that were being fought on a domestic level with rationing, recycling, and war work, such as in munitions factories and farms and men were thus released into the military. Women were also recruited to work on the canals, transporting coal and munitions by barge across the UK via the inland waterways.

November 1, (2005): 108-117. Web.</ref> Propaganda was meant to eliminate all conflicts of personal and political roles and create a heroine out of the women. The implication with propaganda is that it asked women to redefine their personal and domestic ideals of womanhood and motivate them go against the roles that have been instilled in them.<ref name=\"Gingrich, Nadine 2005\"/> \nThe government struggled to encourage women to respond to posters and other forms of propaganda. One attempt to recruit women into the labour force was in one short film ''My Father's Daughter''. In this propaganda film a wealthy factory owner's daughter begs to do her part in the war, but her father carries the stereotypical belief that women are meant to be caretakers and are incapable of such heavy work. When one foreman presents one of the most valuable and efficient workers in the factory as the daughter, the father's prejudices are eliminated. The encouraging message of this short film is \"There's Not Much Women Can't Do\".<ref name=\"Gingrich, Nadine 2005\"/>\n\n====Military roles====\n\nThe most common role of women in active service was that of a searchlight operator.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\">De Groot, Gerard J. \"`I Love the Scent of Cordite in Your Hair': Gender Dynamics in Mixed Anti-Craft Batteries\". ''History'' 82.265 (1997): 73-92. Web.</ref> All of the members of the [[93rd Searchlight Regiment]] were women. Despite being limited in their roles, there was a great amount of respect between the men and women in the mixed batteries.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/> One report states \"Many men were amazed that women could make adequate gunners despite their excitable temperament, lack of technical instincts, their lack of interest in aeroplanes and their physical weaknesses\".<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/> While women still faced discrimination from some of the highly stereotypical older soldiers and officers who did not like women \"playing with their guns\", women were given rifle practice and taught to use anti-aircraft guns while serving in their batteries. They were told that this was in case the Germans invaded. If that were to ever happen, they would be evacuated immediately.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/>\n\n[[File:The_Auxiliary_Territorial_Service_at_An_Anti-aircraft_Gun_Site_in_Britain,_December_1942_TR453.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]] spotter at a 3.7-inch [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA gun site]], December 1942]]\n[[File:Douglas DC-3 - Royal Air Force Transport Command, 1943-1945.

Generally women between 17 and 43 could volunteer and those under 18 required parental consent.<ref name=\"crang\" /> After applying, applicants had to fulfill other requirements, including an interview and medical examination; if they were deemed fit to serve then they were enrolled for the duration of the war. WRNS was the only service that offered an immobile branch which allowed women to live in their homes and work in the local naval establishment.<ref name=\"crang\" /> WRNS was the smallest of the three organizations and as a result was very selective with their candidates. Of the three organizations, WAAF was the most preferred choice; the second being WRNS. ATS was the largest of the three organizations and was least favoured among women because it accepted those who were unable to get into the other forces.  ATS had also developed a reputation of promiscuity and poor living conditions, many women also found the khaki uniform unappealing and as a result favoured WRNS and WAAF over ATS.<ref name=\"crang\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsremembered.org.uk/servicedress.htm|title=ATS Remembered - Service Dress|website=www.atsremembered.org.uk}}</ref> Over 640,000 British women served in various auxiliary services of the British armed forces.<ref>https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2018/0525/From-paranurses-to-snipers-Exhibit-focuses-on-women-s-WWII-contributions</ref>\n\n====Limitations====\n\nWhilst women were limited in some of their roles, they were expected to perform to the same standard as a male soldier performing the same role, and although they could not participate in frontline combat, they still manned anti-aircraft guns and defences which actively engaged hostile aircraft above Britain. Women went through the same military training, lived in the same conditions and did almost the same jobs as men, with the exception of not being able to participate in front-line combat. This important distinction meant that women did not tend to be nominated for medals of valour or bravery, because they were only awarded for \"active operations against enemy in the field\", which women could not take part in.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/>\n\nWomen were also distinct because of the titles by which they were addressed in the army, although these tended to be no different from their male counterparts. They wore the same rank insignia as their male counterparts. Many members of the ATS were respected by the units they were attached to despite their different insignia.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/> The only major difference between an ATS member and a male member of the Regular Army was discipline: a woman was not allowed to be court marshalled unless she herself chose to be. The women in the service were also under the authority of the female officers of the ATS, instead of the male officers under whom they served directly. This meant any disciplinary action was entirely in the hands of the ATS, removing male influence from the process.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/>\n\n====Volunteers====\nDespite their obvious distinctions from men, women were eager to volunteer. Many of the servicewomen came from restricted backgrounds; therefore they found the army liberating.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/> Other reasons women volunteered included escaping unhappy homes or marriages, or to have a more stimulating job. The overwhelming reason for joining the army, though, was patriotism. As in World War I, Great Britain was in a patriotic fervour throughout World War II to protect itself from foreign invasion.<ref name=\"Crang, Jeremy A 2008\">Crang, Jeremy A. \"'Come into the Army, Maud': Women, Military Conscription, and the Markham Inquiry.\" Defence Studies 8.3 (2008): 381-95. Web.</ref> Women, for the first time, were given the opportunity to help in their native land's defense, which explains the high number of female volunteers at the beginning of the war. Despite the overwhelming response to the call for female volunteers, some women refused to join the forces; many were unwilling to give up the civilian job they had, and others had male counterparts that were unwilling to let them go . Others felt that war was still a man's job, and not something women should be involved in.<ref name=\"Crang, Jeremy A 2008\"/> Similar to the men's forces, women's forces were mostly volunteer throughout the war.<ref name=\"Crang, Jeremy A 2008\"/> When women's conscription did come into effect, however, it was highly limited. For example, married women were exempt from any obligation to serve unless they chose to do so, and those who were called could opt to serve in civil defense (the home front).<ref name=\"Crang, Jeremy A 2008\"/>\n\n[[File:WAAF plotters at work in the Operations Room at No. 11 Group HQ at Uxbridge in Middlesex, 1942.

The Women of Employment Order required women ages 18\u201345 to register for labour exchanges and by 1943 the maximum age was raised to 50, which brought an additional 20,000 women into the workforce. Aircraft production was given the top labour priority and many women were diverted into it with some even being transferred from agricultural production.<ref name=\"Little\" />\n\n====Interpretation of aerial photographs====\n\nA vital job was interpreting aerial photographs taken by British spy planes over Allied Europe.<ref>Downing, Taylor. \"Spying from the Sky.\" ''[[History Today]]'' 61.11 (2011): 10-16.

The participation of women allowed these bombs to be destroyed.<ref name=\"Downing, Taylor 2011\"/>\n\n====Civilian pay scales====\nAlthough many women were doing jobs that men had previously done during the war, there were still pay distinctions between the two sexes. Women's pay was significantly lower than men's pay. The average female in manufacturing was earning $31 per week while the average male earned $55 per week.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yellin|first1=Emily|title=Our Mothers War: American Women at Home and at the Front during World War II.|publisher=Free Press|location=NY|isbn=0743245164|url=https://archive.org/details/ourmotherswar00emil|date=2005-03-07}}</ref> Equal pay was rarely achieved as employers wanted to avoid labour costs. Skilled work was often broken down into smaller tasks and labelled skilled or semi-skilled and then paid according to women's pay rates.<ref name=\"Bruley\" /> Women who were judged to be doing \"men's work\" were paid more than women who were thought to be doing \"women's work\" and the employers' definition of this varied regionally.<ref name=\"Little\" /> Women were receiving closer wages to their male counterparts; however despite the government's expressed intentions, women continued to be paid less than men for equivalent work and were segregated in terms of job description, status, and the hours they put in.<ref name=\"Little\" /> In 1940 Ernest Bevin persuaded engineering employers and unions to give women equal pay to men since they were taking on the same tasks that men previously had; this became the ''Extended Employment of Women Agreement''.<ref name=\"Hart\" /> Generally, pay increases depended on the industry; industries that were dominated by women before the war, like textiles and clothing, saw no changes in pay. However the gap between male and female earnings narrowed by 20-24% in metals, engineering and vehicle building and by 10-13% in chemicals, which were all deemed important to the war effort.<ref name=\"Gazeley\" /> Overtime hours also differed, with women getting 2\u20133 hours and men 9-10 a week. Women\u2019s hours were still regulated because of their perceived responsibilities to take care of their family and household.<ref name=\"Hart\" />\n\n====High profile====\nThe British gave high prestige to their women's units who therefore escaped much of the vulgar commentary.

The AF\u017d managed schools, hospitals and local governments. About 100,000 women served with 600,000 men in Tito's Yugoslav National Liberation Army.

Nearly six million were doing farm work, as Germany's agricultural economy was dominated by small family farms. 2.7 million worked in industry. When the German economy was mobilized for war it paradoxically led to a drop in female work participation, reaching a low of 41% before gradually climbing back to over 50% again. This still compares favorably with the UK and the US, both playing catchup, with Britain achieving a participation rate of 41% of women of working age in 1944. However, in terms of women employed in war work, British and German female participation rates were nearly equal by 1944, with the United States still lagging. The difficulties the [[Third Reich]] faced in increasing the size of the work force was mitigated by reallocating labor to work that supported the war effort. High wages in war industries attracted hundreds of thousands, freeing up men for military duties. Prisoners of war were also employed as farmhands, freeing up women for other work.<ref>[[Adam Tooze]], ''The Wages of Destruction'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe Third Reich had many roles for women.

The Second World War involved global conflict on an unprecedented scale; the absolute urgency of mobilizing the entire population made the expansion of the role of women inevitable, although the particular roles varied from country to country. Millions of women of various ages died as a result of the war.\n\n==World patterns==\n\nSeveral hundred thousand women served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units. The Soviet Union, for example, integrated women directly into their army units. The United States, by comparison, elected not to use women in combat because public opinion would not tolerate it.<ref>D'Ann Campbell, [http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/ww2/combat.pdf online edition \"Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union\"], ''[[Journal of Military History]]'' (April 1993), 57:301-323</ref> Instead, like in other nations, approximately 350,000 women served as uniformed auxiliaries in non-combat roles in the U.S. armed forces.

Many women wanted to play an active role, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940. A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Canadian women during the World Wars}}\n\n[[File:Locomotive fast freight cleaning.png|thumb|right|300px|Women replaced men in many of the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] jobs during World War II. Photo taken January, 1943.]]\n\nWhen war began to look unavoidable in the late 1930s, Canadian women felt obligated to help the fight. In October 1938, the [[Women's Royal Voluntary Service|Women's Volunteer Service]] was established in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. Soon, all the provinces and territories followed suit and  similar volunteer groups were emerged. \"Husbands, brothers, fathers, boyfriends were all joining up, doing something to help win the war. Surely women could help as well!\"<ref name=\"gossage\">Gossage, Carolyn. \u2018\u2019Greatcoats and Glamour Boots\u2019\u2019. (Toronto:Dundurn Press Limited, 1991)</ref> In addition to the [[Red Cross]], several volunteer corps had designed themselves after auxiliary groups from Britain. These corps had uniforms, marching drills and a few had rifle training. It became clear, that a unified governing system would be beneficial to the corps. The volunteers in [[British Columbia]] donated two dollars each to pay the expenses so a representative could talk to politicians in [[Ottawa]]. Although all of the politicians appeared sympathetic to the cause, it remained \"premature\" in terms of national necessity.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nIn June  1941, the [[Canadian Women's Army Corps]] was established. The women who enlisted would take over\n*Drivers of light mechanical transport vehicles\n*Cooks in hospitals and messes\n*Clerks, typists, and stenographers at camps and training centres\n*Telephone operators and messengers\n*Canteen helpers<ref name=\"gossage\" />\nOn July 2, 1942 women were given permission to enlist in what would be known as the [[Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force]]. Lastly the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] created the [[Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service]] (WRENS).<ref name=\"gossage\" /> The WRENS were the only corps that were officially a part of their sanctioning body as a women's division. This led to bureaucratic issues that would be solved most easily by absorbing the civilian corps governed by military organizations, into women's divisions as soldiers.\nAccording to the [[RCAF]] the following are the requirements of an enlisted woman:\n#Must be at least 18 years of age, and younger than 41 years of age\n#Must be of medical category A4B (equivalent of A1)\n#Must be equal to or over 5 feet (152&nbsp;cm), and fall within the appropriate weight for her height, not being too far above or below the standard\n#Must have a minimum education of entrance into high school\n#Be able to pass the appropriate trades test\n#Be of good character with no record of conviction for an indictable offence<ref name=\"gossage\" />\nWomen would not be considered for enlistment if they were married and had children dependent on them. Training centres were required for all of the new recruits. They could not be sent to the existing centres as it was necessary that they be separated from male recruits. The Canadian Women's Army Corps set up centres in [[Vermilion, Alberta]] and [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. [[Ottawa]] and [[Toronto]] were the locations of the training centres for the Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force. The WRENS were outfitted in [[Galt, Ontario]].<ref name=\"gossage\" /> Each service had to come up with the best possible appeal to the women joining, for they all wanted them. In reality, the women went where their fathers, brothers and boyfriends were.<ref name=\"gossage\" /> Women had numerous reasons for wanting to join the effort; whether they had a father, husband, or brother in the forces, or simply felt it a duty to help. One woman blatantly exclaimed that she could not wait to turn eighteen to enlist, because she had fantasies of assassinating Hitler. Many women aged 16 or 17 lied about their age in order to enlist. The United States would allow only women who were at least twenty-one to join. For their young female citizens, Canada was the logical option. Recruitment for the different branches of the Canadian Forces was set up in places like Boston and New York. Modifications were made to girls with US citizenship, having their records marked, \"Oath of allegiance not taken by virtue of being a citizen of The United States of America\".<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nWomen had to undergo to medical examinations and meet fitness requirements as well as training in certain trades, depending on the aspect of the armed forces of which they wanted to be a part. Enlisted women were issued entire uniforms minus the undergarments, for which they would receive a quarterly allowance.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nTo be an enlisted woman during the creation stages was not easy. Besides the fact that everyone was learning as they went, they did not receive the support they needed from the male recruits. To begin with, women were initially paid two-thirds of what a man at the same level would make.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://ww2db.com/event/timeline/1942/ |title=1942 Timeline |publisher=WW2DB |accessdate=2011-02-09}}</ref> As the war progressed the military leaders began to see the substantial impact the women could make. This was taken into account and the women received a raise to four-fifths of the wages of a man.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> A female doctor however, would receive equal financial compensation to her male counterpart. The negative reaction of men towards the female recruits was addressed in [[propaganda]] films. ''[[Canada Carries On#1943|Proudly She Marches]]'' and ''[[Wings on Her Shoulder]]'' were made to show the acceptance of female recruits, while showing the men that although they were taking jobs traditionally intended for men, they would be able to retain their femininity.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nOther problems faced early on for these women were those of a more racial nature. An officer of the [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]] had to write to her superiors regarding whether or not a girl of \"[[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indian nationality]]\" would be objected to for enlistment. Because of Canada's large population of immigrants, German women also enlisted, creating great animosity between recruits.<ref name=\"gossage\" /> The biggest difficulty was the French-Canadian population. In a document dated 25 November 1941, it was declared that enlisted women should \"unofficially\" speak English. However, seeing the large number of capable women that this left out, a School of English was stabled for recruits in mid-1942.<ref name=\"gossage\" /> In 1942, [[Mary Greyeyes|Mary Greyeyes-Reid]] became the first First Nations woman to join the [[Canadian Forces]].<ref name=\"forces\">{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.ca/en/page/aboriginals-93#aproudhistory-2 | title=Aboriginal Programs, A Proud History | publisher=[[Canadian Forces]] | accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref> She was featured in photographs to represent native people in the forces, yet at the same time was not welcome in the barracks due to discrimination.<ref name=\"legion\">{{cite web | url=http://legionmagazine.com/en/index.php/2012/08/historical-record-corrected-after-nearly-70-years/ | title=Historical record corrected after nearly 70 years | publisher=[[Legion Magazine]] | date=August 10, 2012 | accessdate=January 25, 2013 | author=Adams, Sharon}}</ref>\n\nOnce in training, some women felt that they had made a mistake. Several women cracked under the pressure and were hospitalized. Other women felt the need to escape, and ran away. The easiest and fastest way out of the service was pregnancy. Women who found out that they were expecting were given a special, quickly executed, discharge.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nThe women who successfully graduated from training had to find ways to entertain themselves to keep morale up. Softball, badminton, tennis, and hockey were among popular pastimes for recruits.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nReligion was of a personal matter to the recruits. A minister of sorts was usually on site for services. For Jewish women, it was custom that they were able to get back to their barracks by sundown on Sabbath and holidays; a [[rabbi]] would be made available if possible.<ref name=\"gossage\" />\n\nAt the beginning of the war 600,000 women in Canada held permanent jobs in the private sector, by the peak in 1943 1.2 million women had jobs.<ref name=\"fact\">[[Veterans Affairs Canada]], [http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/second-world-war/fact_sheets/women \"Women at War,\"] Government of Canada, 2013-08-02</ref> Women quickly gained a good reputation for their mechanical dexterity and fine precision due to their smaller stature.\n\nWomen also had to keep their homes together while the men were away. \"An Alberta mother of nine boys, all away at either war or factory jobs \u2013 drove the tractor, plowed the fields, put up hay, and hauled grain to the elevators, along with tending her garden, raising chickens, pigs, and turkeys, and canned hundreds of jars of fruits and vegetables\".<ref name=\"fact\" />\n\nIn addition to physical jobs, women were also asked to cut back and ration. Silk and nylon were used for the war efforts, creating a shortage of stockings. Many women painted lines down the back of their legs to create the illusion of wearing the fashionable stockings of the time.<ref name=\"fact\" />\n\n===India===\n{{See also|Indian Army during World War II#Women's Auxiliary Corps}}\n\nIn India, policies resembled those of Great Britain, except that women were not used in anti-aircraft units, and there was no conscription of women for munitions work.<ref>Yasmin Khan, ''The Raj At War: A People's History Of India's Second World War'' (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Women's Auxiliary Corps operated from 1939 to 1947, with peak strength of 850 officers and 7,200 auxiliaries in the Indian army. A small naval section operated in the Royal Indian Navy.<ref>Alan Harfield, \"The Women's Auxiliary Corps (India),\" ''Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research'' 83, no 335 (Autumn 2005), pp 243-254</ref>\n\nThe nationalist movements in India during the war split on military service. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] opposed fascism and on his advice youths from India joined the armed forces to fight with Britain along with allies.\n\nOne faction of Congress led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] was so opposed that it cooperated with Nazi Germany, and actually enlisted soldiers who fought alongside Japanese soldiers against the British and Indians in Burma. The \"Rani of Jhansi Regiment\" involved these women in combat on behalf of the [[Indian National Army]]. It was active from 1943-45. Bose spent a good deal of effort on him developing anti-British anti-imperialist ideology designed to mobilize models of women as mothers and sisters in Indian tradition. Bose argued that the direct involvement of women was necessary to achieve total independence of India from the colonial powers. Bose articulated a modern definition of female heroism that involved combat. In actual practice, very few of his female soldiers were directly involved in combat; they largely had support roles in logistics and medical care.<ref>Carol Hills and Daniel C.

They did not serve in the main Italian army. Some 35,000 women (and 170,000 men) joined in the Resistance. The women were used as auxiliary support and were not allowed in senior ranks. Most did cooking and laundry duty.   Some were guides, messengers, and couriers near the front lines. A few were attached to small attack groups of five or six men engaged in sabotage. Some all-female units, engaged in civilian and political action. The Germans aggressively tried to suppress them, sending 5000 to prison, deporting 3000 to Germany. About 650 died in combat or by execution. On a much larger scale, non-military auxiliaries of the Catholic Centro Italiano Femminile (CIF) and the leftist Unione Donne Italiane (UDI) were new organizations that gave women political legitimacy after the war.<ref>Dan A.

Their most important role was as couriers carrying messages between cells of the resistance movement and distributing news broadsheets and operating clandestine printing presses. During partisan attacks on Nazi forces and installations they served as scouts. About 40,000 of Polish women were imprisoned in [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]]. [[Zofia Posmysz]] survived two camps and described her story, inspiring [[Passenger (1963 film)|Passenger]] 1953 film.  [[Wanda Jakubowska]] was imprisoned in Auschwitz and after the war directed a classic film ''[[The Last Stage]]''.\n\nJewish women fought in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and several smaller fights.<ref>[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/women-in-the-holocaust/partisans/index.asp Yad Vashem, Partisans and Underground]</ref> The Stroop Report contains a picture of [[HeHalutz]] female fighters captured with weapons.\n\nDuring the [[Warsaw Rising]] of 1944, female members of the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] were couriers and medics, but many carried weapons and took part in the fighting. Among the more notable women of the Home Army was [[Wanda Gertz]] who created and commanded ''DYSK'' (Women's sabotage unit). For her bravery in these activities and later in the Warsaw Uprising she was awarded Poland's highest awards - [[Virtuti Militari]] and [[Polonia Restituta]]. Many nurses were murdered on September the 2nd, 1944. [[Anna \u015awirszczy\u0144ska]] was a nurse and expected to be executed. She described later the Rising in her poems. One of the articles of the capitulation was that the German Army recognized them as full members of the armed forces and needed to set up separate [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s to hold over 2000 female prisoners-of-war.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ney-Krwawicz |first=Marek |url=http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm |title=Women Soldiers of the Polish Home Army |publisher=Polishresistance-ak.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref>\n\n[[Ma\u0142gorzata Fornalska]] was one of important Communist activists, arrested and killed by Germans.

Web.</ref> Women took on the responsibility of managing the home and became the heroines of the home front.  According to Carruthers, this industrial employment of women significantly raised women's self-esteem as it allowed them to carry out their full potential and do their part in the war. During the war, women's normative roles of \"house wife\" transformed into a patriotic duty. As Carruthers put it, the housewife has become a heroine in the defeat of Hitler.<ref name=\"Carruthers, Susan L 1947\"/> \nThe roles of women shifting from domestic to masculine and dangerous jobs in the workforce made for important changes in workplace structure and society. During the Second World War, society had specific ideals for the jobs in which both women and men participated. When women began to enter into the masculine workforce and munitions industries previously dominated by men, women's segregation began to diminish. Increasing numbers of women were forced into industry jobs between 1940-1943.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\">Gazeley, Ian. \"Women\u2019s pay in British Industry during the second world War.\" ''[[Economic History Review]]''.

Web.</ref> As surveyed by the Ministry of Labour, the percentage of women in industrial jobs went from 19.75 per cent to 27 per cent from 1938-1945.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/> It was very difficult for women to spend their days in factories, and then come home to their domestic chores and care-giving, and as a result, many women were unable to hold their jobs in the workplace.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/> Britain underwent a labour shortage where an estimated 1.5 million people were needed for the armed forces, and an additional 775,000 for munitions and other services in 1942.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/> It was during this \"labour famine\" that propaganda aimed to induce people to join the labour force and do their bit in the war. Women were the target audience in the various forms of propaganda because they were paid substantially less than men.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/> It was of no concern whether women were filling the same jobs that men previously held. Even if women were replacing jobs with the same skill level as a man, they were still paid significantly less due to their gender. In the engineering industry alone, the number of skilled and semi-skilled female workers increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent from 1940-1942.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/> According to Gazeley, even though women were paid less than men, it is clear that women engaging in war work and taking on jobs preserved by men reduced industrial segregation.<ref name=\"Gazeley, Ian 2008\"/>\n\n[[File:UK worker meets Roosevelt - Toni Frissell LC-F9-01-4211-92-2.jpg|thumb|portrait|right| A female machinist talking with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] during her goodwill tour of Great Britain in 1942]]\n[[File:War Office Second World War Official Collection H28513.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pte Elizabeth Gourlay transmitting a radio message.]]\n[[File:Hrh Princess Elizabeth in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, April 1945 TR2832.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Elizabeth in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]], April 1945]]\nIn [[United Kingdom|Britain]], women were essential to the war effort. The contribution by civilian men and women to the British war effort was acknowledged with the use of the words \"[[home front]]\" to describe the battles that were being fought on a domestic level with rationing, recycling, and war work, such as in munitions factories and farms and men were thus released into the military. Women were also recruited to work on the canals, transporting coal and munitions by barge across the UK via the inland waterways. These became known as the \"[[Boatwomen\u2019s training scheme|Idle Women]]\", initially an insult derived from the initials IW, standing for Inland Waterways, which they wore on their badges, but the term was soon adopted by the women themselves.<ref name=\"Telegraph 2008\">{{cite news|title=Reunion and plaque for the 'Idle Women', the Land Girls of the canals|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3135333/Reunion-and-plaque-for-the-Idle-Women-the-Land-Girls-of-the-canals.html|accessdate=9 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=4 October 2008|location=London}}</ref> Many women served with the Women's [[Auxiliary Fire Service]], the Women's Auxiliary Police Corps and in the [[Air Raid Precautions]] (later [[Civil Defence Corps|Civil Defence]]) services.

November 1, (2005): 108-117. Web.</ref> Propaganda was meant to eliminate all conflicts of personal and political roles and create a heroine out of the women. The implication with propaganda is that it asked women to redefine their personal and domestic ideals of womanhood and motivate them go against the roles that have been instilled in them.<ref name=\"Gingrich, Nadine 2005\"/> \nThe government struggled to encourage women to respond to posters and other forms of propaganda. One attempt to recruit women into the labour force was in one short film ''My Father's Daughter''. In this propaganda film a wealthy factory owner's daughter begs to do her part in the war, but her father carries the stereotypical belief that women are meant to be caretakers and are incapable of such heavy work. When one foreman presents one of the most valuable and efficient workers in the factory as the daughter, the father's prejudices are eliminated. The encouraging message of this short film is \"There's Not Much Women Can't Do\".<ref name=\"Gingrich, Nadine 2005\"/>\n\n====Military roles====\n\nThe most common role of women in active service was that of a searchlight operator.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\">De Groot, Gerard J. \"`I Love the Scent of Cordite in Your Hair': Gender Dynamics in Mixed Anti-Craft Batteries\".

If that were to ever happen, they would be evacuated immediately.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/>\n\n[[File:The_Auxiliary_Territorial_Service_at_An_Anti-aircraft_Gun_Site_in_Britain,_December_1942_TR453.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]] spotter at a 3.7-inch [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA gun site]], December 1942]]\n[[File:Douglas DC-3 - Royal Air Force Transport Command, 1943-1945.

Generally women between 17 and 43 could volunteer and those under 18 required parental consent.<ref name=\"crang\" /> After applying, applicants had to fulfill other requirements, including an interview and medical examination; if they were deemed fit to serve then they were enrolled for the duration of the war. WRNS was the only service that offered an immobile branch which allowed women to live in their homes and work in the local naval establishment.<ref name=\"crang\" /> WRNS was the smallest of the three organizations and as a result was very selective with their candidates. Of the three organizations, WAAF was the most preferred choice; the second being WRNS. ATS was the largest of the three organizations and was least favoured among women because it accepted those who were unable to get into the other forces.  ATS had also developed a reputation of promiscuity and poor living conditions, many women also found the khaki uniform unappealing and as a result favoured WRNS and WAAF over ATS.<ref name=\"crang\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsremembered.org.uk/servicedress.htm|title=ATS Remembered - Service Dress|website=www.atsremembered.org.uk}}</ref> Over 640,000 British women served in various auxiliary services of the British armed forces.<ref>https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2018/0525/From-paranurses-to-snipers-Exhibit-focuses-on-women-s-WWII-contributions</ref>\n\n====Limitations====\n\nWhilst women were limited in some of their roles, they were expected to perform to the same standard as a male soldier performing the same role, and although they could not participate in frontline combat, they still manned anti-aircraft guns and defences which actively engaged hostile aircraft above Britain. Women went through the same military training, lived in the same conditions and did almost the same jobs as men, with the exception of not being able to participate in front-line combat. This important distinction meant that women did not tend to be nominated for medals of valour or bravery, because they were only awarded for \"active operations against enemy in the field\", which women could not take part in.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/>\n\nWomen were also distinct because of the titles by which they were addressed in the army, although these tended to be no different from their male counterparts. They wore the same rank insignia as their male counterparts. Many members of the ATS were respected by the units they were attached to despite their different insignia.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/> The only major difference between an ATS member and a male member of the Regular Army was discipline: a woman was not allowed to be court marshalled unless she herself chose to be. The women in the service were also under the authority of the female officers of the ATS, instead of the male officers under whom they served directly. This meant any disciplinary action was entirely in the hands of the ATS, removing male influence from the process.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/>\n\n====Volunteers====\nDespite their obvious distinctions from men, women were eager to volunteer. Many of the servicewomen came from restricted backgrounds; therefore they found the army liberating.<ref name=\"Groot, Gerard J 1997\"/> Other reasons women volunteered included escaping unhappy homes or marriages, or to have a more stimulating job. The overwhelming reason for joining the army, though, was patriotism. As in World War I, Great Britain was in a patriotic fervour throughout World War II to protect itself from foreign invasion.<ref name=\"Crang, Jeremy A 2008\">Crang, Jeremy A. \"'Come into the Army, Maud': Women, Military Conscription, and the Markham Inquiry.\" Defence Studies 8.3 (2008): 381-95.

Despite the overwhelming response to the call for female volunteers, some women refused to join the forces; many were unwilling to give up the civilian job they had, and others had male counterparts that were unwilling to let them go . Others felt that war was still a man's job, and not something women should be involved in.<ref name=\"Crang, Jeremy A 2008\"/> Similar to the men's forces, women's forces were mostly volunteer throughout the war.<ref name=\"Crang, Jeremy A 2008\"/> When women's conscription did come into effect, however, it was highly limited. For example, married women were exempt from any obligation to serve unless they chose to do so, and those who were called could opt to serve in civil defense (the home front).<ref name=\"Crang, Jeremy A 2008\"/>\n\n[[File:WAAF plotters at work in the Operations Room at No. 11 Group HQ at Uxbridge in Middlesex, 1942.

The Women of Employment Order required women ages 18\u201345 to register for labour exchanges and by 1943 the maximum age was raised to 50, which brought an additional 20,000 women into the workforce.

The participation of women allowed these bombs to be destroyed.<ref name=\"Downing, Taylor 2011\"/>\n\n====Civilian pay scales====\nAlthough many women were doing jobs that men had previously done during the war, there were still pay distinctions between the two sexes. Women's pay was significantly lower than men's pay. The average female in manufacturing was earning $31 per week while the average male earned $55 per week.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yellin|first1=Emily|title=Our Mothers War: American Women at Home and at the Front during World War II.|publisher=Free Press|location=NY|isbn=0743245164|url=https://archive.org/details/ourmotherswar00emil|date=2005-03-07}}</ref> Equal pay was rarely achieved as employers wanted to avoid labour costs. Skilled work was often broken down into smaller tasks and labelled skilled or semi-skilled and then paid according to women's pay rates.<ref name=\"Bruley\" /> Women who were judged to be doing \"men's work\" were paid more than women who were thought to be doing \"women's work\" and the employers' definition of this varied regionally.<ref name=\"Little\" /> Women were receiving closer wages to their male counterparts; however despite the government's expressed intentions, women continued to be paid less than men for equivalent work and were segregated in terms of job description, status, and the hours they put in.<ref name=\"Little\" /> In 1940 Ernest Bevin persuaded engineering employers and unions to give women equal pay to men since they were taking on the same tasks that men previously had; this became the ''Extended Employment of Women Agreement''.<ref name=\"Hart\" /> Generally, pay increases depended on the industry; industries that were dominated by women before the war, like textiles and clothing, saw no changes in pay. However the gap between male and female earnings narrowed by 20-24% in metals, engineering and vehicle building and by 10-13% in chemicals, which were all deemed important to the war effort.<ref name=\"Gazeley\" /> Overtime hours also differed, with women getting 2\u20133 hours and men 9-10 a week. Women\u2019s hours were still regulated because of their perceived responsibilities to take care of their family and household.<ref name=\"Hart\" />\n\n====High profile====\nThe British gave high prestige to their women's units who therefore escaped much of the vulgar commentary. The two daughters of Prime Minister Churchill were both in uniform.

The Communist [[Yugoslav National Liberation Movement]] claimed 6,000,000 civilian supporters; its two million women formed the [[Antifascist Front of Women]] (AF\u017d), in which the revolutionary coexisted with the traditional. The AF\u017d managed schools, hospitals and local governments. About 100,000 women served with 600,000 men in Tito's Yugoslav National Liberation Army. It stressed its dedication to women's rights and gender equality and used the imagery of traditional folklore heroines to attract and legitimize the partizanka.<ref>Barbara Jancar, \"Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview,\" ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' (1981) 14#2 pp 143-164.</ref>  After the war, women were relegated to traditional gender roles, but Yugoslavia is unique as its historians paid extensive attention to women's roles in the resistance, until the country broke up in the 1990s.

Lotta Sv\u00e4rd was one of the largest, if not the largest, voluntary group in World War II.

The BDM [[League of German Girls#Wartime service|helped the war effort in many ways]].\n\nOn the eve of war 14.6 million German women were working, with 51% of women of working age (16\u201360 years old) in the workforce. Nearly six million were doing farm work, as Germany's agricultural economy was dominated by small family farms. 2.7 million worked in industry. When the German economy was mobilized for war it paradoxically led to a drop in female work participation, reaching a low of 41% before gradually climbing back to over 50% again. This still compares favorably with the UK and the US, both playing catchup, with Britain achieving a participation rate of 41% of women of working age in 1944. However, in terms of women employed in war work, British and German female participation rates were nearly equal by 1944, with the United States still lagging. The difficulties the [[Third Reich]] faced in increasing the size of the work force was mitigated by reallocating labor to work that supported the war effort. High wages in war industries attracted hundreds of thousands, freeing up men for military duties. Prisoners of war were also employed as farmhands, freeing up women for other work.<ref>[[Adam Tooze]], ''The Wages of Destruction'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe Third Reich had many roles for women. The ''[[SS]]-Helferinnen'' were regarded as part of the SS if they had undergone training at a ''Reichsschule SS'' but all other female workers were regarded as being contracted to the SS and chosen largely from [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1183 |title=Das SS-Helferinnenkorps: Ausbildung, Einsatz und Entnazifizierung der weiblichen Angeh\u00f6rigen der Waffen-SS 1942-1949 |publisher=Reviews in History |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hitlerschildren00gerh |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/hitlerschildren00gerh/page/223 223] |quote=ernst sachs children of the ss. |title=Hitler's Children: The Hitler Youth and the SS |publisher=UNC Press Books |author=Gerhard Rempel |accessdate=2013-09-08|isbn=9780807842997 |year=1989 }}</ref> 3,700 of [[Female guards in Nazi concentration camps|women auxiliaries]] (''Aufseherin'') served for the SS in the camps, the majority of which were at [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]].<ref>Leila J.
