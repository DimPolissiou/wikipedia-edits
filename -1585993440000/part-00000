It cannot be scratched by steel (see [[Mohs scale]]).]]\n\nQuartz belongs to the [[trigonal crystal system]]. The [[crystal habit|ideal crystal shape]] is a six-sided [[prism (geometry)|prism]] terminating with six-sided [[pyramid]]s at each end. In [[nature]] quartz crystals are often [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached at the other end to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within [[gypsum]]. A quartz [[geode]] is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.\n\n\u03b1-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, [[space group]] ''P''3<sub>1</sub>21 or ''P''3<sub>2</sub>21 depending on the chirality. \u03b2-quartz belongs to the hexagonal system, space group ''P''6<sub>2</sub>22 and ''P''6<sub>4</sub>22, respectively.<ref>Crystal Data, Determinative Tables, ACA Monograph No. 5, American Crystallographic Association, 1963</ref> These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both \u03b1-quartz and \u03b2-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between \u03b1- and \u03b2-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without change in the way they are linked.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:\u0391-Quartz.svg|Crystal structure of \u03b1-quartz (red balls are oxygen, grey are silicon)\nFile:\u0392-Quartz.svg|\u03b2-quartz\n</gallery>\n\n==Varieties (according to microstructure)==\nAlthough many of the varietal names historically arose from the color of the mineral, current scientific naming schemes refer primarily to the microstructure of the mineral.

From centuries, it is believed that it possesses healing properties of Sun. Natural citrines are rare; most commercial citrines are heat-treated [[amethyst]]s or [[smoky quartz]]es. However, a heat-treated amethyst will have small lines in the crystal, as opposed to a natural citrine's cloudy or smokey appearance. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut citrine and yellow [[topaz]] visually, but they differ in [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]]. Brazil is the leading producer of citrine, with much of its production coming from the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The name is derived from the Latin word ''citrina'' which means \"yellow\" and is also the origin of the word \"[[citron]]\". Sometimes citrine and amethyst can be found together in the same crystal, which is then referred to as [[ametrine]].<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html Citrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502064111/http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html |date=2 May 2010 }}.

The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of [[titanium]], [[iron]], or [[manganese]], in the material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic [[rutile]] needles which produces an [[Asterism (gemology)|asterism]] in transmitted light.

Although citrine occurs naturally, the majority is the result of heat-treating amethyst or smoky quartz. [[Carnelian]] is widely heat-treated to deepen its color.\n\nBecause natural quartz is often [[crystal twinning|twinned]], synthetic quartz is produced for use in industry. Large, flawless, single crystals are synthesized in an [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]] via the [[Hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]; [[emerald]]s are also synthesized in this fashion.\n\nLike other crystals, quartz may be [[Metal-coated crystal|coated with metal vapors]] to give it an attractive sheen.\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:ArideGranite1.jpg|thumb| Granite rock in the cliff of Gros la T\u00eate on [[Aride Island]], [[Seychelles]].

It is very common in [[sedimentary rock]]s such as [[sandstone]] and [[shale]]. It is a common constituent of [[schist]], [[gneiss]], [[quartzite]] and other [[metamorphic rock]]s. Quartz has the lowest potential for [[weathering]] in the [[Goldich dissolution series]] and consequently it is very common as a residual mineral in stream sediments and residual [[soil]]s.\n\nWhile the majority of quartz crystallizes from molten [[magma]], much quartz also chemically precipitates from hot [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]] [[Vein (geology)|veins]] as [[gangue]], sometimes with [[ore]] minerals like gold, silver and copper. Large crystals of quartz are found in magmatic [[pegmatite]]s. Well-formed crystals may reach several meters in length and [[mass|weigh]] hundreds of kilograms.\n\nNaturally occurring quartz crystals of extremely high purity, necessary for the crucibles and other equipment used for growing [[Monocrystalline silicon|silicon]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]] in the [[semiconductor]] industry, are expensive and rare.

It cannot be scratched by steel (see [[Mohs scale]]).]]\n\nQuartz belongs to the [[trigonal crystal system]]. The [[crystal habit|ideal crystal shape]] is a six-sided [[prism (geometry)|prism]] terminating with six-sided [[pyramid]]s at each end. In [[nature]] quartz crystals are often [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached at the other end to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within [[gypsum]]. A quartz [[geode]] is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.\n\n\u03b1-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, [[space group]] ''P''3<sub>1</sub>21 or ''P''3<sub>2</sub>21 depending on the chirality. \u03b2-quartz belongs to the hexagonal system, space group ''P''6<sub>2</sub>22 and ''P''6<sub>4</sub>22, respectively.<ref>Crystal Data, Determinative Tables, ACA Monograph No. 5, American Crystallographic Association, 1963</ref> These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both \u03b1-quartz and \u03b2-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between \u03b1- and \u03b2-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without change in the way they are linked.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:\u0391-Quartz.svg|Crystal structure of \u03b1-quartz (red balls are oxygen, grey are silicon)\nFile:\u0392-Quartz.svg|\u03b2-quartz\n</gallery>\n\n==Varieties (according to microstructure)==\nAlthough many of the varietal names historically arose from the color of the mineral, current scientific naming schemes refer primarily to the microstructure of the mineral.

Natural citrines are rare; most commercial citrines are heat-treated [[amethyst]]s or [[smoky quartz]]es. However, a heat-treated amethyst will have small lines in the crystal, as opposed to a natural citrine's cloudy or smokey appearance. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut citrine and yellow [[topaz]] visually, but they differ in [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]]. Brazil is the leading producer of citrine, with much of its production coming from the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The name is derived from the Latin word ''citrina'' which means \"yellow\" and is also the origin of the word \"[[citron]]\". Sometimes citrine and amethyst can be found together in the same crystal, which is then referred to as [[ametrine]].<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html Citrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502064111/http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html |date=2 May 2010 }}.

The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of [[titanium]], [[iron]], or [[manganese]], in the material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic [[rutile]] needles which produces an [[Asterism (gemology)|asterism]] in transmitted light.

It is very common in [[sedimentary rock]]s such as [[sandstone]] and [[shale]]. It is a common constituent of [[schist]], [[gneiss]], [[quartzite]] and other [[metamorphic rock]]s. Quartz has the lowest potential for [[weathering]] in the [[Goldich dissolution series]] and consequently it is very common as a residual mineral in stream sediments and residual [[soil]]s.\n\nWhile the majority of quartz crystallizes from molten [[magma]], much quartz also chemically precipitates from hot [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]] [[Vein (geology)|veins]] as [[gangue]], sometimes with [[ore]] minerals like gold, silver and copper. Large crystals of quartz are found in magmatic [[pegmatite]]s. Well-formed crystals may reach several meters in length and [[mass|weigh]] hundreds of kilograms.\n\nNaturally occurring quartz crystals of extremely high purity, necessary for the crucibles and other equipment used for growing [[Monocrystalline silicon|silicon]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]] in the [[semiconductor]] industry, are expensive and rare.

Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&nbsp;\u2013 Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&nbsp;\u2013 Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&nbsp;\u2013 Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).\n\n[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.\n\nConventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).\n\nBecause of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see \"trends\" below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]). Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas) and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.\n\n{{Economy of Canada}}\n\n=== Economic regions and cities ===\nSince the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the \"[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]\") were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s. The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]]. [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.\n\n==== Calgary and Edmonton ====\nThe Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province's population. They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg. This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.\n\nThe economic profile of the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton's suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province's manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Lamphier_20161210\">{{Cite news| last = Lamphier| first = Gary| newspaper = Edmonton Journal |title=It's a wrap, folks: thanks for a great run | access-date = September 5, 2019| date = December 10, 2016| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-its-a-wrap-folks-thanks-for-a-great-run}}</ref>\n\n===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====\nThe [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada.

A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===== Calgary\u2013Edmonton rivalry =====\n{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}\nSeeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the \"Oil Capital of Canada\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]\n{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}\n\nAlberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' \"[[Staples Thesis]]\", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.\n\nThe development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].\n\nIn 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.\n\nThe spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.\n\nA comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).\n\n==Employment==\nAlberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Job market trends and profiles |work=Alberta| access-date = September 9, 2019| date = 2018| url = https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190909182248/https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-09-09 }}</ref> Primary industries are also of great importance, however.\n\nBy March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%\u2014<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> its \"highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province\u2019s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.\"<ref name=\"finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11\">{{cite web | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | title=Alberta Economy: Indicators at a Glance | publisher=Treasury Board and Finance Economics and Revenue Forecasting | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314172259/http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | archive-date=March 14, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015.<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.<ref name=\"financealberta_2016_Feb\">{{cite report | url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/quarterly/2015/2015-16-3rd-Quarter-Fiscal-Update.pdf#page=12 | title=2015\u201316 Third Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement | publisher=Department of Finance, Government of Alberta | date=February 2016 | accessdate=16 March 2016 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |pages=15}}</ref>{{rp|13}} The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015\u201325,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production.<ref name=\"huffington_2015\">{{citation |title=Alberta Oilpatch Layoffs Total 35,000, Says CAPP |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/02/alberta-oilpatch-layoffs_n_8078660.html |work=The Huffington Post|location=Alberta |first=Michelle |last=Butterfield |date=September 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016.

Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production.

Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used. [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other [[mixed farming]]. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]]. Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy.

Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.\n\n==== Forestry ====\n{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}\n\nThe vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].\n\nIn 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.\n\n===Services===\nDespite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\">{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035501|title=Employment by industry, monthly, seasonally adjusted (x 1,000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref> This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\" />\n\n====Finance====\nThe [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market.

Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&nbsp;\u2013 Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&nbsp;\u2013 Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&nbsp;\u2013 Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).\n\n[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.\n\nConventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).\n\nBecause of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see \"trends\" below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]). Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas) and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.\n\n{{Economy of Canada}}\n\n=== Economic regions and cities ===\nSince the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the \"[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]\") were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s. The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]]. [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.\n\n==== Calgary and Edmonton ====\nThe Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province's population. They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg. This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.\n\nThe economic profile of the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton's suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province's manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Lamphier_20161210\">{{Cite news| last = Lamphier| first = Gary| newspaper = Edmonton Journal |title=It's a wrap, folks: thanks for a great run | access-date = September 5, 2019| date = December 10, 2016| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-its-a-wrap-folks-thanks-for-a-great-run}}</ref>\n\n===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====\nThe [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly {{convert|400|km}}. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).<ref name=\"CECorridor\">{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===== Calgary\u2013Edmonton rivalry =====\n{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}\nSeeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the \"Oil Capital of Canada\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]\n{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}\n\nAlberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' \"[[Staples Thesis]]\", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.\n\nThe development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].\n\nIn 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.\n\nThe spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.\n\nA comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).\n\n==Employment==\nAlberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Job market trends and profiles |work=Alberta| access-date = September 9, 2019| date = 2018| url = https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190909182248/https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-09-09 }}</ref> Primary industries are also of great importance, however.\n\nBy March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%\u2014<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> its \"highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province\u2019s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.\"<ref name=\"finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11\">{{cite web | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | title=Alberta Economy: Indicators at a Glance | publisher=Treasury Board and Finance Economics and Revenue Forecasting | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314172259/http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | archive-date=March 14, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015.<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.<ref name=\"financealberta_2016_Feb\">{{cite report | url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/quarterly/2015/2015-16-3rd-Quarter-Fiscal-Update.pdf#page=12 | title=2015\u201316 Third Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement | publisher=Department of Finance, Government of Alberta | date=February 2016 | accessdate=16 March 2016 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |pages=15}}</ref>{{rp|13}} The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015\u201325,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production.<ref name=\"huffington_2015\">{{citation |title=Alberta Oilpatch Layoffs Total 35,000, Says CAPP |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/02/alberta-oilpatch-layoffs_n_8078660.html |work=The Huffington Post|location=Alberta |first=Michelle |last=Butterfield |date=September 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016.

In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.\n\nAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.\n\nAlberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,<ref name=\"Firzli\"/> with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/> The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] \"[[fracking]]\" technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/><ref name=\"NYT_2014\">{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry (2017)<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\">{{cite report |series=Industry Profiles 2018 |title=Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry |url=https://work.alberta.ca/documents/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |date=February 2018 |isbn=978-1-4601-3781-9 |issn= 2292-8960 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909194936/https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f5a3586b-9fad-47a5-8741-e46cf5008d16/resource/9b026daf-1045-49bb-aad6-34996db59914/download/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2019 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!Alberta\n!Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry \n|-\n|Employment ||2,286,900 ||140,300 \n|-\n|Employment Share ||N/A ||6.1% \n|-\n|Unemployment ||194,700 ||8,800 \n|-\n|Unemployment rate ||7.8% ||5.9%\n|} \n*Data Source: Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, CANSIM Table 282\u20130008, 2017 \"Employment share is obtained by dividing the number of employment in this industry by total employment in Alberta.\"<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\"/>\n\n====Natural gas====\n[[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion.

Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used. [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other [[mixed farming]]. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]]. Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |title=Alberta Livestock Inspections |date=August 2006 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta |access-date=2007-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815131438/http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |archive-date=2011-08-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.\n\n==== Forestry ====\n{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}\n\nThe vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].\n\nIn 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.\n\n===Services===\nDespite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\">{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035501|title=Employment by industry, monthly, seasonally adjusted (x 1,000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref> This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\" />\n\n====Finance====\nThe [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market. The city has the second highest number of corporate head offices in Canada after Toronto, and the financial services industry in Calgary has developed to support them.\n\nEdmonton hosts the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: [[Canadian Western Bank]], and [[ATB Financial]], as well as the only province-wide [[credit union]], [[Servus]].\n\n====Government====\nDespite Alberta's reputation as a \"small government\" province, many health care and education professionals are lured to Alberta from other provinces by the higher wages the Alberta government is able to offer because of oil revenues.

It contained five drums holding a total of 50 card faces based on [[poker]]. This machine proved extremely popular and soon many [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] in the city had one or more of them. Players would insert a [[Nickel (U.S. coin)|nickel]] and pull a lever, which would spin the drums and the cards they held, the player hoping for a good poker hand. There was no direct payout mechanism, so a [[Glossary of poker terms|pair of kings]] might get the player a free beer, whereas a [[Glossary of poker terms|royal flush]] could pay out cigars or drinks, the prizes wholly dependent on what was on offer at the local establishment. To make the odds better for the house, two cards were typically removed from the [[Deck (cards)|deck]]: the ten of [[Spades (suit)|spades]] and the [[Jack (playing card)|jack of hearts]], which doubles the [[odds]] against winning a royal flush. The drums could also be rearranged to further reduce a player's chance of winning.\n\nDue to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card game, it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic payout for all possible winning combinations. Somewhere between 1887 and 1895,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slot-machine-resource.com/slot-machine-history.htm |title=History of slot machines }}</ref> [[Charles Fey]] of [[San Francisco, California]], devised a much simpler automatic mechanism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://casinogambling.about.com/od/slots/a/charlesfey.htm |title=Charles Fey article |publisher=Casinogambling.about.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols: horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts, and a [[Liberty Bell]]. The bell gave the machine its name. By replacing ten cards with five symbols and using three reels instead of five drums, the complexity of reading a win was considerably reduced, allowing Fey to devise an effective automatic payout mechanism. Three bells in a row produced the biggest payoff, ten nickels (50\u00a2). ''Liberty Bell'' was a huge success and spawned a thriving mechanical gaming device industry. Even when, after a few years, the use of these gambling devices was banned in his home state, Fey still could not keep up with demand for them elsewhere. The Liberty Bell machine was so popular that it was copied by many slot machine manufacturers. The first of these was a machine, also called the \"Liberty Bell\", produced by the manufacturer Herbert Mills in 1907. By 1908 lots of \"bell\" machines were installed in most cigar stores, saloons, bowling alleys, brothels and barber shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/long-colorful-profitable-history-slot-machines-55000 |title=The Long, Colorful, Profitable History of Slot Machines |publisher=The Indian Observer |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref> Early machines, including an 1899 \"Liberty Bell\", are now part of the Nevada State Museum's Fey Collection.<ref>{{cite web|title = CM-5716-P-06 Machine, Slot|url = http://www.nevadaculture.org/museums/new_exhibits/cc-slot_machines/exhibit1/e10007a.html|website = Nevada State Museum|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe first Liberty Bell machines produced by Mills used the same symbols on the reels as Charles Fey's original. Soon afterwards, another version was produced with patriotic symbols such as a flag and a wreath on the wheels. Later, a similar machine, rechristened the Operator's Bell, was designed, for which an optional gum vending attachment was available. As the gum offered was fruit-flavored, fruit symbols were placed on the reels: lemons, cherries, oranges, and plums. A bell was retained, and a picture of a stick of Bell-Fruit Gum, the origin of the bar symbol, was also present. This set of symbols proved highly popular, so was used by the other companies that began to make their own slot machines: Caille, Watling, Jennings and Pace.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fey |first=Marshall |date=1983 |title=Slot Machines A Pictorial History of the First 100 Years |location= |publisher=[[Liberty Belle Books]] |isbn=0-9623852-7-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe payment of food prizes was a commonly used technique to avoid laws against gambling in a number of states. For this reason, a number of [[gumball machine|gumball]] and other [[vending machine]]s were regarded with mistrust by the courts. The two [[Iowa]] cases of ''State v.

The electromechanical approach of the 1960s allowed ''Money Honey'' to be the first slot machine with a bottomless hopper and automatic payout of up to 500 coins without the help of an attendant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballytech.com/company-information |title=Bally Technologies, Inc. &#124; Company Information |publisher=Ballytech.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> The popularity of this machine led to the increasing predominance of [[electronic game]]s, with the side lever soon becoming vestigial.\n\nThe first video slot machine was developed in 1976 in [[Kearny Mesa, California]], by the Las Vegas\u2013based Fortune Coin Co. This slot machine used a modified {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}} Sony Trinitron color receiver for the display and logic boards for all slot machine functions. The prototype was mounted in a full-size show-ready slot machine cabinet. The first production units went on trial in the [[Las Vegas Hilton Hotel]]. After some \"cheat-proofing\" modifications, the video slot machine was approved by the Nevada State Gaming Commission and eventually found popularity in the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and downtown casinos. Fortune Coin Co. and their video slot machine technology were purchased by IGT (International Gaming Technology) in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe first American video slot machine to offer a \"second screen\" bonus round was ''Reel \u2019Em In'' developed by [[WMS Industries]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casinocenter.com/?p=834|title=HALL OF FAME IN SLOT GAMES : Casino Player Magazine - Strictly Slots Magazine - Casino Gambling Tips|work=casinocenter.com}}</ref> This type of machine had appeared in Australia from at least 1994 with the \"Three Bags Full\" game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=3-bags-full&page=detail&id=5056|title=3 Bags Full|work=arcade-history.com}}</ref> In this type of machine, the display changes to provide a different game where an additional payout may be won or accumulated.\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Vegas slots.JPG|left|thumb|A row of \"Wheel of Fortune\" slot machines in a casino in Las Vegas. This specific slot machine is themed to the TV game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.]]\n\nA person playing a slot machine can insert cash or, in \"[[ticket-in, ticket-out]]\" machines, a paper ticket with a [[barcode]], into a designated slot on the machine. The machine is then activated by means of a lever or button (either physical or on a touchscreen), which activates reels that spin and stop to reveal one or several symbols. Most games have a variety of winning combinations of symbols. If a player matches a combination according to the rules of the game, the slot machine credits the player. Symbols can vary depending on the machine, but often include objects such as fruits, bells, and stylized [[Lucky number|lucky sevens]]. Most slot games have a theme, such as a specific [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], location, or character. Symbols and other bonus features of the game are typically aligned with the theme. Some themes are licensed from popular [[media franchise]]s, including films, television series (including [[game show]]s such as ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''), entertainers, and musicians.\n\nMulti-line slot machines have become more popular since the 1990s. These machines have more than one payline, meaning that visible symbols that are not aligned on the main horizontal may be considered for winning combinations. Traditional 3-reel slot machines commonly have three or five paylines while video slot machines may have 9, 15, 25, or as many as 1024 different paylines. Most accept variable numbers of credits to play, with 1 to 15 credits per line being typical. The higher the amount bet, the higher the payout will be if the player wins. \n\nOne of the main differences between video slot machines and reel machines is in the way payouts are calculated. With reel machines, the only way to win the maximum jackpot is to play the maximum number of coins (usually 3, sometimes 4 or even 5 coins per spin). With video machines, the fixed payout values are multiplied by the number of coins per line that is being bet. In other words: on a reel machine, the odds are more favorable if the gambler plays with the maximum number of coins available.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Tom|title=How Slot Machines Work|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/slot-machine4.htm|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=2002-02-26}}</ref> However, depending on the structure of the game and its bonus features, some video slots may still include features that improve chances at payouts by making increased wagers.\n\n\"Multi-way\" games eschew fixed paylines in favor of allowing symbols to pay anywhere, as long as there is at least one in at least 3 consecutive reels from left to right. Multi-way games may be configured to allow players to bet by-reel: for example, on a game with a 3x5 pattern (often referred to as a 243-way game), playing one reel allows all three symbols in the first reel to potentially pay, but only the center row pays on the remaining reels (often designated by darkening the unused portions of the reels). Other multi-way games use a 4x5 or 5x5 pattern, where there are up to 5 symbols in each reel, allowing for up to 1,024 and 3,125 ways to win respectively. The Australian manufacturer [[Aristocrat Leisure]] brands games featuring this system as \"Reel Power\", \"Xtra Reel Power\" and \"Super Reel Power\" respectively. A variation involves patterns where symbols pay adjacent to one another. Most of these games have a hexagonal reel formation, and much like multi-way games, any patterns not played are darkened out of use.\n\nDenominations can range from 1 cent (\"penny slots\") all the way up to $100.00 or more per credit. The latter are typically known as \"high limit\" machines, and machines configured to allow for such wagers are often located in dedicated areas (which may have a separate team of attendants to cater to the needs of those who play there). The machine automatically calculates the number of credits the player receives in exchange for the cash inserted. Newer machines often allow players to choose from a selection of denominations on a [[splash screen]] or menu.\n\n==Terminology==\nA '''bonus''' is a special feature of the particular game theme, which is activated when certain symbols appear in a winning combination. Bonuses and the number of bonus features vary depending upon the game. Some bonus rounds are a special session of free spins (the number of which is often based on the winning combination that triggers the bonus), often with a different or modified set of winning combinations as the main game and/or other multipliers or increased frequencies of symbols, or a \"hold and re-spin\" mechanic in which specific symbols (usually marked with values of credits or other prizes) are collected and locked in place over a finite number of spins. In other bonus rounds, the player is presented with several items on a screen from which to choose. As the player chooses items, a number of credits is revealed and awarded. Some bonuses use a mechanical device, such as a spinning wheel, that works in conjunction with the bonus to display the amount won. \n\nA '''candle''' is a light on top of the slot machine. It flashes to alert the operator that change is needed, hand pay is requested or a potential problem with the machine. It can be lit by the player by pressing the \"service\" or \"help\" button.\n\n'''Carousel''' refers to a grouping of slot machines, usually in a circle or oval formation.\n\nA '''coin hopper''' is a container where the coins that are immediately available for payouts are held. The hopper is a mechanical device that rotates coins into the coin tray when a player collects credits/coins (by pressing a \"Cash Out\" button). When a certain preset coin capacity is reached, a coin diverter automatically redirects, or \"drops\", excess coins into a \"drop bucket\" or \"drop box\". (Unused coin hoppers can still be found even on games that exclusively employ Ticket-In, Ticket-Out technology, as a vestige.)\n\nThe '''credit meter''' is a display of the amount of money or number of credits on the machine. On mechanical slot machines, this is usually a [[seven-segment display]], but video slot machines typically use stylized text that suits the game's theme and user interface.\n\nThe '''drop bucket''' or '''drop box''' is a container located in a slot machine's base where excess coins are diverted from the hopper. Typically, a drop bucket is used for low-denomination slot machines and a drop box is used for high-denomination slot machines. A drop box contains a hinged lid with one or more locks whereas a drop bucket does not contain a lid. The contents of drop buckets and drop boxes are collected and [[hard count|counted]] by the casino on a scheduled basis.\n\n'''EGM''' is short for \"Electronic Gaming Machine\".\n\n'''Free spins''' are a common form of bonus, where a series of spins are automatically played at no charge at the player's current wager. Free spins are usually triggered via a scatter of at least three designated symbols (with the number of spins dependent on the number of symbols that land). Some games allow the free spins bonus to \"retrigger\", which adds additional spins on top of those already awarded. There is no theoretical limit to the number of free spins obtainable. Some games may have other features that can also trigger over the course of free spins.\n\nA '''[[hand pay]]''' refers to a payout made by an attendant or at an exchange point (\"cage\"), rather than by the slot machine itself. A hand pay occurs when the amount of the payout exceeds the maximum amount that was preset by the slot machine's operator. Usually, the maximum amount is set at the level where the operator must begin to deduct taxes. A hand pay could also be necessary as a result of a short pay.\n\n'''Hopper fill slip''' is a document used to record the replenishment of the coin in the coin hopper after it becomes depleted as a result of making payouts to players. The slip indicates the amount of coin placed into the hoppers, as well as the signatures of the employees involved in the transaction, the slot machine number and the location and the date.\n\n'''MEAL book''' ('''''M'''''achine '''''e'''''ntry '''''a'''''uthorization '''''l'''''og) is a log of the employee's entries into the machine.\n\n'''Low-level''' or '''slant-top''' slot machines include a stool so the player may sit down. '''Stand-up''' or '''upright''' slot machines are played while standing.\n\n'''Optimal play''' is a payback percentage based on a gambler using the optimal strategy in a skill-based slot machine game.\n\n'''Payline''' is a line that crosses through one symbol on each reel, along which a winning combination is evaluated. Classic spinning reel machines usually have up to nine paylines, while video slot machines may have as many as one hundred. Paylines could be of various shapes (horizontal, vertical, oblique, triangular, zigzag, etc.)\n\n'''Roll-up''' is the process of dramatizing a win by playing sounds while the '''meters''' count up to the amount that has been won.\n\n'''Short pay''' refers to a partial payout made by a slot machine, which is less than the amount due to the player. This occurs if the coin hopper has been depleted as a result of making earlier payouts to players. The remaining amount due to the player is either paid as a hand pay or an attendant will come and refill the machine.\n\nA '''scatter''' is a pay combination based on occurrences of a designated symbol landing anywhere on the reels, rather than falling in sequence on the same payline. A scatter pay usually requires a minimum of three symbols to land, and the machine may offer increased prizes or jackpots depending on the number that land. Scatters are frequently used to trigger bonus games, such as free spins (with the number of spins multiplying based on the number of scatter symbols that land). The scatter symbol usually cannot be matched using wilds, and some games may require the scatter symbols to appear on consecutive reels in order to pay. On some multiway games, scatter symbols still pay in unused areas.\n\n'''Taste''' is a reference to the small amount often paid out to keep a player seated and continuously betting. Only rarely will machines fail to pay even the minimum out over the course of several pulls.\n\n[[Image:Slot machine Tilt error.jpg|right|thumb|Display screen of a slot machine in tilt mode]]\n'''Tilt''' is a term derived from electromechanical slot machines' \"[[mercury switch|tilt switches]]\", which would make or break a circuit when they were tilted or otherwise tampered with that triggered an alarm. While modern machines no longer have tilt switches, any kind of technical fault (door switch in the wrong state, reel motor failure, out of paper, etc.) is still called a \"tilt\".\n\nA '''theoretical hold worksheet''' is a document provided by the manufacturer for every slot machine that indicates the theoretical percentage the machine should hold based on the amount paid in. The worksheet also indicates the reel strip settings, number of coins that may be played, the payout schedule, the number of reels and other information descriptive of the particular type of slot machine.\n\n'''Volatility''' or '''variance''' refers to the measure of risk associated with playing a slot machine. A low-volatility slot machine has regular but smaller wins, while a high-variance slot machine has fewer but bigger wins.\n\n'''Weight count''' is an American term referring to the total value of coins or tokens removed from a slot machine's drop bucket or drop box for countomg by the casino's [[hard count]] team through the use of a weigh scale.\n\n'''Wild symbols''' substitute for most other symbols in the game (similarly to a [[Joker (playing card)|joker]] card), usually excluding scatter and jackpot symbols (or offering a lower prize on non-natural combinations that include wilds). How jokers behave are dependent on the specific game and whether the player is in a bonus or free games mode. Sometimes wild symbols may only appear on certain reels, or have a chance to \"stack\" across the entire reel.\n\n==Pay table==\n{{Main|Pay table}}\nEach machine has a table that lists the number of credits the player will receive if the symbols listed on the pay table line up on the pay line of the machine. Some symbols are wild and can represent many, or all, of the other symbols to complete a winning line. Especially on older machines, the pay table is listed on the face of the machine, usually above and below the area containing the wheels. On video slot machines, they are usually contained within a help menu, along with information on other features.\n\n==Technology==\n===Reels===\nHistorically, all slot machines used revolving mechanical reels to display and determine results. Although the original slot machine used five reels, simpler, and therefore more reliable, three reel machines quickly became the standard.\n\nA problem with three reel machines is that the number of combinations is only [[cube (algebra)|cubic]] &ndash; the original slot machine with three physical reels and 10 symbols on each reel had only 10<sup>3</sup> = 1,000 possible combinations. This limited the manufacturer's ability to offer large jackpots since even the rarest event had a likelihood of 0.1%. The maximum theoretical payout, assuming 100% return to player would be 1000 times the bet, but that would leave no room for other pays, making the machine very high risk, and also quite boring.\n\nAlthough the number of symbols eventually increased to about 22, allowing 10,648 combinations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaming.unlv.edu/reading/Pacyniak.PDF |title=Info |website=gaming.unlv.edu }}</ref> this still limited jackpot sizes as well as the number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn the 1980s, however, slot machine manufacturers incorporated electronics into their products and programmed them to weight particular symbols. Thus the odds of losing symbols appearing on the payline became disproportionate to their actual frequency on the physical reel. A symbol would only appear once on the reel displayed to the player, but could, in fact, occupy several stops on the multiple reel.\n\nIn 1984 Inge Telnaes received a patent for a device titled, \"Electronic Gaming Device Utilizing a Random Number Generator for Selecting the Reel Stop Positions\" (US Patent 4448419),<ref>{{US patent|4448419|Electronic gaming device utilizing a random number generator for selecting the reel stop positions}}</ref> which states: \"It is important to make a machine that is perceived to present greater chances of payoff than it actually has within the legal limitations that games of chance must operate.\" <ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Collier |first=Roger\n |date=1 July 2008\n |title=Do slot machines play mind games with gamblers?\n |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal\n |volume=179 |issue=1 |pages=23\u20134\n |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080870\n |pmc=2464464\n |pmid=18591518\n}}</ref> The patent was later bought by [[International Game Technology (1975)|International Game Technology]] and has since expired.\n\nA virtual reel that has 256 virtual stops per reel would allow up to 256<sup>3</sup> = 16,777,216 final positions. The manufacturer could choose to offer a $1 million dollar jackpot on a $1 bet, confident that it will only happen, over the long term, once every 16.8 million plays.\n\n===Computerization===\nWith [[microprocessor]]s now ubiquitous, the computers inside modern slot machines allow manufacturers to assign a different probability to every symbol on every reel. To the player it might appear that a winning symbol was \"so close\", whereas in fact the probability is much lower.\n\nIn the 1980s in the U.K., machines embodying microprocessors became common. These used a number of features to ensure the payout was controlled within the limits of the gambling legislation. As a coin was inserted into the machine, it could go either directly into the cashbox for the benefit of the owner or into a channel that formed the payout reservoir, with the microprocessor monitoring the number of coins in this channel. The drums themselves were driven by stepper motors, controlled by the processor and with proximity sensors monitoring the position of the drums. A \"look-up table\" within the software allows the processor to know what symbols were being displayed on the drums to the gambler. This allowed the system to control the level of payout by stopping the drums at positions it had determined. If the payout channel had filled up, the payout became more generous; if nearly empty, the payout became less so (thus giving good control of the odds).\n\n===Video slot machines===\nVideo slot machines do not use mechanical reels, instead using graphical reels on a computerized [[Display device|display]]. As there are no mechanical constraints on the design of video slot machines, games often use at least five reels, and may also use non-standard layouts. This greatly expands the number of possibilities: a machine can have 50 or more symbols on a reel, giving [[odds]] as high as 300 million to 1 against &ndash; enough for even the largest jackpot. As there are so many combinations possible with five reels, manufacturers do not need to weight the payout symbols (although some may still do so). Instead, higher-paying symbols will typically appear only once or twice on each reel, while more common symbols earning a more frequent payout will appear many times. Video slot machines usually make more extensive use of [[multimedia]], and can feature more elaborate [[minigame]]s as bonuses. Modern cabinets typically use [[flat-panel display]]s, but cabinets using larger [[Curved screen|curved screens]] (which can provide a more immersive experience for the player) are not uncommon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8544303/casino-slot-machine-gambling-addiction-psychology-mobile-games|title=Slot machines perfected addictive gaming. Now, tech wants their tricks|last=Thompson|first=Andrew|date=2015-05-06|website=The Verge|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nVideo slot machines typically encourage the player to play multiple \"lines\": rather than simply taking the middle of the three symbols displayed on each reel, a line could go from top left to bottom right or any other pattern specified by the manufacturer. As each symbol is equally likely, there is no difficulty for the manufacturer in allowing the player to take as many of the possible lines on offer as desire &ndash; the long-term return to the player will be the same. The difference for the player is that, the more lines they play, the more likely they are to get paid on a given spin (because they are betting more).\n\nTo avoid seeming as if the player's money is simply ebbing away (whereas a payout of 100 credits on a single-line machine would be 100 bets and the player would feel they had made a substantial win, on a 20-line machine, it would only be 5 bets and not seem as significant), manufacturers commonly offer bonus games, which can return many times their bet. The player is encouraged to keep playing to reach the bonus: even if he is losing, the bonus game could allow then to win back their losses.\n===Random number generators===\nAll modern machines are designed using [[pseudo random number generator|pseudorandom number generator]]s (\"PRNGs\"), which are constantly generating a sequence of simulated random numbers, at a rate of hundreds or perhaps thousands per second. As soon as the \"Play\" button is pressed, the most recent random number is used to determine the result. This means that the result varies depending on exactly when the game is played. A fraction of a second earlier or later and the result would be different.\n\nIt is important that the machine contains a high-quality RNG implementation. Because all PRNGs must eventually repeat their number sequence<ref>{{cite book|title=Art of Computer Programming|volume=II. Seminumerical Algorithms|edition=1st|chapter=3. Random numbers|last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|authorlink=Donald Knuth|date=|pp=3\u20134|title-link=Art of Computer Programming}}</ref> and, if the period is short or the PRNG is otherwise flawed, an advanced player may be able to \"predict\" the next result. Having access to the PRNG code and seed values, [[Ronald Dale Harris]], a former slot machine programmer, discovered equations for specific gambling games like [[Keno]] that allowed him to predict what the next set of selected numbers would be based on the previous games played.\n\nMost machines are designed to defeat this by generating numbers even when the machine is not being played so the player cannot tell where in the sequence they are, even if they know how the machine was programmed.\n\n===Payout percentage===\n{{Globalize|section|date=April 2019}}\nSlot machines are typically programmed to pay out as winnings 82% to 98% of the money that is wagered by players. This is known as the \"theoretical payout percentage\" or RTP, \"return to player\". The minimum theoretical payout percentage varies among jurisdictions and is typically established by law or regulation. For example, the minimum payout in [[Nevada]] is 75%, in [[New Jersey]] 83%, and in Mississippi 80%. The winning patterns on slot machines &ndash; the amounts they pay and the frequencies of those payouts &ndash; are carefully selected to yield a certain fraction of the money payed to the \"house\" (the operator of the slot machine) while returning the rest to the players during play. Suppose that a certain slot machine costs $1 per spin and has a return to player (RTP) of 95%. It can be calculated that, over a sufficiently long period such as 1,000,000 spins, the machine will return an average of $950,000 to its players, who have inserted $1,000,000 during that time. In this (simplified) example, the slot machine is said to pay out 95%. The operator keeps the remaining $50,000. Within some EGM development organizations this concept is referred to simply as \"par\". \"Par\" also manifests itself to gamblers as promotional techniques: \"Our 'Loose Slots' have a 93% payback! Play now!\"{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nA slot machine's theoretical payout percentage is set at the factory when the [[software]] is written. Changing the payout percentage after a slot machine has been placed on the gaming floor requires a physical swap of the software or ''[[firmware]]'', which is usually stored on an [[EPROM]] but may be loaded onto non-volatile random access memory ([[NVRAM]]) or even stored on [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD]], depending on the capabilities of the machine and the applicable regulations. {{citation needed span|date=April 2019|text=Based on current technology, this is a time-consuming process and as such is done infrequently.}} In certain jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, the EPROM has a [[tamper-evident]] [[security seal|seal]] and can only be changed in the presence of [[Gaming Control Board]] officials. Other jurisdictions, including Nevada, randomly [[audit]] slot machines to ensure that they contain only approved software.\n\nHistorically, many casinos, both online and offline, have been unwilling to publish individual game RTP figures, making it impossible for the player to know whether they are playing a \"loose\" or a \"tight\" game. Since the turn of the century some information regarding these figures has started to come into the public domain either through various casinos releasing them\u2014primarily this applies to online casinos\u2014or through studies by independent gambling authorities.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe ''return to player'' is not the only statistic that is of interest. The probabilities of every payout on the pay table is also critical. For example, consider a hypothetical slot machine with a dozen different values on the pay table. However, the probabilities of getting all the payouts are zero except the largest one. If the payout is 4,000 times the input amount, and it happens every 4,000 times on average, the ''return to player'' is exactly 100%, but the game would be dull to play. Also, most people would not win anything, and having entries on the paytable that have a return of zero would be deceptive. As these individual probabilities are closely guarded secrets, it is possible that the advertised machines with high return to player simply increase the probabilities of these jackpots. The casino could legally place machines of a similar style payout and advertise that some machines have 100% return to player. The added advantage is that these large jackpots increase the excitement of the other players.\n\nThe table of probabilities for a specific machine is called the Probability and Accounting Report or PAR sheet, also PARS commonly understood as Paytable and Reel Strips. Mathematician [[Michael Shackleford]] revealed the PARS for one commercial slot machine, an original [[International Gaming Technology]] ''Red White and Blue'' machine. This game, in its original form, is obsolete, so these specific probabilities do not apply. He only published the odds after a fan of his sent him some information provided on a slot machine that was posted on a machine in the Netherlands. The psychology of the machine design is quickly revealed. There are 13 possible payouts ranging from 1:1 to 2,400:1. The 1:1 payout comes every 8 plays. The 5:1 payout comes every 33 plays, whereas the 2:1 payout comes every 600 plays. Most players assume the likelihood increases proportionate to the payout. The one mid-size payout that is designed to give the player a thrill is the 80:1 payout. It is programmed to occur an average of once every 219 plays. The 80:1 payout is high enough to create excitement, but not high enough that it makes it likely that the player will take his winnings and abandon the game. More than likely the player began the game with at least 80 times his bet (for instance there are 80 quarters in $20). In contrast the 150:1 payout occurs only on average of once every 6,241 plays. The highest payout of 2,400:1 occurs only on average of once every 64<sup>3</sup> = 262,144 plays since the machine has 64 virtual stops. The player who continues to feed the machine is likely to have several mid-size payouts, but unlikely to have a large payout. He quits after he is bored or has exhausted his bankroll.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nDespite their confidentiality, occasionally a PAR sheet is posted on a website. They have limited value to the player, because usually a machine will have 8 to 12 different possible programs with varying payouts. In addition, slight variations of each machine (e.g., with ''double jackpots'' or ''five times play'') are always being developed. The casino operator can choose which EPROM chip to install in any particular machine to select the payout desired. The result is that there is not really such a thing as a high payback type of machine, since every machine potentially has multiple settings. From October 2001 to February 2002, columnist Michael Shackleford obtained PAR sheets for five different nickel machines; four IGT games ''[[Austin Powers (disambiguation)|Austin Powers]]'', ''Fortune Cookie'', ''Leopard Spots'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and one game manufactured by WMS; ''Reel 'em In''. Without revealing the proprietary information, he developed a program that would allow him to determine with usually less than a dozen plays on each machine which EPROM chip was installed. Then he did a survey of over 400 machines in 70 different casinos in Las Vegas. He averaged the data, and assigned an average payback percentage to the machines in each casino. The resultant list was widely publicized for marketing purposes (especially by the Palms casino which had the top ranking).{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nOne reason that the slot machine is so profitable to a casino is that the player must play the ''high house edge and high payout'' wagers along with the ''low house edge and low payout'' wagers. In a more traditional wagering game like craps, the player knows that certain wagers have almost a 50/50 chance of winning or losing, but they only pay a limited multiple of the original bet (usually no higher than three times). Other bets have a higher house edge, but the player is rewarded with a bigger win (up to thirty times in craps). The player can choose what kind of wager he wants to make. A slot machine does not afford such an opportunity. Theoretically, the operator could make these probabilities available, or allow the player to choose which one so that the player is free to make a choice. However, no operator has ever enacted this strategy. Different machines have different maximum payouts, but without knowing the odds of getting the jackpot, there is no rational way to differentiate.\n\nIn many markets where central monitoring and control systems are used to link machines for auditing and security purposes, usually in wide area networks of multiple venues and thousands of machines, player return must usually be changed from a central computer rather than at each machine. A range of percentages is set in the game software and selected remotely.\n\nIn 2006, the Nevada Gaming Commission began working with Las Vegas casinos on technology that would allow the casino's management to change the game, the odds, and the payouts remotely. The change cannot be done instantaneously, but only after the selected machine has been idle for at least four minutes. After the change is made, the machine must be locked to new players for four minutes and display an on-screen message informing potential players that a change is being made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richtel |first=Matt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/12/technology/12casino.html?ei=5089&en=9e945a28ba5016c6&ex=1302494400&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss&pagewanted=all |title=From the Back Office, a Casino Can Change the Slot Machine in Seconds|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=12 April 2009|accessdate=10 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Linked machines===\nSome varieties of slot machines can be linked together in a setup sometimes known as a \"community\" game.

One historical example involved spinning a coin with a short length of plastic wire. The weight and size of the coin would be accepted by the machine and credits would be granted. However, the spin created by the plastic wire would cause the coin to exit through the reject chute into the payout tray. This particular scam has become obsolete due to improvements in newer slot machines. Another obsolete method of defeating slot machines was to use a light source to confuse the optical sensor used to count coins during payout.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-08-11-slot-cheats_x.htm |title=Slot machine cheat bilked casinos with ingenious gadgets |newspaper=USAToday.com |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>\n\nModern slot machines are controlled by EPROM computer chips and, in large casinos, coin acceptors have become obsolete in favor of bill acceptors. These machines and their bill acceptors are designed with advanced anti-cheating and anti-counterfeiting measures and are difficult to defraud. Early computerized slot machines were sometimes defrauded through the use of cheating devices, such as the \"slider\" or \"monkey paw\".

Many states have established [[gaming control board]]s to regulate the possession and use of slot machines and other form of gaming.\n\n[[Nevada]] is the only state that has no significant restrictions against slot machines both for public and private use. In [[New Jersey]], slot machines are only allowed in hotel casinos operated in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Several states ([[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Missouri]]) allow slot machines (as well as any casino-style gambling) only on licensed [[riverboat]]s or permanently anchored [[barge]]s. Since [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Mississippi]] has removed the requirement that casinos on the Gulf Coast operate on barges and now allows them on land along the shoreline. [[Delaware]] allows slot machines at three horse tracks; they are regulated by the [[Delaware Lottery|state lottery]] commission. In Wisconsin, bars and taverns are allowed to have up to five machines. These machines usually allow a player to either take a payout, or gamble it on a double-or-nothing \"side game\". \n\nThe [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|territory]] of [[Puerto Rico]] places significant restrictions on slot machine ownership, but the law is widely flouted and slot machines are common in bars and coffeeshops.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765596778/Illegal-slot-machines-threaten-Puerto-Rico-casinos.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|last=Coto|first=Danica|date=August 13, 2012|title=Illegal slot machines threaten Puerto Rico casinos|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[Native American gaming|tribal casinos]] located on [[Indian reservation|Native American reservations]], slot machines played against the house and operating independently from a [[centralized system|centralized computer system]] are classified as \"Class III\" gaming by the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA), and sometimes promoted as \"Vegas-style\" slot machines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://southfloridareporter.com/10-casinos-you-can-gamble-at-in-south-florida/|title=10 Casinos You Can Gamble at in South Florida|last=SouthFloridaReporter.com|date=2018-09-05|website=South Florida Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> In order to offer Class III gaming, tribes must enter into a [[Tribal-state compacts|compact]] (agreement) with the state that is approved by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], which may contain restrictions on the types and quantity of such games.

In essence, the term \"lottery scheme\" used in the code means slot machines, bingo and table games normally associated with a casino.

In Australia, gaming machines are a matter for state governments, so laws vary between states.\n\nGaming machines are found in casinos (approximately one in each major city), [[pub]]s and clubs in some states (usually sports, social, or [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]] clubs). The first Australian state to legalize this style of gambling was [[New South Wales]], when in 1956 they were made legal in all registered clubs in the state. There are suggestions that the proliferation of poker machines has led to increased levels of [[problem gambling]]; however, the precise nature of this link is still open to research.<ref>[http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/gambling/finalreport/index.html PC.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819030433/http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/gambling/finalreport/index.html |date=2006-08-19 }}, see Chapter 8, Productivity Commission Report no. 10</ref>\n\nIn 1999 the Australian Productivity Commission reported that nearly half Australia's gaming machines were in New South Wales. At the time, 21% of all the gambling machines in the world were operating in Australia and, on a per capita basis, Australia had roughly five times as many gaming machines as the United States. Australia ranks 8th in total number of gaming machines after Japan, U.S.A., Italy, U.K., Spain and Germany. This primarily is because gaming machines have been legal in the state of New South Wales since 1956; over time, the number of machines has grown to 97,103 (at December 2010, including the Australian Capital Territory). By way of comparison, the U.S. State of Nevada, which legalised gaming including slots several decades before N.S.W., had 190,135 slots operating.<ref>{{cite news|title=One pokie for every 110 of us|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/one-pokie-for-every-110-of-us-20100116-mdf3.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|agency=SMH|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nRevenue from gaming machines in pubs and clubs accounts for more than half of the $4 billion in gambling revenue collected by state governments in fiscal year 2002&ndash;03.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[Queensland]], gaming machines in pubs and clubs must provide a return rate of 85%, while machines located in casinos must provide a return rate of 90%.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Most other states have similar provisions. In [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], gaming machines must provide a minimum return rate of 87% (including jackpot contribution), including machines in [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]]. As of December 1, 2007, Victoria banned gaming machines that accepted $100 notes; all gaming machines made since 2003 comply with this rule. This new law also banned machines with an automatic play option. One exception exists in Crown Casino for any player with a VIP loyalty card: they can still insert $100 notes and use an autoplay feature (whereby the machine will automatically play until credit is exhausted or the player intervenes). All gaming machines in Victoria have an information screen accessible to the user by pressing the \"i key\" button, showing the game rules, paytable, return to player percentage, and the top and bottom five combinations with their odds. These combinations are stated to be played on a minimum bet (usually 1 credit per line, with 1 line or reel played, although some newer machines do not have an option to play 1 line; some machines may only allow maximum lines to be played), excluding feature wins.\n\n[[Western Australia]] only permits certain forms of gaming machine in [[Burswood Entertainment Complex|Burswood casino]] and no gaming machines elsewhere. This policy (the most restrictive in Australia) had an extensive political history, reaffirmed by the 1974 Royal Commission into Gambling:<ref>Western Australia, Report of the Royal Commission into Gambling (1974), pp.\u200772\u201373.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Poker machine playing is a mindless, repetitive and insidious form of gambling which has many undesirable features. It requires no thought, no skill or social contact. The odds are never about winning.

Historically poker machines have been banned from Western Australia and we consider that, in the public interest, they should stay banned.|sign=|source=}}\n\nWhile Western Australian gaming machines are similar to the other states', they do not have spinning reels. Therefore different animations are used in place of the spinning reels in order to display each game result.\n\n[[Nick Xenophon]] was elected on an independent [[No Pokies]] ticket in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] at the [[1997 South Australian state election]] on 2.9 percent, re-elected at the [[2006 South Australian state election|2006 election]] on 20.5 percent, and elected to the [[Australian Senate]] at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] on 14.8 percent. Independent candidate [[Andrew Wilkie]], an anti-pokies campaigner, was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of Denison|Denison]] at the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]]. Wilkie was one of four crossbenchers who supported the [[Julia Gillard|Gillard]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government following the [[hung parliament]] result. Wilkie immediately began forging ties with Xenophon as soon as it was apparent that he was elected.

Before 1992, slot machines were only in casinos and small shops, but later slot clubs began appearing all over the country. The most popular and numerous were \"Vulcan 777\" and \"Taj Mahal\". Since 2009 when gambling establishments were banned, almost all slot clubs disappeared and are found only in a specially authorized gambling zones.\n\n===United Kingdom=== <!-- [[Fixed odds betting terminal]] links here. -->\n[[Image:Old fruit machines in Teignmouth 10-08-06.jpg|thumb|right|Row of old fruit machines in Teignmouth Pier, Devon]]\n[[Image:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|right|One armed bandits at [[Wookey Hole Caves]]]]\nSlot machines are covered by the [[Gambling Act 2005]], which superseded the [[Gaming Act 1968]].<ref name=GamingAct>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20052776.htm|title=Gaming Act 2005|year=2005|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nSlot machines in the U.K. are categorised by definitions produced by the [[Gambling Commission]] as part of the Gambling Act of 2005.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As defined by the 2005 Act, large casinos can have a maximum of one hundred and fifty machines in any combination of categories B\u2013D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 5:1); small casinos can have a maximum of eighty machines in any combination of categories B\u2013D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 2:1).\n\n====Category A====\nCategory A games were defined in preparation for the planned \"[[Regional casino|Super Casinos]]\". Despite a lengthy bidding process with [[Manchester]] being chosen as the single planned location, the development was cancelled soon after [[Gordon Brown]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. As a result, there are no lawful Category A games in the U.K.\n\n====Category B====\nCategory B games are divided into subcategories. The differences between B1, B3 and B4 games are mainly the stake and prizes as defined in the above table. Category B2 games &ndash; [[Fixed odds betting terminal]]s (FOBTs) &ndash; have quite different stake and prize rules: FOBTs are mainly found in licensed [[betting shop]]s, or bookmakers, usually in the form of electronic [[roulette]].\n\nThe games are based on a [[random number generation|random number generator]]; thus each game's probability of getting the jackpot is independent of any other game: probabilities are all equal. If a [[pseudorandom number generator]] is used instead of a truly random one, probabilities are not independent since each number is determined at least in part by the one generated before it.\n\n====Category C====\nCategory C games are often referred to as '''fruit machines''', '''one-armed bandits''' and '''AWP''' ([[amusement with prize]]). Fruit machines are commonly found in [[public house|pubs]], [[Nightclub|club]]s, and [[video arcade|arcade]]s. Machines commonly have three but can be found with four or five reels, each with 16\u201324 symbols printed around them. The reels are spun each play, from which the appearance of particular combinations of symbols result in payment of their associated winnings by the machine (or alternatively initiation of a subgame). These games often have many extra features, trails and subgames with opportunities to win money; usually more than can be won from just the payouts on the reel combinations.\n\nFruit machines in the U.K. almost universally have the following features, generally selected at random using a [[pseudorandom number generator]]:\n* A player (known in the industry as a ''punter'') may be given the opportunity to ''hold'' one or more reels before spinning, meaning they will not be spun but instead retain their displayed symbols yet otherwise count normally for that play. This can sometimes increase the chance of winning, especially if two or more reels are held.\n* A player may also be given a number of ''nudges'' following a spin (or, in some machines, as a result in a subgame). A nudge is a step rotation of a reel chosen by the player (the machine may not allow all reels to be nudged for a particular play).\n* ''Cheats'' can also be made available on the Internet or through emailed newsletters to subscribers. These cheats give the player the impression of an advantage, whereas in reality the payout percentage remains exactly the same. The most widely used cheat is known as '''hold after a nudge''' and increases the chance that the player will win following an unsuccessful nudge. The cheats give the player an incentive to play the latest games.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In reality, whilst machines from the early 1990s did not advertise the concept of '''hold after a nudge''' when this feature was first introduced, it became so well-known amongst players and widespread amongst new machine releases that it is now well-advertised on the machine during play. This is characterized by messages on the display such as ''DON'T HOLD ANY'' or ''LET 'EM SPIN'' and is a designed feature of the machine, not a cheat at all.\n\nIt is known for machines to pay out multiple jackpots, one after the other (this is known as a '''streak''' or '''rave''') but each jackpot requires a new game to be played so as not to violate the law about the maximum payout on a single play. Typically this involves the player only pressing the Start button for which a single credit is taken, regardless of whether this causes the reels to spin or not. The minimum payout percentage is 70%, with pubs often setting the payout at around 78%.\n\n===Japan===\n{{See|Pachinko}}\n\n[[Japan]]ese slot machines, known as {{nihongo|'''pachisuro'''|[[:ja:\u30d1\u30c1\u30b9\u30ed|\u30d1\u30c1\u30b9\u30ed]]}} or '''pachislot''' ([[portmanteau]]s of the words \"pachinko\" and \"slot machine\"), are a descendant of the traditional Japanese [[pachinko]] game. Slot machines are a fairly new phenomenon and they can be found mostly in pachinko parlors and the adult sections of [[Video arcade|amusement arcade]]s, known as game centers.\n\nThe machines are regulated with [[integrated circuit]]s, and have six different levels changing the odds of a [[777 (number)#Gambling and luck|777]]. The levels provide a rough outcome of between 90% to 160% (200% for skilled players). Japanese slot machines are \"beatable\". Parlor operators naturally set most machines to simply collect money, but intentionally place a few paying machines on the floor so that there will be at least someone winning,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} encouraging players on the losing machines to keep gambling, using the psychology of the [[gambler's fallacy]].\n\nDespite the many varieties of pachislot machines, there are certain rules and regulations put forward by the {{nihongo|Security Electronics and Communication Technology Association|[[:ja:\u4fdd\u5b89\u96fb\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5354\u4f1a|\u4fdd\u5b89\u96fb\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5354\u4f1a]]}}, an affiliate of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]]. For example, there must be three reels. All reels must be accompanied by buttons which allow players to manually stop them, reels may not spin faster than 80 RPM, and reels must stop within 0.19 seconds of a button press. In practice, this means that machines cannot let reels slip more than 4 symbols. Other rules include a 15 coin payout cap, a 50 credit cap on machines, a 3 coin maximum bet, and other such regulations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nAlthough a 15 coin payout may seem quite low, regulations allow \"Big Bonus\" (c. 400\u2013711 coins) and \"Regular Bonus\" modes (c. 110 coins) where these 15 coin payouts occur nearly continuously until the bonus mode is finished. While the machine is in bonus mode,  the player is entertained with special winning scenes on the LCD display, and energizing music is heard, payout after payout.\n\nThree other unique features of Pachisuro machines are \"stock\", \"renchan\", and {{Nihongo|''tenj\u014d''|\u5929\u4e95}}. On many machines, when enough money to afford a bonus is taken in, the bonus is not immediately awarded. Typically the game merely stops making the reels slip off the bonus symbols for a few games. If the player fails to hit the bonus during these \"standby games\", it is added to the \"stock\" for later collection. Many current games, after finishing a bonus round, set the probability to release additional stock (gained from earlier players failing to get a bonus last time the machine stopped making the reels slip for a bit) very high for the first few games. As a result, a lucky player may get to play several bonus rounds in a row (a \"renchan\"), making payouts of 5,000 or even 10,000 coins possible. The lure of \"stock\" waiting in the machine, and the possibility of \"renchan\" tease the gambler to keep feeding the machine. To tease them further, there is a ''tenj\u014d'' (ceiling), a maximum limit on the number of games between \"stock\" release. For example, if the ''tenj\u014d'' is 1,500, and the number of games played since the last bonus is 1,490, the player is guaranteed to release a bonus within just 10 games.\n\nBecause of the \"stock\", \"renchan\", and ''tenj\u014d'' systems, it is possible to make money by simply playing machines on which someone has just lost a huge amount of money. This is called being a \"[[hyena]]\". They are easy to recognize, roaming the aisles for a \"kamo\" (\"[[Gullibility|sucker]]\" in English) to leave his machine.\n\nIn short, the regulations allowing \"stock\", \"renchan\", and ''tenj\u014d'' transformed the pachisuro from a low-stakes form of entertainment just a few years back to hardcore gambling. [[Problem gambling|Many people may be gambling more than they can afford]], and the big payouts also lure unsavory \"hyena\" types into the gambling halls.\n\nTo address these social issues, a new regulation (Version 5.0) was adopted in 2006 which caps the maximum amount of \"stock\" a machine can hold to around 2,000\u20133,000 coins' worth of bonus games. Moreover, all pachisuro machines must be re-evaluated for regulation compliance every three years. Version 4.0 came out in 2004, so that means all those machines with the up to 10,000 coin payouts will be removed from service by 2007.\n\n==Problem gambling and slot machines==\nNatasha Dow Sch\u00fcll, associate professor in [[New York University]]'s Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, uses the term \"machine zone\" to describe the state of immersion that users of slot machines experience during gambling, in which they lose a sense of time, space, bodily awareness, and monetary value.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sch\u00fcll|first=Natasha|title=Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas|location=Princeton, N.J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-69-116088-7|oclc=866583433}}</ref>\n\nMike Dixon, PhD, professor of psychology at the [[University of Waterloo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/mike-j-dixon|title=Mike J.

Horse Head Bonus Antique Slot Machine.jpg|thumb|Mills Novelty Co. Horse Head Bonus antique slot machine]]\n\n==Skill stops==\nSkill stop buttons predated the Bally electromechanical slot machines of the 1960s and 70s. They appeared on mechanical slot machines manufactured by Mills Novelty Co. as early as the mid 1920s. These machines had modified reel-stop arms, which allowed them to be released from the timing bar, earlier than in a normal play, simply by pressing the buttons on the front of the machine, located between each reel.\n\n\"Skill stop\" buttons were added to some slot machines by Zacharias Anthony in the early 1970s. These enabled the player to stop each reel, allowing a degree of \"skill\" so as to satisfy the [[New Jersey]] gaming laws of the day which required that players were able to control the game in some way. The original conversion was applied to approximately 50 late-model Bally slot machines. Because the typical machine stopped the reels automatically in less than 10 seconds, weights were added to the mechanical timers to prolong the automatic stopping of the reels. By the time the New Jersey Alcoholic Beverages Commission (ABC) had approved the conversion for use in New Jersey arcades, the word was out and every other distributor began adding skill stops. The machines were a huge hit on the [[Jersey Shore]] and the remaining unconverted Bally machines were destroyed as they had become instantly obsolete.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Casino]]\n*[[EUROMAT|European Gaming & Amusement Federation]]\n*[[List of probability topics]]\n*[[Pachinko]]\n*[[Problem gambling]]\n*[[Progressive jackpot]]\n*[[Quiz machine]]\n*[[United States state slot machine ownership regulations]]\n*[[Video bingo]]\n*[[Video Lottery Terminal]]\n*[[Video poker]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Brisman, Andrew.

The location is a [[California Historical Landmark]].]]\nSittman and Pitt of [[Brooklyn, New York]], developed a gambling machine in 1891, which was a precursor to the modern slot machine. It contained five drums holding a total of 50 card faces based on [[poker]]. This machine proved extremely popular and soon many [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] in the city had one or more of them. Players would insert a [[Nickel (U.S. coin)|nickel]] and pull a lever, which would spin the drums and the cards they held, the player hoping for a good poker hand. There was no direct payout mechanism, so a [[Glossary of poker terms|pair of kings]] might get the player a free beer, whereas a [[Glossary of poker terms|royal flush]] could pay out cigars or drinks, the prizes wholly dependent on what was on offer at the local establishment. To make the odds better for the house, two cards were typically removed from the [[Deck (cards)|deck]]: the ten of [[Spades (suit)|spades]] and the [[Jack (playing card)|jack of hearts]], which doubles the [[odds]] against winning a royal flush. The drums could also be rearranged to further reduce a player's chance of winning.\n\nDue to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card game, it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic payout for all possible winning combinations. Somewhere between 1887 and 1895,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slot-machine-resource.com/slot-machine-history.htm |title=History of slot machines }}</ref> [[Charles Fey]] of [[San Francisco, California]], devised a much simpler automatic mechanism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://casinogambling.about.com/od/slots/a/charlesfey.htm |title=Charles Fey article |publisher=Casinogambling.about.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols: horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts, and a [[Liberty Bell]]. The bell gave the machine its name. By replacing ten cards with five symbols and using three reels instead of five drums, the complexity of reading a win was considerably reduced, allowing Fey to devise an effective automatic payout mechanism. Three bells in a row produced the biggest payoff, ten nickels (50\u00a2). ''Liberty Bell'' was a huge success and spawned a thriving mechanical gaming device industry. Even when, after a few years, the use of these gambling devices was banned in his home state, Fey still could not keep up with demand for them elsewhere. The Liberty Bell machine was so popular that it was copied by many slot machine manufacturers. The first of these was a machine, also called the \"Liberty Bell\", produced by the manufacturer Herbert Mills in 1907. By 1908 lots of \"bell\" machines were installed in most cigar stores, saloons, bowling alleys, brothels and barber shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/long-colorful-profitable-history-slot-machines-55000 |title=The Long, Colorful, Profitable History of Slot Machines |publisher=The Indian Observer |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref> Early machines, including an 1899 \"Liberty Bell\", are now part of the Nevada State Museum's Fey Collection.<ref>{{cite web|title = CM-5716-P-06 Machine, Slot|url = http://www.nevadaculture.org/museums/new_exhibits/cc-slot_machines/exhibit1/e10007a.html|website = Nevada State Museum|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe first Liberty Bell machines produced by Mills used the same symbols on the reels as Charles Fey's original. Soon afterwards, another version was produced with patriotic symbols such as a flag and a wreath on the wheels. Later, a similar machine, rechristened the Operator's Bell, was designed, for which an optional gum vending attachment was available. As the gum offered was fruit-flavored, fruit symbols were placed on the reels: lemons, cherries, oranges, and plums. A bell was retained, and a picture of a stick of Bell-Fruit Gum, the origin of the bar symbol, was also present. This set of symbols proved highly popular, so was used by the other companies that began to make their own slot machines: Caille, Watling, Jennings and Pace.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fey |first=Marshall |date=1983 |title=Slot Machines A Pictorial History of the First 100 Years |location= |publisher=[[Liberty Belle Books]] |isbn=0-9623852-7-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe payment of food prizes was a commonly used technique to avoid laws against gambling in a number of states. For this reason, a number of [[gumball machine|gumball]] and other [[vending machine]]s were regarded with mistrust by the courts. The two [[Iowa]] cases of ''State v. Ellis''<ref>200 Iowa 1228, 206 N.W. 105. (Iowa, 1925).</ref> and ''State v. Striggles''<ref>202 Iowa 1318, 210 N.W. 137.

The electromechanical approach of the 1960s allowed ''Money Honey'' to be the first slot machine with a bottomless hopper and automatic payout of up to 500 coins without the help of an attendant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballytech.com/company-information |title=Bally Technologies, Inc. &#124; Company Information |publisher=Ballytech.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> The popularity of this machine led to the increasing predominance of [[electronic game]]s, with the side lever soon becoming vestigial.\n\nThe first video slot machine was developed in 1976 in [[Kearny Mesa, California]], by the Las Vegas\u2013based Fortune Coin Co. This slot machine used a modified {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}} Sony Trinitron color receiver for the display and logic boards for all slot machine functions. The prototype was mounted in a full-size show-ready slot machine cabinet. The first production units went on trial in the [[Las Vegas Hilton Hotel]]. After some \"cheat-proofing\" modifications, the video slot machine was approved by the Nevada State Gaming Commission and eventually found popularity in the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and downtown casinos. Fortune Coin Co. and their video slot machine technology were purchased by IGT (International Gaming Technology) in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe first American video slot machine to offer a \"second screen\" bonus round was ''Reel \u2019Em In'' developed by [[WMS Industries]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casinocenter.com/?p=834|title=HALL OF FAME IN SLOT GAMES : Casino Player Magazine - Strictly Slots Magazine - Casino Gambling Tips|work=casinocenter.com}}</ref> This type of machine had appeared in Australia from at least 1994 with the \"Three Bags Full\" game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=3-bags-full&page=detail&id=5056|title=3 Bags Full|work=arcade-history.com}}</ref> In this type of machine, the display changes to provide a different game where an additional payout may be won or accumulated.\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Vegas slots.JPG|left|thumb|A row of \"Wheel of Fortune\" slot machines in a casino in Las Vegas. This specific slot machine is themed to the TV game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.]]\n\nA person playing a slot machine can insert cash or, in \"[[ticket-in, ticket-out]]\" machines, a paper ticket with a [[barcode]], into a designated slot on the machine. The machine is then activated by means of a lever or button (either physical or on a touchscreen), which activates reels that spin and stop to reveal one or several symbols. Most games have a variety of winning combinations of symbols. If a player matches a combination according to the rules of the game, the slot machine credits the player. Symbols can vary depending on the machine, but often include objects such as fruits, bells, and stylized [[Lucky number|lucky sevens]]. Most slot games have a theme, such as a specific [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], location, or character. Symbols and other bonus features of the game are typically aligned with the theme. Some themes are licensed from popular [[media franchise]]s, including films, television series (including [[game show]]s such as ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''), entertainers, and musicians.\n\nMulti-line slot machines have become more popular since the 1990s. These machines have more than one payline, meaning that visible symbols that are not aligned on the main horizontal may be considered for winning combinations. Traditional 3-reel slot machines commonly have three or five paylines while video slot machines may have 9, 15, 25, or as many as 1024 different paylines. Most accept variable numbers of credits to play, with 1 to 15 credits per line being typical. The higher the amount bet, the higher the payout will be if the player wins. \n\nOne of the main differences between video slot machines and reel machines is in the way payouts are calculated. With reel machines, the only way to win the maximum jackpot is to play the maximum number of coins (usually 3, sometimes 4 or even 5 coins per spin). With video machines, the fixed payout values are multiplied by the number of coins per line that is being bet. In other words: on a reel machine, the odds are more favorable if the gambler plays with the maximum number of coins available.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Tom|title=How Slot Machines Work|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/slot-machine4.htm|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=2002-02-26}}</ref> However, depending on the structure of the game and its bonus features, some video slots may still include features that improve chances at payouts by making increased wagers.\n\n\"Multi-way\" games eschew fixed paylines in favor of allowing symbols to pay anywhere, as long as there is at least one in at least 3 consecutive reels from left to right. Multi-way games may be configured to allow players to bet by-reel: for example, on a game with a 3x5 pattern (often referred to as a 243-way game), playing one reel allows all three symbols in the first reel to potentially pay, but only the center row pays on the remaining reels (often designated by darkening the unused portions of the reels). Other multi-way games use a 4x5 or 5x5 pattern, where there are up to 5 symbols in each reel, allowing for up to 1,024 and 3,125 ways to win respectively. The Australian manufacturer [[Aristocrat Leisure]] brands games featuring this system as \"Reel Power\", \"Xtra Reel Power\" and \"Super Reel Power\" respectively. A variation involves patterns where symbols pay adjacent to one another. Most of these games have a hexagonal reel formation, and much like multi-way games, any patterns not played are darkened out of use.\n\nDenominations can range from 1 cent (\"penny slots\") all the way up to $100.00 or more per credit. The latter are typically known as \"high limit\" machines, and machines configured to allow for such wagers are often located in dedicated areas (which may have a separate team of attendants to cater to the needs of those who play there). The machine automatically calculates the number of credits the player receives in exchange for the cash inserted. Newer machines often allow players to choose from a selection of denominations on a [[splash screen]] or menu.\n\n==Terminology==\nA '''bonus''' is a special feature of the particular game theme, which is activated when certain symbols appear in a winning combination. Bonuses and the number of bonus features vary depending upon the game. Some bonus rounds are a special session of free spins (the number of which is often based on the winning combination that triggers the bonus), often with a different or modified set of winning combinations as the main game and/or other multipliers or increased frequencies of symbols, or a \"hold and re-spin\" mechanic in which specific symbols (usually marked with values of credits or other prizes) are collected and locked in place over a finite number of spins. In other bonus rounds, the player is presented with several items on a screen from which to choose. As the player chooses items, a number of credits is revealed and awarded. Some bonuses use a mechanical device, such as a spinning wheel, that works in conjunction with the bonus to display the amount won. \n\nA '''candle''' is a light on top of the slot machine. It flashes to alert the operator that change is needed, hand pay is requested or a potential problem with the machine. It can be lit by the player by pressing the \"service\" or \"help\" button.\n\n'''Carousel''' refers to a grouping of slot machines, usually in a circle or oval formation.\n\nA '''coin hopper''' is a container where the coins that are immediately available for payouts are held. The hopper is a mechanical device that rotates coins into the coin tray when a player collects credits/coins (by pressing a \"Cash Out\" button). When a certain preset coin capacity is reached, a coin diverter automatically redirects, or \"drops\", excess coins into a \"drop bucket\" or \"drop box\". (Unused coin hoppers can still be found even on games that exclusively employ Ticket-In, Ticket-Out technology, as a vestige.)\n\nThe '''credit meter''' is a display of the amount of money or number of credits on the machine. On mechanical slot machines, this is usually a [[seven-segment display]], but video slot machines typically use stylized text that suits the game's theme and user interface.\n\nThe '''drop bucket''' or '''drop box''' is a container located in a slot machine's base where excess coins are diverted from the hopper. Typically, a drop bucket is used for low-denomination slot machines and a drop box is used for high-denomination slot machines. A drop box contains a hinged lid with one or more locks whereas a drop bucket does not contain a lid. The contents of drop buckets and drop boxes are collected and [[hard count|counted]] by the casino on a scheduled basis.\n\n'''EGM''' is short for \"Electronic Gaming Machine\".\n\n'''Free spins''' are a common form of bonus, where a series of spins are automatically played at no charge at the player's current wager. Free spins are usually triggered via a scatter of at least three designated symbols (with the number of spins dependent on the number of symbols that land). Some games allow the free spins bonus to \"retrigger\", which adds additional spins on top of those already awarded. There is no theoretical limit to the number of free spins obtainable. Some games may have other features that can also trigger over the course of free spins.\n\nA '''[[hand pay]]''' refers to a payout made by an attendant or at an exchange point (\"cage\"), rather than by the slot machine itself. A hand pay occurs when the amount of the payout exceeds the maximum amount that was preset by the slot machine's operator. Usually, the maximum amount is set at the level where the operator must begin to deduct taxes. A hand pay could also be necessary as a result of a short pay.\n\n'''Hopper fill slip''' is a document used to record the replenishment of the coin in the coin hopper after it becomes depleted as a result of making payouts to players. The slip indicates the amount of coin placed into the hoppers, as well as the signatures of the employees involved in the transaction, the slot machine number and the location and the date.\n\n'''MEAL book''' ('''''M'''''achine '''''e'''''ntry '''''a'''''uthorization '''''l'''''og) is a log of the employee's entries into the machine.\n\n'''Low-level''' or '''slant-top''' slot machines include a stool so the player may sit down. '''Stand-up''' or '''upright''' slot machines are played while standing.\n\n'''Optimal play''' is a payback percentage based on a gambler using the optimal strategy in a skill-based slot machine game.\n\n'''Payline''' is a line that crosses through one symbol on each reel, along which a winning combination is evaluated. Classic spinning reel machines usually have up to nine paylines, while video slot machines may have as many as one hundred. Paylines could be of various shapes (horizontal, vertical, oblique, triangular, zigzag, etc.)\n\n'''Roll-up''' is the process of dramatizing a win by playing sounds while the '''meters''' count up to the amount that has been won.\n\n'''Short pay''' refers to a partial payout made by a slot machine, which is less than the amount due to the player. This occurs if the coin hopper has been depleted as a result of making earlier payouts to players. The remaining amount due to the player is either paid as a hand pay or an attendant will come and refill the machine.\n\nA '''scatter''' is a pay combination based on occurrences of a designated symbol landing anywhere on the reels, rather than falling in sequence on the same payline. A scatter pay usually requires a minimum of three symbols to land, and the machine may offer increased prizes or jackpots depending on the number that land. Scatters are frequently used to trigger bonus games, such as free spins (with the number of spins multiplying based on the number of scatter symbols that land). The scatter symbol usually cannot be matched using wilds, and some games may require the scatter symbols to appear on consecutive reels in order to pay. On some multiway games, scatter symbols still pay in unused areas.\n\n'''Taste''' is a reference to the small amount often paid out to keep a player seated and continuously betting. Only rarely will machines fail to pay even the minimum out over the course of several pulls.\n\n[[Image:Slot machine Tilt error.jpg|right|thumb|Display screen of a slot machine in tilt mode]]\n'''Tilt''' is a term derived from electromechanical slot machines' \"[[mercury switch|tilt switches]]\", which would make or break a circuit when they were tilted or otherwise tampered with that triggered an alarm. While modern machines no longer have tilt switches, any kind of technical fault (door switch in the wrong state, reel motor failure, out of paper, etc.) is still called a \"tilt\".\n\nA '''theoretical hold worksheet''' is a document provided by the manufacturer for every slot machine that indicates the theoretical percentage the machine should hold based on the amount paid in. The worksheet also indicates the reel strip settings, number of coins that may be played, the payout schedule, the number of reels and other information descriptive of the particular type of slot machine.\n\n'''Volatility''' or '''variance''' refers to the measure of risk associated with playing a slot machine. A low-volatility slot machine has regular but smaller wins, while a high-variance slot machine has fewer but bigger wins.\n\n'''Weight count''' is an American term referring to the total value of coins or tokens removed from a slot machine's drop bucket or drop box for countomg by the casino's [[hard count]] team through the use of a weigh scale.\n\n'''Wild symbols''' substitute for most other symbols in the game (similarly to a [[Joker (playing card)|joker]] card), usually excluding scatter and jackpot symbols (or offering a lower prize on non-natural combinations that include wilds). How jokers behave are dependent on the specific game and whether the player is in a bonus or free games mode. Sometimes wild symbols may only appear on certain reels, or have a chance to \"stack\" across the entire reel.\n\n==Pay table==\n{{Main|Pay table}}\nEach machine has a table that lists the number of credits the player will receive if the symbols listed on the pay table line up on the pay line of the machine. Some symbols are wild and can represent many, or all, of the other symbols to complete a winning line. Especially on older machines, the pay table is listed on the face of the machine, usually above and below the area containing the wheels. On video slot machines, they are usually contained within a help menu, along with information on other features.\n\n==Technology==\n===Reels===\nHistorically, all slot machines used revolving mechanical reels to display and determine results. Although the original slot machine used five reels, simpler, and therefore more reliable, three reel machines quickly became the standard.\n\nA problem with three reel machines is that the number of combinations is only [[cube (algebra)|cubic]] &ndash; the original slot machine with three physical reels and 10 symbols on each reel had only 10<sup>3</sup> = 1,000 possible combinations. This limited the manufacturer's ability to offer large jackpots since even the rarest event had a likelihood of 0.1%. The maximum theoretical payout, assuming 100% return to player would be 1000 times the bet, but that would leave no room for other pays, making the machine very high risk, and also quite boring.\n\nAlthough the number of symbols eventually increased to about 22, allowing 10,648 combinations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaming.unlv.edu/reading/Pacyniak.PDF |title=Info |website=gaming.unlv.edu }}</ref> this still limited jackpot sizes as well as the number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn the 1980s, however, slot machine manufacturers incorporated electronics into their products and programmed them to weight particular symbols. Thus the odds of losing symbols appearing on the payline became disproportionate to their actual frequency on the physical reel. A symbol would only appear once on the reel displayed to the player, but could, in fact, occupy several stops on the multiple reel.\n\nIn 1984 Inge Telnaes received a patent for a device titled, \"Electronic Gaming Device Utilizing a Random Number Generator for Selecting the Reel Stop Positions\" (US Patent 4448419),<ref>{{US patent|4448419|Electronic gaming device utilizing a random number generator for selecting the reel stop positions}}</ref> which states: \"It is important to make a machine that is perceived to present greater chances of payoff than it actually has within the legal limitations that games of chance must operate.\" <ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Collier |first=Roger\n |date=1 July 2008\n |title=Do slot machines play mind games with gamblers?\n |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal\n |volume=179 |issue=1 |pages=23\u20134\n |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080870\n |pmc=2464464\n |pmid=18591518\n}}</ref> The patent was later bought by [[International Game Technology (1975)|International Game Technology]] and has since expired.\n\nA virtual reel that has 256 virtual stops per reel would allow up to 256<sup>3</sup> = 16,777,216 final positions. The manufacturer could choose to offer a $1 million dollar jackpot on a $1 bet, confident that it will only happen, over the long term, once every 16.8 million plays.\n\n===Computerization===\nWith [[microprocessor]]s now ubiquitous, the computers inside modern slot machines allow manufacturers to assign a different probability to every symbol on every reel. To the player it might appear that a winning symbol was \"so close\", whereas in fact the probability is much lower.\n\nIn the 1980s in the U.K., machines embodying microprocessors became common. These used a number of features to ensure the payout was controlled within the limits of the gambling legislation. As a coin was inserted into the machine, it could go either directly into the cashbox for the benefit of the owner or into a channel that formed the payout reservoir, with the microprocessor monitoring the number of coins in this channel. The drums themselves were driven by stepper motors, controlled by the processor and with proximity sensors monitoring the position of the drums. A \"look-up table\" within the software allows the processor to know what symbols were being displayed on the drums to the gambler. This allowed the system to control the level of payout by stopping the drums at positions it had determined. If the payout channel had filled up, the payout became more generous; if nearly empty, the payout became less so (thus giving good control of the odds).\n\n===Video slot machines===\nVideo slot machines do not use mechanical reels, instead using graphical reels on a computerized [[Display device|display]]. As there are no mechanical constraints on the design of video slot machines, games often use at least five reels, and may also use non-standard layouts. This greatly expands the number of possibilities: a machine can have 50 or more symbols on a reel, giving [[odds]] as high as 300 million to 1 against &ndash; enough for even the largest jackpot. As there are so many combinations possible with five reels, manufacturers do not need to weight the payout symbols (although some may still do so). Instead, higher-paying symbols will typically appear only once or twice on each reel, while more common symbols earning a more frequent payout will appear many times. Video slot machines usually make more extensive use of [[multimedia]], and can feature more elaborate [[minigame]]s as bonuses. Modern cabinets typically use [[flat-panel display]]s, but cabinets using larger [[Curved screen|curved screens]] (which can provide a more immersive experience for the player) are not uncommon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8544303/casino-slot-machine-gambling-addiction-psychology-mobile-games|title=Slot machines perfected addictive gaming. Now, tech wants their tricks|last=Thompson|first=Andrew|date=2015-05-06|website=The Verge|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nVideo slot machines typically encourage the player to play multiple \"lines\": rather than simply taking the middle of the three symbols displayed on each reel, a line could go from top left to bottom right or any other pattern specified by the manufacturer. As each symbol is equally likely, there is no difficulty for the manufacturer in allowing the player to take as many of the possible lines on offer as desire &ndash; the long-term return to the player will be the same. The difference for the player is that, the more lines they play, the more likely they are to get paid on a given spin (because they are betting more).\n\nTo avoid seeming as if the player's money is simply ebbing away (whereas a payout of 100 credits on a single-line machine would be 100 bets and the player would feel they had made a substantial win, on a 20-line machine, it would only be 5 bets and not seem as significant), manufacturers commonly offer bonus games, which can return many times their bet. The player is encouraged to keep playing to reach the bonus: even if he is losing, the bonus game could allow then to win back their losses.\n===Random number generators===\nAll modern machines are designed using [[pseudo random number generator|pseudorandom number generator]]s (\"PRNGs\"), which are constantly generating a sequence of simulated random numbers, at a rate of hundreds or perhaps thousands per second. As soon as the \"Play\" button is pressed, the most recent random number is used to determine the result. This means that the result varies depending on exactly when the game is played. A fraction of a second earlier or later and the result would be different.\n\nIt is important that the machine contains a high-quality RNG implementation. Because all PRNGs must eventually repeat their number sequence<ref>{{cite book|title=Art of Computer Programming|volume=II. Seminumerical Algorithms|edition=1st|chapter=3. Random numbers|last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|authorlink=Donald Knuth|date=|pp=3\u20134|title-link=Art of Computer Programming}}</ref> and, if the period is short or the PRNG is otherwise flawed, an advanced player may be able to \"predict\" the next result. Having access to the PRNG code and seed values, [[Ronald Dale Harris]], a former slot machine programmer, discovered equations for specific gambling games like [[Keno]] that allowed him to predict what the next set of selected numbers would be based on the previous games played.\n\nMost machines are designed to defeat this by generating numbers even when the machine is not being played so the player cannot tell where in the sequence they are, even if they know how the machine was programmed.\n\n===Payout percentage===\n{{Globalize|section|date=April 2019}}\nSlot machines are typically programmed to pay out as winnings 82% to 98% of the money that is wagered by players. This is known as the \"theoretical payout percentage\" or RTP, \"return to player\". The minimum theoretical payout percentage varies among jurisdictions and is typically established by law or regulation. For example, the minimum payout in [[Nevada]] is 75%, in [[New Jersey]] 83%, and in Mississippi 80%. The winning patterns on slot machines &ndash; the amounts they pay and the frequencies of those payouts &ndash; are carefully selected to yield a certain fraction of the money payed to the \"house\" (the operator of the slot machine) while returning the rest to the players during play. Suppose that a certain slot machine costs $1 per spin and has a return to player (RTP) of 95%. It can be calculated that, over a sufficiently long period such as 1,000,000 spins, the machine will return an average of $950,000 to its players, who have inserted $1,000,000 during that time. In this (simplified) example, the slot machine is said to pay out 95%. The operator keeps the remaining $50,000. Within some EGM development organizations this concept is referred to simply as \"par\". \"Par\" also manifests itself to gamblers as promotional techniques: \"Our 'Loose Slots' have a 93% payback! Play now!\"{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nA slot machine's theoretical payout percentage is set at the factory when the [[software]] is written. Changing the payout percentage after a slot machine has been placed on the gaming floor requires a physical swap of the software or ''[[firmware]]'', which is usually stored on an [[EPROM]] but may be loaded onto non-volatile random access memory ([[NVRAM]]) or even stored on [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD]], depending on the capabilities of the machine and the applicable regulations. {{citation needed span|date=April 2019|text=Based on current technology, this is a time-consuming process and as such is done infrequently.}} In certain jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, the EPROM has a [[tamper-evident]] [[security seal|seal]] and can only be changed in the presence of [[Gaming Control Board]] officials. Other jurisdictions, including Nevada, randomly [[audit]] slot machines to ensure that they contain only approved software.\n\nHistorically, many casinos, both online and offline, have been unwilling to publish individual game RTP figures, making it impossible for the player to know whether they are playing a \"loose\" or a \"tight\" game. Since the turn of the century some information regarding these figures has started to come into the public domain either through various casinos releasing them\u2014primarily this applies to online casinos\u2014or through studies by independent gambling authorities.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe ''return to player'' is not the only statistic that is of interest. The probabilities of every payout on the pay table is also critical. For example, consider a hypothetical slot machine with a dozen different values on the pay table. However, the probabilities of getting all the payouts are zero except the largest one. If the payout is 4,000 times the input amount, and it happens every 4,000 times on average, the ''return to player'' is exactly 100%, but the game would be dull to play. Also, most people would not win anything, and having entries on the paytable that have a return of zero would be deceptive. As these individual probabilities are closely guarded secrets, it is possible that the advertised machines with high return to player simply increase the probabilities of these jackpots. The casino could legally place machines of a similar style payout and advertise that some machines have 100% return to player. The added advantage is that these large jackpots increase the excitement of the other players.\n\nThe table of probabilities for a specific machine is called the Probability and Accounting Report or PAR sheet, also PARS commonly understood as Paytable and Reel Strips. Mathematician [[Michael Shackleford]] revealed the PARS for one commercial slot machine, an original [[International Gaming Technology]] ''Red White and Blue'' machine. This game, in its original form, is obsolete, so these specific probabilities do not apply. He only published the odds after a fan of his sent him some information provided on a slot machine that was posted on a machine in the Netherlands. The psychology of the machine design is quickly revealed. There are 13 possible payouts ranging from 1:1 to 2,400:1. The 1:1 payout comes every 8 plays. The 5:1 payout comes every 33 plays, whereas the 2:1 payout comes every 600 plays. Most players assume the likelihood increases proportionate to the payout. The one mid-size payout that is designed to give the player a thrill is the 80:1 payout. It is programmed to occur an average of once every 219 plays. The 80:1 payout is high enough to create excitement, but not high enough that it makes it likely that the player will take his winnings and abandon the game. More than likely the player began the game with at least 80 times his bet (for instance there are 80 quarters in $20). In contrast the 150:1 payout occurs only on average of once every 6,241 plays. The highest payout of 2,400:1 occurs only on average of once every 64<sup>3</sup> = 262,144 plays since the machine has 64 virtual stops. The player who continues to feed the machine is likely to have several mid-size payouts, but unlikely to have a large payout. He quits after he is bored or has exhausted his bankroll.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nDespite their confidentiality, occasionally a PAR sheet is posted on a website. They have limited value to the player, because usually a machine will have 8 to 12 different possible programs with varying payouts. In addition, slight variations of each machine (e.g., with ''double jackpots'' or ''five times play'') are always being developed. The casino operator can choose which EPROM chip to install in any particular machine to select the payout desired. The result is that there is not really such a thing as a high payback type of machine, since every machine potentially has multiple settings. From October 2001 to February 2002, columnist Michael Shackleford obtained PAR sheets for five different nickel machines; four IGT games ''[[Austin Powers (disambiguation)|Austin Powers]]'', ''Fortune Cookie'', ''Leopard Spots'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and one game manufactured by WMS; ''Reel 'em In''. Without revealing the proprietary information, he developed a program that would allow him to determine with usually less than a dozen plays on each machine which EPROM chip was installed. Then he did a survey of over 400 machines in 70 different casinos in Las Vegas. He averaged the data, and assigned an average payback percentage to the machines in each casino. The resultant list was widely publicized for marketing purposes (especially by the Palms casino which had the top ranking).{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nOne reason that the slot machine is so profitable to a casino is that the player must play the ''high house edge and high payout'' wagers along with the ''low house edge and low payout'' wagers. In a more traditional wagering game like craps, the player knows that certain wagers have almost a 50/50 chance of winning or losing, but they only pay a limited multiple of the original bet (usually no higher than three times). Other bets have a higher house edge, but the player is rewarded with a bigger win (up to thirty times in craps). The player can choose what kind of wager he wants to make. A slot machine does not afford such an opportunity. Theoretically, the operator could make these probabilities available, or allow the player to choose which one so that the player is free to make a choice. However, no operator has ever enacted this strategy. Different machines have different maximum payouts, but without knowing the odds of getting the jackpot, there is no rational way to differentiate.\n\nIn many markets where central monitoring and control systems are used to link machines for auditing and security purposes, usually in wide area networks of multiple venues and thousands of machines, player return must usually be changed from a central computer rather than at each machine. A range of percentages is set in the game software and selected remotely.\n\nIn 2006, the Nevada Gaming Commission began working with Las Vegas casinos on technology that would allow the casino's management to change the game, the odds, and the payouts remotely. The change cannot be done instantaneously, but only after the selected machine has been idle for at least four minutes. After the change is made, the machine must be locked to new players for four minutes and display an on-screen message informing potential players that a change is being made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richtel |first=Matt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/12/technology/12casino.html?ei=5089&en=9e945a28ba5016c6&ex=1302494400&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss&pagewanted=all |title=From the Back Office, a Casino Can Change the Slot Machine in Seconds|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=12 April 2009|accessdate=10 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Linked machines===\nSome varieties of slot machines can be linked together in a setup sometimes known as a \"community\" game. The most basic form of this setup involves [[progressive jackpot]]s that are shared between the bank of machines, but may include multiplayer bonuses and other features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.casinojournal.com/articles/89815-the-latest-community-slot-games-offer-play-mechanics-and-features-designed-to-overcome-the-shortfalls-of-previous-products-and-concepts?v=preview|title=The latest community slot games offer play mechanics and features designed to overcome the shortfalls of previous products and concepts|website=Casino Journal|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases multiple machines are linked across multiple casinos. In these cases, the machines may be owned by the manufacturer, who is responsible for paying the jackpot. The casinos [[lease]] the machines rather than owning them outright. Casinos in New Jersey, Nevada, and [[South Dakota]] now offer multi-state progressive jackpots, which now offer bigger jackpot pools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Division of Gaming Enforcement Announces Approval for Interstate Progressive Slot Machines|url=http://www.nj.gov/oag/ge/2014news/MultistateProgressiveSlotMachines.pdf|website=New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Division of Gaming Enforcement Announces Interstate Progressive Slots Link with Nevada|url=http://www.nj.gov/oag/ge/2014news/Multistate%20ProgressiveSlots.pdf|website=New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement}}</ref>\n\n===Fraud===\nMechanical slot machines and their coin acceptors were sometimes susceptible to cheating devices and other scams. One historical example involved spinning a coin with a short length of plastic wire. The weight and size of the coin would be accepted by the machine and credits would be granted. However, the spin created by the plastic wire would cause the coin to exit through the reject chute into the payout tray. This particular scam has become obsolete due to improvements in newer slot machines. Another obsolete method of defeating slot machines was to use a light source to confuse the optical sensor used to count coins during payout.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-08-11-slot-cheats_x.htm |title=Slot machine cheat bilked casinos with ingenious gadgets |newspaper=USAToday.com |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>\n\nModern slot machines are controlled by EPROM computer chips and, in large casinos, coin acceptors have become obsolete in favor of bill acceptors. These machines and their bill acceptors are designed with advanced anti-cheating and anti-counterfeiting measures and are difficult to defraud. Early computerized slot machines were sometimes defrauded through the use of cheating devices, such as the \"slider\" or \"monkey paw\".  Computerized slot machines are fully deterministic and thus outcomes can be sometimes successfully predicted.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koerner|first1=Brendan|title=Russians Engineer a Brilliant Slot Machine Cheat\u2014And Casinos Have No Fix|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/russians-engineer-brilliant-slot-machine-cheat-casinos-no-fix|accessdate=7 February 2017|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Jackpot errors===\nMalfunctioning electronic slot machines are capable of indicating jackpot winnings far in excess of those advertised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/woman-sues-isle-after-she-s-denied-million-from-slot/article_411d78f2-28a0-5e0a-bc16-73e8c79fc3b7.html|title=Woman sues Isle after she's denied $42 million from slot malfunction|author=Jeff Reinitz|work=Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier}}</ref> Two such cases occurred in casinos in Colorado in 2010, where [[Software bug|software errors]] led to indicated jackpots of $11 million and $42 million.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Analysis of machine records by the state Gaming Commission revealed faults, with the true jackpot being substantially smaller.<ref>[https://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/software/woman-who-thought-she-won-42-million-at-casino-gets-2018 Woman Who Thought She Won $42 Million At Casino Gets $20.18 Instead ''IEEE Spectrum'' 25 May 2010 ]</ref> State gaming laws do not require a casino to honour payouts.\n\n==Legislation==\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the public and private availability of slot machines is [[United States state slot machine ownership regulations|highly regulated by state governments]]. Many states have established [[gaming control board]]s to regulate the possession and use of slot machines and other form of gaming.\n\n[[Nevada]] is the only state that has no significant restrictions against slot machines both for public and private use. In [[New Jersey]], slot machines are only allowed in hotel casinos operated in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Several states ([[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Missouri]]) allow slot machines (as well as any casino-style gambling) only on licensed [[riverboat]]s or permanently anchored [[barge]]s. Since [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Mississippi]] has removed the requirement that casinos on the Gulf Coast operate on barges and now allows them on land along the shoreline. [[Delaware]] allows slot machines at three horse tracks; they are regulated by the [[Delaware Lottery|state lottery]] commission. In Wisconsin, bars and taverns are allowed to have up to five machines. These machines usually allow a player to either take a payout, or gamble it on a double-or-nothing \"side game\". \n\nThe [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|territory]] of [[Puerto Rico]] places significant restrictions on slot machine ownership, but the law is widely flouted and slot machines are common in bars and coffeeshops.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765596778/Illegal-slot-machines-threaten-Puerto-Rico-casinos.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|last=Coto|first=Danica|date=August 13, 2012|title=Illegal slot machines threaten Puerto Rico casinos|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[Native American gaming|tribal casinos]] located on [[Indian reservation|Native American reservations]], slot machines played against the house and operating independently from a [[centralized system|centralized computer system]] are classified as \"Class III\" gaming by the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA), and sometimes promoted as \"Vegas-style\" slot machines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://southfloridareporter.com/10-casinos-you-can-gamble-at-in-south-florida/|title=10 Casinos You Can Gamble at in South Florida|last=SouthFloridaReporter.com|date=2018-09-05|website=South Florida Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> In order to offer Class III gaming, tribes must enter into a [[Tribal-state compacts|compact]] (agreement) with the state that is approved by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], which may contain restrictions on the types and quantity of such games.

In Australia, gaming machines are a matter for state governments, so laws vary between states.\n\nGaming machines are found in casinos (approximately one in each major city), [[pub]]s and clubs in some states (usually sports, social, or [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]] clubs). The first Australian state to legalize this style of gambling was [[New South Wales]], when in 1956 they were made legal in all registered clubs in the state. There are suggestions that the proliferation of poker machines has led to increased levels of [[problem gambling]]; however, the precise nature of this link is still open to research.<ref>[http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/gambling/finalreport/index.html PC.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819030433/http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/gambling/finalreport/index.html |date=2006-08-19 }}, see Chapter 8, Productivity Commission Report no. 10</ref>\n\nIn 1999 the Australian Productivity Commission reported that nearly half Australia's gaming machines were in New South Wales. At the time, 21% of all the gambling machines in the world were operating in Australia and, on a per capita basis, Australia had roughly five times as many gaming machines as the United States. Australia ranks 8th in total number of gaming machines after Japan, U.S.A., Italy, U.K., Spain and Germany. This primarily is because gaming machines have been legal in the state of New South Wales since 1956; over time, the number of machines has grown to 97,103 (at December 2010, including the Australian Capital Territory). By way of comparison, the U.S. State of Nevada, which legalised gaming including slots several decades before N.S.W., had 190,135 slots operating.<ref>{{cite news|title=One pokie for every 110 of us|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/one-pokie-for-every-110-of-us-20100116-mdf3.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|agency=SMH|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nRevenue from gaming machines in pubs and clubs accounts for more than half of the $4 billion in gambling revenue collected by state governments in fiscal year 2002&ndash;03.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[Queensland]], gaming machines in pubs and clubs must provide a return rate of 85%, while machines located in casinos must provide a return rate of 90%.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Most other states have similar provisions. In [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], gaming machines must provide a minimum return rate of 87% (including jackpot contribution), including machines in [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]]. As of December 1, 2007, Victoria banned gaming machines that accepted $100 notes; all gaming machines made since 2003 comply with this rule. This new law also banned machines with an automatic play option. One exception exists in Crown Casino for any player with a VIP loyalty card: they can still insert $100 notes and use an autoplay feature (whereby the machine will automatically play until credit is exhausted or the player intervenes). All gaming machines in Victoria have an information screen accessible to the user by pressing the \"i key\" button, showing the game rules, paytable, return to player percentage, and the top and bottom five combinations with their odds. These combinations are stated to be played on a minimum bet (usually 1 credit per line, with 1 line or reel played, although some newer machines do not have an option to play 1 line; some machines may only allow maximum lines to be played), excluding feature wins.\n\n[[Western Australia]] only permits certain forms of gaming machine in [[Burswood Entertainment Complex|Burswood casino]] and no gaming machines elsewhere. This policy (the most restrictive in Australia) had an extensive political history, reaffirmed by the 1974 Royal Commission into Gambling:<ref>Western Australia, Report of the Royal Commission into Gambling (1974), pp.\u200772\u201373.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Poker machine playing is a mindless, repetitive and insidious form of gambling which has many undesirable features. It requires no thought, no skill or social contact. The odds are never about winning. Watching people playing the machines over long periods of time, the impressionistic evidence at least is that they are addictive to many people. Historically poker machines have been banned from Western Australia and we consider that, in the public interest, they should stay banned.|sign=|source=}}\n\nWhile Western Australian gaming machines are similar to the other states', they do not have spinning reels. Therefore different animations are used in place of the spinning reels in order to display each game result.\n\n[[Nick Xenophon]] was elected on an independent [[No Pokies]] ticket in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] at the [[1997 South Australian state election]] on 2.9 percent, re-elected at the [[2006 South Australian state election|2006 election]] on 20.5 percent, and elected to the [[Australian Senate]] at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] on 14.8 percent. Independent candidate [[Andrew Wilkie]], an anti-pokies campaigner, was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of Denison|Denison]] at the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]]. Wilkie was one of four crossbenchers who supported the [[Julia Gillard|Gillard]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government following the [[hung parliament]] result. Wilkie immediately began forging ties with Xenophon as soon as it was apparent that he was elected. In exchange for Wilkie's support, the Labor government are attempting to implement pre-commitment technology for high-bet/high-intensity poker machines, against opposition from the [[Tony Abbott]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] and Clubs Australia.\n\n=== Russia ===\nIn Russia, \"slot clubs\" appeared quite late, only in 1992. Before 1992, slot machines were only in casinos and small shops, but later slot clubs began appearing all over the country. The most popular and numerous were \"Vulcan 777\" and \"Taj Mahal\". Since 2009 when gambling establishments were banned, almost all slot clubs disappeared and are found only in a specially authorized gambling zones.\n\n===United Kingdom=== <!-- [[Fixed odds betting terminal]] links here. -->\n[[Image:Old fruit machines in Teignmouth 10-08-06.jpg|thumb|right|Row of old fruit machines in Teignmouth Pier, Devon]]\n[[Image:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|right|One armed bandits at [[Wookey Hole Caves]]]]\nSlot machines are covered by the [[Gambling Act 2005]], which superseded the [[Gaming Act 1968]].<ref name=GamingAct>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20052776.htm|title=Gaming Act 2005|year=2005|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nSlot machines in the U.K. are categorised by definitions produced by the [[Gambling Commission]] as part of the Gambling Act of 2005.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As defined by the 2005 Act, large casinos can have a maximum of one hundred and fifty machines in any combination of categories B\u2013D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 5:1); small casinos can have a maximum of eighty machines in any combination of categories B\u2013D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 2:1).\n\n====Category A====\nCategory A games were defined in preparation for the planned \"[[Regional casino|Super Casinos]]\". Despite a lengthy bidding process with [[Manchester]] being chosen as the single planned location, the development was cancelled soon after [[Gordon Brown]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. As a result, there are no lawful Category A games in the U.K.\n\n====Category B====\nCategory B games are divided into subcategories. The differences between B1, B3 and B4 games are mainly the stake and prizes as defined in the above table. Category B2 games &ndash; [[Fixed odds betting terminal]]s (FOBTs) &ndash; have quite different stake and prize rules: FOBTs are mainly found in licensed [[betting shop]]s, or bookmakers, usually in the form of electronic [[roulette]].\n\nThe games are based on a [[random number generation|random number generator]]; thus each game's probability of getting the jackpot is independent of any other game: probabilities are all equal. If a [[pseudorandom number generator]] is used instead of a truly random one, probabilities are not independent since each number is determined at least in part by the one generated before it.\n\n====Category C====\nCategory C games are often referred to as '''fruit machines''', '''one-armed bandits''' and '''AWP''' ([[amusement with prize]]). Fruit machines are commonly found in [[public house|pubs]], [[Nightclub|club]]s, and [[video arcade|arcade]]s. Machines commonly have three but can be found with four or five reels, each with 16\u201324 symbols printed around them. The reels are spun each play, from which the appearance of particular combinations of symbols result in payment of their associated winnings by the machine (or alternatively initiation of a subgame). These games often have many extra features, trails and subgames with opportunities to win money; usually more than can be won from just the payouts on the reel combinations.\n\nFruit machines in the U.K. almost universally have the following features, generally selected at random using a [[pseudorandom number generator]]:\n* A player (known in the industry as a ''punter'') may be given the opportunity to ''hold'' one or more reels before spinning, meaning they will not be spun but instead retain their displayed symbols yet otherwise count normally for that play. This can sometimes increase the chance of winning, especially if two or more reels are held.\n* A player may also be given a number of ''nudges'' following a spin (or, in some machines, as a result in a subgame). A nudge is a step rotation of a reel chosen by the player (the machine may not allow all reels to be nudged for a particular play).\n* ''Cheats'' can also be made available on the Internet or through emailed newsletters to subscribers. These cheats give the player the impression of an advantage, whereas in reality the payout percentage remains exactly the same. The most widely used cheat is known as '''hold after a nudge''' and increases the chance that the player will win following an unsuccessful nudge. The cheats give the player an incentive to play the latest games.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In reality, whilst machines from the early 1990s did not advertise the concept of '''hold after a nudge''' when this feature was first introduced, it became so well-known amongst players and widespread amongst new machine releases that it is now well-advertised on the machine during play. This is characterized by messages on the display such as ''DON'T HOLD ANY'' or ''LET 'EM SPIN'' and is a designed feature of the machine, not a cheat at all.\n\nIt is known for machines to pay out multiple jackpots, one after the other (this is known as a '''streak''' or '''rave''') but each jackpot requires a new game to be played so as not to violate the law about the maximum payout on a single play. Typically this involves the player only pressing the Start button for which a single credit is taken, regardless of whether this causes the reels to spin or not. The minimum payout percentage is 70%, with pubs often setting the payout at around 78%.\n\n===Japan===\n{{See|Pachinko}}\n\n[[Japan]]ese slot machines, known as {{nihongo|'''pachisuro'''|[[:ja:\u30d1\u30c1\u30b9\u30ed|\u30d1\u30c1\u30b9\u30ed]]}} or '''pachislot''' ([[portmanteau]]s of the words \"pachinko\" and \"slot machine\"), are a descendant of the traditional Japanese [[pachinko]] game. Slot machines are a fairly new phenomenon and they can be found mostly in pachinko parlors and the adult sections of [[Video arcade|amusement arcade]]s, known as game centers.\n\nThe machines are regulated with [[integrated circuit]]s, and have six different levels changing the odds of a [[777 (number)#Gambling and luck|777]]. The levels provide a rough outcome of between 90% to 160% (200% for skilled players). Japanese slot machines are \"beatable\". Parlor operators naturally set most machines to simply collect money, but intentionally place a few paying machines on the floor so that there will be at least someone winning,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} encouraging players on the losing machines to keep gambling, using the psychology of the [[gambler's fallacy]].\n\nDespite the many varieties of pachislot machines, there are certain rules and regulations put forward by the {{nihongo|Security Electronics and Communication Technology Association|[[:ja:\u4fdd\u5b89\u96fb\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5354\u4f1a|\u4fdd\u5b89\u96fb\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5354\u4f1a]]}}, an affiliate of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]]. For example, there must be three reels. All reels must be accompanied by buttons which allow players to manually stop them, reels may not spin faster than 80 RPM, and reels must stop within 0.19 seconds of a button press. In practice, this means that machines cannot let reels slip more than 4 symbols. Other rules include a 15 coin payout cap, a 50 credit cap on machines, a 3 coin maximum bet, and other such regulations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nAlthough a 15 coin payout may seem quite low, regulations allow \"Big Bonus\" (c. 400\u2013711 coins) and \"Regular Bonus\" modes (c. 110 coins) where these 15 coin payouts occur nearly continuously until the bonus mode is finished. While the machine is in bonus mode,  the player is entertained with special winning scenes on the LCD display, and energizing music is heard, payout after payout.\n\nThree other unique features of Pachisuro machines are \"stock\", \"renchan\", and {{Nihongo|''tenj\u014d''|\u5929\u4e95}}. On many machines, when enough money to afford a bonus is taken in, the bonus is not immediately awarded. Typically the game merely stops making the reels slip off the bonus symbols for a few games. If the player fails to hit the bonus during these \"standby games\", it is added to the \"stock\" for later collection. Many current games, after finishing a bonus round, set the probability to release additional stock (gained from earlier players failing to get a bonus last time the machine stopped making the reels slip for a bit) very high for the first few games. As a result, a lucky player may get to play several bonus rounds in a row (a \"renchan\"), making payouts of 5,000 or even 10,000 coins possible. The lure of \"stock\" waiting in the machine, and the possibility of \"renchan\" tease the gambler to keep feeding the machine. To tease them further, there is a ''tenj\u014d'' (ceiling), a maximum limit on the number of games between \"stock\" release. For example, if the ''tenj\u014d'' is 1,500, and the number of games played since the last bonus is 1,490, the player is guaranteed to release a bonus within just 10 games.\n\nBecause of the \"stock\", \"renchan\", and ''tenj\u014d'' systems, it is possible to make money by simply playing machines on which someone has just lost a huge amount of money. This is called being a \"[[hyena]]\". They are easy to recognize, roaming the aisles for a \"kamo\" (\"[[Gullibility|sucker]]\" in English) to leave his machine.\n\nIn short, the regulations allowing \"stock\", \"renchan\", and ''tenj\u014d'' transformed the pachisuro from a low-stakes form of entertainment just a few years back to hardcore gambling. [[Problem gambling|Many people may be gambling more than they can afford]], and the big payouts also lure unsavory \"hyena\" types into the gambling halls.\n\nTo address these social issues, a new regulation (Version 5.0) was adopted in 2006 which caps the maximum amount of \"stock\" a machine can hold to around 2,000\u20133,000 coins' worth of bonus games. Moreover, all pachisuro machines must be re-evaluated for regulation compliance every three years. Version 4.0 came out in 2004, so that means all those machines with the up to 10,000 coin payouts will be removed from service by 2007.\n\n==Problem gambling and slot machines==\nNatasha Dow Sch\u00fcll, associate professor in [[New York University]]'s Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, uses the term \"machine zone\" to describe the state of immersion that users of slot machines experience during gambling, in which they lose a sense of time, space, bodily awareness, and monetary value.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sch\u00fcll|first=Natasha|title=Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas|location=Princeton, N.J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-69-116088-7|oclc=866583433}}</ref>\n\nMike Dixon, PhD, professor of psychology at the [[University of Waterloo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/mike-j-dixon|title=Mike J.

Horse Head Bonus Antique Slot Machine.jpg|thumb|Mills Novelty Co. Horse Head Bonus antique slot machine]]\n\n==Skill stops==\nSkill stop buttons predated the Bally electromechanical slot machines of the 1960s and 70s. They appeared on mechanical slot machines manufactured by Mills Novelty Co. as early as the mid 1920s. These machines had modified reel-stop arms, which allowed them to be released from the timing bar, earlier than in a normal play, simply by pressing the buttons on the front of the machine, located between each reel.\n\n\"Skill stop\" buttons were added to some slot machines by Zacharias Anthony in the early 1970s. These enabled the player to stop each reel, allowing a degree of \"skill\" so as to satisfy the [[New Jersey]] gaming laws of the day which required that players were able to control the game in some way. The original conversion was applied to approximately 50 late-model Bally slot machines. Because the typical machine stopped the reels automatically in less than 10 seconds, weights were added to the mechanical timers to prolong the automatic stopping of the reels. By the time the New Jersey Alcoholic Beverages Commission (ABC) had approved the conversion for use in New Jersey arcades, the word was out and every other distributor began adding skill stops. The machines were a huge hit on the [[Jersey Shore]] and the remaining unconverted Bally machines were destroyed as they had become instantly obsolete.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Casino]]\n*[[EUROMAT|European Gaming & Amusement Federation]]\n*[[List of probability topics]]\n*[[Pachinko]]\n*[[Problem gambling]]\n*[[Progressive jackpot]]\n*[[Quiz machine]]\n*[[United States state slot machine ownership regulations]]\n*[[Video bingo]]\n*[[Video Lottery Terminal]]\n*[[Video poker]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Brisman, Andrew.

It contains provisions that are part of sexual code promoting procreative sexuality that is interpreted to prohibit same-sex intercourse as sinful. Ancient commentary on this passage suggests that those engaging in [[sodomy]] could be killed without permission from [[dastur|a high priest]]. However, a strong homosexual tradition in Iran is attested to by Greek historians from the 5th century onward, and so the prohibition apparently had little effect on Iranian attitudes or sexual behavior outside the ranks of devout Zoroastrians in rural eastern Iran.<ref name=ZoroTenents>{{cite web |author1=Ervad Behramshah Hormusji Bharda |title=The Importance of Vendidad in the Zarathushti Religion |url=http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/vndimp33.html|website=tenets.zoroastrianism.com |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |date=1990}}</ref><ref name=Frashogard>{{cite web |author1=Ervad Marzban Hathiram |title=Significance and Philosophy of the Vendidad |url=http://www.frashogard.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/the-vendidad-part-3.pdf |website=frashogard.com |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name=HI>{{cite web|title=Ranghaya, Sixteenth Vendidad Nation & Western Aryan Lands|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/ranghaya/index.htm|website=heritageinstitute.com|publisher=Heritage Institute |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Mercury Biography\">{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Lesley-Ann |title=Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography: The Definitive Biography |publisher=Hachette UK, 2011 |isbn=9781444733709 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VJOPWGEUEZ4C&pg=PT28 |accessdate=3 January 2015|date=2011-10-13 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sacred Books of the East\">{{cite book |last1=Darmesteter |first1=James |title=Sacred Books of the East |date=1898 |location=Vd 8:32 |edition=American |url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd8sbe.htm |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |quote=(...) Ahura Mazda answered: 'The man that lies with mankind as man lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is the man that is a Daeva; this one is the man that is a worshipper of the Daevas, that is a male paramour of the Daevas, that is a female paramour of the Daevas, that is a wife to the Daeva; this is the man that is as bad as a Daeva, that is in his whole being a Daeva; this is the man that is a Daeva before he dies, and becomes one of the unseen Daevas after death: so is he, whether he has lain with mankind as mankind, or as womankind.

All sexual activities that occur outside a traditional, heterosexual marriage (i.e., sodomy or adultery) are illegal. Same-sex sexual activities that occur between consenting adults are criminalized and carry a maximum punishment of death\u2014though not generally implemented. Rape, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, often results in execution, but is related to adultery and sodomy in Iran's penal code rather than being classified as \"sexual assault\". The death penalty is legal for those above 18, and if a murder was committed, legal at the age of 15. Approved by the Parliament on July 30, 1991, and finally ratified by the Guardian Council on November 28, 1991, articles 108 through 140 distinctly deal with same-sex sexual activities and their punishments in detail.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Male same-sex sexual activity ===\nAccording to Articles 108 to 113, [[sodomy]] (''lav\u0101t'') can in certain circumstances be a crime for which both partners can be punished by death. If the participants are adults, of sound mind and consenting, the method of execution is for the judge to decide. If one person is non-consenting (i.e., rape), the punishment would only apply to the rapist. A non-adult who engages in consensual sodomy is subject to a punishment of 74 lashes. Articles 114 to 119 assert that sodomy is proved either if a person confesses four times to having committed sodomy or by the testimony of four righteous men. Testimony of women alone or together with a man does not prove sodomy. According to Articles 125 and 126, if sodomy, or any lesser crime referred to above, is proved by confession and the person concerned repents, the judge may request that he be pardoned. If a person who has committed the lesser crimes referred to above repents before the giving of testimony by the witnesses, the punishment is quashed. The judge may punish the person for lesser crimes at his discretion.\n\n=== Female same-sex sexual activity ===\nAccording to Articles 127, 129, and 130, the punishment for female same-sex sexual activity (''mos\u0101heqe'') involving persons who are mature, of sound mind and consenting, is 50 lashes.  If the act is repeated three times and punishment is enforced each time, the death sentence will apply on the fourth occasion.  Article 128 asserts that the ways of proving female same-sex sexual activity in court are the same as for sodomy.  Article 130 says that both Muslims and non-Muslims are subject to the punishment.  According to Articles 132 and 133, the rules for the quashing of sentences, or for pardoning, are the same as for the lesser male homosexual offenses.  According to Article 134, women who \"stand naked under one cover without necessity\" and are not relatives may receive a punishment of 50 lashes.\n\nAt the discretion of the Iranian court, fines, prison sentences, and corporal punishment are usually carried out rather than the death penalty, unless the crime was a rape.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe charges of same-sex sexual activity have in a few occasions been used in political crimes. Other charges had been paired with the sodomy crime, such as rape or acts against the state, and convictions are obtained in grossly flawed trials. On March 14, 1994, famous dissident writer [[Ali Akbar Saidi Sirjani]] was charged with offenses ranging from drug dealing to espionage to homosexual activity. He died in prison under disputed circumstances.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/28/world/leading-dissident-writer-in-iran-dies-after-8-months-in-detention.html |title=Leading Dissident Writer in Iran Dies After 8 Months in Detention |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 1994 |accessdate=August 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Capital punishment ===\n[[Image:Iran.StopKillingGays.WDC.19jul06.jpg|thumb|A protester of the killing of homosexual people in Iran.

Ten to fifteen percent of executions in Iran are for rape. The rape victim may settle the case by accepting compensation (''jirat'') in exchange for withdrawing the charges or forgiving the rapist.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} This is similar to ''diyya'', but equal to a woman's dowry. A woman can also receive ''diyya'' for injuries sustained. Normally, the rapist still faces tazir penalties, such as 100 lashes and jail time for immoral acts, and often faces further penalties for other crimes committed alongside the rape, such as kidnapping, assault, and disruption of public order.\n\nOn July 19, 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni]] two teenagers from the province of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] were convicted by the court of having raped a 13-year-old boy were publicly hanged.

The law does not distinguish between consensual and nonconsensual same sex intercourse, and NGOs reported this lack of clarity led to both the victim and the perpetrator being held criminally liable under the law in cases of assault. The law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \nSecurity forces harassed, arrested, and detained individuals they suspected of being gay or transgender. In some cases security forces raided houses and monitored internet sites for information on LGBTI persons. Those accused of \u201csodomy\u201d often faced summary trials, and evidentiary standards were not always met. Punishment for same-sex sexual activity between men was more severe than between women. \nAccording to international and local media reports, on April 13 at least 30 men suspected of homosexual conduct were arrested by IRGC agents at a private party in Isfahan Province. The agents reportedly fired weapons and used electric Tasers during the raid. According to the Canadian-based nonprofit organization Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees, those arrested were taken to Dastgerd Prison in Isfahan, where they were led to the prison yard and told they would be executed. The Iranian LGBTI activist group 6Rang noted that, following similar raids, those arrested and similarly charged were subjected to forced \u201canal\u201d or \u201csodomy\u201d tests and other degrading treatment and sexual insults.\n\nThe government censored all materials related to LGBTI issues. Authorities particularly blocked websites or content within sites that discussed LGBTI issues, including the censorship of Wikipedia pages defining LGBTI and other related topics. There were active, unregistered LGBTI NGOs in the country. Hate crime laws or other criminal justice mechanisms did not exist to aid in the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes.\n\nThe law requires all male citizens over age 18 to serve in the military but exempts gay and transgender women, who are classified as having mental disorders. New military identity cards listed the subsection of the law dictating the exemption.\n\nAccording to 6Rang this practice identified the men as gay or transgender and put them at risk of physical abuse and discrimination.\nThe government provided transgender persons financial assistance in the form of grants of up to 45 million rials $1,240 and loans up to 55 million rials $1,500 to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Additionally, the Ministry of Cooperatives, Labor, and Social Welfare required health insurers to cover the cost of such surgery. Individuals who undergo gender reassignment surgery may petition a court for new identity documents with corrected gender data, which the government reportedly provided efficiently and transparently. NGOs reported that authorities pressured LGBTI persons to undergo gender reassignment surgery.<ref name=\"IRAN 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277485.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420184105/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277485.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-04-20|title=IRAN 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Summary table ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 400px;\" | Right\n!

Ancient commentary on this passage suggests that those engaging in [[sodomy]] could be killed without permission from [[dastur|a high priest]].

All sexual activities that occur outside a traditional, heterosexual marriage (i.e., sodomy or adultery) are illegal. Same-sex sexual activities that occur between consenting adults are criminalized and carry a maximum punishment of death\u2014though not generally implemented. Rape, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, often results in execution, but is related to adultery and sodomy in Iran's penal code rather than being classified as \"sexual assault\". The death penalty is legal for those above 18, and if a murder was committed, legal at the age of 15. Approved by the Parliament on July 30, 1991, and finally ratified by the Guardian Council on November 28, 1991, articles 108 through 140 distinctly deal with same-sex sexual activities and their punishments in detail.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Male same-sex sexual activity ===\nAccording to Articles 108 to 113, [[sodomy]] (''lav\u0101t'') can in certain circumstances be a crime for which both partners can be punished by death. If the participants are adults, of sound mind and consenting, the method of execution is for the judge to decide. If one person is non-consenting (i.e., rape), the punishment would only apply to the rapist. A non-adult who engages in consensual sodomy is subject to a punishment of 74 lashes. Articles 114 to 119 assert that sodomy is proved either if a person confesses four times to having committed sodomy or by the testimony of four righteous men. Testimony of women alone or together with a man does not prove sodomy. According to Articles 125 and 126, if sodomy, or any lesser crime referred to above, is proved by confession and the person concerned repents, the judge may request that he be pardoned. If a person who has committed the lesser crimes referred to above repents before the giving of testimony by the witnesses, the punishment is quashed. The judge may punish the person for lesser crimes at his discretion.\n\n=== Female same-sex sexual activity ===\nAccording to Articles 127, 129, and 130, the punishment for female same-sex sexual activity (''mos\u0101heqe'') involving persons who are mature, of sound mind and consenting, is 50 lashes.  If the act is repeated three times and punishment is enforced each time, the death sentence will apply on the fourth occasion.  Article 128 asserts that the ways of proving female same-sex sexual activity in court are the same as for sodomy.  Article 130 says that both Muslims and non-Muslims are subject to the punishment.  According to Articles 132 and 133, the rules for the quashing of sentences, or for pardoning, are the same as for the lesser male homosexual offenses.  According to Article 134, women who \"stand naked under one cover without necessity\" and are not relatives may receive a punishment of 50 lashes.\n\nAt the discretion of the Iranian court, fines, prison sentences, and corporal punishment are usually carried out rather than the death penalty, unless the crime was a rape.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe charges of same-sex sexual activity have in a few occasions been used in political crimes. Other charges had been paired with the sodomy crime, such as rape or acts against the state, and convictions are obtained in grossly flawed trials. On March 14, 1994, famous dissident writer [[Ali Akbar Saidi Sirjani]] was charged with offenses ranging from drug dealing to espionage to homosexual activity.

The law does not distinguish between consensual and nonconsensual same sex intercourse, and NGOs reported this lack of clarity led to both the victim and the perpetrator being held criminally liable under the law in cases of assault. The law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \nSecurity forces harassed, arrested, and detained individuals they suspected of being gay or transgender. In some cases security forces raided houses and monitored internet sites for information on LGBTI persons. Those accused of \u201csodomy\u201d often faced summary trials, and evidentiary standards were not always met. Punishment for same-sex sexual activity between men was more severe than between women. \nAccording to international and local media reports, on April 13 at least 30 men suspected of homosexual conduct were arrested by IRGC agents at a private party in Isfahan Province. The agents reportedly fired weapons and used electric Tasers during the raid. According to the Canadian-based nonprofit organization Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees, those arrested were taken to Dastgerd Prison in Isfahan, where they were led to the prison yard and told they would be executed. The Iranian LGBTI activist group 6Rang noted that, following similar raids, those arrested and similarly charged were subjected to forced \u201canal\u201d or \u201csodomy\u201d tests and other degrading treatment and sexual insults.\n\nThe government censored all materials related to LGBTI issues. Authorities particularly blocked websites or content within sites that discussed LGBTI issues, including the censorship of Wikipedia pages defining LGBTI and other related topics. There were active, unregistered LGBTI NGOs in the country. Hate crime laws or other criminal justice mechanisms did not exist to aid in the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes.\n\nThe law requires all male citizens over age 18 to serve in the military but exempts gay and transgender women, who are classified as having mental disorders. New military identity cards listed the subsection of the law dictating the exemption.\n\nAccording to 6Rang this practice identified the men as gay or transgender and put them at risk of physical abuse and discrimination.\nThe government provided transgender persons financial assistance in the form of grants of up to 45 million rials $1,240 and loans up to 55 million rials $1,500 to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Additionally, the Ministry of Cooperatives, Labor, and Social Welfare required health insurers to cover the cost of such surgery. Individuals who undergo gender reassignment surgery may petition a court for new identity documents with corrected gender data, which the government reportedly provided efficiently and transparently. NGOs reported that authorities pressured LGBTI persons to undergo gender reassignment surgery.<ref name=\"IRAN 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277485.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420184105/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277485.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-04-20|title=IRAN 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Summary table ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 400px;\" | Right\n!
