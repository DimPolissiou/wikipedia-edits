It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nAccording to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nAccording to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

However, Defries succeeded in forcing Mercury to terminate his contract in May after threatening to deliver a low-quality album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=605\u2013606}} Defries was then able to pay off Bowie's debts to Mercury through Gem Productions; Mercury then surrendered their copyright on ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969) and ''The Man Who Sold the World'' (1970).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} After ending the contract with Mercury, Defries presented the album to multiple labels in the US.

By 1994, the ground forces had over 50,000 troops, most being former soldiers of the [[Soviet Army]]'s [[Belorussian Military District]]. The army equipment which was used at the time included 79 [[T-54]]s, 639 [[T-55]]s, 291 [[T-62]]s, 299 [[T-64]]s, 8 [[T-80]]s, and 1,800 [[T-72]]s. In December of 2001, the Ground Forces underwent a major reorganization which produced two operational-territorial commands which are similar to Russia's [[military district]]s. The two commands that were formed from this reorganization were the [[Western Operational Command (Belarus)|Western Operational Command]] at [[Grodno]], and the [[North Western Operational Command]], at [[Barysaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldat.ru/force/belarus/spravki.html|title=\u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0431\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0412\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0421\u0438\u043b \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c|website=www.soldat.ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/belarus/army.htm|title=Ground Forces - Belarus|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n=== Headquarters ([[Minsk]]) ===\n* Headquarters of the Armed Forces \n* [[Central Band of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus|Exemplary Military Band]]\n* [[Honor Guard of the Armed Forces of Belarus]]\n* 465th Missile Brigade\n* 336th Missile Artillery Brigade\n* 51st Guards Mixed Artillery Group\n* 188th Engineer Brigade \n* 52nd Specialized Search Battalion  \n* Cynological Center of the Armed Forces\n\n=== [[Western Operational Command (Belarus)|Western Operational Command]] ===\n* [[6th Guards Mechanised Brigade|6th Mechanised Brigade]]\n* [[11th Guards Berlin-Carpathian Mechanized Brigade|11th Mechanised Brigade]]\n* 111th Artillery Brigade\n* 1199th Mixed Artillery Regiment \n* 557th Engineering Brigade  \n* 74th Separate Communications Regiment \n* 815th Maintenance Center \n* 108th Material Support Brigade \n\n=== [[North Western Operational Command]] ===\n* [[120th Guards Mechanised Brigade|120th Mechanised Brigade]]\n* [[19th Guards Mechanized Brigade (Belarus)|19th Guards Mechanized Brigade]]\n* 103rd Mobile Brigade\n* 38th Mobile Brigade\n* [[5th Spetsnaz Brigade]]\n* [[22nd Rocket Brigade]] (until 2005)\n* [[51st Guards Artillery Brigade (Belarus)|51st Guards Artillery Brigade]]\n* [[72nd Guards Joint Training Centre]]\n\n== Specialized forces ==\nThe specialized forces are designed to support the combat activities of the Ground Forces and solve their inherent tasks.

Many representatives of the chemical troops participating in the war were awarded military orders and medals. In the course of eliminating the consequences of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], given the training and technical equipment of the chemical forces, they were assigned some of the most difficult work. The Department of Chemical Forces was created on 1 June 1992 on the basis of the disbanded Directorate of the Belarusian Military District and was included in the General Staff of the Armed Forces. On 21 December 2001, in connection with the creation of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus, the department of chemical forces of the Main Headquarters of the Armed Forces was reorganized and included in it as a department of the Republican Chemical Chemistry for Protection and Ecology of the General Staff of the Armed Forces.<ref>https://www.mil.by/ru/forces/special/rhbz/</ref>\n\n== Equipment ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Model\n! style=\"width:0%;\"|Picture\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Country of Origin\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Type\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Number in service\n! style=\"width:40%;\"|Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" | Tanks\n|-\n| [[T-72]]\n| [[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e \u0414\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0412\u041e (10).jpg|150px]]\n| {{USSR}}\n| [[Main Battle Tank]]\n| 532 (inc T-72B3)<ref>IISS Military Balance 2018, 185.</ref>\n| Mainly T-72B version.

of Belarus]]. It is considered to be the seniormost and notable service branch in the armed forces. The current commander-in-chief of the ground forces is Major General Alexander Nikitin.\n\n== History ==\nThe ground forces were founded on March 20, 1992, on the same day the [[Defence Ministry of Belarus]] was established. By 1994, the ground forces had over 50,000 troops, most being former soldiers of the [[Soviet Army]]'s [[Belorussian Military District]]. The army equipment which was used at the time included 79 [[T-54]]s, 639 [[T-55]]s, 291 [[T-62]]s, 299 [[T-64]]s, 8 [[T-80]]s, and 1,800 [[T-72]]s. In December of 2001, the Ground Forces underwent a major reorganization which produced two operational-territorial commands which are similar to Russia's [[military district]]s. The two commands that were formed from this reorganization were the [[Western Operational Command (Belarus)|Western Operational Command]] at [[Grodno]], and the [[North Western Operational Command]], at [[Barysaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldat.ru/force/belarus/spravki.html|title=\u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0431\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0412\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0421\u0438\u043b \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c|website=www.soldat.ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/belarus/army.htm|title=Ground Forces - Belarus|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n=== Headquarters ([[Minsk]]) ===\n* Headquarters of the Armed Forces \n* [[Central Band of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus|Exemplary Military Band]]\n* [[Honor Guard of the Armed Forces of Belarus]]\n* 465th Missile Brigade\n* 336th Missile Artillery Brigade\n* 51st Guards Mixed Artillery Group\n* 188th Engineer Brigade \n* 52nd Specialized Search Battalion  \n* Cynological Center of the Armed Forces\n\n=== [[Western Operational Command (Belarus)|Western Operational Command]] ===\n* [[6th Guards Mechanised Brigade|6th Mechanised Brigade]]\n* [[11th Guards Berlin-Carpathian Mechanized Brigade|11th Mechanised Brigade]]\n* 111th Artillery Brigade\n* 1199th Mixed Artillery Regiment \n* 557th Engineering Brigade  \n* 74th Separate Communications Regiment \n* 815th Maintenance Center \n* 108th Material Support Brigade \n\n=== [[North Western Operational Command]] ===\n* [[120th Guards Mechanised Brigade|120th Mechanised Brigade]]\n* [[19th Guards Mechanized Brigade (Belarus)|19th Guards Mechanized Brigade]]\n* 103rd Mobile Brigade\n* 38th Mobile Brigade\n* [[5th Spetsnaz Brigade]]\n* [[22nd Rocket Brigade]] (until 2005)\n* [[51st Guards Artillery Brigade (Belarus)|51st Guards Artillery Brigade]]\n* [[72nd Guards Joint Training Centre]]\n\n== Specialized forces ==\nThe specialized forces are designed to support the combat activities of the Ground Forces and solve their inherent tasks.

Many representatives of the chemical troops participating in the war were awarded military orders and medals. In the course of eliminating the consequences of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], given the training and technical equipment of the chemical forces, they were assigned some of the most difficult work. The Department of Chemical Forces was created on 1 June 1992 on the basis of the disbanded Directorate of the Belarusian Military District and was included in the General Staff of the Armed Forces. On 21 December 2001, in connection with the creation of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus, the department of chemical forces of the Main Headquarters of the Armed Forces was reorganized and included in it as a department of the Republican Chemical Chemistry for Protection and Ecology of the General Staff of the Armed Forces.<ref>https://www.mil.by/ru/forces/special/rhbz/</ref>\n\n== Equipment ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Model\n! style=\"width:0%;\"|Picture\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Country of Origin\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Type\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Number in service\n! style=\"width:40%;\"|Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" | Tanks\n|-\n| [[T-72]]\n| [[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e \u0414\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0412\u041e (10).jpg|150px]]\n| {{USSR}}\n| [[Main Battle Tank]]\n| 532 (inc T-72B3)<ref>IISS Military Balance 2018, 185.</ref>\n| Mainly T-72B version.

Resupply missions typically use the Russian [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] spacecraft, European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]s, Japanese [[Kounotori (spacecraft)|Kounotori]] vehicles, and the American [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] and [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft. The primary docking system for Progress spacecraft is the automated [[Kurs (docking system)|Kurs]] system, with the manual [[TORU]] system as a backup. ATVs also use Kurs, however they are not equipped with TORU. Progress and ATV can remain docked for up to six months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/ATV/SEMBW0PR4CF_0.html |title=ESA;\u2014 ATV;\u2014 Crew role in mission control|publisher=Esa.int|date=2011-03-02|accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA4ZJ0VMOC_iss_0.html|title=ESA&nbsp;\u2014 Human Spaceflight and Exploration;\u2014 International Space Station;\u2014 Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)|publisher=Esa.int|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> The other spacecraft \u2014 the Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]], the [[SpaceX Dragon]] and the Northrop Grumman<ref>https://spacenews.com/acquisition-of-orbital-atk-approved-company-renamed-northrop-grumman-innovation-systems/</ref> [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] \u2014 rendezvous with the station before being grappled using [[Canadarm2]] and berthed at the [[nadir]] port of the [[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]] or [[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]] module for one to two months. As of April 2020, [[List of Progress flights|Progress spacecraft]] have flown most of the uncrewed missions to the ISS.\n\n==Spaceports==\n\n===Baikonur Cosmodrome===\n[[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan is the oldest and busiest spaceport. The first module of the ISS was launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81]] as the uncrewed spacecraft [[Zarya]] in 1998 and flew uncrewed for about two years before the first crew arrived. The Progress spacecraft is the most frequent cargo ship sent from Baikonur to the station, bringing supplies such as food, fuel, gas, experiments, and parts. Its light payload is offset by its ability to deliver critical replacement parts at short notice. Fresh fruit and vegetables from the earth are an important part of the crew's diet.\n\n===Tanegashima Space Center===\n[[File:H-IIB F2 launching HTV2.jpg|thumb|left|A Kounotori departing Tanegashima Space Center bound for the International Space Station.]]\n\nLocated in Japan on an island {{convert|115|km}} south of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, the [[Tanegashima Space Center]] (TCS) is the launch site for H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), called {{nihongo3|[[Oriental Stork]] or [[White Stork]]|\u3053\u3046\u306e\u3068\u308a|'''Kounotori'''}}, used to resupply the [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kib\u014d'' Japanese Experiment Module]] (JEM) and the ISS. The name ''Kounotori'' was chosen for the HTV by JAXA because \"a white stork carries an image of conveying an important thing (a baby, happiness, and other joyful things), therefore, it precisely expresses the HTV's mission to transport essential materials to the ISS\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/11/20101111_kounotori_e.html |title=\"KOUNOTORI\" Chosen as Nickname of the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) |publisher=JAXA |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhite Kounotori can carry {{convert|6000|kg}} of cargo in total, about {{convert|3500|-|4500|kg}} of which is accessible by the crew in the pressurized section, the remainder is unpressurised cargo on Exposed Pallet to be handled by the ISS's robotic arm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/htv/overview/|title=HTV Overview|publisher=JAXA|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Centre Spatial Guyanais===\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) uses the [[Guiana Space Centre]] or, more commonly, Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG). It is a French spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana. Operational since 1968, it is particularly suitable as a location for a spaceport due to its proximity to the equator, and that launches are in a favorable direction over water. The near-equatorial launch location provides an advantage for launches to low-inclination (or geostationary) Earth orbits compared to launches from spaceports at higher latitude, the eastward boost provided by the Earth's rotation is about {{convert|463|m/s}} (1,035 miles per hour) at this spaceport.\n\nThe ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle weighs {{convert|20.7|tonnes|kg}} at launch and has a cargo capacity of {{convert|8|tonnes|kg}} ({{convert|1500|to|5500|kg}} of dry cargo, up to {{convert|1000|kg}} of water, nitrogen, oxygen, air), with up to two gases per flight, and up to {{convert|4700|kg}} of propellant for the re-boost and refueling the station.\n\n===Cape Canaveral===\n[[File:CRS-15 Mission (41281637670).jpg|thumb|left|A [[SpaceX Dragon]] cargo launch to [[ISS]] aboard a [[Falcon 9]].]]\n[[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], located in [[Florida]], United States, has been operational since 1950; with its first orbital launch occurring in 1958. All of NASA's crewed [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] missions were launched from the Cape, along with some of the earlier [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions. Cape Canaveral is adjacent to the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Kennedy Space Center]], where the majority of Apollo missions and all the [[Space Shuttle]] missions were launched from. Under contract with NASA, [[SpaceX]] launches the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon spacecraft]] to resupply the American portion of the ISS. The Dragon can transport {{convert|6000|kg}} of pressurized and unpressurized cargo and can return {{convert|3000|kg}} to Earth. It is the only uncrewed resupply vehicle capable of returning a payload.\n\n===Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport===\nThe [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]], located at [[Wallops Island]], Virginia, United States, is the launch site for the [[Northrop Grumman]] [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft for resupplying the American portion of the ISS.\n\n==Current and completed spaceflights==\nThis is a list of uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station. ''Assembly flights are indicated in '''bold text'''''.\n\n''Note'': Russia has delivered cargo via the uncrewed missions of [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] since the launch of the ISS, while the U.S. had used Space Shuttles for hybrid human/cargo missions, resulting in a greater number of Russian uncrewed flights to the ISS.

Resupply missions typically use the Russian [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] spacecraft, European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]s, Japanese [[Kounotori (spacecraft)|Kounotori]] vehicles, and the American [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] and [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft. The primary docking system for Progress spacecraft is the automated [[Kurs (docking system)|Kurs]] system, with the manual [[TORU]] system as a backup. ATVs also use Kurs, however they are not equipped with TORU. Progress and ATV can remain docked for up to six months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/ATV/SEMBW0PR4CF_0.html |title=ESA;\u2014 ATV;\u2014 Crew role in mission control|publisher=Esa.int|date=2011-03-02|accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA4ZJ0VMOC_iss_0.html|title=ESA&nbsp;\u2014 Human Spaceflight and Exploration;\u2014 International Space Station;\u2014 Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)|publisher=Esa.int|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> The other spacecraft \u2014 the Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]], the [[SpaceX Dragon]] and the Northrop Grumman<ref>https://spacenews.com/acquisition-of-orbital-atk-approved-company-renamed-northrop-grumman-innovation-systems/</ref> [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] \u2014 rendezvous with the station before being grappled using [[Canadarm2]] and berthed at the [[nadir]] port of the [[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]] or [[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]] module for one to two months. As of April 2020, [[List of Progress flights|Progress spacecraft]] have flown most of the uncrewed missions to the ISS.\n\n==Spaceports==\n\n===Baikonur Cosmodrome===\n[[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan is the oldest and busiest spaceport. The first module of the ISS was launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81]] as the uncrewed spacecraft [[Zarya]] in 1998 and flew uncrewed for about two years before the first crew arrived. The Progress spacecraft is the most frequent cargo ship sent from Baikonur to the station, bringing supplies such as food, fuel, gas, experiments, and parts. Its light payload is offset by its ability to deliver critical replacement parts at short notice. Fresh fruit and vegetables from the earth are an important part of the crew's diet.\n\n===Tanegashima Space Center===\n[[File:H-IIB F2 launching HTV2.jpg|thumb|left|A Kounotori departing Tanegashima Space Center bound for the International Space Station.]]\n\nLocated in Japan on an island {{convert|115|km}} south of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, the [[Tanegashima Space Center]] (TCS) is the launch site for H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), called {{nihongo3|[[Oriental Stork]] or [[White Stork]]|\u3053\u3046\u306e\u3068\u308a|'''Kounotori'''}}, used to resupply the [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kib\u014d'' Japanese Experiment Module]] (JEM) and the ISS. The name ''Kounotori'' was chosen for the HTV by JAXA because \"a white stork carries an image of conveying an important thing (a baby, happiness, and other joyful things), therefore, it precisely expresses the HTV's mission to transport essential materials to the ISS\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/11/20101111_kounotori_e.html |title=\"KOUNOTORI\" Chosen as Nickname of the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) |publisher=JAXA |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhite Kounotori can carry {{convert|6000|kg}} of cargo in total, about {{convert|3500|-|4500|kg}} of which is accessible by the crew in the pressurized section, the remainder is unpressurised cargo on Exposed Pallet to be handled by the ISS's robotic arm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/htv/overview/|title=HTV Overview|publisher=JAXA|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Centre Spatial Guyanais===\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) uses the [[Guiana Space Centre]] or, more commonly, Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG). It is a French spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana. Operational since 1968, it is particularly suitable as a location for a spaceport due to its proximity to the equator, and that launches are in a favorable direction over water. The near-equatorial launch location provides an advantage for launches to low-inclination (or geostationary) Earth orbits compared to launches from spaceports at higher latitude, the eastward boost provided by the Earth's rotation is about {{convert|463|m/s}} (1,035 miles per hour) at this spaceport.\n\nThe ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle weighs {{convert|20.7|tonnes|kg}} at launch and has a cargo capacity of {{convert|8|tonnes|kg}} ({{convert|1500|to|5500|kg}} of dry cargo, up to {{convert|1000|kg}} of water, nitrogen, oxygen, air), with up to two gases per flight, and up to {{convert|4700|kg}} of propellant for the re-boost and refueling the station.\n\n===Cape Canaveral===\n[[File:CRS-15 Mission (41281637670).jpg|thumb|left|A [[SpaceX Dragon]] cargo launch to [[ISS]] aboard a [[Falcon 9]].]]\n[[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], located in [[Florida]], United States, has been operational since 1950; with its first orbital launch occurring in 1958. All of NASA's crewed [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] missions were launched from the Cape, along with some of the earlier [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions. Cape Canaveral is adjacent to the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Kennedy Space Center]], where the majority of Apollo missions and all the [[Space Shuttle]] missions were launched from. Under contract with NASA, [[SpaceX]] launches the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon spacecraft]] to resupply the American portion of the ISS. The Dragon can transport {{convert|6000|kg}} of pressurized and unpressurized cargo and can return {{convert|3000|kg}} to Earth. It is the only uncrewed resupply vehicle capable of returning a payload.\n\n===Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport===\nThe [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]], located at [[Wallops Island]], Virginia, United States, is the launch site for the [[Northrop Grumman]] [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft for resupplying the American portion of the ISS.\n\n==Current and completed spaceflights==\nThis is a list of uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station. ''Assembly flights are indicated in '''bold text'''''.\n\n''Note'': Russia has delivered cargo via the uncrewed missions of [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] since the launch of the ISS, while the U.S. had used Space Shuttles for hybrid human/cargo missions, resulting in a greater number of Russian uncrewed flights to the ISS. Since the discontinuation of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the numbers of crewed and uncrewed flights by the U.S. and Russia are more closely matched.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Five pounds (British gold coin)", "text_new": "{{About|the gold five-pound coin issued periodically between 1826 and 1990|the post-1990 cupro-nickel commemorative coin|Five pounds (British decimal coin)|other denominations|British coinage}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Five-guinea coin==\nThe [[Five Guineas (British coin)|five guineas]] [[gold coin]] started out life as a five-pound coin before the fluctuating value of the guinea eventually settled at twenty-one shillings; therefore it is arguable that the '''five pounds''' piece issued after the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]] is merely a continuation of the earlier value. However, the \u00a35 coin tends to have a more modern 'feel' and so is normally considered separately.\n\nThe coin was normally issued in cased \"proof\" condition, and rarely circulated, as well as being issued in small quantities which today often result in extremely high values of many tens of thousands of pounds being achieved when a coin appears at auction. The normal weight of the denomination was 40&nbsp;grams.\n\n==George III five-pound coin==\nThe first appearance of the denomination was in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], when it was produced in 1820 as a pattern. The obverse shows the right-facing bust of the king with the legend <small>GEORGIUS III D. G. BRITANNIAR. REX F.D. date</small>, while the reverse shows [[Benedetto Pistrucci]]'s now famous St. George and dragon design with no legend. The edge is inscribed on the normal version, but plain on the proof version.\n\n==George IV five-pound coin==\nThe next appearance of the denomination was in the reign of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], when it was produced in 1826 and 1829. The obverse shows the left-facing bust of the king with the legend <small>GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA date</small>, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend <small>BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF</small>. The 1826 coin has the edge inscription <small>DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI SEPTIMO</small>, while the 1829 coin has a plain edge.\n\n==Victoria five-pound coins==\n<div style=\"float:right;width:198px;margin-left:5px\">[[File:GoldFivePound1839.jpeg|GoldFivePound1839.jpeg]]</div>\n\nThe next coin of this value did not appear until early in the reign of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], when one of the most famous and attractive of all British coins was produced, colloquially known as the ''[[Una and the Lion]]'' coin.  Una and the Lion are characters in Spenser's ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', this five pounds piece has acquired a cult significance among collectors: the obverse shows the young head of the Queen, facing left with the legend <small>VICTORIA D G BRITANNIARUM REGINA F D</small>, while the reverse shows Queen Victoria as Una leading the lion to the left, with the legend <small>DIRIGE DEUS GRESSUS MEOS</small> \u2013 May the Lord direct my steps (some coins say DIRIGIT instead of DIRIGE \u2013 The Lord directs my steps) \u2013 with the date MDCCCXXXIX (1839 AD) in the [[exergue]] under the lion. The edge may either have the inscription <small>DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI TERTIO</small> or be plain. This issue is the lightest of all the \u00a35 coins, weighing only 38.7\u201339.3&nbsp;grams.\n\nThe next appearance of the denomination was not until 1887, when the Jubilee head was used with the obverse inscription <small>VICTORIA D G BRIT REG F D</small>, while the reverse shows [[Benedetto Pistrucci|Pistrucci]]'s [[:Image:1915-half-sov-reverse.JPG|design]] of [[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, with the only legend being the date in the exergue. The edge of this coin is milled, and it weighs 40&nbsp;grams. This coin was also (rarely) produced in the mint at [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], which is identified by the letter \"S\" above the centre of the date.\n\nThe Pistrucci reverse was used again in 1893, when the obverse used the \"Old Head\" or \"Veil Head\" of the queen, with the legend <small>VICTORIA DEI GRA BRITT REGINA FID DEF IND IMP</small>, and the edge is again milled.\n\n==Early 20th-century five-pound coins==\nIn the reigns of Kings [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], ([[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]]), and [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], five pound coins were only issued in proof sets in the first year of their reign (only prepared for approval in the case of Edward VIII, which is why his coin is valued at around \u00a3175,000!). All these reigns used the Pistrucci ''George and Dragon'' obverse, with the 1902 and 1911 coins having milled edges, though at least some of the 1937 coins have plain edges. The 1902 Edward VII coin was also minted at Sydney, being identified by an \"S\" above the centre of the date.\n\n==Elizabeth II five-pound coin==\nThe reign of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] saw a departure from the normal practice in issuing gold coinage. A small number of gold \u00a35 pieces were struck in 1953 in order to provide continuity of the series, and again in 1957, but neither of these strikings were released to the public, with the result that they are now valued in the \u00a3250,000\u2013\u00a3500,000 range. No further \u00a35 gold pieces were struck until 1980, nine years after decimalisation, since when they have been issued somewhat haphazardly in most years. Coins from 1980 to 1984 use the [[Arnold Machin]] effigy of the Queen, while the 1985\u20131990 coins use the [[Raphael Maklouf]] effigy. All these years use the Pistrucci reverse. In 1989 a completely new design was used to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the first issue of the [[gold sovereign|sovereign]] coin \u2013 the obverse shows the Queen seated on the coronation throne holding the orb and sceptre, with the legend <small>ELIZABETH II DEI GRA REG FID DEF</small>, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a [[double rose]] and the legend <small>ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOLD SOVEREIGN 1489\u20131989</small>.\n\nThe \u00a35 coins (non commemorative) are 36.02&nbsp;mm in diameter<ref>http://www.royalmint.com/shop/the_2013_gold_brilliant_uncirculated_5pound_coin?tab=specification#productdetails</ref> in contrast to the commemorative 'crowns' that are 38.6mm diam.\n\n==Modern five-pound coin (not normally gold)==\n{{main|Five pounds (British coin)}}\nSince 1990 \u00a35 coins have been produced in [[British Five Pound coin|cupronickel]], but premium versions in silver and gold are often produced.

However, the \u00a35 coin tends to have a more modern 'feel' and so is normally considered separately.\n\nThe coin was normally issued in cased \"proof\" condition, and rarely circulated, as well as being issued in small quantities which today often result in extremely high values of many tens of thousands of pounds being achieved when a coin appears at auction. The normal weight of the denomination was 40&nbsp;grams.\n\n==George III five-pound coin==\nThe first appearance of the denomination was in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], when it was produced in 1820 as a pattern. The obverse shows the right-facing bust of the king with the legend <small>GEORGIUS III D. G. BRITANNIAR. REX F.D. date</small>, while the reverse shows [[Benedetto Pistrucci]]'s now famous St. George and dragon design with no legend. The edge is inscribed on the normal version, but plain on the proof version.\n\n==George IV five-pound coin==\nThe next appearance of the denomination was in the reign of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], when it was produced in 1826 and 1829. The obverse shows the left-facing bust of the king with the legend <small>GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA date</small>, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend <small>BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF</small>. The 1826 coin has the edge inscription <small>DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI SEPTIMO</small>, while the 1829 coin has a plain edge.\n\n==Victoria five-pound coins==\n<div style=\"float:right;width:198px;margin-left:5px\">[[File:GoldFivePound1839.jpeg|GoldFivePound1839.jpeg]]</div>\n\nThe next coin of this value did not appear until early in the reign of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], when one of the most famous and attractive of all British coins was produced, colloquially known as the ''[[Una and the Lion]]'' coin.  Una and the Lion are characters in Spenser's ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', this five pounds piece has acquired a cult significance among collectors: the obverse shows the young head of the Queen, facing left with the legend <small>VICTORIA D G BRITANNIARUM REGINA F D</small>, while the reverse shows Queen Victoria as Una leading the lion to the left, with the legend <small>DIRIGE DEUS GRESSUS MEOS</small> \u2013 May the Lord direct my steps (some coins say DIRIGIT instead of DIRIGE \u2013 The Lord directs my steps) \u2013 with the date MDCCCXXXIX (1839 AD) in the [[exergue]] under the lion. The edge may either have the inscription <small>DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI TERTIO</small> or be plain. This issue is the lightest of all the \u00a35 coins, weighing only 38.7\u201339.3&nbsp;grams.\n\nThe next appearance of the denomination was not until 1887, when the Jubilee head was used with the obverse inscription <small>VICTORIA D G BRIT REG F D</small>, while the reverse shows [[Benedetto Pistrucci|Pistrucci]]'s [[:Image:1915-half-sov-reverse.JPG|design]] of [[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, with the only legend being the date in the exergue. The edge of this coin is milled, and it weighs 40&nbsp;grams. This coin was also (rarely) produced in the mint at [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], which is identified by the letter \"S\" above the centre of the date.\n\nThe Pistrucci reverse was used again in 1893, when the obverse used the \"Old Head\" or \"Veil Head\" of the queen, with the legend <small>VICTORIA DEI GRA BRITT REGINA FID DEF IND IMP</small>, and the edge is again milled.\n\n==Early 20th-century five-pound coins==\nIn the reigns of Kings [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], ([[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]]), and [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], five pound coins were only issued in proof sets in the first year of their reign (only prepared for approval in the case of Edward VIII, which is why his coin is valued at around \u00a3175,000!). All these reigns used the Pistrucci ''George and Dragon'' obverse, with the 1902 and 1911 coins having milled edges, though at least some of the 1937 coins have plain edges. The 1902 Edward VII coin was also minted at Sydney, being identified by an \"S\" above the centre of the date.\n\n==Elizabeth II five-pound coin==\nThe reign of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] saw a departure from the normal practice in issuing gold coinage. A small number of gold \u00a35 pieces were struck in 1953 in order to provide continuity of the series, and again in 1957, but neither of these strikings were released to the public, with the result that they are now valued in the \u00a3250,000\u2013\u00a3500,000 range. No further \u00a35 gold pieces were struck until 1980, nine years after decimalisation, since when they have been issued somewhat haphazardly in most years. Coins from 1980 to 1984 use the [[Arnold Machin]] effigy of the Queen, while the 1985\u20131990 coins use the [[Raphael Maklouf]] effigy. All these years use the Pistrucci reverse. In 1989 a completely new design was used to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the first issue of the [[gold sovereign|sovereign]] coin \u2013 the obverse shows the Queen seated on the coronation throne holding the orb and sceptre, with the legend <small>ELIZABETH II DEI GRA REG FID DEF</small>, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a [[double rose]] and the legend <small>ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOLD SOVEREIGN 1489\u20131989</small>.\n\nThe \u00a35 coins (non commemorative) are 36.02&nbsp;mm in diameter<ref>http://www.royalmint.com/shop/the_2013_gold_brilliant_uncirculated_5pound_coin?tab=specification#productdetails</ref> in contrast to the commemorative 'crowns' that are 38.6mm diam.\n\n==Modern five-pound coin (not normally gold)==\n{{main|Five pounds (British decimal coin) }}\nSince 1990 \u00a35 coins have been produced in [[British Five Pound coin|cupronickel]], but premium versions in silver and gold are often produced.

After dropping out of college, he and classmate [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]] formed the band Lo-Fi Masters. Cook co-wrote several songs with Mayer that appear on Mayer's first two releases, ''[[Inside Wants Out]]'' and ''[[Room for Squares]]'', including \"No Such Thing\", \"Comfortable\", \"Man on the Side\" and \"Neon\". Cook was also a member of the [[Marshall Tucker Band]] and [[Y-O-U]].\n\n==Biography==\nClay Cook attended Smoke Rise Elementary, [[Tucker High School]], and is a graduate of [[South Gwinnett High School]] in [[Snellville, Georgia]] in 1996. Following this, Cook enrolled at [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. While there, Cook met fellow student and singer-songwriter [[John Mayer]]. The two of them formed the duo known as Lo-Fi Masters, putting 5 of their songs on an eponymous demo tape which was made at Berklee.\n\nIn March 1998 after two years, Cook made the decision to leave Berklee with his bandmate, John Mayer, to move their duo to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], as he was a Georgia native and was aware of the music scene in the city. They began their career in earnest there, quickly making a name for the two-man band. They frequented the local coffeehouse and club circuit in venues including Atlanta's famous venue [[Eddie's Attic]]. On their writing partnership, Cook said, \"Even back then, my role was more like that of a producer and John was the writer. I'd give input to clean up the rough edges and help him get his vision of the song more clear. For instance, he might have written six verses to a song, and I'd help him get it down to three.\"<ref>Small, Mark (2005). Although actual songwriting credits refer only to a couple of songs on Mayer's first record.[http://www.berklee.edu/bt/172/coverstory.html \"John Mayer '9: Running with the Big Dogs\"] Berklee.edu (accessed April 23, 2007)</ref> Cook and Mayer wrote songs in Atlanta which later appeared on Mayer's record ''[[Room for Squares]]'', including: \"[[No Such Thing (John Mayer song)|No Such Thing]]\", \"Love Song for No One\", and \"Neon\". Due to musical and creative differences, the two eventually parted ways. Cook moved to California to work in a music shop and later joined the [[Marshall Tucker Band]]. Since then he has released two albums of solo material while playing with bands. His albums are entitled ''The Year I Grew Up'' and ''On Mountain Time''. Cook has also played with Sugarland and [[Shawn Mullins]].\n\nCook joined the Zac Brown Band, and their album ''[[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]]'' was nominated for the 2011 Grammy's, marking Cook's first recorded material that has been nominated. The band won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for \"As She's Walking Away\" with [[Alan Jackson]]. In 2011 Cook announced he had conceptualized his next solo album and planned on working on it throughout the rigorous touring schedule of the Zac Brown Band. Cook released this new album, ''North Star'', on October 22, 2013.\n\nIn recent years, Cook has also collaborated with artists to produce albums and CDs.
