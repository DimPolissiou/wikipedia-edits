Ye s absolutely.\" Khatri says people have been posting photographs showing the posters that didn't get as much air-time, posters addressing the range of 'important' causes that news anchors have accused the March of ignoring, like education, inheritance and marital rights. By bringing up the manifesto to defend the posters, for instance, Pakistan Feminists isolated themselves from the supposedly provocative posters, and in fact confirm their 'vulgarity'. It implies that Pakistani feminists agree that feminism should operate within the bounds of 'respectability'. According to her accepting narratives prescribing boundaries of respectability are traps that needs to be avoided by feminists and not to be allowed to be cemented in any social discourse. Feminism with conditions is no feminism. It maintains the division between what is \u2018acceptable\u2019 and what is 'immodest', what is 'public' and 'private', allowed and not. It pits the two against each other, rewarding the feminists who rally for legal rights and work-life balance and slut-shaming those who reclaim gendered slurs and carry the posters they did at the March. She questions whether feminism to allow discriminate and gatekeeping, and this gatekeeping is patriarchy's way of bolstering the binary of purpose vs pleasure, where the feminism of purpose (health, education, marital rights) is 'good' feminism, and the feminism of pleasure (sexual politics, bodily autonomy, agency over time and leisure) is 'bad' feminism, 'immoral' and 'frivolous'. She explains as feminists use the language of real and serious, end up creating a distinction between 'actual' issues and 'pretended' ones and rush to clarify that feminists have included 'important' causes in our demands, end up suggesting that other causes are unimportant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Khatri |first1=Sadia |title=Should feminists claim Aurat March\u2019s 'vulgar' posters?

Poster slogan has hit them hard. It has upset them. And now, they are angry and trying to speak to us in a language that they think we'll understand.

Ye s absolutely.\" Khatri says people have been posting photographs showing the posters that didn't get as much air-time, posters addressing the range of 'important' causes that news anchors have accused the March of ignoring, like education, inheritance and marital rights. By bringing up the manifesto to defend the posters, for instance, Pakistan Feminists isolated themselves from the supposedly provocative posters, and in fact confirm their 'vulgarity'. It implies that Pakistani feminists agree that feminism should operate within the bounds of 'respectability'. According to her accepting narratives prescribing boundaries of respectability are traps that needs to be avoided by feminists and not to be allowed to be cemented in any social discourse. Feminism with conditions is no feminism. It maintains the division between what is \u2018acceptable\u2019 and what is 'immodest', what is 'public' and 'private', allowed and not. It pits the two against each other, rewarding the feminists who rally for legal rights and work-life balance and slut-shaming those who reclaim gendered slurs and carry the posters they did at the March. She questions whether feminism to allow discriminate and gatekeeping, and this gatekeeping is patriarchy's way of bolstering the binary of purpose vs pleasure, where the feminism of purpose (health, education, marital rights) is 'good' feminism, and the feminism of pleasure (sexual politics, bodily autonomy, agency over time and leisure) is 'bad' feminism, 'immoral' and 'frivolous'. She explains as feminists use the language of real and serious, end up creating a distinction between 'actual' issues and 'pretended' ones and rush to clarify that feminists have included 'important' causes in our demands, end up suggesting that other causes are unimportant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Khatri |first1=Sadia |title=Should feminists claim Aurat March\u2019s 'vulgar' posters?

Poster slogan has hit them hard. It has upset them. And now, they are angry and trying to speak to us in a language that they think we'll understand.

This was an early Norman [[motte and bailey]] castle, of which only the motte and its surrounding embankments remain. Despite the loss of its timber superstructure and later stone buildings, its height and bulk mean that it still dominates the town centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rayleigh-mount/features/the-castle-at-rayleigh-mount |title=The castle at Rayleigh Mount |publisher=National Trust |date= |accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Later medieval period (1154\u20131485)===\nA [[courthouse]] was erected in Rayleigh in 1338.

By this time, the site was in royal ownership and used for pasture:\n: know all men of special grace who have the will to repair certain Chapel in the said town and to build a new a certain [[Bell tower|belfry]] we have granted them the foundations and to take away and use any stones found theren\".<ref>[[#refRcschurch|Rayleigh Civic Society 2006]], Holy Trinity Church</ref>\n\n===Tudors and Stuarts===\nRecords indicate that the church was rich in plate, vestments and [[stained glass]], but these were disposed of:\n: \"No church within the hundred was more splendidly adorned; none were so richly furnished with plate, vestments and other accessories for the celebration of the divine service; none were so rich in painted glass; none have been more mercilessly despoiled\"<ref>[[#refBurrows1909|Burrows 1909]], p.303.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Burrows|first=John William|url=http://archive.org/details/southendonseadis00burriala|title=Southend-on-Sea and district: historical notes ..|date=1909|publisher=Southend-on-Sea : J.H.

Therefore, the name means overall 'wood or clearing of the wild she-goats or roe-deer\".<ref>''The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place Names'', ed. by Victor Watts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004).</ref><ref>[[#refRcshistory|Rayleigh Civic Society 2006]]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistoric and Roman times===\nThere has been a scattering of stray finds around the town from Prehistoric and Roman times, including some Roman roof and [[hypocaust]] tiles found within the fabric of Rayleigh Church. This suggests that there was a Roman habitation site within the area. However, there is little evidence of any density of population here during this period.<ref>[[#refHistoricassess|Historic Town Assessment Report for Rayleigh, 1999]], pages 3 and 7.</ref>\n\n===Saxon era===\nOne significant archaeological find was in the early 2000s at the western edge of Rayleigh, at the site of the former Park School in Rawreth Lane. An early Saxon cemetery site was discovered here, with 144 cremation burials and evidence of just one high-status female inhumation burial.<ref>Essex County Council [http://unlockingessex.essexcc.gov.uk/uep/custom_pages/monument_detail.asp?content_page_id=68&previous_page_id=48&monument_id=1035613 Unlocking Essex's Past].

This was an early Norman [[motte and bailey]] castle, of which only the motte and its surrounding embankments remain. Despite the loss of its timber superstructure and later stone buildings, its height and bulk mean that it still dominates the town centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rayleigh-mount/features/the-castle-at-rayleigh-mount |title=The castle at Rayleigh Mount |publisher=National Trust |date= |accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Later medieval period (1154\u20131485)===\nA [[courthouse]] was erected in Rayleigh in 1338. This was apparently resented by the townspeople, who turned out in force to destroy it, with 20 [[Leadership|ringleaders]] later arrested and tried.<ref>[[#refBurrows1909|Burrows 1909]], p.31.</ref>\n\nThe forests around Rayleigh were royal hunting grounds. It is recorded that [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] hunted here in 1222, and three King Edwards also visited.<ref>[[#refBurrows1909|Burrows 1909]], p.27.</ref>\n\nOne of the oldest secular building in Rayleigh is 91 High Street which houses Pizza Express downstairs and [[Rayleigh Town Museum]] upstairs. The Regal Room in the museum is dated circa 1350. It is suspected that some of Rayleigh's older Brick build buildings may contain portions older than this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rochford.gov.uk/sites/default/files/planning_historic_environment_rayleigh_town_assess.pdf |title=Rayleigh Historic Town Project Assessment Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nRayleigh Castle gradually fell into disuse, and in 1394 [[King Richard II]] gave permission for the townspeople of Rayleigh to use the foundations as a source of stone. By this time, the site was in royal ownership and used for pasture:\n: know all men of special grace who have the will to repair certain Chapel in the said town and to build a new a certain [[Bell tower|belfry]] we have granted them the foundations and to take away and use any stones found theren\".<ref>[[#refRcschurch|Rayleigh Civic Society 2006]], Holy Trinity Church</ref>\n\n===Tudors and Stuarts===\nRecords indicate that the church was rich in plate, vestments and [[stained glass]], but these were disposed of:\n: \"No church within the hundred was more splendidly adorned; none were so richly furnished with plate, vestments and other accessories for the celebration of the divine service; none were so rich in painted glass; none have been more mercilessly despoiled\"<ref>[[#refBurrows1909|Burrows 1909]], p.303.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Burrows|first=John William|url=http://archive.org/details/southendonseadis00burriala|title=Southend-on-Sea and district: historical notes ..|date=1909|publisher=Southend-on-Sea : J.H.

It was envisioned by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a [[Kolkata]] lawyer, who prevised a school modelled on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], but conscious of Indian ambitions and desires. Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E. Foot]], an Englishman who had spent nine years as a science master at [[Eton College]], England.<ref>{{cite book|year=1979|chapter=FOOT, Arthur Edward|title=Who Was Who 1961\u20131970|location=London|publisher=A. & C. Black|isbn=0-7136-2008-0}}</ref> The last headmaster was [[Matthew Raggett]], who resigned in January 2020. He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively.
