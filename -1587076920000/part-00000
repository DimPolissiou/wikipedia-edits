He is in his 16th term as a congressman, having served in the House since 1989, having previously represented the 19th District from 1989 to 1993, and the 17th District from 1993 to 2013.\n\nIn 2019, following Democratic gains in the November 2018 elections, he took over as Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 2013, he became the Ranking Member of the Committee, replacing [[Howard Berman]], who lost his re-election bid in the 2012 elections.\n\n==Early life, education, and teaching career==\nEngel was born in the Bronx, the son of Sylvia (n\u00e9e Bleend) and Philip Engel, an [[ironworker]]. His grandparents, of [[Ukrainian Jewish]] background,<ref name=\"chabad-ukraine\" /> were immigrants from the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=\"lmTCF\" />\n\nHe grew up in a city housing project, Eastchester Gardens, and attended [[New York City]] public schools.\n\nIn 1969, he graduated from [[Hunter College|Hunter]]-[[Lehman College]] of the [[City University of New York]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[history]]. He subsequently received a [[master's degree]] in guidance and counseling in 1973 from the same institution, by now renamed Lehman College following the severance of its relationship with Hunter College. In 1987, he received a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[New York Law School]].\n\nHe began his political career in local Democrat clubs.\n\nHe taught in the [[New York City Department of Education|New York City School District]] and was a guidance counselor. He taught at Intermediate School 52 from 1969 to 1976 and then at Intermediate School 174.\n\n==New York State Assembly==\nIn 1977, Engel entered the special election for a seat in the [[New York State Assembly]] after the incumbent Democrat [[Alan Hochberg]] was forced to resign. He risked all of his life savings and won by 103 votes. He was the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] nominee in the special election, and on March 1, 1977, he defeated Democratic nominee Ted Weinstein and Republican nominee Arlene Siegel.<ref name=\"JGN6u\" />\n\nEngel was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1977 to 1988, sitting in the [[182nd New York State Legislature|182nd]], [[183rd New York State Legislature|183rd]], [[184th New York State Legislature|184th]], [[185th New York State Legislature|185th]], [[186th New York State Legislature|186th]] and [[187th New York State Legislature]]s. He chaired the Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, as well as the Subcommittee on the [[Mitchell-Lama Housing Program]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1988, Engel ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[New York's 19th congressional district]]. He defeated incumbent Democrat [[Mario Biaggi]] in the [[Primary election|primary]] with 48% of the vote.<ref name=\"lnQpC\" /> Biaggi had been charged with [[racketeering]] in the [[Wedtech Corporation|Wedtech]] scandal,<ref name=\"gd9YM\" /> and Biaggi was eventually jailed by [[Rudy Giuliani]]. Engel won the general election with 56% of the vote.<ref name=\"2CtsC\" /> Engel subsequently never won re-election with less than 61% in a general election. He only faced competitive primary elections (getting less than 70%) twice (1994 and 2000). In 1994, he defeated musician [[Willie Col\u00f3n]] 62%-38%.<ref name=\"8ckzs\" /> In 2000, Engel defeated State Senator [[Larry Seabrook]], who had the support of Bronx County Democratic Party Chairman Roberto Ramirez, 50%-41%.<ref name=\"2wHZP\" />\n\n===Committee assignments===\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]'''\n** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power|Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]\n** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health|Subcommittee on Health]]\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]]''' \u2013 (Chair)\n\n;Party leadership\n* Vice Chair of the Democratic Task Force on Homeland Security\n* Assistant Democratic Whip\n\n;Caucus memberships\n* Arab-Israeli Peace Accord Monitoring Group\n* Congressional Albanian Caucus\n* [[Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety]]\n* Congressional Hellenic-Israeli Alliance\n* Ad Hoc Congressional Committee for Irish Affairs\n* [[Democratic Leadership Council]]\n* Democratic Task Force on Health\n* House Oil and National Security Caucus (Founder and Co-Chair)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130708033649/http://www.iiacf.org/usa/member_directory/ Israel Allies Caucus]\n* [[New Democrat Coalition]]<ref name=\"vnyeS\" />\n* House Caucus on Human Rights\n* House Caucus on the Hudson Valley\n*[[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus]]<ref name=\"bg0x5\" />\n* [[Congressional Arts Caucus]]\n* [[Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus]]<ref name=\"VEu9n\" />\n* Congressional \"Medicare for All\" Caucus (Founding Member) <ref name=\"z4qOx\" />\n* Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus <ref name=\"lgbt-polls\" />\n*[[Climate Solutions Caucus]]<ref name=\"climate-solutions-caucus\" />\n*[[U.S.-Japan Caucus]]<ref name=\"us-japan-caucus\" />\n\n===Attendance at the State of the Union address===\n\nEngel can be seen shaking hands with the president during televised [[State of the Union address]]es.<ref name=\"aisle-seat\" /> Along with other Members of Congress, Engel shows up to the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] early in order to guarantee that he will get an aisle seat. Engel has managed to shake hands with the president at every address, and be seen by his constituents on television since 1989. He has expressed that, \"It's an honor to shake the hand of the president of the United States no matter who it is.\"<ref name=\"qoT1F\" /> Although not technically a State of the Union address, he chose not to do so for Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress <ref name=\"trump-handshake\" />\n\n==Political positions==\n\n===Healthcare reform===\nA strong supporter of [[single payer healthcare]], Engel supports quality access to [[health care]], and refers to himself as [[pro-choice]] \"all the way\".<ref name=\"Wddkx\" /> Engel is a co-sponsor of the [[United States National Health Care Act]], which would implement a single-payer health care system in the United States. In 2010 he was a strong supporter of the landmark [[Affordable Care Act]], committing his vote only after securing provisions that [[New York (state)|New York]] would not be penalized for being a [[do-gooder]] state.<ref name=\"youtube-health-care-vote\" />\n\nIn 2008, Engel authored the [[ALS Registry Act]] (P.L. 110-373),<ref name=\"0U0VM\" /> which established a national registry for the collection and storage of data on those suffering from ALS. He also authored the [[Paul D. Wellstone]] [[Muscular Dystrophy Act]] (P.L. 110-361),<ref name=\"GTeOh\" /> which promoted research at Centers of Excellence for Muscular Dystrophy.\n\nIn 2010, Engel wrote the [[Partnering to Improve Maternity Care Quality Act]] to improve maternity care for mothers and newborns, and to do so in partnership with doctors, advocates, payers, and purchasers. In 2010 he also wrote the [[Gestational Diabetes Act of 2010]], which passed the House, but didn't come to a vote in the Senate. In 2018, he reintroduced the legislation in the [[115th Congress]] for consideration. It was not voted on.<ref name=\"9rOq1\" /> The legislation would provide for better tracking and research into gestational diabetes, which, if untreated, could lead to [[Type 2 diabetes]] for both mother and child.\n\n===Global health===\nRep. Engel supported an improved re-authorization of the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR). Within the PEPFAR bill, Engel included his bill, the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act.<ref name=\"2XgLl\" /> This measure would provide increased U.S. support for international [[Tuberculosis management|Tuberculosis control]] activities, and promotes research to develop new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines.\n\n===Energy===\nIn 2005, Engel, along with Congressman [[Jack Kingston]] (R-GA), introduced the Fuel Choices for American Security Act (H.R. 4409), later modified and re-introduced in 2007 as the DRIVE Act (H.R. 670) - the Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy Act - with more than 80 bi-partisan co-sponsors. It was designed to promote America's [[national security]] and economic stability by reducing dependence on foreign oil through the use of clean [[alternative fuels]] and advanced vehicle technologies. It also called for increased tire efficiency - to increase a vehicle's gas miles.<ref name=\"CxXGz\" />\n\nMany provisions of the DRIVE Act were included in the [[Energy Independence and Security Act]], which was signed into law on December 19, 2007, and became Public Law No. 110-140. This law mandates increased fuel efficiency standards from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, and the development of American-grown [[biofuel]]s like [[cellulosic ethanol]], [[biodiesel]], and [[biobutanol]].\n\nEngel introduced the Open Fuel Standards Act, alongside Congressmen Kingston, [[Steve Israel]] (D-NY) and [[Bob Inglis]] (R-SC).<ref name=\"cIYUk\" /> This bill would have required 50 percent of new cars sold in the [[United States]] by 2012 (and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015) to be [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s capable of running on any combination of [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[gasoline]]. Flex fuel vehicles cost about $100 more than the same vehicle in a gasoline-only version.\n\nEngel is the senior Representative from New York on the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]], and the Representative from New York on the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. He played a key role in negotiating the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454,<ref name=\"qTkBB\" /> which passed the House on June 26, 2009.<ref name=\"hpyfd\" /> That legislation was intended to revitalize the economy by creating millions of new jobs, increase American national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil, and preserve the planet by reducing [[greenhouse gas emissions]].<ref name=\"77mcR\" /> It passed the House in 2009, but was not voted on by the Senate in the [[111th Congress]].\n\n===Gun control===\nA supporter of [[gun control]], Engel has in Congress \"worked to [[Assault weapons legislation in the United States|ban assault weapons]], [[high-capacity magazine]]s and armor-piercing bullets, institute [[universal background check]]s, adopt [[extreme risk protection order]]s, and restore funding for gun violence research.\"<ref name=\"LKHs7\" /> Engel has received an \"F\" grade from the [[National Rifle Association]]<ref name=\"OnTheIssues\" /> and 100 percent ratings from the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]]<ref name=\"fVRqJ\" /> and [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]].<ref name=\"1e3MQ\" /> He voted against a [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act|2003 bill]] that immunized firearm manufacturers and dealers from civil liability for gun misuse, supports \"[[smart gun]]\" technology to prevent guns from being used by unauthorized persons, and voted against a bill to reduce the waiting period to purchase a gun at a gun show.<ref name=\"OnTheIssues\" /> In 2009, Engel was one of 53 members of Congress who signed a letter to President [[Barack Obama]], urging the new president to resume enforcement of a ban on the import  of foreign [[assault weapons]] (authorized by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] and enforced during the administrations of [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]]).<ref name=\"0Cfen\" /> In 2011, after 400,000 defective [[gun lock]]s were recalled from the market, Engel introduced a bill intended to protect parents and children from faulty gun locks by instructing the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) to set a national quality standard for all child safety devices used on firearms.<ref name=\"ScBIk\" />\n\n===Other domestic issues===\nOn December 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the [[Truth in Caller ID Act]]. The legislation was introduced by [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] in the Senate, passed the House on December 15, and is virtually identical to Rep. Engel's bill.<ref name=\"SaWyu\" /> The new law cracks down on the use of [[caller ID spoofing]], often used by criminals to trick their victims into giving out personal information. The legislation will help law enforcement combat [[identity theft]].\n\nRep. Engel originally introduced the Securing our Borders and Our Data Act in July 2008, HR 6702.<ref name=\"MSlAG\" /> That bill would ensure that when a traveler enters the United States, a border agent cannot search or seize the traveler's data or equipment without cause.<ref name=\"Wu3pr\" /> The legislation was re-introduced in the 111th Congress as HR 239.<ref name=\"tvvs7\" /> The [[Department of Homeland Security]] altered their rules to prevent agents from searching and seizing without cause.<ref name=\"Z0VTF\" /> This encompassed much of Rep. Engel's legislation.\n\nIn the 109th Congress, Engel introduced the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act, HR 3402.<ref name=\"x2MS4\" /> The bill was intended to stop some of the massive fraud in the prepaid calling card industry.<ref name=\"EY2kH\" /> The legislation passed the House unanimously, but the Senate did not act on it. In 2011, Rep. Engel introduced the [[Drug Testing Integrity Act]], which would prohibit products to be sold that enable cheating on drug tests.\n\nIn 2010, Engel urged the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] to stop their plan to ban private transfer fees on [[cooperative apartment]] sales. Some developers and investors had been [[abusing the system]] by imposing transfer fees that would have provided them with percentages on all future sales of the property over many decades. The transfer fee, when used correctly, can help owners and developers fund projects and remain affordable. The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Engel introduced [[SNOPA]], the Social Network Online Protection Act. It would guarantee online privacy and ensure that employers and educational institutions cannot use personal data as a bargaining chip for employment or education. Employers/schools would be barred from requesting or requiring usernames or passwords to social media sites as part of the hiring, employment, or enrollment process. The bill was re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]], with Rep. [[Michael Grimm (politician)|Michael Grimm]] as the Republican lead, and Rep. [[Jan Schakowski]] as an original co-sponsor.\n\n===International affairs===\n[[File:Nelson-Mandela-with-congressman-Engel.png|thumb|Engel with [[Nelson Mandela]]]]\nEngel is a supporter of recognizing [[Jerusalem]] as the capital of [[Israel]], and has also been an advocate for the causes of [[Albanian-Americans]] and ethnic [[Albanians]] in [[Kosovo]]. In 2003, he authored the [[Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act]], which was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 12, 2003.<ref name=\"qLAzE\" /> In this Law, Congress authorized penalties and restrictions on US relations with [[Syria]] for its occupation of [[Lebanon]], and for its relationship with terrorist groups. Syria withdrew all forces from Lebanon in 2005 after the [[Cedar Revolution]].\n\n====Western Hemisphere Subcommittee====\nAs Chairman of the House of Representatives [[Foreign Affairs]] Subcommittee on the [[Western Hemisphere]], Engel has called for stronger U.S. relations with [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. His Subcommittee has held hearings on issues such as the crisis in [[Haiti]], poverty, and inequality in Latin America.\n\nEngel pushed for increased funding for emergency relief in Haiti, and for Temporary Protective Status (TPS) of Haitian nationals in the U.S.<ref name=\"OAOzQ\" /> Engel is also supportive of the \"[[M\u00e9rida Initiative]]\", in which the U.S. is cooperating with [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and Haiti to counter [[narco-trafficking]] and related violence in the region. In the [[110th United States Congress]], he introduced the Social Investment and Economic Development Act for the Americas of 2007<ref name=\"ntC4y\" /> (re-introduced in 2009, where it also died in committee<ref name=\"q42Qu\" />) and sponsored the Western Hemisphere Energy Compact Act to develop partnerships to strengthen diplomatic relations with the Government of Brazil, and the governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere (died in committee).<ref name=\"VlJxI\" />\n\nThe bi-partisan Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2009 (sponsored by Rep. Engel) was passed by the House on December 8, 2009; it would have taken a fresh look at the United States' counter-narcotics efforts, both at home and abroad. The bill did not pass the Senate.<ref name=\"smbGN\" />\n\n====Middle East====\n[[File:Secretary Kerry, Senators McCain and Warner, House Minority Leader Pelosi, and Representative Engel Chat Before Greeting King Salman of Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|Engel before greeting the new King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]], in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]] in January 2015]]\nEngel is one of the leading congressional supporters of  [[Israel]]. Although he has supported resolutions critical of both Israelis and Palestinians, his criticisms of Israeli policies have usually been couched as warnings of their harm to Israel itself. In 2008, he was the lead Democrat on a resolution condemning [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian terrorist organizations.<ref name=\"76OW6\" /> Shortly after entering Congress, he sponsored a resolution declaring [[Jerusalem]] the undivided capital of Israel.<ref name=\"LFeZk\" /> A very pro-Israel position, this was contrary to official American policy until President Donald Trump adopted it in December 2019. He also wrote the [[Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act]], which was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 12, 2003.<ref name=\"UNXmM\" /> This law authorized restrictions on American relations with [[Syria]], and penalties for its occupation of [[Lebanon]], and for its relationship with terrorist groups.\n\nIn January 2017, Engel introduced a House resolution condemning the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334|UN Security Council Resolution 2334]], which condemned [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlement building]] in the occupied [[Palestinian territories]] as a violation of international law.<ref name=\"ROANC\" />\n\n====Kosovo and the Balkans====\nIn 1996, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"The [[Kosovo]] cause has been kept alive in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by a small group of congressmen led by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.)....\"<ref name=\"CoDjw\" /> While a member of the Subcommittee on Europe and Chair of the Congressional Albanian Issues Caucus, Engel fought [[War Crimes in the Kosovo War#Ethnic cleansing|ethnic cleansing]] in the 1999 [[Kosovo War]] and voiced support in Congress for the unilateral [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]] from Serbia. A street has been named after him in [[Pej\u00eb]], and he was the first foreign dignitary to address the [[Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo parliament]].<ref name=\"gWljZ\" />\n\n====Cyprus====\nEngel called for the withdrawal of [[Turkey|Turkish]] troops from [[Cyprus]], and authored a resolution in 1996 calling for its [[demilitarization]]. His 1994 law allowed the [[United States Department of State]] to conduct an investigation of five Americans who disappeared during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], and found the remains of one.<ref name=\"xqZeA\" /> Engel received the [[George Paraskevaides]] Award on May 17, 2007, given to those who have utilized ancient [[wikt:Hellenic|Hellenic]] values to contribute to the nations and people of Cyprus and America and to the Hellenics in the modern world.<ref name=\"yuE00\" />\n\n====Iraq War====\nIn 2002, although 133 members of the House of Representatives voted against it, Engel voted for the resolution granting President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq, as did the two [[United States Senate|Senators]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Chuck Schumer]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and almost 300 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref name=\"tasyN\" /> After revelations that intelligence provided to Congress was partially unreliable, and the subsequent problems faced after [[Saddam Hussein]] was deposed, Engel has come to regret his decision to support the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and consistently votes in favor of gradual withdrawal. He has met with anti-war activists, and in 2008, he publicly called for the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. Engel received an \"A\" grade from the Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans in 2008.<ref name=\"7BCHv\" />\n\n====Irish affairs====\nIn 2007, Engel became a Co-Chair of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs. He supported the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]], and aided Irish nationals facing deportation from the United States.<ref name=\"9V2qw\" /> He has been a friend of [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]],<ref name=\"oct28\" /> and was the author of legislation that prohibits employers in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Ireland]] from receiving U.S. funds from the [[International Fund for Ireland]], unless they comply with fair employment and non-discrimination principles called the \"[[MacBride Principles]]\".<ref name=\"wygrW\" /> In 2010, Rep. Engel was instrumental in helping Joe Byrne return to the [[United States]], after a bureaucratic problem left him detained in Ireland and separated from his family in [[Rockland County]].\n\n====Human rights====\n[[File:Joshua Wong speaks at the US Capitol, 2019.jpg|thumb|230px|Engel with Hong Kong activists who have become prominent figures in the [[2019 Hong Kong protests]]]]\nAs a member of the [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]], Engel has supported [[Albanian-Americans]] and ethnic [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians]] in [[Kosovo]]. He is co-author of the [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], along with Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA), which addresses [[child labor]] in the cocoa fields of [[West Africa]].\n\nIn early 2001, he wrote the House resolution condemning the [[Taliban]] for forcing [[Hindu]] citizens to wear distinguishing marks as reminiscent of the [[Nazis]] forcing [[Jews]] to wear a yellow [[Star of David]].<ref name=\"blNGS\" /> In 2008, he wrote a resolution commending the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Promote Racial and Ethnic Equality.<ref name=\"sqYJ8\" />\n\nEngel sponsored a bill to support the [[Day of Silence]], during which students vow to remain silent to bring attention to the harassment and discrimination faced by [[lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender]] people in schools.<ref name=\"KXjsC\" /> That bill has been re-submitted in the [[111th United States Congress]].<ref name=\"HyUUt\" /> He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which allowed for states not to be required to recognize same-sex marriages in other states.<ref name=\"uMZhH\" /> In 2010, he voted in 2010 to repeal the \"[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]\" policy, enabling homosexuals to serve [[Coming out|openly]] in the U.S. Military.\n\nIn 2018, Engel condemned the [[2017\u2013present Rohingya genocide in Myanmar|genocide]] of the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya Muslim]] minority in [[Myanmar]] and called for a stronger response to the crisis.<ref name=\"W3S1Y\" />\n\nEngel urged the Trump administration to take a tougher line on [[China]] by imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who are responsible for [[Xinjiang re-education camps|human rights abuses]] against the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] [[Islam in China|Muslim]] minority in China's northwestern [[Xinjiang]] region. In March 2019, the group of lawmakers led by Engel wrote a letter to Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] that read in part, \"This issue is bigger than just China. It is about demonstrating to strongmen globally that the world will hold them accountable for their actions.\"<ref name=\"4B6xn\" />\n\n====Iran nuclear deal====\nIn August 2015, Engel announced that he would oppose the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] Iran nuclear deal in congress, saying that, \"The answers I've received simply don't convince me that this deal will keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran's hands, and may in fact strengthen Iran's position as a destabilizing and destructive influence across the Middle East.\"<ref name=\"KbL5a\" />\n\n==Controversies==\nIn March 2009, the Associated Press reported that Engel had been taking an annual [[tax credit]] on his [[Potomac, Maryland]] residence for at least ten years (cumulatively receiving thousands of dollars in tax credits), despite the fact that the credit is reserved for people who declare Maryland their primary residence. Maryland officials revoked the tax credit.<ref name=\"APTaxCredit\" /> The matter was reviewed by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which also looked into similar tax credits claimed by three other members of the House.<ref name=\"b9UXB\" /> The OCE eventually ended its review on Engel and two of the other members of Congress ([[Doris Matsui]] and [[Edolphus Towns]]) without recommending further investigation by the [[House Ethics Committee]].<ref name=\"oofcr\" />\n\nPublisher Christopher Hagedorn has often used his Bronx weekly newspapers, the ''Bronx News'', the ''Parkchester News'', and the ''Co-op City News'', to attack Engel.<ref name=\"columbia.edu\" /> Hagedorn believes that Engel, when he was still an assemblyman, was behind a failed effort in 1988 to evict the Co-op City News from its offices in Co-op City.<ref name=\"UD3nO\" /> Since 1988, Hagedorn has published numerous editorials and articles attacking Engel and even reprinted critical articles about him that have been published in other newspapers. Hagedorn has often endorsed Engel's opponents in the Democratic primary and the general election but the Congressman always won re-election to Congress. In 2000, Hagedorn intensified his campaign against Engel when the leadership of the powerful Bronx County Democratic organization decided to support former Assemblyman and City Councilman Larry Seabrook in the primary against Engel.<ref name=\"I8qN6\" /> Seabrook, whose campaign was plagued with problems, lost the primary to Engel by a wide margin.\n\nEngel has mostly ignored Hagedorn's attacks. In 1995, however, his then-communications director Greg Howard, told the Bronx Beat newspaper, which wrote about the feud, \"We don't consider Mr. Hagedorn a legitimate journalist. He uses the paper as his own personal platform for whatever agenda he has. He chooses the paper to malign people with whom he has philosophical differences.\"<ref name=\"columbia.edu\" /> In the last decade, Hagedorn's newspapers have mostly ignored Engel.\n\nIn July 2014, Engel appeared at a pro-Israel rally in New York City with anti-[[Muslim]] activist [[Pamela Geller]].

He is in his 16th term as a congressman, having served in the House since 1989, having previously represented the 19th District from 1989 to 1993, and the 17th District from 1993 to 2013.\n\nIn 2019, following Democratic gains in the November 2018 elections, he took over as Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 2013, he became the Ranking Member of the Committee, replacing [[Howard Berman]], who lost his re-election bid in the 2012 elections.\n\n==Early life, education, and teaching career==\nEngel was born in the Bronx, the son of Sylvia (n\u00e9e Bleend) and Philip Engel, an [[ironworker]]. His grandparents, of [[Ukrainian Jewish]] background,<ref name=\"chabad-ukraine\" /> were immigrants from the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=\"lmTCF\" />\n\nHe grew up in a city housing project, Eastchester Gardens, and attended [[New York City]] public schools.\n\nIn 1969, he graduated from [[Hunter College|Hunter]]-[[Lehman College]] of the [[City University of New York]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[history]]. He subsequently received a [[master's degree]] in guidance and counseling in 1973 from the same institution, by now renamed Lehman College following the severance of its relationship with Hunter College. In 1987, he received a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[New York Law School]].\n\nHe began his political career in local Democrat clubs.\n\nHe taught in the [[New York City Department of Education|New York City School District]] and was a guidance counselor. He taught at Intermediate School 52 from 1969 to 1976 and then at Intermediate School 174.\n\n==New York State Assembly==\nIn 1977, Engel entered the special election for a seat in the [[New York State Assembly]] after the incumbent Democrat [[Alan Hochberg]] was forced to resign. He risked all of his life savings and won by 103 votes. He was the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] nominee in the special election, and on March 1, 1977, he defeated Democratic nominee Ted Weinstein and Republican nominee Arlene Siegel.<ref name=\"JGN6u\" />\n\nEngel was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1977 to 1988, sitting in the [[182nd New York State Legislature|182nd]], [[183rd New York State Legislature|183rd]], [[184th New York State Legislature|184th]], [[185th New York State Legislature|185th]], [[186th New York State Legislature|186th]] and [[187th New York State Legislature]]s. He chaired the Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, as well as the Subcommittee on the [[Mitchell-Lama Housing Program]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nIn 1988, Engel ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[New York's 19th congressional district]]. He defeated incumbent Democrat [[Mario Biaggi]] in the [[Primary election|primary]] with 48% of the vote.<ref name=\"lnQpC\" /> Biaggi had been charged with [[racketeering]] in the [[Wedtech Corporation|Wedtech]] scandal,<ref name=\"gd9YM\" /> and Biaggi was eventually jailed by [[Rudy Giuliani]]. Engel won the general election with 56% of the vote.<ref name=\"2CtsC\" /> Engel subsequently never won re-election with less than 61% in a general election. He only faced competitive primary elections (getting less than 70%) twice (1994 and 2000). In 1994, he defeated musician [[Willie Col\u00f3n]] 62%-38%.<ref name=\"8ckzs\" /> In 2000, Engel defeated State Senator [[Larry Seabrook]], who had the support of Bronx County Democratic Party Chairman Roberto Ramirez, 50%-41%.<ref name=\"2wHZP\" />\n\n===Committee assignments===\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]'''\n** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power|Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]\n** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health|Subcommittee on Health]]\n* '''[[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]]''' \u2013 (Chair)\n\n;Party leadership\n* Vice Chair of the Democratic Task Force on Homeland Security\n* Assistant Democratic Whip\n\n;Caucus memberships\n* Arab-Israeli Peace Accord Monitoring Group\n* Congressional Albanian Caucus\n* [[Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety]]\n* Congressional Hellenic-Israeli Alliance\n* Ad Hoc Congressional Committee for Irish Affairs\n* [[Democratic Leadership Council]]\n* Democratic Task Force on Health\n* House Oil and National Security Caucus (Founder and Co-Chair)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130708033649/http://www.iiacf.org/usa/member_directory/ Israel Allies Caucus]\n* [[New Democrat Coalition]]<ref name=\"vnyeS\" />\n* House Caucus on Human Rights\n* House Caucus on the Hudson Valley\n*[[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus]]<ref name=\"bg0x5\" />\n* [[Congressional Arts Caucus]]\n* [[Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus]]<ref name=\"VEu9n\" />\n* Congressional \"Medicare for All\" Caucus (Founding Member) <ref name=\"z4qOx\" />\n* Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus <ref name=\"lgbt-polls\" />\n*[[Climate Solutions Caucus]]<ref name=\"climate-solutions-caucus\" />\n*[[U.S.-Japan Caucus]]<ref name=\"us-japan-caucus\" />\n\n===Attendance at the State of the Union address===\n\nEngel can be seen shaking hands with the president during televised [[State of the Union address]]es.<ref name=\"aisle-seat\" /> Along with other Members of Congress, Engel shows up to the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] early in order to guarantee that he will get an aisle seat. Engel has managed to shake hands with the president at every address, and be seen by his constituents on television since 1989. He has expressed that, \"It's an honor to shake the hand of the president of the United States no matter who it is.\"<ref name=\"qoT1F\" /> Although not technically a State of the Union address, he chose not to do so for Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress <ref name=\"trump-handshake\" />\n\n==Political positions==\n\n===Healthcare reform===\nA strong supporter of [[single payer healthcare]], Engel supports quality access to [[health care]], and refers to himself as [[pro-choice]] \"all the way\".<ref name=\"Wddkx\" /> Engel is a co-sponsor of the [[United States National Health Care Act]], which would implement a single-payer health care system in the United States. In 2010 he was a strong supporter of the landmark [[Affordable Care Act]], committing his vote only after securing provisions that [[New York (state)|New York]] would not be penalized for being a [[do-gooder]] state.<ref name=\"youtube-health-care-vote\" />\n\nIn 2008, Engel authored the [[ALS Registry Act]] (P.L. 110-373),<ref name=\"0U0VM\" /> which established a national registry for the collection and storage of data on those suffering from ALS. He also authored the [[Paul D. Wellstone]] [[Muscular Dystrophy Act]] (P.L. 110-361),<ref name=\"GTeOh\" /> which promoted research at Centers of Excellence for Muscular Dystrophy.\n\nIn 2010, Engel wrote the [[Partnering to Improve Maternity Care Quality Act]] to improve maternity care for mothers and newborns, and to do so in partnership with doctors, advocates, payers, and purchasers. In 2010 he also wrote the [[Gestational Diabetes Act of 2010]], which passed the House, but didn't come to a vote in the Senate. In 2018, he reintroduced the legislation in the [[115th Congress]] for consideration. It was not voted on.<ref name=\"9rOq1\" /> The legislation would provide for better tracking and research into gestational diabetes, which, if untreated, could lead to [[Type 2 diabetes]] for both mother and child.\n\n===Global health===\nRep. Engel supported an improved re-authorization of the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR). Within the PEPFAR bill, Engel included his bill, the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act.<ref name=\"2XgLl\" /> This measure would provide increased U.S. support for international [[Tuberculosis management|Tuberculosis control]] activities, and promotes research to develop new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines.\n\n===Energy===\nIn 2005, Engel, along with Congressman [[Jack Kingston]] (R-GA), introduced the Fuel Choices for American Security Act (H.R. 4409), later modified and re-introduced in 2007 as the DRIVE Act (H.R. 670) - the Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy Act - with more than 80 bi-partisan co-sponsors. It was designed to promote America's [[national security]] and economic stability by reducing dependence on foreign oil through the use of clean [[alternative fuels]] and advanced vehicle technologies. It also called for increased tire efficiency - to increase a vehicle's gas miles.<ref name=\"CxXGz\" />\n\nMany provisions of the DRIVE Act were included in the [[Energy Independence and Security Act]], which was signed into law on December 19, 2007, and became Public Law No. 110-140. This law mandates increased fuel efficiency standards from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, and the development of American-grown [[biofuel]]s like [[cellulosic ethanol]], [[biodiesel]], and [[biobutanol]].\n\nEngel introduced the Open Fuel Standards Act, alongside Congressmen Kingston, [[Steve Israel]] (D-NY) and [[Bob Inglis]] (R-SC).<ref name=\"cIYUk\" /> This bill would have required 50 percent of new cars sold in the [[United States]] by 2012 (and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015) to be [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s capable of running on any combination of [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[gasoline]]. Flex fuel vehicles cost about $100 more than the same vehicle in a gasoline-only version.\n\nEngel is the senior Representative from New York on the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]], and the Representative from New York on the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. He played a key role in negotiating the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454,<ref name=\"qTkBB\" /> which passed the House on June 26, 2009.<ref name=\"hpyfd\" /> That legislation was intended to revitalize the economy by creating millions of new jobs, increase American national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil, and preserve the planet by reducing [[greenhouse gas emissions]].<ref name=\"77mcR\" /> It passed the House in 2009, but was not voted on by the Senate in the [[111th Congress]].\n\n===Gun control===\nA supporter of [[gun control]], Engel has in Congress \"worked to [[Assault weapons legislation in the United States|ban assault weapons]], [[high-capacity magazine]]s and armor-piercing bullets, institute [[universal background check]]s, adopt [[extreme risk protection order]]s, and restore funding for gun violence research.\"<ref name=\"LKHs7\" /> Engel has received an \"F\" grade from the [[National Rifle Association]]<ref name=\"OnTheIssues\" /> and 100 percent ratings from the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]]<ref name=\"fVRqJ\" /> and [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]].<ref name=\"1e3MQ\" /> He voted against a [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act|2003 bill]] that immunized firearm manufacturers and dealers from civil liability for gun misuse, supports \"[[smart gun]]\" technology to prevent guns from being used by unauthorized persons, and voted against a bill to reduce the waiting period to purchase a gun at a gun show.<ref name=\"OnTheIssues\" /> In 2009, Engel was one of 53 members of Congress who signed a letter to President [[Barack Obama]], urging the new president to resume enforcement of a ban on the import  of foreign [[assault weapons]] (authorized by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] and enforced during the administrations of [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]]).<ref name=\"0Cfen\" /> In 2011, after 400,000 defective [[gun lock]]s were recalled from the market, Engel introduced a bill intended to protect parents and children from faulty gun locks by instructing the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) to set a national quality standard for all child safety devices used on firearms.<ref name=\"ScBIk\" />\n\n===Other domestic issues===\nOn December 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the [[Truth in Caller ID Act]]. The legislation was introduced by [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] in the Senate, passed the House on December 15, and is virtually identical to Rep. Engel's bill.<ref name=\"SaWyu\" /> The new law cracks down on the use of [[caller ID spoofing]], often used by criminals to trick their victims into giving out personal information. The legislation will help law enforcement combat [[identity theft]].\n\nRep. Engel originally introduced the Securing our Borders and Our Data Act in July 2008, HR 6702.<ref name=\"MSlAG\" /> That bill would ensure that when a traveler enters the United States, a border agent cannot search or seize the traveler's data or equipment without cause.<ref name=\"Wu3pr\" /> The legislation was re-introduced in the 111th Congress as HR 239.<ref name=\"tvvs7\" /> The [[Department of Homeland Security]] altered their rules to prevent agents from searching and seizing without cause.<ref name=\"Z0VTF\" /> This encompassed much of Rep. Engel's legislation.\n\nIn the 109th Congress, Engel introduced the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act, HR 3402.<ref name=\"x2MS4\" /> The bill was intended to stop some of the massive fraud in the prepaid calling card industry.<ref name=\"EY2kH\" /> The legislation passed the House unanimously, but the Senate did not act on it. In 2011, Rep. Engel introduced the [[Drug Testing Integrity Act]], which would prohibit products to be sold that enable cheating on drug tests.\n\nIn 2010, Engel urged the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] to stop their plan to ban private transfer fees on [[cooperative apartment]] sales. Some developers and investors had been [[abusing the system]] by imposing transfer fees that would have provided them with percentages on all future sales of the property over many decades. The transfer fee, when used correctly, can help owners and developers fund projects and remain affordable. The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Engel introduced [[SNOPA]], the Social Network Online Protection Act. It would guarantee online privacy and ensure that employers and educational institutions cannot use personal data as a bargaining chip for employment or education. Employers/schools would be barred from requesting or requiring usernames or passwords to social media sites as part of the hiring, employment, or enrollment process. The bill was re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]], with Rep. [[Michael Grimm (politician)|Michael Grimm]] as the Republican lead, and Rep. [[Jan Schakowski]] as an original co-sponsor.\n\n===International affairs===\n[[File:Nelson-Mandela-with-congressman-Engel.png|thumb|Engel with [[Nelson Mandela]]]]\nEngel is a supporter of recognizing [[Jerusalem]] as the capital of [[Israel]], and has also been an advocate for the causes of [[Albanian-Americans]] and ethnic [[Albanians]] in [[Kosovo]]. In 2003, he authored the [[Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act]], which was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 12, 2003.<ref name=\"qLAzE\" /> In this Law, Congress authorized penalties and restrictions on US relations with [[Syria]] for its occupation of [[Lebanon]], and for its relationship with terrorist groups. Syria withdrew all forces from Lebanon in 2005 after the [[Cedar Revolution]].\n\n====Western Hemisphere Subcommittee====\nAs Chairman of the House of Representatives [[Foreign Affairs]] Subcommittee on the [[Western Hemisphere]], Engel has called for stronger U.S. relations with [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. His Subcommittee has held hearings on issues such as the crisis in [[Haiti]], poverty, and inequality in Latin America.\n\nEngel pushed for increased funding for emergency relief in Haiti, and for Temporary Protective Status (TPS) of Haitian nationals in the U.S.<ref name=\"OAOzQ\" /> Engel is also supportive of the \"[[M\u00e9rida Initiative]]\", in which the U.S. is cooperating with [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and Haiti to counter [[narco-trafficking]] and related violence in the region. In the [[110th United States Congress]], he introduced the Social Investment and Economic Development Act for the Americas of 2007<ref name=\"ntC4y\" /> (re-introduced in 2009, where it also died in committee<ref name=\"q42Qu\" />) and sponsored the Western Hemisphere Energy Compact Act to develop partnerships to strengthen diplomatic relations with the Government of Brazil, and the governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere (died in committee).<ref name=\"VlJxI\" />\n\nThe bi-partisan Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2009 (sponsored by Rep. Engel) was passed by the House on December 8, 2009; it would have taken a fresh look at the United States' counter-narcotics efforts, both at home and abroad. The bill did not pass the Senate.<ref name=\"smbGN\" />\n\n====Middle East====\n[[File:Secretary Kerry, Senators McCain and Warner, House Minority Leader Pelosi, and Representative Engel Chat Before Greeting King Salman of Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|Engel before greeting the new King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]], in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]] in January 2015]]\nEngel is one of the leading congressional supporters of  [[Israel]]. Although he has supported resolutions critical of both Israelis and Palestinians, his criticisms of Israeli policies have usually been couched as warnings of their harm to Israel itself. In 2008, he was the lead Democrat on a resolution condemning [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian terrorist organizations.<ref name=\"76OW6\" /> Shortly after entering Congress, he sponsored a resolution declaring [[Jerusalem]] the undivided capital of Israel.<ref name=\"LFeZk\" /> A very pro-Israel position, this was contrary to official American policy until President Donald Trump adopted it in December, 2019. He also wrote the [[Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act]], which was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 12, 2003.<ref name=\"UNXmM\" /> This law authorized restrictions on American relations with [[Syria]], and penalties for its occupation of [[Lebanon]], and for its relationship with terrorist groups.\n\nIn January 2017, Engel introduced a House resolution condemning the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334|UN Security Council Resolution 2334]], which condemned [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlement building]] in the occupied [[Palestinian territories]] as a violation of international law.<ref name=\"ROANC\" />\n\n====Kosovo and the Balkans====\nIn 1996, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"The [[Kosovo]] cause has been kept alive in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by a small group of congressmen led by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.)....\"<ref name=\"CoDjw\" /> While a member of the Subcommittee on Europe and Chair of the Congressional Albanian Issues Caucus, Engel fought [[War Crimes in the Kosovo War#Ethnic cleansing|ethnic cleansing]] in the 1999 [[Kosovo War]] and voiced support in Congress for the unilateral [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]] from Serbia. A street has been named after him in [[Pej\u00eb]], and he was the first foreign dignitary to address the [[Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo parliament]].<ref name=\"gWljZ\" />\n\n====Cyprus====\nEngel called for the withdrawal of [[Turkey|Turkish]] troops from [[Cyprus]], and authored a resolution in 1996 calling for its [[demilitarization]]. His 1994 law allowed the [[United States Department of State]] to conduct an investigation of five Americans who disappeared during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], and found the remains of one.<ref name=\"xqZeA\" /> Engel received the [[George Paraskevaides]] Award on May 17, 2007, given to those who have utilized ancient [[wikt:Hellenic|Hellenic]] values to contribute to the nations and people of Cyprus and America and to the Hellenics in the modern world.<ref name=\"yuE00\" />\n\n====Iraq War====\nIn 2002, although 133 members of the House of Representatives voted against it, Engel voted for the resolution granting President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq, as did the two [[United States Senate|Senators]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Chuck Schumer]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and almost 300 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref name=\"tasyN\" /> After revelations that intelligence provided to Congress was partially unreliable, and the subsequent problems faced after [[Saddam Hussein]] was deposed, Engel has come to regret his decision to support the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and consistently votes in favor of gradual withdrawal. He has met with anti-war activists, and in 2008, he publicly called for the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. Engel received an \"A\" grade from the Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans in 2008.<ref name=\"7BCHv\" />\n\n====Irish affairs====\nIn 2007, Engel became a Co-Chair of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs. He supported the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]], and aided Irish nationals facing deportation from the United States.<ref name=\"9V2qw\" /> He has been a friend of [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]],<ref name=\"oct28\" /> and was the author of legislation that prohibits employers in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Ireland]] from receiving U.S. funds from the [[International Fund for Ireland]], unless they comply with fair employment and non-discrimination principles called the \"[[MacBride Principles]]\".<ref name=\"wygrW\" /> In 2010, Rep. Engel was instrumental in helping Joe Byrne return to the [[United States]], after a bureaucratic problem left him detained in Ireland and separated from his family in [[Rockland County]].\n\n====Human rights====\n[[File:Joshua Wong speaks at the US Capitol, 2019.jpg|thumb|230px|Engel with Hong Kong activists who have become prominent figures in the [[2019 Hong Kong protests]]]]\nAs a member of the [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]], Engel has supported [[Albanian-Americans]] and ethnic [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians]] in [[Kosovo]]. He is co-author of the [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], along with Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA), which addresses [[child labor]] in the cocoa fields of [[West Africa]].\n\nIn early 2001, he wrote the House resolution condemning the [[Taliban]] for forcing [[Hindu]] citizens to wear distinguishing marks as reminiscent of the [[Nazis]] forcing [[Jews]] to wear a yellow [[Star of David]].<ref name=\"blNGS\" /> In 2008, he wrote a resolution commending the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Promote Racial and Ethnic Equality.<ref name=\"sqYJ8\" />\n\nEngel sponsored a bill to support the [[Day of Silence]], during which students vow to remain silent to bring attention to the harassment and discrimination faced by [[lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender]] people in schools.<ref name=\"KXjsC\" /> That bill has been re-submitted in the [[111th United States Congress]].<ref name=\"HyUUt\" /> He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which allowed for states not to be required to recognize same-sex marriages in other states.<ref name=\"uMZhH\" /> In 2010, he voted in 2010 to repeal the \"[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]\" policy, enabling homosexuals to serve [[Coming out|openly]] in the U.S. Military.\n\nIn 2018, Engel condemned the [[2017\u2013present Rohingya genocide in Myanmar|genocide]] of the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya Muslim]] minority in [[Myanmar]] and called for a stronger response to the crisis.<ref name=\"W3S1Y\" />\n\nEngel urged the Trump administration to take a tougher line on [[China]] by imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who are responsible for [[Xinjiang re-education camps|human rights abuses]] against the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] [[Islam in China|Muslim]] minority in China's northwestern [[Xinjiang]] region. In March 2019, the group of lawmakers led by Engel wrote a letter to Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] that read in part, \"This issue is bigger than just China. It is about demonstrating to strongmen globally that the world will hold them accountable for their actions.\"<ref name=\"4B6xn\" />\n\n====Iran nuclear deal====\nIn August 2015, Engel announced that he would oppose the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] Iran nuclear deal in congress, saying that, \"The answers I've received simply don't convince me that this deal will keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran's hands, and may in fact strengthen Iran's position as a destabilizing and destructive influence across the Middle East.\"<ref name=\"KbL5a\" />\n\n==Controversies==\nIn March 2009, the Associated Press reported that Engel had been taking an annual [[tax credit]] on his [[Potomac, Maryland]] residence for at least ten years (cumulatively receiving thousands of dollars in tax credits), despite the fact that the credit is reserved for people who declare Maryland their primary residence. Maryland officials revoked the tax credit.<ref name=\"APTaxCredit\" /> The matter was reviewed by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which also looked into similar tax credits claimed by three other members of the House.<ref name=\"b9UXB\" /> The OCE eventually ended its review on Engel and two of the other members of Congress ([[Doris Matsui]] and [[Edolphus Towns]]) without recommending further investigation by the [[House Ethics Committee]].<ref name=\"oofcr\" />\n\nPublisher Christopher Hagedorn has often used his Bronx weekly newspapers, the ''Bronx News'', the ''Parkchester News'', and the ''Co-op City News'', to attack Engel.<ref name=\"columbia.edu\" /> Hagedorn believes that Engel, when he was still an assemblyman, was behind a failed effort in 1988 to evict the Co-op City News from its offices in Co-op City.<ref name=\"UD3nO\" /> Since 1988, Hagedorn has published numerous editorials and articles attacking Engel and even reprinted critical articles about him that have been published in other newspapers. Hagedorn has often endorsed Engel's opponents in the Democratic primary and the general election but the Congressman always won re-election to Congress. In 2000, Hagedorn intensified his campaign against Engel when the leadership of the powerful Bronx County Democratic organization decided to support former Assemblyman and City Councilman Larry Seabrook in the primary against Engel.<ref name=\"I8qN6\" /> Seabrook, whose campaign was plagued with problems, lost the primary to Engel by a wide margin.\n\nEngel has mostly ignored Hagedorn's attacks. In 1995, however, his then-communications director Greg Howard, told the Bronx Beat newspaper, which wrote about the feud, \"We don't consider Mr. Hagedorn a legitimate journalist. He uses the paper as his own personal platform for whatever agenda he has. He chooses the paper to malign people with whom he has philosophical differences.\"<ref name=\"columbia.edu\" /> In the last decade, Hagedorn's newspapers have mostly ignored Engel.\n\nIn July 2014, Engel appeared at a pro-Israel rally in New York City with anti-[[Muslim]] activist [[Pamela Geller]]. He was criticised for sharing a stage with Geller.<ref name=\"J7ew9\" />\n\nIn January 2020, he revealed that in a call after he was fired, [[John Bolton]] \"suggested to [him] \u2014 unprompted \u2014 that the [Foreign Affaairs Committee] look into the recall of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.\"<ref name=\"bolton-call\" />\n\n==Grades and recognition==\nEngel received an \"A\" on the [[Drum Major Institute]]'s 2005<ref name=\"V1acd\" /> Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues. He also received a 100% from the [[League of Conservation Voters]] for his record on the environment.\n\nEngel has received positive marks from major environmental groups such as the [[League of Conservation Voters]]<ref name=\"1my4s\" /> and the [[Sierra Club]].<ref name=\"WVPce\" />\n\nEngel received the \"National Association of Public Hospitals Safety Net Award\" in 2007 primarily for the introduction of The Public and Teaching Hospital Preservation Act.<ref name=\"PWj2X\" /> He also earned the \"100% Perfection in the Pursuit of Equality\" in 2002 from the [[Human Rights Campaign]].

He had started just 11 league games for City. Etuhu made his debut in a 0-1 victory at Bradford City and scored his first goal for the club in a 4-2 victory over Sheffield Wednesday a week later. Etuhu became a regular in the Preston side, playing alongside Sean Gregan in centre midfield replacing the injured Mark Rankine. He would go on to score two more goals in the 2001/02 season as Preston ultimately fell short of the playoffs losing manager David Moyes to Everton in March. \n\nPreston began 2002/03 season under the stewardship of new manager Craig Brown and whilst Etuhu was initially first choice in midfield, he soon found himself in and out of the side as Preston struggled to find consistency. Etuhu made 38 appearances in all competitions, adding to his goal tally as Preston finished the season in 12th. Preston's patchy form continued into 2003/04 as their impressive attack was let down by a poor backline despite a number of personnel changes. Etuhu again found himself, along with a number of other Preston players, in and out of the starting eleven as Brown looked to find his best side. Etuhu was reduced to 26 appearances as Preston finished 15th following a poor second half of the season which had seen them in danger of relegation and for the second season running, exit the FA Cup to Third Division opposition as they lost 2-1 to Swansea.\n\n2004/05 saw Preston reach their second playoff final in four years but despite beginning the season in Preston's midfield, Etuhu would only play a bit part in the campaign. Manager Craig Brown was sacked in August 2004 and replaced with assistant Billy Davies whose indifferent start resulted in Etuhu being relegated to the bench as Davies preferred a centre-midfield of Brian O'Neil and Paul McKenna alongside wingers Chris Sedgwick and Eddie Lewis. As Preston's formed picked up Etuhu found himself out of the matchday squad altogether but as the side closed in on the playoffs he returned to the bench making substitute appearances in the last 7 games including the 1-0 playoff final defeat to West Ham at Cardiff. \n\nIn August 2005 Etuhu began his third season in a row in the Preston midfield but indifferent form and the signings of Adam Nowland and David Jones meant he was again reduced to substitute appearances. By December 2005 Etuhu began to consider his future away from Deepdale as he repeatedly failed to make the matchday squad and in January 2006 he signed for Norwich on loan for the rest of the 2005/06 season. With Preston failing to include a clause to prevent Etuhu playing against his parent club his first game for Norwich was strangely against the Lilywhites at Carrow Road. During the match Etuhu all but sealed the end of his career at Deepdale with a clumsy challenge that broke Preston midfielder Adam Nowland's leg, an injury that would all but end Nowland's footballing career.\n\n===Norwich City===\n[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] signed him during the January transfer window for \u00a3450,000 after a loan deal initially brought him to the club. His form began to improve towards the end of the season and in the early stages of the 2006\u201307 campaign.\n\nEtuhu scored his first goal for Norwich in a 2\u20130 win against [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in a League Cup match on 23 August 2006, and got his first league goal for the club in a 3\u20133 draw at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on 12 September 2006. On 21 October 2006 he scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]] at Carrow Road to help his new manager [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]] win his first home game after replacing [[Nigel Worthington]].\n\nIt was incorrectly reported during September 2006 that following the 3\u20131 defeat at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], Etuhu and teammate [[Youssef Safri]] traded punches on the team bus on their return journey to [[East Anglia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/FOOTBALL-CANARIES-PUNCH-UP-article57470.html | title=FOOTBALL: CANARIES' PUNCH-UP | accessdate=2014-01-12}}</ref>\n\n===Sunderland===\nEtuhu signed for newly promoted [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in a deal worth \u00a31.5 million in the summer of 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6902275.stm |title=Sunderland complete Etuhu signing |date=17 July 2007 |work=BBC Sport}}</ref> On 9 February 2008, Etuhu scored his first goal for Sunderland in their home match against Wigan.

He had started just 11 league games for City. Etuhu made his debut in a 0-1 victory at Bradford City and scored his first goal for the club in a 4-2 victory over Sheffield Wednesday a week later. Etuhu became a regular in the Preston side, playing alongside Sean Gregan in centre midfield replacing the injured Mark Rankine. He would go on to score two more goals in the 2001/02 season as Preston ultimately fell short of the playoffs losing manager David Moyes to Everton in March. \n\nPreston began 2002/03 season under the stewardship of new manager Craig Brown and whilst Etuhu was initially first choice in midfield, he soon found himself in and out of the side as Preston struggled to find consistency. Etuhu made 38 appearances in all competitions, adding to his goal tally as Preston finished the season in 12th. Preston's patchy form continued into 2003/04 as their impressive attack was let down by a poor backline despite a number of personnel changes. Etuhu again found himself, along with a number of other Preston players, in and out of the starting eleven as Brown looked to find his best side. Etuhu was reduced to 26 appearances as Preston finished 15th following a poor second half of the season which had seen them in danger of relegation and for the second season running, exit the FA Cup to Third Division opposition as they lost 2-1 to Swansea.\n\n2004/05 saw Preston reach their second playoff final in four years but despite beginning the season in Preston's midfield, Etuhu would only play a bit part in the campaign. Manager Craig Brown was sacked in August 2004 and replaced with assistant Billy Davies whose indifferent start resulted in Etuhu being relegated to the bench as Davies preferred a centre-midfield of Brian O'Neil and Paul McKenna alongside wingers Chris Sedgwick and Eddie Lewis. As Preston's formed picked up Etuhu found himself out of the matchday squad altogether but as the side closed in on the playoffs he returned to the bench making substitute appearances in the last 7 games including the 1-0 playoff final defeat to West Ham at Cardiff. \n\nIn August 2005 Etuhu began his third season in a row in the Preston midfield but indifferent form and the signings of Adam Nowland and David Jones meant he was again reduced to substitute appearances. By December 2005 Etuhu began to consider his future away from Deepdale as he repeatedly failed to make the matchday squad and in January 2006 he signed for Norwich on loan for the rest of the 2005/06 season. With Preston failing to include a clause to prevent Etuhu playing against his parent club his first game for Norwich was strangely against the Lilywhites at Carrow Road. During the match Etuhu all but sealed the end of his career at Deepdale with a clumsy challenge that broke Preston midfielder Adam Nowland's leg, an injury that would all but end Nowland's footballing career.\n\n===Norwich City===\n[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] signed him during the January transfer window for \u00a3450,000 after a loan deal initially brought him to the club. His form began to improve towards the end of the season and in the early stages of the 2006\u201307 campaign.\n\nEtuhu scored his first goal for Norwich in a 2\u20130 win against [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in a League Cup match on 23 August 2006, and got his first league goal for the club in a 3\u20133 draw at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on 12 September 2006. On 21 October 2006 he scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]] at Carrow Road to help his new manager [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]] win his first home game after replacing [[Nigel Worthington]].\n\nIt was incorrectly reported during September 2006 that following the 3\u20131 defeat at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], Etuhu and teammate [[Youssef Safri]] traded punches on the team bus on their return journey to [[East Anglia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/FOOTBALL-CANARIES-PUNCH-UP-article57470.html | title=FOOTBALL: CANARIES' PUNCH-UP | accessdate=2014-01-12}}</ref>\n\n===Sunderland===\nEtuhu signed for newly promoted [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in a deal worth \u00a31.5 million in the summer of 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6902275.stm |title=Sunderland complete Etuhu signing |date=17 July 2007 |work=BBC Sport}}</ref> On 9 February 2008, Etuhu scored his first goal for Sunderland in their home match against Wigan.

Brown, alongside frequent collaborator [[Teddy Riley]], is noted as a pioneer of [[new jack swing]]; a fusion of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]].

Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.\n\nBrown also starred in films such as ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'' and ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]''. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005.

Brown's musical influences also include [[Rick James]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Marvin Gaye]], and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/bobby-brown/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy|title=Artist Influences for Bobby Brown|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref> \n\n==Music career== Toniyah Johnson Hit Bobby Brown On Stage\n\n===New Edition===\n{{Main|New Edition}}\nNew Edition was founded in 1981 by 12-year-old Brown and childhood friends [[Michael Bivins]] and Ricky Bell.<ref name=\"Jet\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq|title=Jet|publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]]|issn=0021-5996|date=1997-12-08|accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref> [[Ralph Tresvant]] joined the group at the suggestion of Bell who sang with Tresvant as a duo. Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew [[Ronnie DeVoe]], to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1982, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s Streetwise Records, who released their debut album ''[[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]''. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl,\" which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their [[New Edition|self-titled second release]]. The album included the crossover hits \"[[Cool It Now]]\" and \"[[Mr. Telephone Man]],\" which Brown also co-led.\n\nDespite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title= How Cruel Can Fame Be, Bobby Brown? |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 27, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-27/entertainment/ca-63_1_bobby-brown|accessdate=2010-11-25|first=Robert|last=Hilburn}}</ref> Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition.\" Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a [[VH-1]] ''[[Behind the Music]]'' documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members\u2014most prominently Tresvant\u2014against the decision.\n\n===Solo career===\nFollowing his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album ''[[King of Stage]]'' in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the ballad \"[[Girlfriend (Bobby Brown song)|Girlfriend]],\" but the album otherwise failed to perform well.\n\nBrown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&B producers and songwriters of the time, including [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Babyface]], [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Teddy Riley]]. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]''. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]],<ref name=\":9\" /> including the number-one single, the self-penned \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which became, along with \"[[Every Little Step]]\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step.\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bobby-brown|title=Bobby Brown|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ''Don't Be Cruel'' also garnered Brown two [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]].\n\nIn 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, ''[[Dance!...Ya Know It!]]'', was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the ''Don't Be Cruel'' project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement. In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 [[MTV Awards]], and Brown was set to release the album ''Mystical Magic'', but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day.  In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" by [[Glenn Medeiros]], making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend [[Ralph Tresvant]] on the latter's single \"[[Stone Cold Gentleman]]\", which was a top-five R&B hit.\n\nBrown's next album ''[[Bobby (Bobby Brown album)|Bobby]]'' wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era\u2014one that Brown had dominated\u2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"[[Humpin' Around]]\", \"[[Get Away (Bobby Brown song)|Get Away]],\" and \"Good Enough.\" He received his second [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] nomination for \"Humpin' Around.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> He received his third [[American Music Award]] in January 1993. However, sales of ''Bobby'' did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to [[Whitney Houston]], and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.  In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"[[Something in Common]],\" which was released as a single from the ''Bobby'' album.  Four years later he would release his fourth solo album ''[[Forever (Bobby Brown album)|Forever]]'', in 1997.  Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful.\n\nPrior to the release of ''Forever'', Brown had been in negotiations with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label [[Death Row East]]. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following ''Forever'', Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from ''[[The Benzino Project]]'', and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper [[Ja Rule]] on the song \"[[Thug Lovin']].\" Brown was signed to [[Murder Inc. Records]], but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to [[Damian Marley]]'s song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, ''[[Welcome to Jamrock]]''. \n\nIn 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled ''Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But'', written by author Derrick Handspike.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/news/author-reveals-why-bobby-brown-backed-ou/|title=Author Reveals Why Bobby Brown Backed Out of Tell-All Book Deal|last=|first=|date=December 16, 2009|website=Essence|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1584747/bobby-browns-autobiography-claims-whitney-houston-introduced-him-to-hard-drugs/|title=Bobby Brown's Autobiography Claims Whitney Houston Introduced Him To Hard Drugs|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=April 3, 2008|website=MTV|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But|last=Handspike|first=Derrick|publisher=Over The Edge Books|year=2012|isbn=9781467519441|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer [[Macy Gray]] on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album ''[[The Sellout (album)|The Sellout]]''.

However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.\n\nIn 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death of the group's idol Michael Jackson]], all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of [[Jackson 5]] hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year. As of 2016, Brown and New Edition continue to perform together.\n\n==Film and television career==\n[[File:Vernae Taylor (left) Bobby Brown and Katrina Robinson.jpg|thumb|right|Brown with performing artist Vernae Taylor (left) and Katrina Robinson (right), at the Circle of Sisters event in 2018.]]\nBrown made his acting debut with a cameo appearance in the 1989 film, ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', playing the Mayor's doorman. The following year, he appeared in the HBO kids show, ''[[Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme]]'' playing all three characters of Three Blind Mice. In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'', and had a major role in the [[Martin Lawrence]] film, ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]''. Brown made other guest appearances in the films, ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]'', ''[[Gang of Roses]]'', ''[[Nora's Hair Salon]]'' and ''Go for Broke''.\n\nIn 2005, Brown signed a deal with [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] to overlook the direction of the reality series, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', but it was said{{by whom|date=June 2018}} that he had to convince producers that his then-wife Whitney Houston would appear on the show. Houston later told [[Oprah Winfrey]] that she agreed to do it because she \"loved him\" and \"did whatever he asked because I was his wife.\" ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\".<ref>Barry Garron, [https://www.today.com/popculture/being-bobby-brown-disgusting-wbna8409211 \"'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting\"], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.</ref> Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot.<ref>Steve Rogers, [http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php \"Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season\"], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.</ref> The show lasted one season but received bad reviews in the duration of its run, leading to a fallout in both singers' careers; it ended in 2006 after Houston refused to appear in a second season.

After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1982, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s Streetwise Records, who released their debut album ''[[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]''. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl,\" which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their [[New Edition|self-titled second release]]. The album included the crossover hits \"[[Cool It Now]]\" and \"[[Mr. Telephone Man]],\" which Brown also co-led.\n\nDespite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title= How Cruel Can Fame Be, Bobby Brown? |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 27, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-27/entertainment/ca-63_1_bobby-brown|accessdate=2010-11-25|first=Robert|last=Hilburn}}</ref> Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition.\" Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a [[VH-1]] ''[[Behind the Music]]'' documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members\u2014most prominently Tresvant\u2014against the decision.\n\n===Solo career===\nFollowing his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album ''[[King of Stage]]'' in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the ballad \"[[Girlfriend (Bobby Brown song)|Girlfriend]],\" but the album otherwise failed to perform well.\n\nBrown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&B producers and songwriters of the time, including [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Babyface]], [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Teddy Riley]]. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]''. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]],<ref name=\":9\" /> including the number-one single, the self-penned \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which became, along with \"[[Every Little Step]]\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step.\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bobby-brown|title=Bobby Brown|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ''Don't Be Cruel'' also garnered Brown two [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]].\n\nIn 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, ''[[Dance!...Ya Know It!]]'', was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the ''Don't Be Cruel'' project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement. In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 [[MTV Awards]], and Brown was set to release the album ''Mystical Magic'', but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day.  In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" by [[Glenn Medeiros]], making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend [[Ralph Tresvant]] on the latter's single \"[[Stone Cold Gentleman]]\", which was a top-five R&B hit.\n\nBrown's next album ''[[Bobby (Bobby Brown album)|Bobby]]'' wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era\u2014one that Brown had dominated\u2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"[[Humpin' Around]]\", \"[[Get Away (Bobby Brown song)|Get Away]],\" and \"Good Enough.\" He received his second [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] nomination for \"Humpin' Around.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> He received his third [[American Music Award]] in January 1993. However, sales of ''Bobby'' did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to [[Whitney Houston]], and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.  In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"[[Something in Common]],\" which was released as a single from the ''Bobby'' album.  Four years later he would release his fourth solo album ''[[Forever (Bobby Brown album)|Forever]]'', in 1997.  Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful.\n\nPrior to the release of ''Forever'', Brown had been in negotiations with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label [[Death Row East]]. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following ''Forever'', Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from ''[[The Benzino Project]]'', and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper [[Ja Rule]] on the song \"[[Thug Lovin']].\" Brown was signed to [[Murder Inc. Records]], but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to [[Damian Marley]]'s song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, ''[[Welcome to Jamrock]]''. \n\nIn 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled ''Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But'', written by author Derrick Handspike.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/news/author-reveals-why-bobby-brown-backed-ou/|title=Author Reveals Why Bobby Brown Backed Out of Tell-All Book Deal|last=|first=|date=December 16, 2009|website=Essence|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1584747/bobby-browns-autobiography-claims-whitney-houston-introduced-him-to-hard-drugs/|title=Bobby Brown's Autobiography Claims Whitney Houston Introduced Him To Hard Drugs|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=April 3, 2008|website=MTV|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But|last=Handspike|first=Derrick|publisher=Over The Edge Books|year=2012|isbn=9781467519441|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer [[Macy Gray]] on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album ''[[The Sellout (album)|The Sellout]]''.

A full-fledged reunion occurred with the 1996 release of the album, ''[[Home Again (New Edition album)|Home Again]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73551/update-bobby-brown-arrested-in-atlanta|title=Update: Bobby Brown Arrested In Atlanta|last=|first=|date=November 7, 2002|website=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> Brown contributed lead vocals on two hit singles, \"Hit Me Off\" and \"[[You Don't Have to Worry (New Edition song)|You Don't Have to Worry]]\". However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.\n\nIn 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death of the group's idol Michael Jackson]], all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of [[Jackson 5]] hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year. As of 2016, Brown and New Edition continue to perform together.\n\n==Film and television career==\n[[File:Vernae Taylor (left) Bobby Brown and Katrina Robinson.jpg|thumb|right|Brown with performing artist Vernae Taylor (left) and Katrina Robinson (right), at the Circle of Sisters event in 2018.]]\nBrown made his acting debut with a cameo appearance in the 1989 film, ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', playing the Mayor's doorman. The following year, he appeared in the HBO kids show, ''[[Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme]]'' playing all three characters of Three Blind Mice. In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'', and had a major role in the [[Martin Lawrence]] film, ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]''. Brown made other guest appearances in the films, ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]'', ''[[Gang of Roses]]'', ''[[Nora's Hair Salon]]'' and ''Go for Broke''.\n\nIn 2005, Brown signed a deal with [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] to overlook the direction of the reality series, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', but it was said{{by whom|date=June 2018}} that he had to convince producers that his then-wife Whitney Houston would appear on the show. Houston later told [[Oprah Winfrey]] that she agreed to do it because she \"loved him\" and \"did whatever he asked because I was his wife.\" ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\".<ref>Barry Garron, [https://www.today.com/popculture/being-bobby-brown-disgusting-wbna8409211 \"'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting\"], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.</ref> Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot.<ref>Steve Rogers, [http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php \"Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season\"], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.</ref> The show lasted one season but received bad reviews in the duration of its run, leading to a fallout in both singers' careers; it ended in 2006 after Houston refused to appear in a second season. The couple divorced soon after.\n\nIn June 2007, Brown took part in the ITV television series \"24 hours with...\", a chat show format as celebrity and interviewer spend an intense 24 hours locked in a room together. The show's host, [[Jamie Campbell (British documentary filmmaker)|Jamie Campbell]], asked Brown questions about his career and private life, and infamously joked about making \"sexual moves\" towards the singer.

He was the son of the previous chief, Hugh Duff O'Sheridan of Togher townland, Kilmore parish, County Cavan. William was the ancestor of the famous Sheridan theatrical family. William died sometime before 1638 leaving two sons, Owen (of [[Mullaghmore, Tullyhunco]] townland, Kildallan parish) and Patrick (of [[Raleagh]] townland, Kildallan parish). Owen Sheridan succeeded to his father's lands and this was confirmed by a grant to him by [[Charles I of England]] dated 6 March 1637. Owen's son Denis was born in 1612 and became a Catholic priest in charge of Kildrumferton parish, County Cavan.

Joint combat operations are one illustration of that. In Karaula and Visoko in 1992, at Mount Zmajevac around mid-April 1993 and in the Bila valley in June 1993, the Mujahedin fought alongside ARBiH units against Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat forces.\"<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the ICTY Appeals Chamber in April 2008 concluded that the relationship between the 3rd Corps of the Bosnian Army headed by Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and the El Mud\u017eahid detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack them as if they were a distinct enemy force.<ref name=\"un.org\" />{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Propaganda==\nAlthough Serb and Croat media created much controversy about alleged war crimes committed by the squad, no indictment was issued by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] against any of these foreign volunteers. According to the ICTY verdicts, Serb propaganda was very active, constantly propagating false information about the foreign fighters in order to inflame [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] hatred among Serbs. After the takeover of [[Prijedor]] by Serb forces in 1992, Radio Prijedor propagated Serb nationalistic ideas characterising prominent non-Serbs as criminals and extremists who should be punished. One example of such propaganda was the derogatory language used for referring to non-Serbs such as \"Mujahedin\", \"''[[Usta\u0161e]]''\" or \"[[Zelene beretke|Green Berets]]\", although at the time there were no foreign volunteers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ICTY concluded in the [[Milomir Staki\u0107]] verdict that, Mile Muti\u0107, the director of the local paper ''Kozarski Vjesnik'' and the journalist Rade Muti\u0107 regularly attended meetings of Serb politicians (local authorities) in order to be informed about the next steps for spreading propaganda.<ref name=\"ICTY: Milomir Staki\u0107 judgement - The media\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/stakic/trialc/judgement/sta-tj030731e.htm#ID2di|title=ICTY: Milomir Staki\u0107 judgement - The media}}</ref><ref name=\"ICTY: Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 judgement - Greater Serbia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/tadic/trialc2/judgement/tad-tj970507e.htm#_Toc387417236|title=ICTY: Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 judgement - Greater Serbia}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nAnother example of propaganda about \"Islamic holy warriors\" is presented in the ICTY Kordi\u0107 and \u010cerkez verdict for war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] leadership on Bosniak civilians. [[Gornji Vakuf]] was attacked by [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) in January 1993 followed by heavy shelling of the town by Croat artillery. During [[cease-fire]] negotiations at the Britbat HQ in Gornji Vakuf, Colonel Andri\u0107, representing the HVO, demanded that the Bosnian forces lay down their arms and accept HVO control of the town, threatening that if they did not agree he would flatten Gornji Vakuf to the ground.<ref name=\"ICTY: Kordi\u0107 and \u010cerkez verdict - IV.

After the village of Maline was taken, a military police unit of the 306th Brigade of Bosnian Army arrived in Maline.

The commander of the 306th Brigade authorised the wounded be put onto a truck and transported to Mehurici. A number of mujahideen stormed the village of Maline, and even though the commander of the Bosnian Army 306th Brigade forbade them to approach, they did not obey.

On 13 August 1993, the Bosnian government officially organized foreign volunteers into the detachment known as ''El Mud\u017eahid'' in order to impose control and order. Initially, the foreign mujahideen gave food and other basic necessities to the local Muslim population, who were deprived of such by the Serb forces. Once hostilities broke out between the Bosnian government and the Croat forces (HVO), the mujahideen also participated in battles against the HVO alongside ARBiH units.<ref name=\"icty judgement\">ICTY: Summary of the judgement for Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and [[Amir Kubura]] - {{cite web|url=http://secnet069.un.org/x/cases/hadzihasanovic_kubura/cis/en/cis_hadzihasanovic_kubura_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728142657/http://secnet069.un.org/x/cases/hadzihasanovic_kubura/cis/en/cis_hadzihasanovic_kubura_en.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 }}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe foreign mujahideen recruited local young men, offering them military training, uniforms and weapons.

The foreign volunteers even became unpopular with many of the Bosniak population, because the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian army]] had thousands of troops and had no need for more soldiers, but rather for arms. Many Bosnian Army officers and intellectuals were suspicious of the foreign volunteers arrival in the central part of the country, because they came from [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zagreb]] in Croatia, and were passed through the self-proclaimed [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] without problems, unlike Bosnian Army soldiers who were regularly arrested by Croat forces. {{citation needed|reason=cit needed for para|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe first mujahideen training camp was located in Poljanice next to the village of [[Mehurici]], in the [[Bila River (Romania)|Bila]] valley, [[Travnik]] municipality.

The mujahideen from Poljanice camp were also established in the towns of [[Zenica]] and Travnik and, from the second half of 1993 onwards, in the village of [[Ora\u0161ac, Croatia|Orasac]], also located in the Bila valley.<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/><ref>[http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=6540 Spero News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123230849/http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=6540 |date=2006-11-23 }}, Bosnia: Muslims upset by Wahhabi leaders, Adrian Morgan, 13 November 2006</ref>\n\nThe military effectiveness of the mujahideen is disputed.

According to a UN communiqu\u00e9 of 1995, the El Mud\u017eahid battalion was \"directly dependent on Bosnian staff for supplies\" and for \"directions\" during combat with the Serb forces.<ref>[http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_07_16/feature.html The American Conservative], The Bosnian Connection, by Brendan O\u2019Neill, 16 July 2007</ref> The issue has formed part of two ICTY war crimes trials against two former senior officials in the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis of superior criminal responsibility. In its Trial Chamber judgement in the case of ICTY v.

Accordingly, the Prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the foreign Mujahedin officially joined the ARBiH and that they were ''de iure'' subordinated to the Accused Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and [[Amir Kubura]].<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/></blockquote>\n\nIt also found that\n\n<blockquote>there are significant indicia of a subordinate relationship between the Mujahedin and the Accused ''prior'' to August 13, 1993. Testimony heard by the Trial Chamber and, in the main, documents tendered into evidence demonstrate that the ARBiH maintained a close relationship with the foreign Mujahedin as soon as these arrived in central Bosnia in 1992. Joint combat operations are one illustration of that. In Karaula and Visoko in 1992, at Mount Zmajevac around mid-April 1993 and in the Bila valley in June 1993, the Mujahedin fought alongside ARBiH units against Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat forces.\"<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the ICTY Appeals Chamber in April 2008 concluded that the relationship between the 3rd Corps of the Bosnian Army headed by Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and the El Mud\u017eahid detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack them as if they were a distinct enemy force.<ref name=\"un.org\" />{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Propaganda==\nAlthough Serb and Croat media created much controversy about alleged war crimes committed by the squad, no indictment was issued by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] against any of these foreign volunteers. According to the ICTY verdicts, Serb propaganda was very active, constantly propagating false information about the foreign fighters in order to inflame [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] hatred among Serbs. After the takeover of [[Prijedor]] by Serb forces in 1992, Radio Prijedor propagated Serb nationalistic ideas characterising prominent non-Serbs as criminals and extremists who should be punished. One example of such propaganda was the derogatory language used for referring to non-Serbs such as \"Mujahedin\", \"''[[Usta\u0161e]]''\" or \"[[Zelene beretke|Green Berets]]\", although at the time there were no foreign volunteers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ICTY concluded in the [[Milomir Staki\u0107]] verdict that, Mile Muti\u0107, the director of the local paper ''Kozarski Vjesnik'' and the journalist Rade Muti\u0107 regularly attended meetings of Serb politicians (local authorities) in order to be informed about the next steps for spreading propaganda.<ref name=\"ICTY: Milomir Staki\u0107 judgement - The media\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/stakic/trialc/judgement/sta-tj030731e.htm#ID2di|title=ICTY: Milomir Staki\u0107 judgement - The media}}</ref><ref name=\"ICTY: Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 judgement - Greater Serbia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/tadic/trialc2/judgement/tad-tj970507e.htm#_Toc387417236|title=ICTY: Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 judgement - Greater Serbia}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nAnother example of propaganda about \"Islamic holy warriors\" is presented in the ICTY Kordi\u0107 and \u010cerkez verdict for war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] leadership on Bosniak civilians.

She was accompanied by Mrs Mabel Crichton, the wife of a friend.  The actress knew of the danger of being hit by a submarine in British territorial waters and she was not confident that the ship could outrace a submarine and, as she put it, was \"in a state\" for much of the voyage. She and Mabel Crichton (who did not survive the sinking) became friendly  with their tablemates: Max Schwarcz and Francis Bertram Jenkins. However, despite the convivial company on board Brandell never got over her feeling of dread. Jenkins did not help matters by pointing out the shortage of lifebelts on board. Brandell begged Mabel Crichton to allow her to stay the night in Crichton's cabin because she was so frightened. Crichton welcomed Brandell into her cabin and spent most of the night trying to reassure her that nothing would happen to them. However, Brandell's fears were proved right and the next day on May 7, 1915 the Lusitania [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|was torpedoed]] by a German submarine and sank. In her written deposition to the authorities Brandell wrote:\n[[File:Josephine Mary Brandell The Graphic 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Josephine Mary Brandell photographed for ''[[The Graphic]]'' (1915)]]\n<blockquote>\n\"Dear Sir,\n\nI am replying to your request in giving my statement to the best of my recollection about the sinking of the Lusitania.\n\nI had just finished making a collection for the musicians and sat down to finish my lunch where Mrs. N.

In fact I was nervous during the whole trip; so much so, that I kept worrying my friends about fearing the sub-marines.\n\nThursday night I was in a state that I could not sleep in my own cabin, so I asked Mrs. Crigchton (sic.) if I could sleep in her cabin,  \u201cPoor soul\u201d, she was only too happy to be of any assistance to me and did all she could during the whole night to quiet my nerves.  The next morning I heard the hooting of the horn as it was foggy.  Everything went well {{sic|untill}} I sat down to lunch when the explosion occurred.  The people rushed for the stairs.  I heard someone shouting to be calm.  I looked up and saw it was one of the captains.  I cannot say whether it was the first or the second...\n\n...When we finally reached the top deck, I saw very few of the first class passengers.  I was simply horrified with fright.  Mr. Schwartz\u2019s trying to calm me when Mr. E. Gorer, (the art dealer of Bond Street) rushed over to us and put a life-belt on me which was the means of my being saved and told me to be brave.  He returning for other life-belts and Mr. Schwartz after putting me into the boat where Mrs. {{sic|Crigchton}} was already sitting, went to help other women.  That\u2019s the last I saw of those two brave heroes.  Just then our boat was lowered but immediately it hit the water it upset, throwing all its occupants out.  About six were saved from that boat which contained 60 or 70 passengers.  The sights I saw when that boat upset is too awful.  Words cannot describe it.  A rope was thrown to us which a few caught hold of.  I then remember a few of us getting hold of an oar, but some of them soon dropped off.  The cries for mercy, the people drowning and coming up again within three minutes time barely touching me was too terrible.  Somehow I caught hold of a deck chair which was floating near me and held on until I became numb when I was picked up by Mr. Harkness, the assistant purser, who afterwards told me he thought I was gone when he first looked at me.\n\nThere were plenty of life-belts on board but there was not any time to get at them.  I did not see any guns, {{sic|amunition}} or Canadian troops.  The discipline was alright from what I saw.  I was only five minutes on the Lusitania after she had been struck.  The first boat and the second in which I was in were upset, the reason I cannot tell.  I did not hear any explosion after the first.  I may add that we ought to have gone faster than 16 knots an hour in the War Zone and a Cruiser should have been sent by the Admiralty to meet us.\n\nYours truly\n\nJosephine Brandell\n\nP.S.

She was accompanied by Mrs Mabel Crichton, the wife of a friend.  The actress knew of the danger of being hit by a submarine in British territorial waters and she was not confident that the ship could outrace a submarine and, as she put it, was \"in a state\" for much of the voyage. She and Mabel Crichton (who did not survive the sinking) became friendly  with their tablemates: Max Schwarcz and Francis Bertram Jenkins. However, despite the convivial company on board Brandell never got over her feeling of dread. Jenkins did not help matters by pointing out the shortage of lifebelts on board. Brandell begged Mabel Crichton to allow her to stay the night in Crichton's cabin because she was so frightened. Crichton welcomed Brandell into her cabin and spent most of the night trying to reassure her that nothing would happen to them. However, Brandell's fears were proved right and the next day on May 7 1915 the Lusitania [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|was torpedoed]] by a German submarine and sank. In her written deposition to the authorities Brandell wrote:\n[[File:Josephine Mary Brandell The Graphic 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Josephine Mary Brandell photographed for ''[[The Graphic]]'' (1915)]]\n<blockquote>\n\"Dear Sir,\n\nI am replying to your request in giving my statement to the best of my recollection about the sinking of the Lusitania.\n\nI had just finished making a collection for the musicians and sat down to finish my lunch where Mrs. N.

[[West Leeds High School]] opened in 1907 based at the Old School Lofts building on Whingate.

Construction begun in 2008, on the fields opposite to the [[West Leeds High School]] site and the \u00a325&nbsp;million build was completed by August 2009.

The main site with the older pupils was located on the fields of the previous [[West Leeds High school]] with a capacity for 1,200 students. The younger pupils (Years 7 and 8) were located at the site which had been previously the [[Wortley High School]] buildings, as the full school roll was 1600 pupils in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Education bosses have been accused of getting their sums badly wrong over a new \u00a320m school in Leeds|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/leeds-schools-bosses-get-their-sums-wrong-1-2208438|accessdate=4 December 2015|publisher=The Yorkshire Post|date=3 April 2009}}</ref> Due to falling pupil numbers, in July 2011 the [[Wortley High School]] site was closed and all students were moved to the Upper Site, so that the school became a single-site school in September 2011.

[[West Leeds High School]] opened in 1907 based at the Old School Lofts building on Whingate. [[West Leeds High School]] had separate Girls and Boys sites, with girls based initially on Congress Mount until they finally merged into a new school site in the 1940s.\n\nIn 2006 the local authority gained agreement from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to rebuild the schools. Construction begun in 2008, on the fields opposite to the [[West Leeds High School]] site and the \u00a325&nbsp;million build was completed by August 2009. It was decided to call the new school Swallow Hill, in order to reflect the local area of Swallow Hill (The area located between both predecessor schools).\n\nIn September 2009 Swallow Hill Community College opened with Bernard Knowles as the headteacher,<ref>{{cite news|title=Double Celebrations as Two City Schools Get Set for Merger|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/double-celebrations-as-two-city-schools-get-set-for-merger-1-2180817|accessdate=4 December 2015|publisher=The Yorkshire Post|date=8 May 2008}}</ref> using the two sites of [[West Leeds High School]] and [[Wortley High School]]. The main site with the older pupils was located on the fields of the previous [[West Leeds High school]] with a capacity for 1,200 students. The younger pupils (Years 7 and 8) were located at the site which had been previously the [[Wortley High School]] buildings, as the full school roll was 1600 pupils in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Education bosses have been accused of getting their sums badly wrong over a new \u00a320m school in Leeds|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/leeds-schools-bosses-get-their-sums-wrong-1-2208438|accessdate=4 December 2015|publisher=The Yorkshire Post|date=3 April 2009}}</ref> Due to falling pupil numbers, in July 2011 the [[Wortley High School]] site was closed and all students were moved to the Upper Site, so that the school became a single-site school in September 2011.

Commenting on the 2015 exam results the Academy initially declined to release exam results at all, and posted the following statement on its website, which was still up in December 2015, {{quote|text=''The drop in the headline figure in 2015, after two years of improving results, was unexpected and we appear to have been caught up in some nationally publicised issues in both English and mathematics GCSE.
