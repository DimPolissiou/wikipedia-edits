Also included are short films, cutscene films (made up of cutscenes and cinematics from the actual games), documentaries with video games as their subjects and films in which video games play a large part (such as ''[[Tron]]'' or ''[[WarGames]]'').\n\nFilms based on video games have often received negative reviews.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.

The USD(R&E) and the office s/he heads are charged with the development and oversight of DoD technology strategy for the DoD.  The post (or effectively the same post) has at various times had the titles '''Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering''' ('''ASD(R&E)'''), or '''Director of Defense Research and Engineering''' ('''DDR&E''').  The latter title has itself historically varied between the rank of under secretary and that of assistant secretary.\n\nUSD(R&E) is the principal staff advisor for research and engineering matters to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary]] and Deputy Secretary of Defense. In this capacity, USD(R&E) serves as the [[Chief Technology Officer]] (CTO) for the Department of Defense charged with the development and oversight of DoD technology strategy in concert with the department\u2019s current and future requirements. The goal of USD(R&E) is to extend the capabilities of current war fighting systems, develop breakthrough capabilities, hedge against an uncertain future through a set of scientific and engineering options and counter strategic surprise.  USD(R&E) also provides advice and assistance in developing policies for rapid technology transition.\n\nFrom 1987 until 1 February 2018, ASD(R&E) was subordinate to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  On 1 February 2018, the research and engineering were split into an independent office, with the head position being elevated from an assistant secretary to an under secretary level.  The remaining acquisition office became the Office of the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment]] (A&S).<ref name=\":1\" />  The current under secretary is [[Michael D.

In June 1953, President Eisenhower\u2019s Reorganization Plan No. 6 abolished the boards as such, and created six new Assistant Secretaries of Defense. Two of these assistant secretary positions\u2014Applications Engineering, and Research and Development\u2014were combined in March 1957 to become the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)).\n\nUnder the DoD Reorganization Act of 1958 (PL 85-599, effective 6 August 1958), the position of ASD(R&E) was abolished and replaced by a Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E).\n\nFrom 19 May 1961, until 15 July 1965, a Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering held the additional title of ASD(R&E), on the theory that this position reported to, in rank, an under secretary\u2014the DDR&E.  On 21 October 1977, PL 95-140 made the rank of the DDR&E unambiguous by renaming it to the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)).\n\nThe history of Department of Defense management of science and technology up to the 1980s is described at greater length in a report available from the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC).<ref>O'Neil, William D. and Gene H. Porter, \u201cWhat to Buy?

A subordinate position at the assistant secretary level was reestablished with the previous title DDR&E.  However, budget control of the technology portfolio was kept by USD(AT&L), diminishing the importance of the DDR&E position subsequently.\n\nOn 7 January 2011, President Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act with several redesignated titles within the Department of Defense. These changes included renaming the DDR&E as, once again, ASD(R&E).<ref name=\"asd_re\">[http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/index.html Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126215523/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/index.html |date=26 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOn 1 February 2018, the Office of the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics]] was split into two new offices: the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (R&E) and the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S), as a result of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2018/02/01/the-pentagons-acquisition-office-is-gone-heres-what-the-next-120-days-bring/|title=The Pentagon\u2019s acquisition office is gone.

The USD(R&E) and the office s/he heads are charged with the development and oversight of DoD technology strategy for the DoD.  The post (or effectively the same post) has at various times had the titles '''Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering''' ('''ASD(R&E)'''), or '''Director of Defense Research and Engineering''' ('''DDR&E''').  The latter title has itself historically varied between the rank of under secretary and that of assistant secretary.\n\nUSD(R&E) is the principal staff advisor for research and engineering matters to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary]] and Deputy Secretary of Defense. In this capacity, USD(R&E) serves as the [[Chief Technology Officer]] (CTO) for the Department of Defense charged with the development and oversight of DoD technology strategy in concert with the department\u2019s current and future requirements. The goal of USD(R&E) is to extend the capabilities of current war fighting systems, develop breakthrough capabilities, hedge against an uncertain future through a set of scientific and engineering options and counter strategic surprise.  USD(R&E) also provides advice and assistance in developing policies for rapid technology transition.\n\nFrom 1987 until 1 February 2018, ASD(R&E) was subordinate to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  On 1 February 2018, the research and engineering were split into an independent office, with the head position being elevated from an assistant secretary to an under secretary level.  The remaining acquisition office became the Office of the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment]] (A&S).<ref name=\":1\" />  The current under secretary is [[Michael D.

In June 1953, President Eisenhower\u2019s Reorganization Plan No. 6 abolished the boards as such, and created six new Assistant Secretaries of Defense. Two of these assistant secretary positions\u2014Applications Engineering, and Research and Development\u2014were combined in March 1957 to become the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)).\n\nUnder the DoD Reorganization Act of 1958 (PL 85-599, effective 6 August 1958), the position of ASD(R&E) was abolished and replaced by a Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E).\n\nFrom 19 May 1961, until 15 July 1965, a Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering held the additional title of ASD(R&E), on the theory that this position reported to, in rank, an under secretary\u2014the DDR&E.  On 21 October 1977, PL 95-140 made the rank of the DDR&E unambiguous by renaming it to the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)).\n\nThe history of Department of Defense management of science and technology up to the 1980s is described at greater length in a report available from the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC).<ref>O'Neil, William D. and Gene H. Porter, \u201cWhat to Buy? The Role of Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E): Lessons from the 1970s,\u201d IDA Paper P-4675 (Alexandria, Virginia: Institute for Defense Analyses, Jan 2011) http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA549549.</ref>\n\nThe Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986 expanded the scope of USD(R&E) position to encompass acquisition and logistics, as well as technology, and it was renamed USD(AT&L).  A subordinate position at the assistant secretary level was reestablished with the previous title DDR&E.  However, budget control of the technology portfolio was kept by USD(AT&L), diminishing the importance of the DDR&E position subsequently.\n\nOn 7 January 2011, President Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act with several redesignated titles within the Department of Defense. These changes included renaming the DDR&E as, once again, ASD(R&E).<ref name=\"asd_re\">[http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/index.html Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126215523/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/index.html |date=26 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOn 1 February 2018, the Office of the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics]] was split into two new offices: the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (R&E) and the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S), as a result of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2018/02/01/the-pentagons-acquisition-office-is-gone-heres-what-the-next-120-days-bring/|title=The Pentagon\u2019s acquisition office is gone.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

Banneker was employed directly by Ellicott and did not at any time, as far as can be determined, work with or for L'Enfant.\"</ref> In late February 1792, [[Presidency of George Washington|President George Washington]] dismissed L'Enfant, who had failed to have his plan published and who was experiencing frequent conflicts with the three Commissioners that Washington had appointed to supervise the planning and survey of the federal district and city.<ref name=planning/><ref name=\"Bowling\">Bowling</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/details/centennialhisto00woolgoog/page/n112 Crew, pp. 101-102] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111093014/https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA101&id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ |date=2015-11-11}}<br/>(2) {{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~docktor/wmslogo.htm |title=Plan of the City of Washington|publisher=Washington Map Society|date=1997-03-22|accessdate=2012-06-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623142642/http://home.earthlink.net/~docktor/wmslogo.htm |archivedate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Silvio Bedini with bust of Thomas Jefferson 1981.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><sup>[[Smithsonian Institution]]</sup><br />Silvio Bedini (1981)</div>]]\nA number of undocumented stories connecting Benjamin Banneker with the planning and survey of the federal capital city have appeared over the years.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

Graham's notes on her sources stated that she had constructed the book's story \"within the framework of little known true facts\".

All dates and main events can be documented. All gaps have been filled in with incidents of whose probablity I am convinced\".</ref> However, when describing Graham's book in a 1972 biography of Banneker, Bedini stated that her work had been written for children, was highly fictionalized and, having become popular, had \"resulted in yet more confusion concerning Banneker's achievements and their importance\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/300/mode/1up/search/Graham Bedini, 1972, p. 300.]</ref>\n\nGraham's account of Banneker's involvement in the origins of the District of Columbia stated that Banneker worked with L'Enfant during the planning and survey of the federal district. Her story told that in early 1792, L'Enfant \"packed everything and departed --- taking the plans with him.\" When Banneker learned of this, he took an adventurous trip to his home in [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]], Maryland. While at home, Banneker reconstructed L'Enfant's plan from memory within a three-day period.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126/mode/1up Bedini, 1972, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

The new department was established in May of the same year. The IU School of Medicine was admitted as a member of the American Association of American Medical Colleges ([[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]]) in 1904. \n\n===Founding in Indianapolis, 1908===\nIn addition to its department of medicine in Bloomington, IU's leaders wanted to locate medical training facilities in Indianapolis. Their initial plan was to provide medical students with the first two years of coursework at Bloomington and the final two years at Indianapolis, where students would receive clinically-based training as part of their studies.<ref name=\"Gray13\">{{cite book|url=|title=IUPUI\u2013The Making of an Urban University|author=Ralph D. Gray|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780253342423|edition=|series=|volume=|location=Bloomington|page=13}}</ref> Prior to 1908, due primarily to the high cost of establishing its own medical facilities in Indianapolis, IU attempted to merge with existing medical schools, but the effort was not successful.<ref>IU's relationship with the Indiana Medical College, organized in Indianapolis in 1869, was dissolved in 1876; other early efforts to establish a training facility in Indianapolis also failed. A proposed merger with the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons, organized in Indianapolis in 1873, did not materialize in 1903, and no agreement was reached to merge with the Medical College of Indiana in 1904. See Myers, pp. 62, 71\u201373.</ref> \n\nBetween 1905 and 1908 there continued to be a debate over which university, IU or Purdue, could establish a state-supported, four-year medical school at Indianapolis.<ref>IU believed that under a legislative act approved on February 15, 1838, it had the authorization to provide instruction in medicine, as well as other professional fields, but the development of a four-year, state-supported medical school was delayed due to lack of sufficient funding. See Gray, pp. 14\u201316, and Myers, pp. 63\u201364.</ref> In 1905, Purdue University's Medical Department joined with the Medical Department of the University of Indianapolis (the former Medical College of Indiana), the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons, and the Fort Wayne Medical College to form the Indiana Medical College, School of Medicine of Purdue University.<ref>The Indiana Medical College offered training in the former Medical College of Indiana's facilities on Senate Avenue. The building that housed the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons was sold. See Myers, pp. 63\u201364; 74\u201375.</ref> Unable to merge with other existing institutions, IU organized a separate medical training facility in Indianapolis. In 1906 a group of IU supporters purchased the building that housed the former Central College of Physicians and Surgeons at 212 North Senate. The building became the site of the State College of Physicians and Surgeons, which offered clinical instructions to IU's third- and fourth-year medical students. State College enrolled 109 students in September 1906. In August 1907 the IU board of trustees agreed to a merger of the IU School of Medicine in Bloomington with the State College of Physicians in Indianapolis but agreed to take financial responsibility for only the school's facilities in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe County]] (Bloomington). The first two years of training continued at Bloomington and the final two years of clinical training were held at the State College site in Indianapolis, with a doctor of medicine degree conferred by Indiana University.<ref>Myers, pp. 75\u201376; Gray, pp. 13, 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nTo resolve their ongoing dispute, IU and Purdue leaders, along with their supporters, sought approval from the [[Indiana General Assembly]] to operate their own schools of medicine in Marion County. In April 1908, IU and Purdue officials reached an agreement. The resolution consolidated the medical department at IU Bloomington with the State College of Physicians and the Indiana Medical College, School of Medicine of Purdue University, at Indianapolis and retained the name of the IU School of Medicine<ref>Gray, pp. 14\u201316; Myers, pp. 63\u201364, and 74.</ref>  On February 26, 1909, the state legislature formally authorized Indiana University to operate a medical school in Marion County. With the finalized agreement between IU and Purdue, the two separate medical schools in Indianapolis were consolidated, marking the second founding of the Indiana University School of Medicine in 1908. The state legislature's authorization in 1909 allowed IU to operate its own medical school in Marion County and enabled IU's medical students to complete all four years of their medical education in Indianapolis.<ref>Myers, pp. 79\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Early leadership and enrollment===\nDoctor Allison Maxwell agreed to serve as the first dean of the four-year IU School of Medicine in Indianapolis in April 1908; he remained as its dean until 1911. Maxwell led the fledgling school through a difficult time when financial budgets were an issue and the consolidation of IU's and Purdue's medical school faculties in Indianapolis and Bloomington was completed. The combined faculty would support the four-year medical school at Indianapolis and maintain the two-year, pre-clinical coursework at Bloomington. In addition to Maxwell, other leaders in the IU School of Medicine's early history were drawn from [[Johns Hopkins University]], including Charles P. Emerson who was appointed as the second dean of the IU School of Medicine in 1911 and served in that role until 1931.<ref>Gray, p. 17; Myers, pp. 79\u201381, 87.</ref>\n\nWillis D. Gatch became the third dean of the medical school in 1932. In 1909, Gatch had invented the [[Gatch bed|Gatch adjustable hospital bed]], which used a crank to raise and lower the patient's head and feet.<ref>Myers, p. 81.

After the consolidation of the IU School of Medicine with the State College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Indiana Medical College in 1908, the medical school used the former Indiana Medical College's facilities for about ten years while it secured financing to construct new medical school buildings. Several of the medical school's early buildings in Indianapolis were erected in the 1910s and 1920s on property that would eventually become the site of the IU Medical Center on the present-day IUPUI campus.<ref>Gray, p. 18; Myers, pp. 81\u201383.</ref>\n\nIn February 1912, IU acquired property on West Michigan Street, near the [[Indianapolis City Hospital]], to erect the Robert E. Long Hospital. Construction on the new teaching hospital began in 1912. Although its cornerstone was laid on November 1, 1912, the [[Great Flood of 1913]] delayed the building's opening until 1914. Long Hospital was dedicated on June 15, 1914, and admitted its first patients the following day. Emerson Hall, another early medical school building, was constructed about {{convert|200|ft|m}} northeast of Long Hospital and completed in the fall of 1919 at a cost of $257,699.<ref>Gray, pp. 17\u201318; Myers, pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nThe cornerstone of the [[Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health|Riley Hospital for Children]] was laid on October 7, 1923, and dedicated on October 7, 1924. The hospital, named in honor of Hoosier poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]], was erected north of Long Hospital. The James Whitcomb Riley Association (later known as the [[Riley Children's Foundation]]) hoped to raise an initial $250,000 in funding to add to the state's appropriation. By 1923 it had received $911,518 in pledges from more than 30,000 citizens,<ref>Gray, p. 19; Myers, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> including $45,000 in donations from a mass fundraising event.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Significant additions to the hospital were built over the years, including three in the 1930s: a Kiwanis Unit, dedicated in 1930; a Rotary Unit, dedicated in 1931; and a hydrotherapy pool in 1935.<ref name=Myers85-86>Myers, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\nAnother of the medical school's early teaching hospitals was the William H. Coleman Hospital for Women. Erected west of Long Hospital and dedicated on October 20, 1927, Coleman Hospital's total cost was about $300,000. Other early buildings erected on the medical school campus in Indianapolis included the Ball Residence for Nurses, dedicated on October 7, 1928;<ref name=Myers85-86/> Myers Hall, built in 1937; and Fesler Hall, built in 1939. \nThe school's medical research building was expanded in 1947 with a five-year grant from the Riley Children's Foundation.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The VanNuys Medical Sciences Building opened in 1958.<ref name=\"IUSMinfo11\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iu.edu/~centen/index.php4|title=Founding and Early History\n|publisher=Indiana University School of Medicine|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Curriculum==\nIn 2003, it was one of ten medical schools nationwide chosen by the [[American Medical Association]] to develop new methods of teaching professionalism to doctors.<ref name=\"IUSMinfo12\">{{cite book |title= Professionalism in Medicine: Critical Perspectives |author1=Wear, Delese  |author2=Aultman, Julie |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-32726-6 |pages=275 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMThDJjRl6kC&vq=indiana&dq=isbn:0387327266|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> In order to ensure that its educational process more accurately reflected its commitment to graduating caring and competent physicians, the Indiana University School of Medicine initiated a competency curriculum in 1999.

In the 1960s, Mori Aprison discovered the inhibitory neurotransmitter [[glycine]]. Dr. Paul Stark, another neuroscientist and faculty member at IUSM, led the clinical team at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in the development of [[Prozac]], a widely prescribed antidepressant. In 1984, IUSM established the first DNA \"bank\" in the world; blood samples from clients were used to extract DNA which could indicate the genetic risk for certain illnesses and conditions. The school researchers also discovered the use of cord blood as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells and pioneered their use in the clinic. In the early 1990s, the school was one of the first institutions to study the use of computer systems in reducing the costs of healthcare management.<ref name=\"IUSMinfo19\">{{cite journal|author=Time Hilchey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/technology/study-of-computerized-care-finds-big-patient-and-hospital-savings.html|title=Study of Computerized Care Finds Big Patient and Hospital Savings | journal=The New York Times | date=20 January 1993}}</ref>\n\nThe IU School of Medicine is the home of a National Cancer Institute\u2014designated Clinical Cancer Center,  and the only National Institute of Health\u2014funded viral vector production facility for clinical grade therapeutics.<ref name=\"IUSMinfo18\">{{cite web|url=http://grad.medicine.iu.edu/degree-programs/combined-degrees/mdphd/curriculum/|title=IUSM Research Centers Overview|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328025841/http://grad.medicine.iu.edu/degree-programs/combined-degrees/mdphd/curriculum/|archivedate=28 March 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> The school is known for establishing a curative therapy for testicular cancer.

The new department was established in May of the same year. The IU School of Medicine was admitted as a member of the American Association of American Medical Colleges ([[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]]) in 1904. \n\n===Founding in Indianapolis, 1908===\nIn addition to its Department of Medicine in Bloomington, IU's leaders wanted to locate medical training facilities in Indianapolis.

A proposed merger with the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons, organized in Indianapolis in 1873, did not materialize in 1903, and no agreement was reached to merge with the Medical College of Indiana in 1904. See Myers, pp. 62, 71\u201373.</ref> \n\nBetween 1905 and 1908 there continued to be a debate over which university, IU or Purdue, could establish a state-supported, four-year medical school at Indianapolis.<ref>IU believed that under a legislative act approved on February 15, 1838, it had the authorization to provide instruction in medicine, as well as other professional fields, but the development of a four-year, state-supported medical school was delayed due to lack of sufficient funding. See Gray, pp. 14\u201316, and Myers, pp. 63\u201364.</ref> In 1905, Purdue University's Medical Department joined with the Medical Department of the University of Indianapolis (the former Medical College of Indiana), the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons, and the Fort Wayne Medical College to form the Indiana Medical College, School of Medicine of Purdue University.<ref>The Indiana Medical College offered training in the former Medical College of Indiana's facilities on Senate Avenue. The building that housed the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons was sold. See Myers, pp. 63\u201364; 74\u201375.</ref> Unable to merge with other existing institutions, IU organized a separate medical training facility in Indianapolis. In 1906 a group of IU supporters purchased the building that housed the former Central College of Physicians and Surgeons at 212 North Senate. The building became the site of the State College of Physicians and Surgeons, which offered clinical instructions to IU's third- and fourth-year medical students. State College enrolled 109 students in September 1906. In August 1907 the IU Board of Trustees agreed to a merger of the IU School of Medicine in Bloomington with the State College of Physicians in Indianapolis but agreed to take financial responsibility for only the school's facilities in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe County]] (Bloomington). The first two years of training continued at Bloomington and the final two years of clinical training were held at the State College site in Indianapolis, with a doctor of medicine degree conferred by Indiana University.<ref>Myers, pp. 75\u201376; Gray, pp. 13, 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nTo resolve their ongoing dispute, IU and Purdue leaders, along with their supporters, sought approval from the [[Indiana General Assembly]] to operate their own schools of medicine in Marion County. In April 1908, IU and Purdue officials reached an agreement. The resolution consolidated the medical department at IU Bloomington with the State College of Physicians and the Indiana Medical College, School of Medicine of Purdue University, at Indianapolis and retained the name of the IU School of Medicine<ref>Gray, pp. 14\u201316; Myers, pp. 63\u201364, and 74.</ref>  On February 26, 1909, the state legislature formally authorized Indiana University to operate a medical school in Marion County. With the finalized agreement between IU and Purdue, the two separate medical schools in Indianapolis were consolidated, marking the second founding of the Indiana University School of Medicine in 1908. The state legislature's authorization in 1909 allowed IU to operate its own medical school in Marion County and enabled IU's medical students to complete all four years of their medical education in Indianapolis.<ref>Myers, pp. 79\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Early leadership and enrollment===\nDoctor Allison Maxwell agreed to serve as the first dean of the four-year IU School of Medicine in Indianapolis in April 1908; he remained as its dean until 1911. Maxwell led the fledgling school through a difficult time when financial budgets were an issue and the consolidation of IU's and Purdue's medical school faculties in Indianapolis and Bloomington was completed. The combined faculty would support the four-year medical school at Indianapolis and maintain the two-year, pre-clinical coursework at Bloomington. In addition to Maxwell, other leaders in the IU School of Medicine's early history were drawn from [[Johns Hopkins University]], including Charles P. Emerson who was appointed as the second dean of the IU School of Medicine in 1911 and served in that role until 1931.<ref>Gray, p. 17; Myers, pp. 79\u201381, 87.</ref>\n\nWillis D.

After the consolidation of the IU School of Medicine with the State College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Indiana Medical College in 1908, the medical school used the former Indiana Medical College's facilities for about ten years while it secured financing to construct new medical school buildings. Several of the medical school's early buildings in Indianapolis were erected in the 1910s and 1920s on property that would eventually become the site of the IU Medical Center on the present-day IUPUI campus.<ref>Gray, p. 18; Myers, pp. 81\u201383.</ref>\n\nIn February 1912, IU acquired property on West Michigan Street, near the [[Indianapolis City Hospital]], to erect the Robert E. Long Hospital. Construction on the new teaching hospital began in 1912. Although its cornerstone was laid on November 1, 1912, the [[Great Flood of 1913]] delayed the building\u2019s opening until 1914. Long Hospital was dedicated on June 15, 1914, and admitted its first patients the following day. Emerson Hall, another early medical school building, was constructed about {{convert|200|ft|m}} northeast of Long Hospital and completed in the fall of 1919 at a cost of $257,699.<ref>Gray, pp. 17\u201318; Myers, pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nThe cornerstone of the [[Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health|Riley Hospital for Children]] was laid on October 7, 1923, and dedicated on October 7, 1924. The hospital, named in honor of Hoosier poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]], was erected north of Long Hospital. The James Whitcomb Riley Association (later known as the [[Riley Children's Foundation]]) hoped to raise an initial $250,000 in funding to add to the state's appropriation. By 1923 it had received $911,518 in pledges from more than 30,000 citizens,<ref>Gray, p. 19; Myers, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> including $45,000 in donations from a mass fundraising event.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Significant additions to the hospital were built over the years, including three in the 1930s: a Kiwanis Unit, dedicated in 1930; a Rotary Unit, dedicated in 1931; and a hydrotherapy pool in 1935.<ref name=Myers85-86>Myers, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\nAnother of the medical school's early teaching hospitals was the William H. Coleman Hospital for Women. Erected west of Long Hospital and dedicated on October 20, 1927, Coleman Hospital\u2019s total cost was about $300,000. Other early buildings erected on the medical school campus in Indianapolis included the Ball Residence for Nurses, dedicated on October 7, 1928;<ref name=Myers85-86/> Myers Hall, built in 1937; and Fesler Hall, built in 1939. \nThe school's medical research building was expanded in 1947 with a five-year grant from the Riley Children's Foundation.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The VanNuys Medical Sciences Building opened in 1958.<ref name=\"IUSMinfo11\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iu.edu/~centen/index.php4|title=Founding and Early History\n|publisher=Indiana University School of Medicine|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Curriculum==\nIn 2003, it was one of ten medical schools nationwide chosen by the [[American Medical Association]] to develop new methods of teaching professionalism to doctors.<ref name=\"IUSMinfo12\">{{cite book |title= Professionalism in Medicine: Critical Perspectives |author1=Wear, Delese  |author2=Aultman, Julie |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-32726-6 |pages=275 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMThDJjRl6kC&vq=indiana&dq=isbn:0387327266|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> In order to ensure that its educational process more accurately reflected its commitment to graduating caring and competent physicians, the Indiana University School of Medicine initiated a competency curriculum in 1999.

In 1984, IUSM established the first DNA \"bank\" in the world; blood samples from clients were used to extract DNA which could indicate the genetic risk for certain illnesses and conditions. The school researchers also discovered the use of cord blood as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells and pioneered their use in the clinic.

Homoscedasticity is not required for the coefficient estimates to be unbiased, consistent, and asymptotically normal, but it is required for OLS to be efficient.<ref>{{citation|title=Cross-Level Inference|first1=Christopher H.|last1=Achen|first2=W.

The matrices below are covariances when there are just three observations across time. The disturbance in matrix A is homoskedastic; this is the simple case where OLS is the best linear unbiased estimator. The disturbances in matrices B and C are heteroskedastic. In matrix B, the variance is time-varying, increasing steadily across time; in   matrix C, the variance depends on the value of x.

The null hypothesis of this chi-squared test is homoscedasticity, and the alternative hypothesis would indicate heteroscedasticity. Since the Breusch\u2013Pagan test is sensitive to departures from normality or small sample sizes, the Koenker\u2013Bassett or 'generalized Breusch\u2013Pagan' test is commonly used instead. From the auxiliary regression, it retains the R-squared value which is then multiplied by the sample size, and then becomes the test statistic for a chi-squared distribution (and uses the same degrees of freedom). Although it is not necessary for the Koenker\u2013Bassett test, the Breusch\u2013Pagan test requires that the squared residuals also be divided by the residual sum of squares divided by the sample size.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pryce|first1=Gwilym|title=Heteroscedasticity: Testing and Correcting in SPSS|url=http://reocities.com/Heartland/4205/SPSS/HeteroscedasticityTestingAndCorrectingInSPSS1.pdf|pages=12\u201318|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> Testing for groupwise heteroscedasticity requires the [[Goldfeld\u2013Quandt test]].\n\n==Homoscedastic distributions==\n\nTwo or more [[normal distribution]]s, <math>N(\\mu_i,\\Sigma_i)</math>, are homoscedastic if they share a common [[covariance matrix|covariance]] (or [[correlation matrix|correlation]]) matrix, <math>\\Sigma_i = \\Sigma_j,\\ \\forall i,j</math>.
