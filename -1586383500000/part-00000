The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an [[electric field]] between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below. Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the deflection angle is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size.\n\n===Phosphor persistence===\nVarious [[phosphor]]s are available depending upon the needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen.

Through the phenomenon of [[secondary emission]], this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.<ref>{{cite book |last= Williams |first= Jim |title= Analog circuit design: art, science, and personalities |publisher= Newnes |year= 1991 |pages= 115\u2013116 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=CFoEAP2lwLEC&pg=PA115 |isbn= 978-0-7506-9640-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Yen, William M. |author2=Shionoya, Shigeo |author3=Yamamoto, Hajime |title= Practical Applications of Phosphors |publisher= CRC Press |year= 2006 |page= 211 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cKMSf0iRVSgC&pg=PA211 |isbn=978-1-4200-4369-3}}</ref>\n\n===Graticules===\nMost oscilloscopes have a [[oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] as part of the visual display, to facilitate measurements.

These are distinct from ''[[digital storage oscilloscope]]s'' which rely on solid state digital memory to store the image.\n\nWhere a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, but only for a few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode-ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a [[dielectric]] layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.\n\nWhen the main electron gun writes an image to the screen, the energy in the main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily to turn off the flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.<ref>The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition (1970\u20131979)</ref>\n\n==Color CRTs==\n[[File:CRT screen. closeup.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a delta-gun [[shadow mask]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT Phosphors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a [[Trinitron]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT_phosphors.png|thumb|right|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common CRT]]\nColor tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively.

(The triangular configuration is often called \"delta-gun\", based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta \u0394.)

Another type of color CRT uses an [[aperture grille]] of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.<ref name=maskgrill/>\n\n===Convergence and purity in color CRTs===\nDue to limitations in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, it has not been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, solely on the basis of the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.\n\nColor convergence and color purity are two aspects of this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering it is necessary that regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask.{{clarify|reason=See Talk page for apparent contradiction|date=August 2019}} This is called convergence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126054428/http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Picture This|date=March 2005|author=Norton, Thomas J. |work= UltimateAVmag.com}}</ref> More specifically, the convergence at the center of the screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the color it is intended to strike and no others. This is called purity. Like convergence, there is static purity and dynamic purity, with the same meanings of \"static\" and \"dynamic\" as for convergence. Convergence and purity are distinct parameters; a CRT could have good purity but poor convergence, or vice versa. Poor convergence causes color \"shadows\" or \"ghosts\" along displayed edges and contours, as if the image on the screen were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printed]] with poor registration. Poor purity causes objects on the screen to appear off-color while their edges remain sharp. Purity and convergence problems can occur at the same time, in the same or different areas of the screen or both over the whole screen, and either uniformly or to greater or lesser degrees over different parts of the screen.\n\n[[File:Magnet on TV.webm|thumb|A magnet used on a CRT TV. Note the distortion of the image.]]\nThe solution to the static convergence and purity problems is a set of color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their [[magnetic fields]] parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field [[vector field|vector]] can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [two each for two magnets] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.\n\nOn some CRTs, additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence or dynamic purity at specific points on the screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of dynamic convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.\n\nDynamic color convergence and purity are one of the main reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex [[raster graphics|raster]] geometry parameters through electronics under user control.\n\n===Degaussing===\n[[File:Degauss in progress.jpg|thumb|256px|A degaussing in progress.]]\nIf the shadow mask or aperture grille becomes magnetized, its magnetic field alters the paths of the electron beams. This causes errors of \"color purity\" as the electrons no longer follow only their intended paths, and some will hit some phosphors of colors other than the one intended. For example, some electrons from the red beam may hit blue or green phosphors, imposing a magenta or yellow tint to parts of the image that are supposed to be pure red. (This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization is localized.) Therefore, it is important that the shadow mask or aperture grille not be magnetized. \n\nMost color CRT displays, i.e. television sets and computer monitors, each have a built-in [[degaussing]] (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component of which is a degaussing coil which is mounted around the perimeter of the CRT face inside the [[wikt:bezel|bezel]]. Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtGauss-c.html|title=Magnetization and Degaussing|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically [[deformation (engineering)|deform]] (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.\n\nThe degaussing circuit is often built of a [[Thermo-Electricity|thermo-electric]] (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element and a positive thermal [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient]] (PTC) [[resistor-capacitor circuit|resistor]], connected directly to the switched [[AC power]] line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance to a point where degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the [[ambient temperature]]; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.\n\nThis simple design is effective and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially [[Energy Star]] rated ones, use a [[relay]] to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, so that the degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off at the end of the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.\n\nAt high refresh rates and resolutions, the deflection coil/yoke starts to produce large amounts of heat, due to the need to quickly move the electron beam (because the electron beam has to scan more lines per second), which in turn requires large amounts of power, for quickly generating strong magnetic fields. This makes CRTs beyond certain resolutions and refresh rates impractical, since the coils would need active cooling, to prevent the heat from the coils  from melting the glue that is used to attach them to the neck of the CRT.\n\n==Vector monitors==\n{{Main|Vector monitor}}\nVector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and are in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971\u20131984 |author= Van Burnham |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-52420-1}}</ref>\nThey draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs can be used in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.\n\n==CRT resolution==\n[[Dot pitch]] defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, [[moir\u00e9]] appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.displaymate.com/moire.html |title= Moir\u00e9 Interference Patterns |accessdate=4 October 2006 |work=DisplayMate Technologies website}}</ref> Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moir\u00e9; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question406.htm |title=What causes the faint horizontal lines on my monitor? |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>\n\n==Gamma==\nCRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |title=Gamma correction |accessdate=4 October 2009 |last=Robin |first=Michael |date=1 January 2005 |work=BroadcastEngineering |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531130845/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |archivedate=31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Other types==\n===Data storage tubes===\n{{Main|Williams tube}}\nThe Williams tube or Williams-Kilburn tube was a cathode-ray tube used to electronically store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the Williams tube was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.\n\n===Cat's eye===\n{{Main|Magic eye tube}}\nIn some [[vacuum tube]] radio sets, a [[Magic eye tube|\"Magic Eye\" or \"Tuning Eye\" tube]] was provided to assist in tuning the receiver. Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |title=Tuning-Eye Tubes |accessdate=1 December 2009 |publisher=vacuumtube.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423055711/http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |archivedate=23 April 2009}}</ref> The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording level meter, and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.\n\n===Charactrons===\n{{Main|Charactron}}\nSome displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask ([[stencil]]), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2735956|title=Cathode ray apparatus|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2824250|title=INPUT|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nimo===\n{{Main|Nimo tube}}\n[[File:Nimo tube BA0000-P31 showing digit 9.jpg|thumb|right|Nimo tube BA0000-P31]]\nNimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., [[nixie tube]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title=IEE Nimo CRT 10-gun readout tube datasheet |format=PDF |work=tube-tester.com|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Flood beam CRT===\n{{Main|Electron-stimulated luminescence}}\nFlood beam CRTs are small tubes that are arranged as pixels for large screens like [[Jumbotron]]s. The first screen using this technology was introduced by [[Mitsubishi Electric]] for the [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=947|title= Futaba TL-3508XA 'Jumbotron' Display|date= 11 March 2010|accessdate= 2014-12-19|website= The Vintage Technology Association: Military Industrial Electronics Research Preservation|publisher= The Vintage Technology Association}}</ref> Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, to make up the color sub-pixels.

In 2005, Sony announced that they would stop the production of CRT computer displays. Samsung did not introduce any CRT models for the 2008 model year at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show; on 4 February 2008, they removed their 30\" wide screen CRTs from their North American website and did not replace them with new models.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=slimfithdtv |title=SlimFit HDTV|publisher=Samsung |accessdate=12 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110164950/http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=slimfithdtv <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate= 10 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[DSG International (retailer)|DSG (Dixons)]], the largest retailer of domestic electronic equipment, reported that CRT models made up 80\u201390% of the volume of televisions sold at Christmas 2004 and 15\u201320% a year later, and that they were expected to be less than 5% at the end of 2006.

According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China.{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Causes====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nCRTs, despite advances, remained relatively heavy and cumbersome in comparison to other display technologies. CRT screens had much deeper cabinets compared to flat panels and rear-projection displays for a given screen size; it was largely impractical to build or use CRTs larger than {{convert|40|in|cm|0}}. The CRT disadvantages became especially significant in light of rapid technological advancements in [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] and plasma flat-panels, which allowed them to easily surpass these size limitations while also being thin and wall-mountable (two key features that were increasingly being preferred by customers).\n\n==Health concerns==\n\n===Ionizing radiation===\nCRTs can emit a small amount of [[X-ray]] radiation as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered not to be harmful. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in {{CodeFedReg|21|1020|10}} are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 [[Roentgen (unit)|milliroentgens]] per hour (mR/h) (0.13&nbsp;\u00b5C/(kg\u00b7h) or 36&nbsp;pA/kg) at a distance of {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10 |title=Subchapter J, Radiological Health (21CFR1020.10) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=13 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Toxicity===\nOlder color and monochrome CRTs may have been manufactured with toxic substances, such as [[cadmium]], in the phosphors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |title=Toxic TVs |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041627/http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |archivedate=27 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |title=Occupational Risks Associated with Electronics Demanufacturing and CRT Glass Processing Operations and the Impact of Mitigation Activities on Employee Safety and Health |accessdate=20 January 2011 |author1=Peters-Michaud, Neil |author2=Katers, John |author3=Barry, Jim |format=PDF |work=Cascade Asset Management, LLC |publisher=Basel Action Network |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012352/http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanelements.com/cdm.html |title=Cadmium |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=[[American Elements]]}}</ref> The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from [[lead glass|leaded glass]], which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |title=Characterization of Lead Leachability from Cathode Ray Tubes Using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure |accessdate=4 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012228/http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leach (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).\n\n=== Recycling ===\nDue to the toxins contained in CRT monitors the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] created rules (in October 2001) stating that CRTs must be brought to special [[Electronic waste|e-waste recycling]] facilities. In November 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through [[landfill]]s or [[incineration]]. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/recycling/electron/index.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nVarious states participate in the recycling of CRTs, each with their reporting requirements for collectors and recycling facilities. For example, in California the recycling of CRTs is governed by CALRecycle, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery through their Payment System. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/electronics/cew|title=Covered Electronic Waste Payment System|first=State of|last=California|website=www.calrecycle.ca.gov}}</ref>. Recycling facilities that accept CRT devices from business and residential sector must obtain contact information such as address and phone number to ensure the CRTs come from a California source in order to participate in the CRT Recycling Payment System. \n\nIn Europe, disposal of CRT televisions and monitors is covered by the [[WEEE Directive]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm-group.com/recycling/WEEEandCRTProcessing.htm |title=WEEE and CRT Processing |accessdate=4 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603065621/http://www.awm-group.com/recycling/WEEEandCRTProcessing.htm |archive-date=3 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Flicker===\n{{Main|Flicker (screen)}}\nAt low [[refresh rate]]s (60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and below), the periodic scanning of the display may produce a flicker that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with [[peripheral vision]].

If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.\n\n===High-frequency audible noise===\n50&nbsp;Hz/60&nbsp;Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734&nbsp;Hz (for [[NTSC]] systems) or 15,625&nbsp;Hz (for [[PAL]] systems).<ref>{{cite book |last= Netravali |first= Arun N. |author2=Haskell, Barry G. |title= Digital pictures: representation, compression, and standards |publisher= Plenum Publishing Corporation |year= 1995 |page= 100 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-TXYfZrCBuQC&pg=PA100 |isbn=978-0-306-44917-8}}</ref> These frequencies are at the upper range of [[human hearing]] and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/crt/failWhine-c.html |title=The monitor is producing a high-pitched whine |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> The sound is due to [[magnetostriction]] in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the [[flyback transformer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhys-Jones |first1=J. |title=Television economics |journal=Radiotronics |date=February 1951 |volume=16 |issue=2 |page=37}}</ref>\n\nThis problem does not occur on 100/120&nbsp;Hz TVs and on non-CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) computer displays, because they use much higher horizontal scanning frequencies (22&nbsp;kHz to over 100&nbsp;kHz).\n\n===Implosion===\nHigh [[vacuum]] inside glass-walled cathode-ray tubes permits electron beams to fly freely\u2014without colliding into molecules of air or other gas.

This is many times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply is turned off, some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain  a charge for some time and therefore dissipate that charge suddenly through a ground such as an inattentive human grounding a capacitor  discharge lead.\n\n==Security concerns==\nUnder some circumstances, the signal radiated from the [[electron gun]]s, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured remotely and used to reconstruct what is shown on the CRT using a process called [[Van Eck phreaking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf|title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk?|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> Special [[TEMPEST]] shielding can mitigate this effect.

As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.\n\nSince the late 2000s, CRTs have been largely superseded by newer \"[[flat panel]]\" display technologies such as [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]], [[plasma display]], and [[OLED]] displays. In the case of LCD and OLED displays, initial picture quality when they were first adapted wasn't as good. However, as the technology has developed, these displays now provide images of higher quality than CRT, with lower manufacturing costs and power consumption, as well as significantly less weight and bulk.

The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an [[electric field]] between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below. Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the deflection angle is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size.\n\n===Phosphor persistence===\nVarious [[phosphor]]s are available depending upon the needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen.

Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a [[micro-channel plate]] just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of [[secondary emission]], this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.<ref>{{cite book |last= Williams |first= Jim |title= Analog circuit design: art, science, and personalities |publisher= Newnes |year= 1991 |pages= 115\u2013116 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=CFoEAP2lwLEC&pg=PA115 |isbn= 978-0-7506-9640-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Yen, William M. |author2=Shionoya, Shigeo |author3=Yamamoto, Hajime |title= Practical Applications of Phosphors |publisher= CRC Press |year= 2006 |page= 211 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cKMSf0iRVSgC&pg=PA211 |isbn=978-1-4200-4369-3}}</ref>\n\n===Graticules===\nMost oscilloscopes have a [[oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] as part of the visual display, to facilitate measurements.

These are distinct from ''[[digital storage oscilloscope]]s'' which rely on solid state digital memory to store the image.\n\nWhere a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, but only for a few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode-ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a [[dielectric]] layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.\n\nWhen the main electron gun writes an image to the screen, the energy in the main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily to turn off the flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.<ref>The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition (1970\u20131979)</ref>\n\n==Color CRTs==\n[[File:CRT screen. closeup.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a delta-gun [[shadow mask]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT Phosphors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a [[Trinitron]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT_phosphors.png|thumb|right|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common CRT]]\nColor tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively.

Another type of color CRT uses an [[aperture grille]] of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.<ref name=maskgrill/>\n\n===Convergence and purity in color CRTs===\nDue to limitations in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, it has not been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, solely on the basis of the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.\n\nColor convergence and color purity are two aspects of this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering it is necessary that regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask.{{clarify|reason=See Talk page for apparent contradiction|date=August 2019}} This is called convergence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126054428/http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Picture This|date=March 2005|author=Norton, Thomas J. |work= UltimateAVmag.com}}</ref> More specifically, the convergence at the center of the screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the color it is intended to strike and no others. This is called purity. Like convergence, there is static purity and dynamic purity, with the same meanings of \"static\" and \"dynamic\" as for convergence. Convergence and purity are distinct parameters; a CRT could have good purity but poor convergence, or vice versa. Poor convergence causes color \"shadows\" or \"ghosts\" along displayed edges and contours, as if the image on the screen were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printed]] with poor registration. Poor purity causes objects on the screen to appear off-color while their edges remain sharp. Purity and convergence problems can occur at the same time, in the same or different areas of the screen or both over the whole screen, and either uniformly or to greater or lesser degrees over different parts of the screen.\n\n[[File:Magnet on TV.webm|thumb|A magnet used on a CRT TV. Note the distortion of the image.]]\nThe solution to the static convergence and purity problems is a set of color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their [[magnetic fields]] parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field [[vector field|vector]] can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [two each for two magnets] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.\n\nOn some CRTs, additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence or dynamic purity at specific points on the screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of dynamic convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.\n\nDynamic color convergence and purity are one of the main reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex [[raster graphics|raster]] geometry parameters through electronics under user control.\n\n===Degaussing===\n[[File:Degauss in progress.jpg|thumb|256px|A degaussing in progress.]]\nIf the shadow mask or aperture grille becomes magnetized, its magnetic field alters the paths of the electron beams. This causes errors of \"color purity\" as the electrons no longer follow only their intended paths, and some will hit some phosphors of colors other than the one intended. For example, some electrons from the red beam may hit blue or green phosphors, imposing a magenta or yellow tint to parts of the image that are supposed to be pure red. (This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization is localized.) Therefore, it is important that the shadow mask or aperture grille not be magnetized. \n\nMost color CRT displays, i.e. television sets and computer monitors, each have a built-in [[degaussing]] (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component of which is a degaussing coil which is mounted around the perimeter of the CRT face inside the [[wikt:bezel|bezel]]. Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtGauss-c.html|title=Magnetization and Degaussing|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically [[deformation (engineering)|deform]] (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.\n\nThe degaussing circuit is often built of a [[Thermo-Electricity|thermo-electric]] (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element and a positive thermal [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient]] (PTC) [[resistor-capacitor circuit|resistor]], connected directly to the switched [[AC power]] line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance to a point where degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the [[ambient temperature]]; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.\n\nThis simple design is effective and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially [[Energy Star]] rated ones, use a [[relay]] to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, so that the degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off at the end of the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.\n\nAt high refresh rates and resolutions, the deflection coil/yoke starts to produce large amounts of heat, due to the need to quickly move the electron beam (because the electron beam has to scan more lines per second), which in turn requires large amounts of power, for quickly generating strong magnetic fields. This makes CRTs beyond certain resolutions and refresh rates impractical, since the coils would need active cooling, to prevent the heat from the coils  from melting the glue that is used to attach them to the neck of the CRT.\n\n==Vector monitors==\n{{Main|Vector monitor}}\nVector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and are in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971\u20131984 |author= Van Burnham |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-52420-1}}</ref>\nThey draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs can be used in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.\n\n==CRT resolution==\n[[Dot pitch]] defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, [[moir\u00e9]] appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.displaymate.com/moire.html |title= Moir\u00e9 Interference Patterns |accessdate=4 October 2006 |work=DisplayMate Technologies website}}</ref> Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moir\u00e9; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question406.htm |title=What causes the faint horizontal lines on my monitor? |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>\n\n==Gamma==\nCRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |title=Gamma correction |accessdate=4 October 2009 |last=Robin |first=Michael |date=1 January 2005 |work=BroadcastEngineering |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531130845/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |archivedate=31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Other types==\n===Data storage tubes===\n{{Main|Williams tube}}\nThe Williams tube or Williams-Kilburn tube was a cathode-ray tube used to electronically store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the Williams tube was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.\n\n===Cat's eye===\n{{Main|Magic eye tube}}\nIn some [[vacuum tube]] radio sets, a [[Magic eye tube|\"Magic Eye\" or \"Tuning Eye\" tube]] was provided to assist in tuning the receiver.

These incorporate a perforated metal character mask ([[stencil]]), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2735956|title=Cathode ray apparatus|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2824250|title=INPUT|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nimo===\n{{Main|Nimo tube}}\n[[File:Nimo tube BA0000-P31 showing digit 9.jpg|thumb|right|Nimo tube BA0000-P31]]\nNimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., [[nixie tube]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title=IEE Nimo CRT 10-gun readout tube datasheet |format=PDF |work=tube-tester.com|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Flood beam CRT===\n{{Main|Electron-stimulated luminescence}}\nFlood beam CRTs are small tubes that are arranged as pixels for large screens like [[Jumbotron]]s. The first screen using this technology was introduced by [[Mitsubishi Electric]] for the [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=947|title= Futaba TL-3508XA 'Jumbotron' Display|date= 11 March 2010|accessdate= 2014-12-19|website= The Vintage Technology Association: Military Industrial Electronics Research Preservation|publisher= The Vintage Technology Association}}</ref> Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, to make up the color sub-pixels.

In 2005, Sony announced that they would stop the production of CRT computer displays. Samsung did not introduce any CRT models for the 2008 model year at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show; on 4 February 2008, they removed their 30\" wide screen CRTs from their North American website and did not replace them with new models.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=slimfithdtv |title=SlimFit HDTV|publisher=Samsung |accessdate=12 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110164950/http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=slimfithdtv <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate= 10 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[DSG International (retailer)|DSG (Dixons)]], the largest retailer of domestic electronic equipment, reported that CRT models made up 80\u201390% of the volume of televisions sold at Christmas 2004 and 15\u201320% a year later, and that they were expected to be less than 5% at the end of 2006.

According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China.{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Causes====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nCRTs, despite advances, remained relatively heavy and cumbersome in comparison to other display technologies. CRT screens had much deeper cabinets compared to flat panels and rear-projection displays for a given screen size; it was largely impractical to build or use CRTs larger than {{convert|40|in|cm|0}}. The CRT disadvantages became especially significant in light of rapid technological advancements in [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] and plasma flat-panels, which allowed them to easily surpass these size limitations while also being thin and wall-mountable (two key features that were increasingly being preferred by customers).\n\n==Health concerns==\n\n===Ionizing radiation===\nCRTs can emit a small amount of [[X-ray]] radiation as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered not to be harmful. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in {{CodeFedReg|21|1020|10}} are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 [[Roentgen (unit)|milliroentgens]] per hour (mR/h) (0.13&nbsp;\u00b5C/(kg\u00b7h) or 36&nbsp;pA/kg) at a distance of {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10 |title=Subchapter J, Radiological Health (21CFR1020.10) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=13 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Toxicity===\nOlder color and monochrome CRTs may have been manufactured with toxic substances, such as [[cadmium]], in the phosphors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |title=Toxic TVs |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041627/http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |archivedate=27 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |title=Occupational Risks Associated with Electronics Demanufacturing and CRT Glass Processing Operations and the Impact of Mitigation Activities on Employee Safety and Health |accessdate=20 January 2011 |author1=Peters-Michaud, Neil |author2=Katers, John |author3=Barry, Jim |format=PDF |work=Cascade Asset Management, LLC |publisher=Basel Action Network |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012352/http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanelements.com/cdm.html |title=Cadmium |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=[[American Elements]]}}</ref> The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from [[lead glass|leaded glass]], which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |title=Characterization of Lead Leachability from Cathode Ray Tubes Using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure |accessdate=4 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012228/http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leach (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).\n\n=== Recycling ===\nDue to the toxins contained in CRT monitors the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] created rules (in October 2001) stating that CRTs must be brought to special [[Electronic waste|e-waste recycling]] facilities. In November 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through [[landfill]]s or [[incineration]]. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/recycling/electron/index.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nVarious states participate in the recycling of CRTs, each with their reporting requirements for collectors and recycling facilities. For example, in California the recycling of CRTs is governed by CALRecycle, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery through their Payment System. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/electronics/cew|title=Covered Electronic Waste Payment System|first=State of|last=California|website=www.calrecycle.ca.gov}}</ref>.

If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.\n\n===High-frequency audible noise===\n50&nbsp;Hz/60&nbsp;Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734&nbsp;Hz (for [[NTSC]] systems) or 15,625&nbsp;Hz (for [[PAL]] systems).<ref>{{cite book |last= Netravali |first= Arun N. |author2=Haskell, Barry G. |title= Digital pictures: representation, compression, and standards |publisher= Plenum Publishing Corporation |year= 1995 |page= 100 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-TXYfZrCBuQC&pg=PA100 |isbn=978-0-306-44917-8}}</ref> These frequencies are at the upper range of [[human hearing]] and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/crt/failWhine-c.html |title=The monitor is producing a high-pitched whine |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> The sound is due to [[magnetostriction]] in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the [[flyback transformer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhys-Jones |first1=J. |title=Television economics |journal=Radiotronics |date=February 1951 |volume=16 |issue=2 |page=37}}</ref>\n\nThis problem does not occur on 100/120&nbsp;Hz TVs and on non-CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) computer displays, because they use much higher horizontal scanning frequencies (22&nbsp;kHz to over 100&nbsp;kHz).\n\n===Implosion===\nHigh [[vacuum]] inside glass-walled cathode-ray tubes permits electron beams to fly freely\u2014without colliding into molecules of air or other gas.

It is based on the novel ''La Femme de chambre du Titanic'' by [[Didier Decoin]].<ref name=NYTimes/> The film is known variously by its French title, ''La Femme de chambre du Titanic'', and also by the shortened English title ''The Chambermaid'', which was adopted in late August 1998<ref name=Phoenix/> to avoid the impression that it was trying to cash in on the success of James Cameron's popular film, ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which was released the year before ''The Chambermaid on the Titanic'' made its US debut.<ref name=SFChronicle/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1912, the protagonist, Horty, leads an uneventful life as a foundry worker in the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] region of northern France with his wife, Zoe, \"the most beautiful woman in town.\" The owner of the foundry where Horty works, Simeon, lusts after Zoe. When Horty wins a company athletic contest, Simeon's prize is a ticket to [[Southampton]] to see the sailing of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.\n\nThe night before the ''Titanic'' departs, Horty meets a beautiful young woman named Marie, who explains that she is a chambermaid aboard the ''Titanic''. Marie has nowhere to sleep because all of the local hotels are full, and Horty agrees to share his room. Their encounter is seemingly chaste, with Marie sleeping in the bed while Horty spends the night in the armchair. However, in the middle of the night Marie tries to seduce him. Whether or not she succeeds is ambiguous, and she is gone when Horty awakes. Attending the departure of the Titanic, Horty spots a photographer taking a picture of Marie, and asks the photographer for the photo.\n\nUpon returning home, Horty finds that he has been promoted, but this good news is dampened by rumors of an affair between his wife, Zoe, and the foundry owner, Simeon. A bitter and jealous Horty visits a local bar to drown his sorrows. Drunk, he tells friends and co-workers about the lovely chambermaid he met in Southampton, earning him free drinks and tips. Following the sinking of the Titanic, Horty's tales become increasingly erotic, and the viewer is never sure what is truth and what is fantasy.\n\nHorty catches the attention of a traveling entertainer named Zeppe. Zeppe offers Horty the chance to escape his dismal dreary life. Horty agrees and begins to work with Zeppe, converting his story into a play. One night, Zoe attends the play; later, Horty explains his tale as a work of fiction. However, Horty's story becomes more elaborate and romantic attracting a larger audience for each re-telling steadily driving a wedge between him and his wife. Eventually Zoe demands a part in the performance, playing the role of Marie poignantly fighting against the waves after the ''Titanic'' sinks. The film ends by revealing why Marie would sleep with Horty.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Olivier Martinez]] as Horty\n*[[Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n]] as Marie\n*[[Romane Bohringer]] as Zo\u00e9\n*[[Aldo Maccione]] as Zeppe\n*[[Didier Bezace]] as Sim\u00e9on\n*Jean-Marie Juan as Pascal\n*Arno Chevrier as Al\n*Salvador Madrid as L\u00e9on\n*Marianne Groves as Mathilde\n*Didier B\u00e9nureau as Sim\u00e9on's secretary\n*Alberto Cassadie as Giovanni\n*Giorgio Gobbi as Manu\n*[[Yves Verhoeven]] as Gaspard\n*Vincenzo De Caro as Lacroix\n*[[Stefania Orsola Garello]] as Mimi\n*Barbara Lerici as Blanche\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Chambermaid on the Titanic'' received an 81% fresh rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 16 reviews.<ref name=Rotten/> Mick LaSelle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' praised ''Chambermaid'' for what he felt was a rare honest portrayal of male sexuality.

The vividness and richness of Quarrie's description of the Melliah was the main source behind an important scene in [[Hall Caine]]'s ''[[The Manxman (novel)|The Manxman]]''. This apparent [[plagiarism]] caused much controversy in the Manx newspapers once Quarrie's detailed explication of the connection between the two works was published in October 1889.<ref name=\"Melliah\" />\n\nQuarrie emigrated to New York City in 1889 where he gained considerable success as a journalist over the subsequent forty years.<ref name=\"Melliah\" /><ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=TMN/1898/10/08&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ar01300&PageLabel=13 'Personal and Otherwise', ''Manxman'', 8 October 1898]</ref> By September 1898 he was living at 2720 Atlantic Avenue, [[Brooklyn]],<ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=TMS/1898/09/03&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ar00502&PageLabel=5 'Old Coaching Days in the Isle of Man', ''Manx Sun'', 3 Sep 1898]</ref> where he had a daughter.<ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=TMS/1898/11/26&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ar00419&PageLabel=4 'Births, Marriages and Deaths', ''Manx Sun'', 26 November 1898]</ref> By 1913 Quarrie was signing his poems from 230 W. 116 St., New York,<ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=RYC/1913/12/05&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ar00704&PageLabel=7 'On Reading the Courier', ''Ramsey Courier'', 5 December 1913]</ref> and by April 1918 he was living at 330 East 55th Street.<ref>[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq20361.htm 'A War Rubaiyat', ''Manx Quarterly'', No. 19, 1918]</ref>\n\nWhilst in America, Quarrie continued to write poems about his youth in the north of the Isle of Man, receiving comments in the Manx press such as: \"Mr Quarrie knew the Isle of Man thoroughly.

The vividness and richness of Quarrie's description of the Melliah was the main source behind an important scene in [[Hall Caine]]'s ''[[The Manxman (novel)|The Manxman]]''. This apparent [[plagiarism]] caused much controversy in the Manx newspapers once Quarrie's detailed explication of the connection between the two works was published in October 1889.<ref name=\"Melliah\" />\n\nQuarrie emigrated to New York City in 1889 where he gained considerable success as a journalist over the subsequent forty years.<ref name=\"Melliah\" /><ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=TMN/1898/10/08&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ar01300&PageLabel=13 'Personal and Otherwise', ''Manxman'', 8 October 1898]</ref> By September 1898 he was living at 2720 Atlantic Avenue, [[Brooklyn]],<ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=TMS/1898/09/03&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ar00502&PageLabel=5 'Old Coaching Days in the Isle of Man', ''Manx Sun'', 3 Sep 1898]</ref> where he had a daughter.<ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=TMS/1898/11/26&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ar00419&PageLabel=4 'Births, Marriages and Deaths', ''Manx Sun'', 26 November 1898]</ref> By 1913 Quarrie was signing his poems from 230 W. 116 St., New York,<ref>[http://www.newspapers.gov.im/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_IOMDEMO&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-eu&Path=RYC/1913/12/05&ChunkNum=-1&ID=Ar00704&PageLabel=7 'On Reading the Courier', ''Ramsey Courier'', 5 December 1913]</ref> and by April 1918 he was living at 330 East 55th Street.<ref> [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq20361.htm 'A War Rubaiyat', ''Manx Quarterly'', No. 19, 1918]</ref>\n\nWhilst in America, Quarrie continued to write poems about his youth in the north of the Isle of Man, receiving comments in the Manx press such as: \"Mr Quarrie knew the Isle of Man thoroughly.
