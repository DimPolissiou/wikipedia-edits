This phenomenon is common in people's daily life shown by a large-scale study in which participants spend 47% of their waking time on average on daydreaming.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Daniel T.|last2=Killingsworth|first2=Matthew A.|date=2010-11-12|title=A Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind|journal=Science|volume=330|issue=6006|pages=932|doi=10.1126/science.1192439|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21071660|bibcode=2010Sci...330..932K|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/danielgilbert/files/a-wandering-mind-is-an-unhapy-mind-killingsworthe-ma-science-2010.pdf}}</ref> There are various names of this phenomenon including [[mind wandering]], fantasy, spontaneous thoughts, etc. Daydreaming is the term used by [[Jerome L.

Mooneyham and Schooler reviewed studies published from 1995 and found 29 studies related to costs compared to only 6 recent studies arguing functional benefits of daydreaming. Some of the major costs of daydreaming summarized by the review are associated with performances such as reading, sustained attention, mood, etc.<ref name=\":03\"/>\n\nThe negative effects of daydreaming on reading performance have been studied the most thoroughly. Research shows that there is a negative correlation between daydreaming frequency and reading comprehension performance. To be specific, there are costs associated with daydreaming during reading and the costs include deficits of item-specific comprehension and model-building ability.<ref name=\":03\"/>\n\nDisruptive daydreams, or spontaneous daydreaming is also characteristic of people with attention-deficit hyperactive disorder, and can be viewed in a negative light as children with ADHD tend to have a more difficult time concentrating on their surroundings and being mindful of current tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://secure.byui.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.byui.edu%2Fcas%2Fidp%2Fprofile%2FSAML2%2FCallback%3FentityId%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fbyui.idm.oclc.org%252FShibboleth%26SAMLRequest%3DPD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz48c2FtbHA6QXV0aG5SZXF1ZXN0IHhtbG5zOnNhbWxwPSJ1cm46b2FzaXM6bmFtZXM6dGM6U0FNTDoyLjA6cHJvdG9jb2wiIERlc3RpbmF0aW9uPSJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5ieXVpLmVkdS9jYXMvaWRwL3Byb2ZpbGUvU0FNTDIvUmVkaXJlY3QvU1NPIiBJRD0iXzE1ODY0MDgyNTI2NzgxNCIgSXNzdWVJbnN0YW50PSIyMDIwLTA0LTA5VDA0OjU3OjMyWiIgVmVyc2lvbj0iMi4wIj48c2FtbDpJc3N1ZXIgeG1sbnM6c2FtbD0idXJuOm9hc2lzOm5hbWVzOnRjOlNBTUw6Mi4wOmFzc2VydGlvbiI%252BaHR0cHM6Ly9ieXVpLmlkbS5vY2xjLm9yZy9TaGliYm9sZXRoPC9zYW1sOklzc3Vlcj48c2FtbHA6TmFtZUlEUG9saWN5IEFsbG93Q3JlYXRlPSIxIi8%252BPC9zYW1scDpBdXRoblJlcXVlc3Q%252B%26RelayState%3Dezp.2aHR0cDovL3NlYXJjaC5lYnNjb2hvc3QuY29tL2xvZ2luLmFzcHg.ZGlyZWN0PXRydWUmZGI9YXBoJkFOPTEyNzY0MzI4NyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU-|title=CAS \u2013 Central Authentication Service|website=secure.byui.edu|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://secure.byui.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.byui.edu%2Fcas%2Fidp%2Fprofile%2FSAML2%2FCallback%3FentityId%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fbyui.idm.oclc.org%252FShibboleth%26SAMLRequest%3DPD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz48c2FtbHA6QXV0aG5SZXF1ZXN0IHhtbG5zOnNhbWxwPSJ1cm46b2FzaXM6bmFtZXM6dGM6U0FNTDoyLjA6cHJvdG9jb2wiIERlc3RpbmF0aW9uPSJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5ieXVpLmVkdS9jYXMvaWRwL3Byb2ZpbGUvU0FNTDIvUmVkaXJlY3QvU1NPIiBJRD0iXzE1ODY0MDgyNjk2NzgxNyIgSXNzdWVJbnN0YW50PSIyMDIwLTA0LTA5VDA0OjU3OjQ5WiIgVmVyc2lvbj0iMi4wIj48c2FtbDpJc3N1ZXIgeG1sbnM6c2FtbD0idXJuOm9hc2lzOm5hbWVzOnRjOlNBTUw6Mi4wOmFzc2VydGlvbiI%252BaHR0cHM6Ly9ieXVpLmlkbS5vY2xjLm9yZy9TaGliYm9sZXRoPC9zYW1sOklzc3Vlcj48c2FtbHA6TmFtZUlEUG9saWN5IEFsbG93Q3JlYXRlPSIxIi8%252BPC9zYW1scDpBdXRoblJlcXVlc3Q%252B%26RelayState%3Dezp.2aHR0cDovL3NlYXJjaC5lYnNjb2hvc3QuY29tL2xvZ2luLmFzcHg.ZGlyZWN0PXRydWUmZGI9YXBoJkFOPTEzOTg4ODIxOSZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU-|title=CAS \u2013 Central Authentication Service|website=secure.byui.edu|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nNegative mood is another consequence of daydreaming. Research finds people generally report to be less happy when they are daydreaming than when they are not even the activities they otherwise do are the least enjoyed by them. For the positive daydreaming, people report the same happiness rating between current tasks and pleasant things they are more likely to daydream about. This finding remains true across all activities. The important relationship between mood and daydreaming from time-lag analysis is that the latter comes first, not the other way round.<ref name=\":03\"/>\n\nFor more examples, in the late 19th century, Toni Nelson argued that some daydreams with grandiose fantasies are self-gratifying attempts at \"wish fulfillment\". Still in the 1950s, some educational [[psychologist]]s warned parents not to let their children daydream, for fear that the children may be sucked into \"[[neurosis]] and even [[psychosis]]\".<ref name=\"Klinger2\"/>\n\nWhile the cost of daydreaming is more thoroughly discussed, the associated benefit is understudied. one potential reason is the payoff of daydreaming is usually private and hidden compared to the measurable cost from external goal-directed tasks. It's hard to know and record people's private thoughts such as personal goals and dreams, so whether daydreaming supports these thoughts is difficult to discuss.<ref name=\":12\"/>\n\nIn recent studies, Immordino et al. identified a seemingly hidden but important benefit of daydreaming. They argued that the mind is not idle during daydreaming, though it's at rest when not attentively engaging in external tasks. Rather, during this process, people indulge themselves in and reflect on fantasies, memories, future goals and psychological selves while still being able to control enough attention to keep easy tasks going and monitor the external environment. Thus, the potential benefits are the skills of internal reflection developed in daydreaming to connect emotional implication of daily life experience with personal meaning building process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Immordino-Yang|first=Mary Helen|last2=Christodoulou|first2=Joanna A.|last3=Singh|first3=Vanessa|date=July 2012|title=Rest Is Not Idleness: Implications of the Brain's Default Mode for Human Development and Education|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science: A Journal of the Association for Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=4|pages=352\u2013364|doi=10.1177/1745691612447308|issn=1745-6916|pmid=26168472|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c2056b7138f928651115d9b7d589bc7bdabeee30}}</ref>\n\nDespite the deleterious impact of daydreaming on aptitude tests which most educational institutions put heavy emphasis on, Immrdino et al. argued that it's important for children to get the internal reflection skills from daydreaming. Research shows that children quipped with theses skills have higher academic ability and are socially and emotionally better off. Also, when the external environment demands overly high attention from children, it's reasonable to believe these useful skills are underdeveloped.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Functions of daydreaming ==\nSince daydreaming is disruptive in external tasks and its potential benefits are quite private and subtle, it's worth discussing the reason why daydreaming exists and occupies a large amount of people's waking time.\n\nMooneyham and Schooler summarized five potential functions daydreaming serves: future thinking, creative thinking, attentional cycling, [[dishabituation]] and relief from boredom.\n\nFuture thinking, also known as autobiographical thinking, serves as a way to speculate and anticipate future events. Daydreaming can disrupt external activities, but the benefit of future thinking can be paid off later, as it allows better planning and preparation of future goals. People are more likely to have future-focused daydreams than present-focused and past-focused.<ref name=\":03\"/> Daydreaming can be a useful tool to help keep people mindful of their relevant goals, such as imagining future success of a goal to motivate accomplishing a difficult or uninteresting task.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://secure.byui.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.byui.edu%2Fcas%2Fidp%2Fprofile%2FSAML2%2FCallback%3FentityId%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fbyui.idm.oclc.org%252FShibboleth%26SAMLRequest%3DPD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz48c2FtbHA6QXV0aG5SZXF1ZXN0IHhtbG5zOnNhbWxwPSJ1cm46b2FzaXM6bmFtZXM6dGM6U0FNTDoyLjA6cHJvdG9jb2wiIERlc3RpbmF0aW9uPSJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5ieXVpLmVkdS9jYXMvaWRwL3Byb2ZpbGUvU0FNTDIvUmVkaXJlY3QvU1NPIiBJRD0iXzE1ODY0MDk3NTg2Nzk2NiIgSXNzdWVJbnN0YW50PSIyMDIwLTA0LTA5VDA1OjIyOjM4WiIgVmVyc2lvbj0iMi4wIj48c2FtbDpJc3N1ZXIgeG1sbnM6c2FtbD0idXJuOm9hc2lzOm5hbWVzOnRjOlNBTUw6Mi4wOmFzc2VydGlvbiI%252BaHR0cHM6Ly9ieXVpLmlkbS5vY2xjLm9yZy9TaGliYm9sZXRoPC9zYW1sOklzc3Vlcj48c2FtbHA6TmFtZUlEUG9saWN5IEFsbG93Q3JlYXRlPSIxIi8%252BPC9zYW1scDpBdXRoblJlcXVlc3Q%252B%26RelayState%3Dezp.2aHR0cDovL3NlYXJjaC5lYnNjb2hvc3QuY29tL2xvZ2luLmFzcHg.ZGlyZWN0PXRydWUmZGI9YXBoJkFOPTEyNzY0MzI4NyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU-|title=CAS \u2013 Central Authentication Service|website=secure.byui.edu|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nCreative thinking is another function of daydreaming associated with increased creativity.

When people have many goals, daydreaming provides an opportunity for people to switch among different streams of information and thoughts. Thus, this ability allows people to choose appropriate behaviors to deal with multiple situations.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n[[Dishabituation]] is beneficial in the situation when the internal response to the external stimulus decreases as the external stimulus repeats during learning process. One research identified this effect in learning and showed that learning is more effective with distributed practices rather than massed practices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Underwood|first=Benton J.|last2=Ekstrand|first2=Bruce R.|date=1967|title=Effect of distributed practice on paired-associate learning.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=73|issue=4, Pt.2|pages=1\u201321|doi=10.1037/h0024341|issn=0022-1015}}</ref> Daydreaming can provide the opportunity to allow thoughts to drift away from intensive learning temporarily and to focus again with the refreshed capability to continue focusing on attention-demanding tasks.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nRelief from boredom is an obvious and adaptive function of daydreaming. When people are doing boring tasks, daydreaming allows their thoughts to detach from current external tasks to relieve boredom. At the same time, this temporary detachment will not stop external activities completely when these activities are necessary. Also, daydreaming can cause the perception that time moves more quickly.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nDaydreaming can also be used to imagine Social Situations. Humans are naturally oriented to be social in behavior and actively seek the approval and company of others.

Like nighttime dreams, daydreams, also, are an example of wish-fulfillment (based on infantile experiences), and are allowed to surface because of relaxed censorship. He pointed out that, in contrast to nighttime dreams, which are often confusing and incoherent, there seems to be a process of \"secondary revision\" in fantasies that makes them more lucid, like daydreaming. The state of daydreaming is a kind of liminal state between waking (with the ability to think rationally and logically) and sleeping. They stand in much the same relation to the childhood memories from which they are derived as do some of the Baroque palaces of Rome to the ancient ruins whose pavements and columns have provided the material for the more recent structures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=J.|title=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume V (1900-1901): The Interpretation of Dreams (Second Part) and On Dreams.|year=1953|publisher=The Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-analysis|location=London|pages=492}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] psychologists Jerome L. Singer of [[Yale University]] and John S. Antrobus of the [[City College of New York]], created a daydream [[questionnaire]]. The questionnaire, called the Imaginal Processes Inventory (IPI), has been used to investigate daydreams. Psychologists Leonard Giambra and George Huba used the IPI and found that daydreamers' imaginary images vary in three ways: how vivid or enjoyable the daydreams are, how many guilt- or fear-filled daydreams they have, and how \"deeply\" into the daydream people go.<ref name=\"Klinger2\"/>\n \n[[Humanistic psychology]] on other hand, found numerous examples of people in [[creativity|creative]] or artistic careers, such as [[musical composer|composers]], [[novelist]]s and [[filmmaker]]s, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly, research [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Self-Reflection ===\nDaydreaming can also be used to reveal personal aspects about an individual. In an experiment called \u201cthe Directed Daydream\u201d([[Robert Desoille|Desoille, Robert]], 1965) Desoille had a subject rest on a couch and then invited them to daydream about a series of objects and events. These daydreams can reveal implicit personality traits of the person based on the details imagined. The subjects are asked to imagine a sword or vase first, then to imagine climbing a mountain, and then ascending into space. The subject is then asked to visualize a wizard, a witch, and a dragon. Subjects who imagine more details and sleek objects often see themselves as more useful and hold a belief they are capable of growth. Through the daydream, which can involve many fantastical elements, characteristics such as a fear of men or a desire to subdue a selfish personality trait can be revealed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rocca|first=R.

Over focusing on negative experiences from the past and potential negative future events caused an increase in negativity and a temporary reduction in positive mood.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Lavender|first=Anna|last2=Watkins|first2=Edward|date=2004|title=Rumination and future thinking in depression|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/014466504323088015|journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|pages=129\u2013142|doi=10.1348/014466504323088015|issn=2044-8260}}</ref> Self-reflection can also have anti-depressant effects and an increase in planning for the future, creativity, and positivism. Whether a person will experience a positive or negative response from self-reflection depends on thought content and the individual\u2019s current mood. It is hypothesized that frequent negative reflection is strongly associated with an individual\u2019s feelings of guilt and fear, and a history of poor attention control.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Recent research==\nEric Klinger's research in the 1980s showed that most daydreams are about ordinary, everyday events and help to remind us of mundane tasks. Klinger's research also showed that over 75% of workers in \"boring jobs\", such as [[lifeguard]]s and [[truck driver]]s, use vivid daydreams to \"ease the boredom\" of their routine tasks. Klinger found that fewer than 5% of the workers' daydreams involved explicitly sexual thoughts and that violent daydreams were also uncommon.<ref name=\"Klinger2\"/>\n\nIsraeli high school students who scored high on the Daydreaming Scale of the IPI had more [[empathy]] than students who scored low.

Mooneyham and Schooler reviewed studies published from 1995 and found 29 studies related to costs compared to only 6 recent studies arguing functional benefits of daydreaming. Some of the major costs of daydreaming summarized by the review are associated with performances such as reading, sustained attention, mood, etc.<ref name=\":03\"/>\n\nThe negative effects of daydreaming on reading performance have been studied the most thoroughly. Research shows that there is a negative correlation between daydreaming frequency and reading comprehension performance.

Research finds people generally report to be less happy when they are daydreaming than when they are not even the activities they otherwise do are the least enjoyed by them. For the positive daydreaming, people report the same happiness rating between current tasks and pleasant things they are more likely to daydream about. This finding remains true across all activities. The important relationship between mood and daydreaming from time-lag analysis is that the latter comes first, not the other way round.<ref name=\":03\"/>\n\nFor more examples, in the late 19th century, Toni Nelson argued that some daydreams with grandiose fantasies are self-gratifying attempts at \"wish fulfillment\". Still in the 1950s, some educational [[psychologist]]s warned parents not to let their children daydream, for fear that the children may be sucked into \"[[neurosis]] and even [[psychosis]]\".<ref name=\"Klinger2\"/>\n\nWhile the cost of daydreaming is more thoroughly discussed, the associated benefit is understudied. one potential reason is the payoff of daydreaming is usually private and hidden compared to the measurable cost from external goal-directed tasks. It's hard to know and record people's private thoughts such as personal goals and dreams, so whether daydreaming supports these thoughts is difficult to discuss.<ref name=\":12\"/>\n\nIn recent studies, Immordino et al. identified a seemingly hidden but important benefit of daydreaming. They argued that the mind is not idle during daydreaming, though it's at rest when not attentively engaging in external tasks. Rather, during this process, people indulge themselves in and reflect on fantasies, memories, future goals and psychological selves while still being able to control enough attention to keep easy tasks going and monitor the external environment. Thus, the potential benefits are the skills of internal reflection developed in daydreaming to connect emotional implication of daily life experience with personal meaning building process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Immordino-Yang|first=Mary Helen|last2=Christodoulou|first2=Joanna A.|last3=Singh|first3=Vanessa|date=July 2012|title=Rest Is Not Idleness: Implications of the Brain's Default Mode for Human Development and Education|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science: A Journal of the Association for Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=4|pages=352\u2013364|doi=10.1177/1745691612447308|issn=1745-6916|pmid=26168472|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c2056b7138f928651115d9b7d589bc7bdabeee30}}</ref>\n\nDespite the deleterious impact of daydreaming on aptitude tests which most educational institutions put heavy emphasis on, Immrdino et al. argued that it's important for children to get the internal reflection skills from daydreaming. Research shows that children quipped with theses skills have higher academic ability and are socially and emotionally better off. Also, when the external environment demands overly high attention from children, it's reasonable to believe these useful skills are underdeveloped.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Functions of daydreaming ==\nSince daydreaming is disruptive in external tasks and its potential benefits are quite private and subtle, it's worth discussing the reason why daydreaming exists and occupies a large amount of people's waking time.\n\nMooneyham and Schooler summarized five potential functions daydreaming serves: future thinking, creative thinking, attentional cycling, [[dishabituation]] and relief from boredom.\n\nFuture thinking, also known as autobiographical thinking, serves as a way to speculate and anticipate future events. Though it's costly for current external activities performances, the benefit will be paid off later since future thinking allows better plan and preparation of the future goals. People are more likely to have future-focused daydreams than present-focused and past-focused.<ref name=\":03\"/> Daydreaming can be a useful tool to help keep people mindful of their relevant goals, such as imagining future success of a goal to motivate accomplishing a difficult or uninteresting task.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://secure.byui.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.byui.edu%2Fcas%2Fidp%2Fprofile%2FSAML2%2FCallback%3FentityId%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fbyui.idm.oclc.org%252FShibboleth%26SAMLRequest%3DPD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz48c2FtbHA6QXV0aG5SZXF1ZXN0IHhtbG5zOnNhbWxwPSJ1cm46b2FzaXM6bmFtZXM6dGM6U0FNTDoyLjA6cHJvdG9jb2wiIERlc3RpbmF0aW9uPSJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5ieXVpLmVkdS9jYXMvaWRwL3Byb2ZpbGUvU0FNTDIvUmVkaXJlY3QvU1NPIiBJRD0iXzE1ODY0MDk3NTg2Nzk2NiIgSXNzdWVJbnN0YW50PSIyMDIwLTA0LTA5VDA1OjIyOjM4WiIgVmVyc2lvbj0iMi4wIj48c2FtbDpJc3N1ZXIgeG1sbnM6c2FtbD0idXJuOm9hc2lzOm5hbWVzOnRjOlNBTUw6Mi4wOmFzc2VydGlvbiI%252BaHR0cHM6Ly9ieXVpLmlkbS5vY2xjLm9yZy9TaGliYm9sZXRoPC9zYW1sOklzc3Vlcj48c2FtbHA6TmFtZUlEUG9saWN5IEFsbG93Q3JlYXRlPSIxIi8%252BPC9zYW1scDpBdXRoblJlcXVlc3Q%252B%26RelayState%3Dezp.2aHR0cDovL3NlYXJjaC5lYnNjb2hvc3QuY29tL2xvZ2luLmFzcHg.ZGlyZWN0PXRydWUmZGI9YXBoJkFOPTEyNzY0MzI4NyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU-|title=CAS \u2013 Central Authentication Service|website=secure.byui.edu|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nCreative thinking is another function of daydreaming associated with increased creativity.

When people have many goals, daydreaming provides an opportunity for people to switch among different streams of information and thoughts. Thus, this ability allows people to choose appropriate behaviors to deal with multiple situations.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n[[Dishabituation]] is beneficial in the situation when the internal response to the external stimulus decreases as the external stimulus repeats during learning process.

At the same time, this temporary detachment will not stop external activities completely when these activities are necessary.

Like nighttime dreams, daydreams, also, are an example of wish-fulfillment (based on infantile experiences), and are allowed to surface because of relaxed censorship. He pointed out that, in contrast to nighttime dreams, which are often confusing and incoherent, there seems to be a process of \"secondary revision\" in fantasies that makes them more lucid, like daydreaming. The state of daydreaming is a kind of liminal state between waking (with the ability to think rationally and logically) and sleeping. They stand in much the same relation to the childhood memories from which they are derived as do some of the Baroque palaces of Rome to the ancient ruins whose pavements and columns have provided the material for the more recent structures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=J.|title=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume V (1900-1901): The Interpretation of Dreams (Second Part) and On Dreams.|year=1953|publisher=The Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-analysis|location=London|pages=492}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] psychologists Jerome L. Singer of [[Yale University]] and John S. Antrobus of the [[City College of New York]], created a daydream [[questionnaire]]. The questionnaire, called the Imaginal Processes Inventory (IPI), has been used to investigate daydreams. Psychologists Leonard Giambra and George Huba used the IPI and found that daydreamers' imaginary images vary in three ways: how vivid or enjoyable the daydreams are, how many guilt- or fear-filled daydreams they have, and how \"deeply\" into the daydream people go.<ref name=\"Klinger2\"/>\n \n[[Humanistic psychology]] on other hand, found numerous examples of people in [[creativity|creative]] or artistic careers, such as [[musical composer|composers]], [[novelist]]s and [[filmmaker]]s, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly, research [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Self-Reflection ===\nDaydreaming can also be used to reveal personal aspects about an individual. In an experiment called \u201cthe Directed Daydream\u201d(Desoille, Robert, 1965) \u00a0a psychologist has a subject rest on a couch and are then invited to daydream about a series of objects and events that can reveal implicit personality traits of the person based on the details imagined. The subjects are asked to imagine a sword or vase first, then to imagine climbing a mountain, and then ascending into space. The subject is then asked to visualize a wizard, a witch, and a dragon. Subjects who imagine more details and sleek objects often see themselves as more useful and hold a belief they are capable of growth. Through the daydream, which can involve many fantastical elements, characteristics such as a fear of men or a desire to subdue a selfish personality trait can be revealed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rocca|first=R. E.|date=September 1981|title=[Directed daydreaming of Robert Desoille]|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7348086|journal=Acta Psiquiatrica Y Psicologica De America Latina|volume=27|issue=4-5|pages=295\u2013303|issn=0001-6896|pmid=7348086}}</ref>\n\nSelf-reflection is when an individual\u2019s actions or thoughts are replayed or rehearsed in the mind. \u00a0Reflective daydreaming can be both beneficial and detrimental. Over focusing on negative experiences from the past and potential negative future events caused an increase in negativity and a temporary reduction in positive mood.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Lavender|first=Anna|last2=Watkins|first2=Edward|date=2004|title=Rumination and future thinking in depression|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/014466504323088015|journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|pages=129\u2013142|doi=10.1348/014466504323088015|issn=2044-8260}}</ref> Self-reflection can also have anti-depressant effects and an increase in planning for the future, creativity, and positivism. Whether a person will experience a positive or negative response from self-reflection depends on thought content and the individual\u2019s current mood. It is hypothesized that frequent negative reflection is strongly associated with an individual\u2019s feelings of guilt and fear, and a history of poor attention control.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Recent research==\nEric Klinger's research in the 1980s showed that most daydreams are about ordinary, everyday events and help to remind us of mundane tasks. Klinger's research also showed that over 75% of workers in \"boring jobs\", such as [[lifeguard]]s and [[truck driver]]s, use vivid daydreams to \"ease the boredom\" of their routine tasks. Klinger found that fewer than 5% of the workers' daydreams involved explicitly sexual thoughts and that violent daydreams were also uncommon.<ref name=\"Klinger2\"/>\n\nIsraeli high school students who scored high on the Daydreaming Scale of the IPI had more [[empathy]] than students who scored low.

It resembles in certain respects the ''[[writ of amparo|amparo]]'' remedy available in some Spanish-speaking nations.\n\nThe constitutional complaint is an extraordinary remedy for the protection of constitutional rights. These are the basic rights (Art. 1 - 19 GG) and certain related rights (Art. 20 Sec. 4, Art. 33, Art. 38, Art. 101, Art. 103, Art. 104 GG).\n\nThe constitutional complaint originally was only part of a federal law (\u00a7\u00a7 90 ff. BVerfGG) and not part of the constitution itself. Yet it was incorporated in the Constitution in 1969, because at the same time the so-called [[:de:Notstandsverfassung|Notstandsverfassung]] (regulations for the case of emergency and war) was incorporated in the constitution. In case of emergency it is possible to impose restrictions on the citizens in respect to certain basic rights. In order to avoid the possibility of simple changes of the federal law, the remedy was incorporated in the constitution.\n\nThe constitutional complaint is not a popular action. Although everyone can take action, the appellant must meet certain requirements:\nThe appellant must allege that their above-mentioned constitutional rights have been violated by an act of German (not [[European Union|EU]]) public authorities (be it [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[judicial]] or [[legislative]]).\n\nThe appellant needs to be affected \n- himself,\n- currently, and\n- immediately.\n\nThe latter requirement will normally only be met by constitutional complaints against judgments and against acts of the executive. Laws are normally not self-executing.\nAs an extraordinary remedy the constitutional complaint is subsidiary to the regular remedies. This means two things. In the first place the appellant must have used every possible other remedy (also the remedy in case of infringement of the claim for hearing). This is why practically, constitutional complaints are mostly directed against judicial acts, not acts of the executive (which can still be contested at the [[administrative court]]). Secondly (and the reason why so many complaints are dismissed as inadmissible), the appellant must have already claimed the violation of the above-mentioned rights while making use of the regular remedies.\n\nThe complaint must be written.

Fidel Castro was openly ambiguous about his beliefs at the time. Some orthodox historians argue Castro was a communist from the beginning with a long term plan; however, others have argued he had no strong ideological loyalties. [[Leslie Dewart]] has stated that there is no evidence to suggest Castro was ever a communist agent. Levine and Papasotiriou believe Castro believed in little outside of a distaste for American imperialism. As evidence for his lack of communist leanings they note his friendly relations with the [[United States]] shortly after the revolution and him not joining the Cuban Communist Party during the beginning of his [[Land reform in Cuba|land reforms]].<ref name=ideology></ref>\n\n===Women's roles===\n[[File:Ra\u00fal, Vilma, Jorge Risquet y Jos\u00e9 Nivaldo Causse.jpg|thumb|Ra\u00fal Castro, [[Vilma Esp\u00edn]], [[Jorge Risquet]] and Jos\u00e9 Nivaldo Causse in 1958]]\nThe importance of women's contributions to the Cuban Revolution is reflected in the very accomplishments that allowed the revolution to be successful, from the participation in the [[Moncada Barracks]], to the Mariana Grajales all-women's platoon that served as Fidel Castro's personal security detail.

Castro was joined by CIA connected [[Frank Sturgis]] who offered to train Castro's troops in guerrilla warfare. Castro accepted the offer, but he also had an immediate need for guns and ammunition, so Sturgis became a gunrunner. Sturgis purchased boatloads of weapons and ammunition from CIA weapons expert Samuel Cummings' International Armament Corporation in Alexandria, Virginia. Sturgis opened a training camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where he taught Che Guevara and other 26th of July Movement rebel soldiers guerrilla warfare.\n\nIn addition, poorly armed irregulars known as ''[[escopeteros]]'' harassed Batista's forces in the foothills and plains of [[Oriente Province]].

Fidel Castro was openly ambiguous about his beliefs at the time. Some orthodox historians argue Castro was a communist from the beginning with a long term plan; however, others have argued he had no strong ideological loyalties. [[Leslie Dewart]] has stated that there is no evidence to suggest Castro was ever a communist agent. Levine and Papasotiriou believe Castro believed in little outside of a distaste for American imperialism. As evidence for his lack of communist leanings they note his friendly relations with the [[United States]] shortly after the revolution and him not joining the Cuban Communist Party during the beginning of his [[Land reform in Cuba|land reforms]].<ref name=ideology></ref>\n\n===Women's roles===\n[[File:Ra\u00fal, Vilma, Jorge Risquet y Jos\u00e9 Nivaldo Causse.jpg|thumb|Ra\u00fal Castro, [[Vilma Esp\u00edn]], [[Jorge Risquet]] and Jos\u00e9 Nivaldo Causse in 1958]]\nThe importance of women's contributions to the Cuban Revolution is reflected in the very accomplishments that allowed the revolution to be successful, from the participation in the [[Moncada Barracks]], to the Mariana Grajales all-women's platoon that served as Fidel Castro's personal security detail.
