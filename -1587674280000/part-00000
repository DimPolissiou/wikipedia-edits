In 2019, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as [[The World's Billionaires#2019|the ninth-richest person in the world]], with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion. Since signing [[The Giving Pledge]], Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg was elected the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[mayor of New York City]].

(born February 14, 1942) is an American politician, businessman, philanthropist, and author. He is the majority owner and co-founder of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]. He was the mayor of [[New York City]] from 2002 to 2013, and was a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]].\n\nBloomberg grew up in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] and graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. He began his career at the securities brokerage [[Salomon Brothers]] before forming his own company in 1981. That company, Bloomberg L.P., is a financial information, software and media firm that is known for its [[Bloomberg Terminal]]. Bloomberg spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. In 2019, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as [[The World's Billionaires#2019|the ninth-richest person in the world]], with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion. Since signing [[The Giving Pledge]], Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg was elected the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[mayor of New York City]]. First elected [[2001 New York City mayoral election|in 2001]], he held office for three consecutive terms, winning re-election [[2005 New York City mayoral election|in 2005]] and [[2009 New York City mayoral election|in 2009]].

He also led a rezoning of large areas of New York City, which facilitated massive and widespread new commercial and residential construction after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Bloomberg is considered to have had far-reaching influence on [[politics of New York City|the politics]], [[Economy of New York City|business sector]], and [[culture of New York City]] during his three terms as mayor.

Other acronyms for TEFL are '''TESL''' ('''Teaching English as a second language'''), '''TESOL''' ('''Teaching English to speakers of other languages'''), and '''ESL''' ('''[[English as a second or foreign language|English as a second language]]''', a term typically used in English-speaking countries, and more often referring to the learning than the teaching).<ref>{{Cite web |title=The beginner's guide to what's what in TEFL |url=https://www.i-to-i.com/blog/tefl-faq/the-beginners-guide-to-whats-what-in-tefl/ |website=i-to-i TEFL |date=2018 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> Students who are learning English as a second language are known as '''ELLs''' ('''English language learners''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elltx.org/bilingual_esl.html|title=English Language Learner - Bilingual/ESL|website=www.elltx.org}}</ref>\n\n==Teaching English as a second language==\n{{redirect|TESL|the video game|The Elder Scrolls: Legends}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n'''Teaching English as a second language''' ('''TESL''')refers to teaching [[English language|English]] to [[student]]s whose [[first language]] is not English, usually offered in a region where English ''is'' the dominant language and natural English language immersion situations are apt to be ''plentiful''. Usually focused on survival language. \n\nThe teaching profession has historically used different names for TEFL and TESL; however, the more generic term '''teaching English to speakers of other languages''' ('''TESOL''') is increasingly used to describe the profession, it covers both TESL and TEFL as an umbrella term. Both native speakers and non-native speakers successfully train to be English language teachers. In order to teach English as a Second Language to English Language Learners, or ELL's, one must pass a written and oral test in English to demonstrate proficiency.\n\n{ Brown (1991.p. 257)  referred to the progress the TESOL profession was making during the 1970s and 80s in achieving desired goals such as shifting its focus from product-oriented teaching to process-oriented teaching and from a rigid curriculum to a more flexible one.}\n\nThe use of these various terms has led to confusion about the training options for both prospective students and for employers. Because there is no global standard for the training of English language teacher, it is important to look beyond the actual acronym/title to the components of the training program. Short term certificate programs that do not have an academic affiliation resulting in credits or degrees (such as CELTA or other non-credit programs) can be a good launching pad for beginning positions internationally, but they will generally not provide sufficient training for a career (unless a person already has substantial experience and a degree in a closely related field). People interested in pursuing a career as an English language teacher should invest in credit-bearing programs that result in a university recognized certificate or degree program (MA/TESOL, MA/Applied Linguistics) particularly if one wants to work in higher education. Because of the confusing certification situation, employers now generally look for a certificate that reflects at least 100 hours of instruction in order to determine if the candidate has sufficient preparation to begin teaching English. Institutions with higher standards will require applicants to possess a master's degree for employment.\n\nPeople wishing to teach in the K-12 public school system in the United States will need a state-teacher certification at a minimum and an ELL Endorsement (or other state qualification) to be qualified to teach ELL.\n\n\nWhen choosing a graduate program, it is important to determine if the program is designed to prepare students to teach in K-12 settings OR in adult education settings. Most programs are designed for one or the other, but not both.\n\nIn California, teachers may become certified as ''California Teachers of English Learners'' (CTEL).\n\n==Teaching techniques==\n{{see also|Language teaching methods}}\n\n===Reading===\n\nTEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) that uses [[literature]] aimed at children and teenagers is rising in popularity. Youth-oriented literature offers simpler material (\"simplified readers\" are produced by major publishers), and often provides a more conversational style than literature for adults. [[Children's literature]] in particular sometimes provides subtle cues to pronunciation, through [[rhyming]] and other [[word play]]. One method for using these books is the multiple-pass technique. The instructor reads the book, pausing often to explain certain words and concepts. On the second pass, the instructor reads the book completely through without stopping. Textbooks contain a variety of literature like poetry, stories, essays, plays etc. through which certain linguistic items are taught.\n\nReading aloud to students who are learning English as a foreign language is a highly effective strategy to assist them in learning the basic rules and understandings of the process of reading. When teachers read aloud to their students, they simply model fluency and comprehension, while also adding visual support, periodic paraphrasing, and extension.<ref name=Bolos>{{Cite journal |last=Bolos |first=Nicole |title=Successful Strategies For Teaching Reading to Middle Grades English Language Learners: Teachers Can Employ a Variety of Classroom-Tested Strategies To Teach Reading To English Language Learners |journal=Middle School Journal |date=November 2012 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=14\u201320 |jstor=41763115|doi=10.1080/00940771.2012.11461843 }}</ref> When choosing an appropriate text for the student, both the vocabulary and concepts of the text that may be new to the student need to be considered.<ref name=Bolos/> To make sure they get definite understanding of the text, engaging the students during reading will assist them with making connections between what is being read and the new vocabulary.<ref name=Bolos/>\n\n===Communicative language teaching===\n\n[[Communicative language teaching]] (CLT) emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language. Despite a number of criticisms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tonvanhattum.com.br/comreth.html|title=Communicative Approach Rethought|author=Van Hattum, Ton|year=2006|work=tonvanhattum.com.br}}</ref>\nit continues to be popular, particularly in [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rel.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/36/2/211|title=The Trend and Challenge for Teaching EFL at Taiwanese Universities|work=sagepub.com}}</ref> and Europe. In India CBSE ( Central Board of Secondary Education) has adopted this approach in its affiliated schools.\n\nThe [[task-based language learning]] approach to CLT has gained ground in recent years. Proponents believe CLT is important for developing and improving speaking, writing, listening, and reading skills, and that it prevents students' merely listening passively to the teacher without interaction. [[Dogme language teaching|Dogme]]<ref name=\"two\">{{cite book|last1=Meddings|first1=Luke|last2=Thornbury|first2=Scott|title=Teaching Unplugged: Dogme in English Language Teaching|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0dfPgAACAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2009|publisher=Delta|isbn=978-1-905085-19-4}}</ref>  is a similar communicative approach that encourages teaching without published textbooks, instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher.<ref>{{cite news |first=Meddings |last=Luke |title=Throw away your textbooks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/26/tefl.lukemeddings |work=The Guardian |date=2004-03-26 |accessdate = 2009-06-22 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Blended learning===\n\nBlended learning is a combination of multimedia elements  (also known as [[computer-assisted language learning]]), achieved through a [[virtual learning environment]] (VLE) with classroom instruction, a teacher, and peers. Blended learning utilizes technology to provide massive amounts of comprehensible input to its learners through video and other types of multimedia, without a teacher present.\n\nVLEs have been a major growth point in the English Language Teaching (ELT) industry over the last five years. There are two types:\n\n*Externally hosted platforms that a school or institution exports content to (e.g., the proprietary [[WebCT|Web Course Tools]], or the open source [[Moodle]])\n*Content-supplied, course-managed learning platforms (e.g. the ''Macmillan English Campus'')\n\nThe former provides pre-designed structures and tools, while the latter supports course-building by the language school\u2014teachers can '''blend''' existing courses with games, activities, listening exercises, and grammar reference units contained online. This supports classroom, [[Autodidacticism|self-study]] or remote practice (for example in an [[internet caf\u00e9]]). Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan in India has launched a web portal ECTLT where learners can learn English and other subjects online and interact with their own teachers of KVS across the country.\n\n===Online classroom===\n\nAdvances in technology have made it possible to get a TEFL qualification online. Students can enroll in online classes that are [[Accreditation|accredited]] by organizations such as the British Council or Cambridge ESOL. There is no single overarching accreditation body for TEFL however private for-profit companies have been known to invent accreditation affiliates and use them to cheat the customer.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Guide to TEFL Accreditation|url=http://careers.theguardian.com/careers-blog/a-guide-to-tefl-accreditations-and-qualifications|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Study materials are divided into modules. Students take one or multiple tests per study module. Support is handled by [[tutors]], who can be reached via [[email]]. After successfully finishing the last module the student is granted a [[Certificate in Education|certificate]]. It comes in digital form or can be shipped to the student's address. Getting such a certificate can be beneficial.{{clarify|reason=how? - no OR!|date=December 2017}}{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Qualifications for TEFL teachers==\nQualification requirements vary considerably from country to country and among employers within the same country. In many institutions it is possible to teach without a degree or teaching certificate.  Some institutions will consider it necessary to be a native speaker with an MA TESOL. A university degree in English language and literature can also be of value, as indeed can any specialist degree. Other institutions consider a proof of English proficiency, a University degree and a basic teaching qualification to be more than sufficient.  However, the level of academic qualification need not be the most important qualification, as many schools will be more interested in one's interpersonal skills. For trainers wishing to enter the academic field, publications can be as important as qualifications, especially if they relate to English use in the field. Where there is a high demand for teachers and no statutory requirements, employers may accept otherwise unqualified candidates. Each country is different, and acceptance depends on demand for English teachers and the teacher's previous teaching and life experiences.<ref>\"Distance learning courses can also be a good introduction, but feedback on your teaching practice is important and most distance courses will not include this, and therefore will not be acceptable to many teaching institutes.\" [http://www.britishcouncil.org/teacherrecruitment-tefl-qualifications-certificates-2.htm The British Council]</ref>\n\nPrivate [[language school]]s are likely to require at least a certificate based on successful completion of a course consisting of a minimum of 100 hours. Major programs like EPIK will offer a higher salary to teachers who have completed any TEFL Course, online or otherwise, so long as the program meets the minimum 100-hour requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epik.go.kr/contents.do?contentsNo=49&menuNo=278|title=EPIK (English Program In Korea)-Pay Scale|publisher=}}</ref> Internet-based TEFL courses are generally accepted worldwide, and particularly in Asia, where the largest job markets exist in China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eslinsider.com/blog/will-this-tefl-course-be-accepted-or-recognized|title=Will this TEFL course be accepted or recognized?|work=eslinsider.com}}</ref> For China the minimum TEFL requirement is 120 hours.\n\nIn Asia there has also been a tendency to hire TEFL teachers on superficial criteria, such as race (with Caucasians preferred) on the assumption that an English teacher or native English speaker should be 'white', this is proven especially true in Thailand, a big employer of TEFL teachers, with adverts frequently calling explicitly for native-English speakers. Partly this is driven by commercial expectations in the private sector, where parents feel that paying extra fees for TEFL teacher should warrant an American or British TEFL teacher, the schools will not risk losing students over this.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAge/gender requirements might also be encountered. In some countries outside Europe and America, for example the Middle East, schools might hire men over women or vice versa. And they might hire only teachers in a certain age range; usually between 20 and 40 years of age. In China, age requirements can differ across the country due to provincial government regulations. Anyone under 19 may be able to teach TEFL, but usually only in a volunteer situation, such as a refugee camp.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Pay and conditions worldwide==\nAs in most fields, the pay depends greatly on education, training, experience, seniority, and expertise.  As with much [[expatriate]] work, employment conditions vary among countries, depending on the level of [[economic development]] and how much people want to live there. In relatively poor countries, even a low wage may equate to a comfortable [[middle class]] [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].<ref name=\"cactus\">{{cite web|title=TEFL Pay|url=http://www.cactustefl.com/get_started/tefl_pay.php|work=Cactus TEFL|accessdate=2010-05-19|quote=There does however seem to be a basic TEFL LAW, which states that if you're on a full-time contract of 24-26 teaching hours per week, you will have enough money to pay rent in a modest, possibly shared apartment, pay for food, get out and about to explore at weekends, have the odd beer or glass of wine of an evening, and, over the period of your contract, get some money put aside for flights home at Christmas.  Generally speaking, you tend to live fairly basically, and what you earn is not usually enough to support partners, family back home or pay back debts or mortgage instalments. In many ways, TEFL can be a bit of a return to your student days, where there is less emphasis on material 'stuff' and more in being absorbed into the culture of the experience.}}</ref> EFL Teachers who wish to earn money often target countries in East Asia such as China, South Korea and Japan where demand is high.

Spain has encountered criticism{{by whom|date=April 2013}} given the overwhelming number of small to medium businesses (including TEFL schools) which routinely dodge the teachers' social security contributions as a means of maximizing profits.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ways to Make Money as a Nomad Expat {{!}} Planet Asia|url = http://planetasia.org/how-to-make-money-as-nomad-expat|website = Planet Asia|accessdate = 2015-12-11|language = en-US|date = 30 June 2014}}</ref> The result is that most teachers are entitled to less unemployment or sick pay than they would be entitled to if their salaries and contributions were declared in accordance with the law. Similar situations increase in countries with labor laws that may not apply to foreign employees, or which may be unenforced. An employer might ignore [[contract]] provisions, especially regarding [[Working time|working hours]], working days, and end-of-contract payments.\n\nDifficulties faced by foreign teachers regarding language, culture, or simply limited time can make it difficult to demand pay and conditions that their contracts stipulate. Some disputes arise from [[cross-cultural]] misunderstandings. Teachers who can't adapt to living and working in a foreign country may decide to leave after a few months. It can be difficult for teachers to recognize which jobs are legitimate, as many of the leading jobs boards allow unfiltered paid posting. Teachers can choose to enlist the help of recruitment agencies who only work with reputable schools.\n\n==TEFL region and country locations==\n{{add references|section|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Europe===\n\nMajor European cities have established language schools on-site or operated as agencies sending teachers to various locations. September is the peak recruiting month, and many annual contracts last from October until June. Employers prefer [[graduate school|graduates]] with experience in teaching [[Business English]] or in teaching young learners.\n\nInstructors from the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], countries within the [[European Union]], do not need any [[Visa (document)|visas]] to work within the EU, which reduces demand for non-EU teachers. Immigration laws require that non-EU job applicants submit documents from their home countries in person after the European employer files an officially documented job offer. If the worker has traveled to Europe to find the job, this means they must return home and wait for some time. Following the process correctly does not guarantee getting a visa. Many private-sector employers do not subsidize them at all, because they are able to hire the staff easily from the EU countries.\n\n[[International school]]s hire some experienced and well-qualified non-EU teachers. Education ministries, i.e. those of [[France]] and [[Spain]], offer opportunities for assistant language instructors in public schools. Part-time employment is usually allowed under an education visa, but this visa also requires proper attendance at an accredited EU college or university, institute, or another educational program.\n\nDespite claims from websites that sell courses, state schools often do not accept brief TEFL courses as a substitute for a university degree in English education.<ref name=\"adamo\">[http://www.teachitaly.com/tefl.htm Teacher Training (TEFL) Frauds], Frank Adamo</ref> In Spain it is impossible to get a job with a state school without getting one's foreign teaching degree accepted in Spain and then passing the civil service examination (\"oposiciones\").\n\nDemand for TEFL tends to be stronger in countries which [[Enlargement of the European Union|joined the European Union]] recently. They also tend to have lower costs of living. Non-EU teachers usually find legal work there with less difficulty. The [[Balkan]] former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] countries have seen recent growth in TEFL\u2014private schools have recruited Anglophone teachers there for several years.\n\nVery few foreign instructors work in [[Scandinavia]], where stricter immigration laws and a policy of relying on bilingual local teachers apply.\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed that in 2006 there were 4,747 female English as a Foreign Language teachers (80.1%) and 1,174 male teachers (19.8%) in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yazdanpanah |first=Lily K. |title=A Quantitative Investigation of ESL Teacher Knowledge in Australian Adult Education |journal=Teaching English as a Second Language - Electronic Journal |location=Berkeley, California |date=February 2015 |volume=18 |issue=4 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1057319.pdf}}</ref> Despite the worldwide financial crisis in 2008, the number of international students attending universities in Australia has remained high.\n\nIn August 2013, there were four hundred and sixty-two thousand international students paying full-fees in Australia, with students from China and India being the two largest markets.<ref name=Phakiti>{{Cite journal |last1=Phakiti |first1=Aek |last2=Hirsh |first2=David |last3=Woodrow |first3=Lindy |title=It's Not Only English: Effects Of Other Individual Factors On English Language Learning and Academic Learning Of ESL International Students In Australia |journal=[[Journal of Research in International Education]] |date=December 2013 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=239\u2013258 |doi=10.1177/1475240913513520}}</ref> Previously, international students applying to study at an Australian university were required to sit a test and were only accepted based on their academic performance and English language proficiency.<ref name=Phakiti/>  However, Australian universities are now providing alternative entry pathways into higher education programs to allow international students to improve both their English language and academic preparedness at the same time.

In Bangladesh, despite Bengali being the only official state language and mother tongue to almost 97% of the population, English is widely spoken. It is an affect for the cause of British Colonial ruling over the region for two consecutive centuries. People use English from day-to-day activities to formal works. Almost all colleges and higher education institutions provide in-depth language study programs for English language, literature and linguistics. Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh holds constant affiliation with British Council as a member of the Commonwealth.\n\n====Cambodia====\nDemand for English teachers in [[Cambodia]] has grown over the past decade, although the country has a small population and is dependent on foreign aid for much of its economic development, limiting growth.<ref>\"The teaching placement is primarily in the English schools of Phnom Penh. However there are opportunities to teach business, healthcare and communications classes as well.\" [https://tefl.ie/teach-english-cambodia/ Teach English In Cambodia]</ref>\n\nCambodia was ruled by the French from 1863 to 1953, and therefore English was not the primary second language until recently.

TEFL in China actually began in the latter half of the 19th century with the \"Westernization Movement\" started by some Chinese officials in the Qing Dynasty. With this movement came the influence of Western culture, trade and commerce. Some astute Chinese officials saw the need to learn English as a foreign language. The situation required establishment of institutes for teaching English. The first such Institute (called \"Tongwenguan\") was set up in 1862 and in 1901 became part of the Beijing Normal University. This institution was a comprehensive higher education facility which included TEFL in the curriculum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://teslcanadajournal.ca/index.php/tesl/article/view/1001/820|title=Teaching English as a Foreign Language in China |work=TESL Canada Journal}}</ref>\nMany opportunities exist within the [[China|People's Republic of China]], including preschool, university, private schools and institutes, companies, and tutoring. [[NGO]]s, such as Teach For China, are an opportunity as well.  The provinces and the Ministry of Education in [[Beijing]] tightly govern public schools, while private schools have more freedom to set work schedules, pay, and requirements.\n\nEnglish teaching salaries in China are dependent on multiple factors including teaching hours, location, inclusions/bonuses, public vs private sector, as well as the applicant's qualifications, education level and work experience. It is important to note that due to high demand, salaries have increased significantly over recent years. A standard contract within the public school system generally entails less than 20 hours of teaching time, weekends off, included accommodations, flight stipend/reimbursement for 1 year contracts, paid public holidays, medical insurance and Z visa (working permit) sponsorship. These positions offer an average base salary of 6,000 - 7,000 RMB per month in smaller cities and rural areas. In larger cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou these positions now offer 10,000 RMB plus per month due to higher living costs. The private sector is less uniform with salaries going as high as 20,000 RMB per month for experienced applicants in major cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jobs.gaijinpot.com/job/view/job_id/85903/lang/en|title=Disney English Language Learning Director in China|work=GaijinPot Jobs}}</ref> Private positions tend to demand higher hours, may include teaching in multiple locations and often require weekend and evening working schedules. Accommodation is not included but schools typically offer a stipend towards rental costs.\n\nEnglish teachers should hold a minimum bachelor's degree in any discipline, be at least 25 years old and have at least 2 years of working experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachinchina.cn/all-jobs/|title=Teaching Jobs in China|work=teachinchina.cn}}</ref> English teachers should also be native speakers with citizenship from one of the following countries: USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tderecruit.com/faq/|title=Teach in China FAQ|work=TDE Recruit FAQ}}</ref> Due to demand, these rules are often overlooked, and schools often are able to obtain work permits for teachers who do not meet the minimums, although this is tightening up in the major cities.\n\nPublic schools usually pay during vacations, but not for summer break unless the teacher renews the contract,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://middlekingdomlife.com/guide/travel-medical-benefits.htm|title=Travel and Medical Benefits for Foreign Teachers in China |year=2008|author=Dr. Gregory Mavrides|work=Middle Kingdom Life}}</ref> while many private schools have shortened vacation schedules and may pay for whatever short number of days is allowed for vacation.\n\nCompany jobs vary, depending on the number of employees they want to train. They may employ a teacher for one or two classes, or a complete set of 14 to 16 hours a week. Tutoring also varies, as in some cases a whole family of students or just one family member. Teachers employed by schools usually can't engage in paid tutoring or any other paid work per the terms of their teaching contract.\n\nThe majority of teachers accept contracts with schools. Public school contracts are fairly standard, while private schools set their own requirements. Schools try to hire teachers from [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, but because of demand, others with good English language skills and natural accent may be able to find positions.\n\nThere are numerous steps involved for getting a visa to teach in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.helloteacher.asia/info/visa-process|title=Getting a visa to teach in China {{!}} Hello Teacher!|website=www.helloteacher.asia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> As of February 2017 the legal process for processing and awarding Z-visas in China has become considerably more strict.

This procedure is in addition to the existing visa process. It can take approximately 3 months from being given a job offer to having all the relevant permits to enter and start working in China.\n\n====Hong Kong,China====\nHong Kong was once a British Crown colony, and English-language education is taken seriously there, as demonstrated by government-funded research. Hong Kong was handed back to the People's Republic of China in 1997 and became known as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).\n\nTeaching English in Hong Kong has become quite a business. Many English teaching institutions have since opened. Big private names include Headstart Group Limited and English for Asia. Native English speakers may quickly find a job teaching English, although foreigners should be aware of shady companies who often pull tricks on their employees.\nA qualification in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) has become a pre-requisite to enter the [[Native English-speaking Teacher scheme]] (NET scheme), which is funded by the HKSAR government and provides the ultimate career destination for an English teacher. On top of attractive salary, housing is provided with all the other fringe benefits including full holiday pay, provident fund and health insurance. Housing or rental support is the biggest incentive to foreign teachers as housing cost in Hong Kong is ranked one of the highest in the world.\n\nOnce a teacher is on the NET scheme, they can move from school to school after completion of, normally, a two-year contract.  Therefore, a teacher with a strong track record has a lot of opportunities to land an ideal position at an ideal school.  While many foreigners think coming to Hong Kong with a short online TEFL qualification is sufficient, both public and private schools are looking for TEFL qualifications listed with the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Vocational and Academic Qualifications and Hong Kong Education Bureau. Acquiring one of those qualifications gives a foreigner a definite advantage to securing a preferred teaching position at a formal school, whether private or public, kindergarten, primary or secondary.  When selecting NET, schools will not normally consider learning-centre experience due to the differences in class size, continuity of student group, level of classroom management skills and sophistication in teaching pedagogy required between schools and centres.\n\n====India====\nAdditional English language instructions take place at higher levels of public and private schools.\n\nBeginning as early as 1759, English language teaching in India has been occurring for more than two hundred and fifty years.<ref name=Hussain>{{Cite journal |last=Hussain |first=Wajahat |title=English Language Teaching in India: A Brief Historical Sketch |journal=Language in India |date=May 2012 |volume=12 |issue=5 |issn=1930-2940 |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/may2012/elthistory.pdf}}</ref> After Hindi, English is the most commonly spoken, written and read language of India, as it is used most commonly for inter-state and intrastate communication, acting as a \u2018link\u2019 language.<ref name=Hussain/> In India, it is a very important language in some fields such as law, finance, education, and business.<ref name=Hussain/>\n\nThe popularity of English in the country has also posed problems for the regional and traditional languages within the country.

Other teachers work in ''[[eikaiwa]]'' (private language schools), universities, and as Coordinators for International Relations (CIRs) in government and boards of education.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Clair|title=Teaching English as a Foreign Language|url=http://www.theteflacademy.com/teaching-english-as-a-foreign-language|publisher=The TEFL Academy|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe largest of these chains are [[Aeon (eikaiwa)|Aeon]] and [[ECC (eikaiwa)|ECC]].  The sector is not well regulated. [[Nova (English teaching company)|Nova]], one of the largest chains with over 900 branches, collapsed in October 2007, leaving thousands of foreign teachers without income or, for some, a place to live.  Agencies are increasingly used to send English speakers into [[kindergarten]]s, primary schools, and private companies whose employees need to improve their [[Business English]]. Agencies, known in Japan as ''haken'', or dispatch companies, have recently been competing among themselves to get contracts from various Boards of Education for Elementary, Junior and Senior High Schools, and wages have decreased steadily.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} JALT (the [[Japan Association for Language Teaching]]) is the largest NPO (not-for-profit organization) for language teachers (mainly native English speakers), with nearly 3,000 members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jalt.org/main/about|title=About JALT|work=jalt.org}}</ref>\n\n====Laos====\nEnglish language has been increasingly important in education, international trade and cooperation in [[Laos]] since the 1990s. The government started to promote foreign direct investment, and the introduction of Laos as an observer at [[ASEAN]] in 1992 also increased the necessity of English. Laos was considered as a full member of ASEAN in 1997. From 1992-97, the government had to improve its fluency in English.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nMore recently, high-ranking officials, business people, and shareholders have started to work at their English. This trend looks set to increase as English is due to be included and taught in the field of education too.\n\n====Middle East and North Africa====\n[[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and other wealthy [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]] are the main locations for instructors to work in this region. Many positions provide high salaries and good benefits such as free housing and flights, but tend to require extensive qualifications and experience. Private academies and university programs, variously referred to as Foundation Year or Preparatory Year programs that assist incoming students with academic preparation for university-level academic work, are the main venues of instruction. Some public primary and secondary schools, such as those in [[Abu Dhabi]], have begun to recruit foreign English instructors.\n\nOther Middle Eastern and North African countries offer more modestly-paid positions. [[Amideast]] and the [[British Council]] operate in a number of countries providing teaching opportunities in their English language courses.\n\nEnglish is also taught in [[Iran]] starting at the primary school level.\n\n====Mongolia====\n\nThe [[Peace Corps]] has 136 volunteers in [[Mongolia]], many of whom are English teachers<ref>{{cite web|author=Peace Corps |url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.wherepc.asia&cntry=mongolia |title=Mongolia &#124; Asia &#124; Peace Corps |publisher=Peacecorps.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref> mostly teaching in the vast rural areas, where the population density is low.  In [[Ulaanbaatar]], a modest number of professional NETs teach at private institutes, universities,  and some schools. In addition to foreign instructors from the major English-speaking countries, there are Filipinos teaching in Mongolian schools, institutes and large industrial or mining companies.\n\n====South Korea====\nThere is great demand for native English speakers willing to teach in [[South Korea]], though it is dropping.  In 2013, the number of native English speakers teaching in public schools dropped 7.7% in one year to 7,011.<ref>{{cite web|author=&nbsp;<!--By Hong Gil-dong | hong@heraldcorp.com//--> |url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130501000556 |title=Native English teacher head count continues decline-The Korea Herald |publisher=Nwww.koreaherald.com |date= May 2013|accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref>   Most of the nation's provinces are removing foreign English teachers from their middle and high schools. As with Japan, Korea is also nurturing a government-run program for teacher placement called [[EPIK|English Program in Korea (EPIK)]]. EPIK reported that it recruited 6,831 foreign teachers to work in Korean public schools. There are a number of associations for English teachers in Korea, the largest one with a significant number of native speakers is KOTESOL.\n\nInstitutions commonly provide round-trip airfare and a rent-free apartment for a one-year contract. Note that since March 15, 2008, [[visa (document)|visa]] rules have changed. Prospective teachers must now undergo a medical examination and a criminal background check, produce an original degree certificate, and provide sealed transcripts. On arriving in South Korea, teachers must undergo a further medical check before they receive an ARC (Alien Registration Card) card.\n\nKorean labor law provides all workers with a severance pay equivalent to one month's salary is paid at the end of a contract. Most job contracts are for 1 year and include entrance and exit plane tickets. Citizens of the US, Canada and Australia<ref>Australian Embassy, Republic of Korea: [http://www.southkorea.embassy.gov.au/seol/AusKorsocialsec08.html Australia-Korea Social Security Agreement]</ref> also receive back their pension contributions and their employers' part of the pension contributions on leaving the country. The average starting pay for those with no previous teaching experience and no degree in the English language is usually between US$1,800 to US$2,200.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bondi|first1=Diaz|title=TEFL \u2013 Teaching English Abroad|url=https://maximonivel.com/tefl-tesol/|publisher=Maximonivel|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere are four main places to work in South Korea: universities, private schools, public schools ([[EPIK]]), and private language academies (known in South Korea as ''[[hagwon]]''s). Private language academies (in 2005 there were over thirty thousand such academies teaching English<ref>{{cite report |title=The Language Training Market In Korea |publisher=[[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|Industry Canada]] |date=April 2007 |p=6 |url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2007/ic/Iu44-41-2007E.pdf#page=6 |isbn=978-0-662-45857-9}}</ref>), the most common teaching location in Korea, can be for classes of school children, housewives, university students (often at the university itself), or businesspeople.  There are numerous, usually small independent ''hagwons'' but also numerous large chains.\n\n====Taiwan====\nIn Taiwan, most teachers work in [[cram school]]s, known locally as ''bushibans'' or buxibans. Some are part of chains, like [[Hess Educational Organization|Hess]] and [[KOJEN English Language Schools|Kojen]]. Others operate independently. Such schools pay around [[US$]]2,000 per month. End-of-contract bonuses equivalent to an extra month's pay are not mandated by law as in South Korea, and are uncommon in Taiwan.  Also, under current law it is illegal for foreigners to teach English in pre-schools or kindergartens, though it is almost always overlooked by both the schools and the government, thereby making the practice common and accepted. To teach English and live in Taiwan, one must be a holder of an Alien Resident Card (ARC), which is supplied to passport holders of native English speaking countries by hiring schools. ARC candidates must hold a bachelor's degree from a university.\n\nIn recent years Taiwan has increased its needs for TEFL and Certified Teachers in public schools. Qualifications and salaries for public school positions are based on certifications and experience. Also, benefits and salaries are more extensive than cram schools.\n\n====Thailand====\n[[Thailand]] has a great demand for native English speakers, and has a ready-made workforce in the form of travelers and [[expatriates]] attracted by the local lifestyle despite relatively low salaries. Teachers can expect to earn a minimum starting salary of around 25,000 Baht.<ref>[http://www.onlinetefl.com/tefl-jobs-abroad/tefl-jobs-in-thailand.html \"Teach English in Thailand\"],  With a degree, a respected TEFL qualification and all the relevant paperwork one can expect to earn a starting salary of around 25,000 Baht (US$800) a month but that could be as high as 60,000 (US$1850) depending on experience and the location of the school.</ref> Because Thailand prohibits foreigners from most non-skilled and skilled occupations, a high percentage of foreign residents teach English for a living, and are able to stay in the country. Qualifications for EFL teachers in Thailand have become stricter in the last couple of years,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} with most schools now requiring a bachelor's degree plus a 120-hour TEFL course. It is possible to find work without a degree in Thailand. However, as a degree makes getting a work permit far easier, to work without a degree is often to work illegally, opening teachers up to exploitation by employers.<ref>[http://www.tefl.org.uk/blog/2013/july/government-vs-private-language-schools-in-thailand/ \"Government vs. Private Language Schools in Thailand\"] Some TEFL certificate providers have started offering residential courses in Thailand as a way of ensuring their students the necessary government-required experience and cultural awareness.</ref>\n\n===Americas===\nThere has been significant growth in TEFL within the wealthier non-Anglophone countries of [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]], and [[South America]] as well as the [[Caribbean]]. In particular, many teachers work in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]]. Chile has even made it a national goal to become a bilingual nation within the coming years. As proof of its commitment to this goal the Chilean Ministry of Education sponsors [[English Opens Doors]], a program that recruits English speakers to work in Chilean Public High Schools.<ref>\" South America becomes the most desired destination for teaching English positions and you must be a passport holder  from the USA, Canada, Australia, UK, Ireland, South Africa or New Zealand to\n teach there\" [https://premiertefl.com/internships/argentina/ Teach English In Argentinia]</ref>\n\n====Costa Rica====\nCosta Rica is a popular choice among TEFL teachers in light of the high market demand for English instructors, the stable economic and political atmosphere, and the vibrant culture. Teaching positions are available through public and private schools, language schools, universities and colleges, and through private tutoring. Language schools typically hire all year round, and teachers of Business English are also in high demand. There are quality Costa Rica TEFL training courses that offer certification as well as job placement assistance following completion of a course.\n\n===Africa===\nTEFL in Africa has historically been linked to aid programs such as the US [[Peace Corps]] or the multinational [[Voluntary Service Overseas]] organization, as well as other aid programs. Most African countries employ bilingual local teachers. Poverty and instability in some African countries has made it difficult to attract foreign teachers. There has been increasing government investment in education and a growing private sector.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Applied linguistics]]\n*[[Language education]]\n*[[List of countries by English-speaking population]]\n*[[Second language acquisition]]\n*[[Sociolinguistics]]\n* [[Trinity College London ESOL]]\n* [[Glossary of language teaching terms and ideas]]\n* [[English Opens Doors]]\n* [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] known as TOEFL\n* [[EF Standard English Test]], open-access standardized English assessment tools\n* [[English as a second or foreign language]]\n* [[CELTA]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Paul Z.

TEFL can occur either within the [[state school]] system or more privately, at a [[language school]] or with a [[tutor]]. TEFL can also take place in an English-speaking country for people who have [[Immigration|immigrated]] there (either temporarily for school or work, or permanently). TEFL teachers may be native or non-native speakers of English. Other acronyms for TEFL are '''TESL''' ('''Teaching English as a second language'''), '''TESOL''' ('''Teaching English to speakers of other languages'''), and '''ESL''' ('''[[English as a second or foreign language|English as a second language]]''', a term typically used in English-speaking countries, and more often referring to the learning than the teaching).<ref>{{Cite web |title=The beginner's guide to what's what in TEFL |url=https://www.i-to-i.com/blog/tefl-faq/the-beginners-guide-to-whats-what-in-tefl/ |website=i-to-i TEFL |date=2018 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> Students who are learning English as a second language are known as '''ELLs''' ('''English language learners''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elltx.org/bilingual_esl.html|title=English Language Learner - Bilingual/ESL|website=www.elltx.org}}</ref>\n\n==Teaching English as a second language==\n{{redirect|TESL|the video game|The Elder Scrolls: Legends}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n'''Teaching English as a second language''' ('''TESL''') refers to teaching [[English language|English]] to [[student]]s whose [[first language]] is not English, usually offered in a region where English ''is'' the dominant language and natural English language immersion situations are apt to be ''plentiful''.\n\nThe teaching profession has historically used different names for TEFL and TESL; however, the more generic term '''teaching English to speakers of other languages''' ('''TESOL''') is increasingly used to describe the profession. Both native speakers and non-native speakers successfully train to be English language teachers. In order to teach English as a Second Language to English Language Learners, or ELL's, one must pass a written and oral test in English to demonstrate proficiency.\n\n{ Brown (1991.p. 257)  referred to the progress the TESOL profession was making during the 1970s and 80s in achieving desired goals such as shifting its focus from product-oriented teaching to process-oriented teaching and from a rigid curriculum to a more flexible one.}\n\nThe use of these various terms has led to confusion about the training options for both prospective students and for employers. Because there is no global standard for the training of English language teacher, it is important to look beyond the actual acronym/title to the components of the training program. Short term certificate programs that do not have an academic affiliation resulting in credits or degrees (such as CELTA or other non-credit programs) can be a good launching pad for beginning positions internationally, but they will generally not provide sufficient training for a career (unless a person already has substantial experience and a degree in a closely related field). People interested in pursuing a career as an English language teacher should invest in credit-bearing programs that result in a university recognized certificate or degree program (MA/TESOL, MA/Applied Linguistics) particularly if one wants to work in higher education. Because of the confusing certification situation, employers now generally look for a certificate that reflects at least 100 hours of instruction in order to determine if the candidate has sufficient preparation to begin teaching English. Institutions with higher standards will require applicants to possess a master's degree for employment.\n\nPeople wishing to teach in the K-12 public school system in the United States will need a state-teacher certification at a minimum and an ELL Endorsement (or other state qualification) to be qualified to teach ELL.\n\n\nWhen choosing a graduate program, it is important to determine if the program is designed to prepare students to teach in K-12 settings OR in adult education settings. Most programs are designed for one or the other, but not both.\n\nIn California, teachers may become certified as ''California Teachers of English Learners'' (CTEL).\n\n==Teaching techniques==\n{{see also|Language teaching methods}}\n\n===Reading===\n\nTEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) that uses [[literature]] aimed at children and teenagers is rising in popularity. Youth-oriented literature offers simpler material (\"simplified readers\" are produced by major publishers), and often provides a more conversational style than literature for adults. [[Children's literature]] in particular sometimes provides subtle cues to pronunciation, through [[rhyming]] and other [[word play]]. One method for using these books is the multiple-pass technique. The instructor reads the book, pausing often to explain certain words and concepts. On the second pass, the instructor reads the book completely through without stopping. Textbooks contain a variety of literature like poetry, stories, essays, plays etc. through which certain linguistic items are taught.\n\nReading aloud to students who are learning English as a foreign language is a highly effective strategy to assist them in learning the basic rules and understandings of the process of reading. When teachers read aloud to their students, they simply model fluency and comprehension, while also adding visual support, periodic paraphrasing, and extension.<ref name=Bolos>{{Cite journal |last=Bolos |first=Nicole |title=Successful Strategies For Teaching Reading to Middle Grades English Language Learners: Teachers Can Employ a Variety of Classroom-Tested Strategies To Teach Reading To English Language Learners |journal=Middle School Journal |date=November 2012 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=14\u201320 |jstor=41763115|doi=10.1080/00940771.2012.11461843 }}</ref> When choosing an appropriate text for the student, both the vocabulary and concepts of the text that may be new to the student need to be considered.<ref name=Bolos/> To make sure they get definite understanding of the text, engaging the students during reading will assist them with making connections between what is being read and the new vocabulary.<ref name=Bolos/>\n\n===Communicative language teaching===\n\n[[Communicative language teaching]] (CLT) emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language. Despite a number of criticisms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tonvanhattum.com.br/comreth.html|title=Communicative Approach Rethought|author=Van Hattum, Ton|year=2006|work=tonvanhattum.com.br}}</ref>\nit continues to be popular, particularly in [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rel.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/36/2/211|title=The Trend and Challenge for Teaching EFL at Taiwanese Universities|work=sagepub.com}}</ref> and Europe. In India CBSE ( Central Board of Secondary Education) has adopted this approach in its affiliated schools.\n\nThe [[task-based language learning]] approach to CLT has gained ground in recent years. Proponents believe CLT is important for developing and improving speaking, writing, listening, and reading skills, and that it prevents students' merely listening passively to the teacher without interaction. [[Dogme language teaching|Dogme]]<ref name=\"two\">{{cite book|last1=Meddings|first1=Luke|last2=Thornbury|first2=Scott|title=Teaching Unplugged: Dogme in English Language Teaching|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0dfPgAACAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2009|publisher=Delta|isbn=978-1-905085-19-4}}</ref>  is a similar communicative approach that encourages teaching without published textbooks, instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher.<ref>{{cite news |first=Meddings |last=Luke |title=Throw away your textbooks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/26/tefl.lukemeddings |work=The Guardian |date=2004-03-26 |accessdate = 2009-06-22 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Blended learning===\n\nBlended learning is a combination of multimedia elements  (also known as [[computer-assisted language learning]]), achieved through a [[virtual learning environment]] (VLE) with classroom instruction, a teacher, and peers. Blended learning utilizes technology to provide massive amounts of comprehensible input to its learners through video and other types of multimedia, without a teacher present.\n\nVLEs have been a major growth point in the English Language Teaching (ELT) industry over the last five years. There are two types:\n\n*Externally hosted platforms that a school or institution exports content to (e.g., the proprietary [[WebCT|Web Course Tools]], or the open source [[Moodle]])\n*Content-supplied, course-managed learning platforms (e.g. the ''Macmillan English Campus'')\n\nThe former provides pre-designed structures and tools, while the latter supports course-building by the language school\u2014teachers can '''blend''' existing courses with games, activities, listening exercises, and grammar reference units contained online. This supports classroom, [[Autodidacticism|self-study]] or remote practice (for example in an [[internet caf\u00e9]]). Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan in India has launched a web portal ECTLT where learners can learn English and other subjects online and interact with their own teachers of KVS across the country.\n\n===Online classroom===\n\nAdvances in technology have made it possible to get a TEFL qualification online. Students can enroll in online classes that are [[Accreditation|accredited]] by organizations such as the British Council or Cambridge ESOL. There is no single overarching accreditation body for TEFL however private for-profit companies have been known to invent accreditation affiliates and use them to cheat the customer.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Guide to TEFL Accreditation|url=http://careers.theguardian.com/careers-blog/a-guide-to-tefl-accreditations-and-qualifications|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Study materials are divided into modules. Students take one or multiple tests per study module. Support is handled by [[tutors]], who can be reached via [[email]]. After successfully finishing the last module the student is granted a [[Certificate in Education|certificate]]. It comes in digital form or can be shipped to the student's address. Getting such a certificate can be beneficial.{{clarify|reason=how? - no OR!|date=December 2017}}{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Qualifications for TEFL teachers==\nQualification requirements vary considerably from country to country and among employers within the same country. In many institutions it is possible to teach without a degree or teaching certificate.  Some institutions will consider it necessary to be a native speaker with an MA TESOL. A university degree in English language and literature can also be of value, as indeed can any specialist degree. Other institutions consider a proof of English proficiency, a University degree and a basic teaching qualification to be more than sufficient.  However, the level of academic qualification need not be the most important qualification, as many schools will be more interested in one's interpersonal skills. For trainers wishing to enter the academic field, publications can be as important as qualifications, especially if they relate to English use in the field. Where there is a high demand for teachers and no statutory requirements, employers may accept otherwise unqualified candidates. Each country is different, and acceptance depends on demand for English teachers and the teacher's previous teaching and life experiences.<ref>\"Distance learning courses can also be a good introduction, but feedback on your teaching practice is important and most distance courses will not include this, and therefore will not be acceptable to many teaching institutes.\" [http://www.britishcouncil.org/teacherrecruitment-tefl-qualifications-certificates-2.htm The British Council]</ref>\n\nPrivate [[language school]]s are likely to require at least a certificate based on successful completion of a course consisting of a minimum of 100 hours. Major programs like EPIK will offer a higher salary to teachers who have completed any TEFL Course, online or otherwise, so long as the program meets the minimum 100-hour requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epik.go.kr/contents.do?contentsNo=49&menuNo=278|title=EPIK (English Program In Korea)-Pay Scale|publisher=}}</ref> Internet-based TEFL courses are generally accepted worldwide, and particularly in Asia, where the largest job markets exist in China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eslinsider.com/blog/will-this-tefl-course-be-accepted-or-recognized|title=Will this TEFL course be accepted or recognized?|work=eslinsider.com}}</ref> For China the minimum TEFL requirement is 120 hours.\n\nIn Asia there has also been a tendency to hire TEFL teachers on superficial criteria, such as race (with Caucasians preferred) on the assumption that an English teacher or native English speaker should be 'white', this is proven especially true in Thailand, a big employer of TEFL teachers, with adverts frequently calling explicitly for native-English speakers. Partly this is driven by commercial expectations in the private sector, where parents feel that paying extra fees for TEFL teacher should warrant an American or British TEFL teacher, the schools will not risk losing students over this.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAge/gender requirements might also be encountered. In some countries outside Europe and America, for example the Middle East, schools might hire men over women or vice versa. And they might hire only teachers in a certain age range; usually between 20 and 40 years of age. In China, age requirements can differ across the country due to provincial government regulations. Anyone under 19 may be able to teach TEFL, but usually only in a volunteer situation, such as a refugee camp.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Pay and conditions worldwide==\nAs in most fields, the pay depends greatly on education, training, experience, seniority, and expertise.  As with much [[expatriate]] work, employment conditions vary among countries, depending on the level of [[economic development]] and how much people want to live there. In relatively poor countries, even a low wage may equate to a comfortable [[middle class]] [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].<ref name=\"cactus\">{{cite web|title=TEFL Pay|url=http://www.cactustefl.com/get_started/tefl_pay.php|work=Cactus TEFL|accessdate=2010-05-19|quote=There does however seem to be a basic TEFL LAW, which states that if you're on a full-time contract of 24-26 teaching hours per week, you will have enough money to pay rent in a modest, possibly shared apartment, pay for food, get out and about to explore at weekends, have the odd beer or glass of wine of an evening, and, over the period of your contract, get some money put aside for flights home at Christmas.  Generally speaking, you tend to live fairly basically, and what you earn is not usually enough to support partners, family back home or pay back debts or mortgage instalments. In many ways, TEFL can be a bit of a return to your student days, where there is less emphasis on material 'stuff' and more in being absorbed into the culture of the experience.}}</ref> EFL Teachers who wish to earn money often target countries in East Asia such as China, South Korea and Japan where demand is high.

Similar situations increase in countries with labor laws that may not apply to foreign employees, or which may be unenforced. An employer might ignore [[contract]] provisions, especially regarding [[Working time|working hours]], working days, and end-of-contract payments.\n\nDifficulties faced by foreign teachers regarding language, culture, or simply limited time can make it difficult to demand pay and conditions that their contracts stipulate. Some disputes arise from [[cross-cultural]] misunderstandings. Teachers who can't adapt to living and working in a foreign country may decide to leave after a few months. It can be difficult for teachers to recognize which jobs are legitimate, as many of the leading jobs boards allow unfiltered paid posting. Teachers can choose to enlist the help of recruitment agencies who only work with reputable schools.\n\n==TEFL region and country locations==\n{{add references|section|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Europe===\n\nMajor European cities have established language schools on-site or operated as agencies sending teachers to various locations. September is the peak recruiting month, and many annual contracts last from October until June. Employers prefer [[graduate school|graduates]] with experience in teaching [[Business English]] or in teaching young learners.\n\nInstructors from the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], countries within the [[European Union]], do not need any [[Visa (document)|visas]] to work within the EU, which reduces demand for non-EU teachers. Immigration laws require that non-EU job applicants submit documents from their home countries in person after the European employer files an officially documented job offer. If the worker has traveled to Europe to find the job, this means they must return home and wait for some time. Following the process correctly does not guarantee getting a visa. Many private-sector employers do not subsidize them at all, because they are able to hire the staff easily from the EU countries.\n\n[[International school]]s hire some experienced and well-qualified non-EU teachers. Education ministries, i.e. those of [[France]] and [[Spain]], offer opportunities for assistant language instructors in public schools. Part-time employment is usually allowed under an education visa, but this visa also requires proper attendance at an accredited EU college or university, institute, or another educational program.\n\nDespite claims from websites that sell courses, state schools often do not accept brief TEFL courses as a substitute for a university degree in English education.<ref name=\"adamo\">[http://www.teachitaly.com/tefl.htm Teacher Training (TEFL) Frauds], Frank Adamo</ref> In Spain it is impossible to get a job with a state school without getting one's foreign teaching degree accepted in Spain and then passing the civil service examination (\"oposiciones\").\n\nDemand for TEFL tends to be stronger in countries which [[Enlargement of the European Union|joined the European Union]] recently. They also tend to have lower costs of living. Non-EU teachers usually find legal work there with less difficulty. The [[Balkan]] former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] countries have seen recent growth in TEFL\u2014private schools have recruited Anglophone teachers there for several years.\n\nVery few foreign instructors work in [[Scandinavia]], where stricter immigration laws and a policy of relying on bilingual local teachers apply.\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed that in 2006 there were 4,747 female English as a Foreign Language teachers (80.1%) and 1,174 male teachers (19.8%) in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yazdanpanah |first=Lily K. |title=A Quantitative Investigation of ESL Teacher Knowledge in Australian Adult Education |journal=Teaching English as a Second Language - Electronic Journal |location=Berkeley, California |date=February 2015 |volume=18 |issue=4 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1057319.pdf}}</ref> Despite the worldwide financial crisis in 2008, the number of international students attending universities in Australia has remained high.\n\nIn August 2013, there were four hundred and sixty-two thousand international students paying full-fees in Australia, with students from China and India being the two largest markets.<ref name=Phakiti>{{Cite journal |last1=Phakiti |first1=Aek |last2=Hirsh |first2=David |last3=Woodrow |first3=Lindy |title=It's Not Only English: Effects Of Other Individual Factors On English Language Learning and Academic Learning Of ESL International Students In Australia |journal=[[Journal of Research in International Education]] |date=December 2013 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=239\u2013258 |doi=10.1177/1475240913513520}}</ref> Previously, international students applying to study at an Australian university were required to sit a test and were only accepted based on their academic performance and English language proficiency.<ref name=Phakiti/>  However, Australian universities are now providing alternative entry pathways into higher education programs to allow international students to improve both their English language and academic preparedness at the same time. Some of these alternative pathways include Foundation Studies and English Language Intensive Courses.<ref name=Phakiti/>\n\nEmployment for teachers of English as a foreign language has risen by a rate of 45.3% over the past 5 years and is expected to grow very strongly through 2017.<ref name=open.edu.au>{{Cite web|url=https://www.open.edu.au/careers/education-training/english-teachers-as-a-second-language|title=English Teachers (As a Second Language)|last=|first=|date=|website=Open Universities Australia|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> In November 2012, the number of EAFL (English as a foreign language) teachers in Australia had risen to 8,300, and the projected number for 2017 is 9,500 teachers.<ref name=open.edu.au/> The top three regions in Australia for employment as an EAFL teacher is New South Wales: 49.5%, Victoria: 29.7%, and Queensland:  7.7%.<ref name=open.edu.au/>\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Bangladesh====\nEnglish language teaching in Bangladesh starts from the beginning of primary level education, which keeps on going further towards advanced level till secondary education through high schools. In Bangladesh, despite Bengali being the only official state language and mother tongue to almost 97% of the population, English is widely spoken. It is an affect for the cause of British Colonial ruling over the region for two consecutive centuries. People use English from day-to-day activities to formal works. Almost all colleges and higher education institutions provide in-depth language study programs for English language, literature and linguistics. Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh holds constant affiliation with British Council as a member of the Commonwealth.\n\n====Cambodia====\nDemand for English teachers in [[Cambodia]] has grown over the past decade, although the country has a small population and is dependent on foreign aid for much of its economic development, limiting growth.<ref>\"The teaching placement is primarily in the English schools of Phnom Penh. However there are opportunities to teach business, healthcare and communications classes as well.\" [https://tefl.ie/teach-english-cambodia/ Teach English In Cambodia]</ref>\n\nCambodia was ruled by the French from 1863 to 1953, and therefore English was not the primary second language until recently. From the 1970s through to the 1990s, Cambodia experienced civil war and political turmoil which had a devastating effect on the national education system and the learning of a second language.<ref name=Neau>{{Cite journal |last=Neau |first=Vira |title=The Teaching of Foreign Languages in Cambodia: A Historical Perspective |journal=Language, Culture and Curriculum |date=2010 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=253\u2013268 |doi=10.1080/07908310308666673}}</ref> By 1979 it was estimated that 90% of schools had been destroyed and 75% of teachers were no longer working and foreign languages were not being taught.<ref name=Neau/> However, in Cambodian schools today, English as a foreign language is taught from Grade 7 onwards and is the most popular foreign language studied.

The reason for this is that the people who are able to communicate in English are ones that are more likely to have opportunities to find better occupations with higher pay, as it is used to communicate with international businesses and organizations.<ref name=Hashim/>\n\n====China====\n'''Beginnings: Qing Dynasty'''\n\nAs Wang Keqiang stated (1986) TEFL has existed in China for approximately one hundred years and has been subject to the policies and politics of the times. TEFL in China actually began in the latter half of the 19th century with the \"Westernization Movement\" started by some Chinese officials in the Qing Dynasty. With this movement came the influence of Western culture, trade and commerce. Some astute Chinese officials saw the need to learn English as a foreign language. The situation required establishment of institutes for teaching English. The first such Institute (called \"Tongwenguan\") was set up in 1862 and in 1901 became part of the Beijing Normal University. This institution was a comprehensive higher education facility which included TEFL in the curriculum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://teslcanadajournal.ca/index.php/tesl/article/view/1001/820|title=Teaching English as a Foreign Language in China |work=TESL Canada Journal}}</ref>\nMany opportunities exist within the [[China|People's Republic of China]], including preschool, university, private schools and institutes, companies, and tutoring. [[NGO]]s, such as Teach For China, are an opportunity as well.  The provinces and the Ministry of Education in [[Beijing]] tightly govern public schools, while private schools have more freedom to set work schedules, pay, and requirements.\n\nEnglish teaching salaries in China are dependent on multiple factors including teaching hours, location, inclusions/bonuses, public vs private sector, as well as the applicant's qualifications, education level and work experience. It is important to note that due to high demand, salaries have increased significantly over recent years. A standard contract within the public school system generally entails less than 20 hours of teaching time, weekends off, included accommodations, flight stipend/reimbursement for 1 year contracts, paid public holidays, medical insurance and Z visa (working permit) sponsorship. These positions offer an average base salary of 6,000 - 7,000 RMB per month in smaller cities and rural areas. In larger cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou these positions now offer 10,000 RMB plus per month due to higher living costs. The private sector is less uniform with salaries going as high as 20,000 RMB per month for experienced applicants in major cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jobs.gaijinpot.com/job/view/job_id/85903/lang/en|title=Disney English Language Learning Director in China|work=GaijinPot Jobs}}</ref> Private positions tend to demand higher hours, may include teaching in multiple locations and often require weekend and evening working schedules. Accommodation is not included but schools typically offer a stipend towards rental costs.\n\nEnglish teachers should hold a minimum bachelor's degree in any discipline, be at least 25 years old and have at least 2 years of working experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachinchina.cn/all-jobs/|title=Teaching Jobs in China|work=teachinchina.cn}}</ref> English teachers should also be native speakers with citizenship from one of the following countries: USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tderecruit.com/faq/|title=Teach in China FAQ|work=TDE Recruit FAQ}}</ref> Due to demand, these rules are often overlooked, and schools often are able to obtain work permits for teachers who do not meet the minimums, although this is tightening up in the major cities.\n\nPublic schools usually pay during vacations, but not for summer break unless the teacher renews the contract,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://middlekingdomlife.com/guide/travel-medical-benefits.htm|title=Travel and Medical Benefits for Foreign Teachers in China |year=2008|author=Dr. Gregory Mavrides|work=Middle Kingdom Life}}</ref> while many private schools have shortened vacation schedules and may pay for whatever short number of days is allowed for vacation.\n\nCompany jobs vary, depending on the number of employees they want to train. They may employ a teacher for one or two classes, or a complete set of 14 to 16 hours a week. Tutoring also varies, as in some cases a whole family of students or just one family member. Teachers employed by schools usually can't engage in paid tutoring or any other paid work per the terms of their teaching contract.\n\nThe majority of teachers accept contracts with schools. Public school contracts are fairly standard, while private schools set their own requirements. Schools try to hire teachers from [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, but because of demand, others with good English language skills and natural accent may be able to find positions.\n\nThere are numerous steps involved for getting a visa to teach in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.helloteacher.asia/info/visa-process|title=Getting a visa to teach in China {{!}} Hello Teacher!|website=www.helloteacher.asia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> As of February 2017 the legal process for processing and awarding Z-visas in China has become considerably more strict. Applicants now require a criminal background check, 120 hours or more TEFL certification and a bachelor's degree from a Western University.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nooneliterecruitment.com/notarisation-documents-getting-chinese-work-visa/|title=Notarisation of documents for getting your Chinese Work Visa - Noon Elite Recruitment|work=Noon Elite Recruitment|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}</ref> Before the Chinese employer can issue an invitation letter to work in China all of these aforementioned documents are required to be notarised and legalised in the candidate's home country and then verified in China after physically posting to the Chinese employer. This procedure is in addition to the existing visa process. It can take approximately 3 months from being given a job offer to having all the relevant permits to enter and start working in China.\n\n====Hong Kong,China====\nHong Kong was once a British Crown colony, and English-language education is taken seriously there, as demonstrated by government-funded research. Hong Kong was handed back to the People's Republic of China in 1997 and became known as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).\n\nTeaching English in Hong Kong has become quite a business. Many English teaching institutions have since opened. Big private names include Headstart Group Limited and English for Asia. Native English speakers may quickly find a job teaching English, although foreigners should be aware of shady companies who often pull tricks on their employees.\nA qualification in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) has become a pre-requisite to enter the [[Native English-speaking Teacher scheme]] (NET scheme), which is funded by the HKSAR government and provides the ultimate career destination for an English teacher. On top of attractive salary, housing is provided with all the other fringe benefits including full holiday pay, provident fund and health insurance. Housing or rental support is the biggest incentive to foreign teachers as housing cost in Hong Kong is ranked one of the highest in the world.\n\nOnce a teacher is on the NET scheme, they can move from school to school after completion of, normally, a two-year contract.  Therefore, a teacher with a strong track record has a lot of opportunities to land an ideal position at an ideal school.  While many foreigners think coming to Hong Kong with a short online TEFL qualification is sufficient, both public and private schools are looking for TEFL qualifications listed with the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Vocational and Academic Qualifications and Hong Kong Education Bureau. Acquiring one of those qualifications gives a foreigner a definite advantage to securing a preferred teaching position at a formal school, whether private or public, kindergarten, primary or secondary.  When selecting NET, schools will not normally consider learning-centre experience due to the differences in class size, continuity of student group, level of classroom management skills and sophistication in teaching pedagogy required between schools and centres.\n\n====India====\nAdditional English language instructions take place at higher levels of public and private schools.\n\nBeginning as early as 1759, English language teaching in India has been occurring for more than two hundred and fifty years.<ref name=Hussain>{{Cite journal |last=Hussain |first=Wajahat |title=English Language Teaching in India: A Brief Historical Sketch |journal=Language in India |date=May 2012 |volume=12 |issue=5 |issn=1930-2940 |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/may2012/elthistory.pdf}}</ref> After Hindi, English is the most commonly spoken, written and read language of India, as it is used most commonly for inter-state and intrastate communication, acting as a \u2018link\u2019 language.<ref name=Hussain/> In India, it is a very important language in some fields such as law, finance, education, and business.<ref name=Hussain/>\n\nThe popularity of English in the country has also posed problems for the regional and traditional languages within the country. At the national level, Hindi has the status of official language in India, and English is recognized as the second official language for governmental works.<ref name=Constitution>{{Cite web |url=http://rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU%3d |title=Constitutional Provisions \u2013 Official Language Related Part-17 Of The Constitution Of India |language=Hindi |website=[[National Informatics Centre]] |accessdate=1 December 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108170457/http://www.rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU= |archivedate=8 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Japan====\n{{main|English-language education in Japan}}\n\nIn [[Japan]], the [[JET Programme]] employs assistant language teachers and teaching assistants to work in [[List of high schools in Japan|Japanese high schools]] and [[Elementary schools in Japan|elementary school]]s. Other teachers work in ''[[eikaiwa]]'' (private language schools), universities, and as Coordinators for International Relations (CIRs) in government and boards of education.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Clair|title=Teaching English as a Foreign Language|url=http://www.theteflacademy.com/teaching-english-as-a-foreign-language|publisher=The TEFL Academy|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe largest of these chains are [[Aeon (eikaiwa)|Aeon]] and [[ECC (eikaiwa)|ECC]].  The sector is not well regulated. [[Nova (English teaching company)|Nova]], one of the largest chains with over 900 branches, collapsed in October 2007, leaving thousands of foreign teachers without income or, for some, a place to live.  Agencies are increasingly used to send English speakers into [[kindergarten]]s, primary schools, and private companies whose employees need to improve their [[Business English]]. Agencies, known in Japan as ''haken'', or dispatch companies, have recently been competing among themselves to get contracts from various Boards of Education for Elementary, Junior and Senior High Schools, and wages have decreased steadily.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} JALT (the [[Japan Association for Language Teaching]]) is the largest NPO (not-for-profit organization) for language teachers (mainly native English speakers), with nearly 3,000 members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jalt.org/main/about|title=About JALT|work=jalt.org}}</ref>\n\n====Laos====\nEnglish language has been increasingly important in education, international trade and cooperation in [[Laos]] since the 1990s. The government started to promote foreign direct investment, and the introduction of Laos as an observer at [[ASEAN]] in 1992 also increased the necessity of English. Laos was considered as a full member of ASEAN in 1997. From 1992-97, the government had to improve its fluency in English.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nMore recently, high-ranking officials, business people, and shareholders have started to work at their English. This trend looks set to increase as English is due to be included and taught in the field of education too.\n\n====Middle East and North Africa====\n[[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and other wealthy [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]] are the main locations for instructors to work in this region. Many positions provide high salaries and good benefits such as free housing and flights, but tend to require extensive qualifications and experience. Private academies and university programs, variously referred to as Foundation Year or Preparatory Year programs that assist incoming students with academic preparation for university-level academic work, are the main venues of instruction. Some public primary and secondary schools, such as those in [[Abu Dhabi]], have begun to recruit foreign English instructors.\n\nOther Middle Eastern and North African countries offer more modestly-paid positions. [[Amideast]] and the [[British Council]] operate in a number of countries providing teaching opportunities in their English language courses.\n\nEnglish is also taught in [[Iran]] starting at the primary school level.\n\n====Mongolia====\n\nThe [[Peace Corps]] has 136 volunteers in [[Mongolia]], many of whom are English teachers<ref>{{cite web|author=Peace Corps |url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.wherepc.asia&cntry=mongolia |title=Mongolia &#124; Asia &#124; Peace Corps |publisher=Peacecorps.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref> mostly teaching in the vast rural areas, where the population density is low.  In [[Ulaanbaatar]], a modest number of professional NETs teach at private institutes, universities,  and some schools. In addition to foreign instructors from the major English-speaking countries, there are Filipinos teaching in Mongolian schools, institutes and large industrial or mining companies.\n\n====South Korea====\nThere is great demand for native English speakers willing to teach in [[South Korea]], though it is dropping.  In 2013, the number of native English speakers teaching in public schools dropped 7.7% in one year to 7,011.<ref>{{cite web|author=&nbsp;<!--By Hong Gil-dong | hong@heraldcorp.com//--> |url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130501000556 |title=Native English teacher head count continues decline-The Korea Herald |publisher=Nwww.koreaherald.com |date= May 2013|accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref>   Most of the nation's provinces are removing foreign English teachers from their middle and high schools. As with Japan, Korea is also nurturing a government-run program for teacher placement called [[EPIK|English Program in Korea (EPIK)]]. EPIK reported that it recruited 6,831 foreign teachers to work in Korean public schools. There are a number of associations for English teachers in Korea, the largest one with a significant number of native speakers is KOTESOL.\n\nInstitutions commonly provide round-trip airfare and a rent-free apartment for a one-year contract. Note that since March 15, 2008, [[visa (document)|visa]] rules have changed. Prospective teachers must now undergo a medical examination and a criminal background check, produce an original degree certificate, and provide sealed transcripts. On arriving in South Korea, teachers must undergo a further medical check before they receive an ARC (Alien Registration Card) card.\n\nKorean labor law provides all workers with a severance pay equivalent to one month's salary is paid at the end of a contract. Most job contracts are for 1 year and include entrance and exit plane tickets. Citizens of the US, Canada and Australia<ref>Australian Embassy, Republic of Korea: [http://www.southkorea.embassy.gov.au/seol/AusKorsocialsec08.html Australia-Korea Social Security Agreement]</ref> also receive back their pension contributions and their employers' part of the pension contributions on leaving the country. The average starting pay for those with no previous teaching experience and no degree in the English language is usually between US$1,800 to US$2,200.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bondi|first1=Diaz|title=TEFL \u2013 Teaching English Abroad|url=https://maximonivel.com/tefl-tesol/|publisher=Maximonivel|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere are four main places to work in South Korea: universities, private schools, public schools ([[EPIK]]), and private language academies (known in South Korea as ''[[hagwon]]''s). Private language academies (in 2005 there were over thirty thousand such academies teaching English<ref>{{cite report |title=The Language Training Market In Korea |publisher=[[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|Industry Canada]] |date=April 2007 |p=6 |url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2007/ic/Iu44-41-2007E.pdf#page=6 |isbn=978-0-662-45857-9}}</ref>), the most common teaching location in Korea, can be for classes of school children, housewives, university students (often at the university itself), or businesspeople.  There are numerous, usually small independent ''hagwons'' but also numerous large chains.\n\n====Taiwan====\nIn Taiwan, most teachers work in [[cram school]]s, known locally as ''bushibans'' or buxibans. Some are part of chains, like [[Hess Educational Organization|Hess]] and [[KOJEN English Language Schools|Kojen]]. Others operate independently. Such schools pay around [[US$]]2,000 per month. End-of-contract bonuses equivalent to an extra month's pay are not mandated by law as in South Korea, and are uncommon in Taiwan.  Also, under current law it is illegal for foreigners to teach English in pre-schools or kindergartens, though it is almost always overlooked by both the schools and the government, thereby making the practice common and accepted. To teach English and live in Taiwan, one must be a holder of an Alien Resident Card (ARC), which is supplied to passport holders of native English speaking countries by hiring schools. ARC candidates must hold a bachelor's degree from a university.\n\nIn recent years Taiwan has increased its needs for TEFL and Certified Teachers in public schools. Qualifications and salaries for public school positions are based on certifications and experience. Also, benefits and salaries are more extensive than cram schools.\n\n====Thailand====\n[[Thailand]] has a great demand for native English speakers, and has a ready-made workforce in the form of travelers and [[expatriates]] attracted by the local lifestyle despite relatively low salaries. Teachers can expect to earn a minimum starting salary of around 25,000 Baht.<ref>[http://www.onlinetefl.com/tefl-jobs-abroad/tefl-jobs-in-thailand.html \"Teach English in Thailand\"],  With a degree, a respected TEFL qualification and all the relevant paperwork one can expect to earn a starting salary of around 25,000 Baht (US$800) a month but that could be as high as 60,000 (US$1850) depending on experience and the location of the school.</ref> Because Thailand prohibits foreigners from most non-skilled and skilled occupations, a high percentage of foreign residents teach English for a living, and are able to stay in the country. Qualifications for EFL teachers in Thailand have become stricter in the last couple of years,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} with most schools now requiring a bachelor's degree plus a 120-hour TEFL course. It is possible to find work without a degree in Thailand. However, as a degree makes getting a work permit far easier, to work without a degree is often to work illegally, opening teachers up to exploitation by employers.<ref>[http://www.tefl.org.uk/blog/2013/july/government-vs-private-language-schools-in-thailand/ \"Government vs. Private Language Schools in Thailand\"] Some TEFL certificate providers have started offering residential courses in Thailand as a way of ensuring their students the necessary government-required experience and cultural awareness.</ref>\n\n===Americas===\nThere has been significant growth in TEFL within the wealthier non-Anglophone countries of [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]], and [[South America]] as well as the [[Caribbean]]. In particular, many teachers work in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]]. Chile has even made it a national goal to become a bilingual nation within the coming years. As proof of its commitment to this goal the Chilean Ministry of Education sponsors [[English Opens Doors]], a program that recruits English speakers to work in Chilean Public High Schools.<ref>\" South America becomes the most desired destination for teaching English positions and you must be a passport holder  from the USA, Canada, Australia, UK, Ireland, South Africa or New Zealand to\n teach there\" [https://premiertefl.com/internships/argentina/ Teach English In Argentinia]</ref>\n\n====Costa Rica====\nCosta Rica is a popular choice among TEFL teachers in light of the high market demand for English instructors, the stable economic and political atmosphere, and the vibrant culture. Teaching positions are available through public and private schools, language schools, universities and colleges, and through private tutoring. Language schools typically hire all year round, and teachers of Business English are also in high demand. There are quality Costa Rica TEFL training courses that offer certification as well as job placement assistance following completion of a course.\n\n===Africa===\nTEFL in Africa has historically been linked to aid programs such as the US [[Peace Corps]] or the multinational [[Voluntary Service Overseas]] organization, as well as other aid programs. Most African countries employ bilingual local teachers. Poverty and instability in some African countries has made it difficult to attract foreign teachers. There has been increasing government investment in education and a growing private sector.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Applied linguistics]]\n*[[Language education]]\n*[[List of countries by English-speaking population]]\n*[[Second language acquisition]]\n*[[Sociolinguistics]]\n* [[Trinity College London ESOL]]\n* [[Glossary of language teaching terms and ideas]]\n* [[English Opens Doors]]\n* [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] known as TOEFL\n* [[EF Standard English Test]], open-access standardized English assessment tools\n* [[English as a second or foreign language]]\n* [[CELTA]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Paul Z.

[[Numa Pompilius Garfield Adams|Numa P.G. Adams]], who was the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Howard University at the time, was assigned the task of organizing a new faculty of African American physicians to help advance the school in the medical field. Cobb, in turn had the aspirations of creating a laboratory of [[anatomy]] and physical anthropology at Howard University that would have the resources for African American scholars to contribute to debates in [[racial biology]]. As a part of Dean Adams' efforts, Cobb was sent to study under biological anthropologist T. Wingate Todd at Case Western Reserve University.<ref name=\"Harrison and Harrison, 19992\">Harrison and Harrison, 1999</ref> Cobb's dissertation work was an expansive survey of the Hamann-Todd Skeletal Collection, a large skeletal population now housed at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]] which is associated with Case Western Reserve University<ref name=\":0\" />. He earned his [[Ph. D|Ph.D]] in Anthropology in 1932 and his dissertation was published the title ''Human Archives'' the following year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nCobb distinguished himself by representing the pursuit of social responsibility in the field of anthropology, as well as by being a scholarly activist. In his studies and publications, he pursued disproving and dissolving misinformation including racially and socially biased studies in the fields of anatomy and anthropology. He believed that scholars of the academy must take responsibility \"not only for their own thoughts and actions but also for their own society\" because he believed that the values that are expressed, whether subtly or overtly, through studies, are key in the shaping of culture and society. He aspired to be the first anthropologist to undertake a demographic analysis that would expose the toll racism was taking on the African American population, and he wanted to create the resources so he would not be the last. His work illustrated the consequences of the human condition as a result of segregation and racism on both sides of the spectrum, and used his work to confront these issues. He also was the President of the [[NAACP]] from 1976 to 1982. He died of pneumonia on November 20, 1990.\n\nCobb was long involved in the African identified descendants' struggle for freedom, justice, and equality. He was a member of the board of directors for the NAACP since 1949 and, for a longer period, active in the affairs of the Associate's District of Columbia Branch. He also was active in the National Urban League and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. He also was editor of the journal of the National Medical Association.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Crisis|date=November 1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>\n\nHe created the Imhotep Conferences on Hospital Integration in 1957, an annual conference seeking to end hospital and medical school segregation and continued until 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/cobb-w-montague-1904-1990 |title=William Montague Cobb bio |last= |first= |date= |access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nA few of Cobb's most celebrated works were the following:\n\n* \"Human Archives\" \u2013 1932\n* \"Race and Runners\" \u20131936\n* \"The Cranio-Facial Union and the Maxillary Tuber in Mammals\" \u2013 1943\n* \"Cranio Facial Union of Man\" \u2013 1940\n* \u201cMedical Care and the Plight of the Negro in Medicine\u201d \u2013 1947.\n* \"An anatomist's view of human relations.

[[Numa Pompilius Garfield Adams|Numa P.G. Adams]], who was the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Howard University at the time, was assigned the task of organizing a new faculty of African American physicians to help advance the school in the medical field. Cobb, in turn had the aspirations of creating a laboratory of [[anatomy]] and physical anthropology at Howard University that would have the resources for African American scholars to contribute to debates in [[racial biology]]. As a part of Dean Adams' efforts, Cobb was sent to study under biological anthropologist T. Wingate Todd at Case Western Reserve University.<ref name=\"Harrison and Harrison, 19992\">Harrison and Harrison, 1999</ref> Cobb's dissertation work was an expansive survey of the Hamann-Todd Skeletal Collection, a large skeletal population now housed at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]] which is associated with Case Western Reserve University<ref name=\":0\" />. He earned his [[Ph. D|Ph.D]] in Anthropology in 1932 and his dissertation was published the title ''Human Archives'' the following year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nCobb distinguished himself by representing the pursuit of social responsibility in the field of anthropology, as well as by being a scholarly activist. In his studies and publications, he pursued disproving and dissolving misinformation including racially and socially biased studies in the fields of anatomy and anthropology. He believed that scholars of the academy must take responsibility \"not only for their own thoughts and actions but also for their own society\" because he believed that the values that are expressed, whether subtly or overtly, through studies, are key in the shaping of culture and society. He aspired to be the first anthropologist to undertake a demographic analysis that would expose the toll racism was taking on the African American population, and he wanted to create the resources so he would not be the last. His work illustrated the consequences of the human condition as a result of segregation and racism on both sides of the spectrum, and used his work to confront these issues. He also was the President of the [[NAACP]] from 1976 to 1982. He died of pneumonia on November 20, 1990.\n\nCobb was long involved in the African identified descendants' struggle for freedom, justice, and equality. He was a member of the board of directors for the NAACP since 1949 and, for a longer period, active in the affairs of the Associate's District of Columbia Branch. He also was active in the National Urban League and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. He also was editor of the journal of the National Medical Association.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Crisis|date=November 1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>\n\nHe created the Imhotep Conferences on Hospital Integration in 1957, an annual conference seeking to end hospital and medical school segregation and continued until 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/cobb-w-montague-1904-1990 |title=William Montague Cobb bio |last= |first= |date= |access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nA few of Cobb's most celebrated works were the following:\n\n* \"Human Archives\" \u2013 1932\n* \"Race and Runners\" \u20131936\n* \"The Cranio-Facial Union and the Maxillary Tuber in Mammals\" \u2013 1943\n* \"Cranio Facial Union of Man\" \u2013 1940\n* \u201cMedical Care and the Plight of the Negro in Medicine\u201d \u2013 1947.\n* \"An anatomist's view of human relations.
