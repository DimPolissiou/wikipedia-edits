From 1834 until the destruction of the edifice by fire in 1880 he was also the musical director of the Theatre Royal, a role that involved conducting the orchestra, composing more than 100 overtures to plays, and directing operatic performances including vocal soloists, a chorus and the orchestra.

He presented public lectures, played the violin in lectures by others, and published a collection of more than 100 dance tunes in 1858. Following reprints in 1965 and 2003, this is still in use today.\n\nAmong Levey's acknowledged children was the birth of triplets in April 1837, two of whom became prominent musicians: the violin virtuoso Richard Michael Levey junior (1837\u20131911) who stylised himself as a \"Paganini Redivivus\" (the reborn Paganini) and the operatic composer and conductor [[William Charles Levey]] (1837\u20131894). His great-grandson, [[Michael Levey]] (1927\u20132008), was director the National Gallery, London, from 1973 to 1986, and author of ''The Life and Death of Mozart'' (1971).<ref>See review by [[Charles Rosen]] in ''The New York Review of Books'', 18 May 1972, [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/05/18/love-that-mozart/ here]; retrieved 7 April 2020.</ref>\n\nLevey lived to see the opening the new Theatre Royal in December 1897 and died in Dublin in 1899, aged 88.\n\n==Assessment==\nAlong with [[John William Glover]], [[Joseph Robinson (composer)|Joseph Robinson]] and his brothers, John Stanford (the father of [[Charles Villiers Stanford|C.

Despite their championship drought, Belichick's Patriots remained historically dominant throughout much of the 2000s/2010s. They qualified for the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]] nine times (missing only the 2008 postseason), reached the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] five times, appeared in two Super Bowls and, in the eyes of many, solidified [[Tom Brady|Tom Brady's]] status as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. In [[2007 NFL season|2007]], the Patriots [[2007 New England Patriots season|completed just the second undefeated regular season]] in the history of the modern NFL (the first being their [[Dolphins-Patriots rivalry|division rival]] [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972]]), as well as the first since the league expanded its seasons to sixteen games (though only the '72 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl). It was achievements such as these that made the Patriots a particularly intriguing media target. A miserable loss in week four against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], where New England dropped to 2\u20132, frequent off-field antics of tight-end [[Rob Gronkowski]] and highly publicized [[Deflategate]] scandal were all important chronicles of the 2014 Patriots\u2019 wild season, the latter of which would ultimately result in the four-game suspension of Brady for the beginning of the [[2016 NFL season]]. Despite all this, the Patriots managed to emerge victorious in the end.\n\nThe Patriots finished 12\u20134 for the third straight year, winning their sixth straight [[AFC East]] title, as well as the top-overall seed and home field advantage for the AFC playoffs. With their seeding, New England was awarded a first-round bye in the playoffs for the fifth season in a row, the first such occurrence for any team since the league switched to a 12-team playoff format in 1990 (surpassing the 1992\u201395 [[Dallas Cowboys]]). They finished fourth in the NFL in scoring (468 points) and eighth in points allowed (313), and first in point differential (with an average margin of victory of 9.7 points).\n\nThe Patriots defeated the [[Baltimore Ravens]] 35\u201331 in the Divisional Round of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|playoffs]], advancing to their fourth straight [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] game. There, they defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 45\u20137 to advance to their 8th Super Bowl, their 6th under Bill Belichick. On February 1, 2015, the Patriots played the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Super Bowl XLIX]]. After allowing the Seahawks to tie the game 14\u201314 at halftime and falling behind ten points in the third quarter, the Patriots rallied in the final quarter of the game to secure a 28\u201324 lead. The win secured their fourth championship in franchise history.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=400749027|title=Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception gives Pats Super

The Patriots featured several key additions: [[Brandon LaFell]], [[Darrelle Revis]], and [[Brandon Browner]] (even though he was suspended for the first four games).\n\nAfter forcing a Patriots three-and-out, [[Chris McCain]] blocked the punt by [[Ryan Allen (American football)|Ryan Allen]] with [[Jason Trusnik]] recovering at the Patriots 15. Four plays later, [[Lamar Miller]] scored on a 4-yard touchdown pass from [[Ryan Tannehill]], for a 7-0 Dolphins lead. The Patriots responded, marching 80 yards in 13 plays, with [[Shane Vereen]] tying the game on a 2-yard run. On the third play of the Dolphins next drive, [[Mike Wallace]] was stripped by [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] with [[Jerod Mayo]] recovering at the Dolphins 35. The Dolphins  defense stiffened, and held New England to a 47-yard field goal by [[Stephen Gostkowski]]. The Dolphins responded by driving all the way to the Patriots 37, but [[Alfonzo Dennard]] intercepted Tannehill at the Patriots 6-yard line. The Patriots proceeded to march 94 yards in 11 plays, aided by a 44-yard bomb from [[Tom Brady]] to [[Julian Edelman]], culminating with Brady finding [[Rob Gronkowski]] on a six-yard touchdown pass giving the Patriots a commanding 17\u20137 lead midway through the second quarter. After reaching their own 47, the Dolphins turnover woes continued with [[Logan Ryan]] stripping Miller and [[Darrelle Revis]] recovering at the Patriots 34. The Dolphins defense stiffened and the Patriots punted. The Dolphins answered with a drive deep into Patriot territory, but had to settle for a 38-yard field goal from [[Caleb Sturgis]], trimming the score to 17\u201310 with 1:59 to go in the half. A 30-yard kickoff return by [[Patrick Chung]] and a 33-yard catch by Edelman, helped the Patriots reach the Dolphins 27 where Gostkowski drilled a 45-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 20\u201310 at halftime. The second half was a different story entirely. The Dolphins stormed all the way to the Patriots 6-yard line on their first possession, but the Patriots defense clamped down and held the Dolphins to a 24-yard field goal to trim the lead back to 7. On the fourth play of the Patriots next drive, Brady was strip-sacked by [[Cameron Wake]] with [[Louis Delmas]] recovering at the Patriots 34. Four plays later Tannehill found Wallace for a 14-yard touchdown pass to tie the game midway through the third quarter. Following a Patriots three-and-out, the Dolphins were set up with good position at their own 47. They reached the Patriots 3, but once again the Patriots clamped down and Sturgis booted a 21-yard field goal, regaining the lead for the Dolphins, 23\u201320. It only got worse for New England. Early in the fourth quarter, facing a 3rd-and-9 at the Dolphins 44, Brady had his best pocket of the 2nd half, but overthrew an open Edelman and the Patriots punted. The Dolphins pulled away on their next drive, methodically marching 85 yards in 12 plays, converting three third-downs, with Moreno rushing for a 4-yard touchdown, increasing the Dolphins lead to 30\u201320 with just 3:29 remaining in the 4th quarter. Any hope of a Patriots comeback died on their next possession when Brady was sacked by [[Anthony Johnson (defensive lineman)|Anthony Johnson]] on 4th-and-10. The Dolphins didn't get a first down, but Sturgis' 27-yard field goal, his 4th, was good and the Dolphins led 33\u201320. The Patriots drove deep into Miami territory in the final seconds, but turned the ball over on downs.\n\nThe loss was the Patriots first to open a season since losing 31\u20130 to the [[Buffalo Bills]] in 2003. Tom Brady was sacked four times, losing two fumbles and finishing the day completing only 29 of 56 pass attempts, including 14/35 in the second half, for 249 yards and 1 touchdown. Edelman had 95 yards on just 6 catches, but Brandon LaFell, the new deep-threat, didn't have a single catch. The Patriots defense played well in the first half, forcing three turnovers and holding the Dolphins to just ten points, but allowed 23 points and forced no turnovers in the second half. Ryan Tannehill was efficient, 18 of 32 for 178 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. Moreno ran for 134 yards, including 91 yards in the 2nd half, and the Dolphins as a team rushed for 191 yards and out-gained the Patriots in total yards in the second half, 222\u201367.\n\n====Week 2: at Minnesota Vikings====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Two: New England Patriots at Minnesota Vikings \u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 14\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT/12:00 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CDT]]\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=10|R2=14|R3=3|R4=3\n |home=Vikings\n |H1=7|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0\n |stadium=[[TCF Bank Stadium]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]\n |attendance=52,350\n |weather={{convert|58|F|C}}, partly cloudy\n |referee=[[Tony Corrente]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Ian Eagle]] (play-by-play), [[Dan Fouts]] (color commentator) and [[Jenny Dell]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014091404/2014/REG2/patriots@vikings Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56191/MIN_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Matt Asiata]] 25-yard pass from [[Matt Cassel]] ([[Blair Walsh]] kick), 11:02.

This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety [[Devin McCourty]] intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, [[Stevan Ridley]] scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10\u20137 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to [[Darrelle Revis]] at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17\u20137. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but [[Chandler Jones]] blocked [[Blair Walsh]]'s field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24\u20137 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27\u20137. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30\u20137 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie [[Dominique Easley]] intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game.\n\nBrady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be. Stevan Ridley led the Patriots in rushing, carrying the ball 25 times for 101 yards and a touchdown. Filling in for the suspended [[Adrian Peterson]], Matt Asiata carried the ball 13 times for only 36 yards. Matt Cassel went 19 of 36 for 202 yards with 1 touchdown, but was intercepted 4 times by the Patriots.\n\n====Week 3: vs. Oakland Raiders====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Three: Oakland Raiders at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 21\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT\n |road=Raiders\n |R1=3|R2=0|R3=6|R4=0\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=0|H2=10|H3=0|H4=6\n |stadium=[[Gillette Stadium]], [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|78|F|C}}, cloudy and humid\n |referee=[[Pete Morelli]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Greg Gumbel (play-by-play), Trent Green (color commentator) and Evan Washburn (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014092105/2014/REG3/raiders@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56208/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Sebastian Janikowski]] 49-yard field goal, 4:42.

After both teams punted again, the Patriots embarked on a 15 play, 84-yard drive, converting four third-downs,  and scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski midway through the second quarter to take a 7\u20133 lead. The Raiders punted on their next drive, and [[Marquette King]] punted only 22 yards to midfield. With the great field position, the Patriots drove all the way to the Raiders 2, but their red zone struggles continued, and they settled for a 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving them a 10\u20133 lead at halftime. Strong defense continued in the second half. The Raiders drove deep into Patriots territory early in the second quarter, but could only score on a 37-yard field goal by Janikowski. Following a Patriots punt, the Raiders drove from their own 14, to the Patriots 37, but a false start penalty on guard [[Donald Penn]] made it 3rd-and-15, and then Carr completed a 13-yard pass to [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]] to the Patriots 29, bringing up a 4th-and-2. The Raiders decided to settle with Janikowski's 47 yard field goal, making the score 10\u20139. [[Matthew Slater]] returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to the Patriots 41. With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13\u20139 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, [[Darren McFadden]] scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard [[Gabe Jackson]]. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by [[Vince Wilfork]] with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots.\n\nTom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots). With the win the Patriots advanced to 2-1 and Brady won his 150th career game, 3rd most by a starting quarterback in NFL history.\n\n====Week 4: at Kansas City Chiefs====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Four: New England Patriots at Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 Game summary\n |date={{tooltip|September 29|Monday}}\n |time=8:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CDT\n |road=Patriots\n |R1=0|R2=0|R3=7|R4=7\n |home='''Chiefs'''\n |H1=7|H2=10|H3=10|H4=14\n |stadium=[[Arrowhead Stadium]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n |attendance=76,613\n |weather={{convert|82|F|C}}, clear\n |referee=[[John Parry (American football official)|John Parry]]\n |TV=[[Monday Night Football|ESPN]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Mike Tirico]] (play-by-play), [[Jon Gruden]] (color commentator) and [[Lisa Salters]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014092900/2014/REG4/patriots@chiefs Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56230/KC_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* KC \u2013 [[Jamaal Charles]] 2-yard run ([[Cairo Santos]] kick), 2:15.

The Patriots' struggling offensive line combined with Brady's accuracy issues doomed them against [[Tamba Hali]] and [[Justin Houston]] while the Patriots had no answer for the Chiefs' balanced offensive attack.\n\nThe Chiefs had a strong opening possession, reaching the Patriots' 46, but were forced to punt. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Chiefs struck with an 11-play, 73-yard drive, with [[Jamaal Charles]] scoring on a 2-yard touchdown run. The Patriots managed to reach the Chiefs' 42-yard line on their next drive but were once again forced to punt. On the Chiefs' next possession, [[Knile Davis]] powered his way for a 48-yard carry to the Patriots' 38-yard line. Next, [[Alex Smith]] hit star tight-end [[Travis Kelce]] on a 33-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots' 5-yard line. Finally, Smith hit Charles for a five-yard touchdown pass, extending the Chiefs' lead to 14\u20130. The Patriots once again drove into Chiefs' territory on their next drive, but again punted away. Later, the Chiefs drove all the way to the Patriots' 4-yard line, and Smith hit [[Dwayne Bowe]] at the Patriots' 1-yard line, which should have ended the half, but Logan Ryan was called for a hands-to-the face on [[Donnie Avery]], giving the Chiefs one more play, and [[Cairo Santos]] booted a 22-yard chip-shot field goal for a 17\u20130 Chiefs' lead at halftime. The Chiefs had gained 303 yards of offense in the first half, the most allowed in one half by the Patriots under Belichick. Both teams punted on their initial second-half possession, but on 2nd and 7 on the Patriots' next possession, [[Tamba Hali]], almost completely untouched by left tackle [[Nate Solder]], strip-sacked Brady and recovered for Kansas City at the Patriots' 9. Two plays later, Smith threw a quick pass to Charles out of the backfield for a touchdown, Charles' third, increasing Kansas City's lead to 24\u20130. On the Patriots' second play of their next drive, a miscommunication between Brady and Edelman led to an interception by [[Sean Smith (cornerback)|Sean Smith]], who returned the ball 34 yards to the New England 13-yard line. The Patriots' defense managed to keep Kansas City out of the end zone, but Santos booted a 31-yard field goal, giving Kansas City a 27\u20130 lead. On the Patriots' next drive, Vereen ran for 9 yards on 1st down. After being stuffed for no gain on the next play, Brady hit Vereen for a 28-yard gain to the Chiefs' 44. On the very next play, Brady hit Brandon LaFell, who broke through three defenders and raced off for a 44-yard touchdown, making the score 27\u20137. However, the Chiefs couldn't be stopped. Kansas City answered right back, marching 80 yards in 12 plays, converting two third-and-longs in the process, and scoring on Smith's two-yard touchdown strike to Kelce, extending the lead to 34\u20137, and killing any hope of a Patriots' comeback. On the ensuing Patriot drive, facing a 3rd-and-4 from their own 26, [[Husain Abdullah]] intercepted a Brady pass and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving the Chiefs a 41\u20137 lead. Abdullah fell to his knees in a Muslim prayer, and was flagged for unnecessary roughness. This caused controversy as many thought it was for his praying. With the deficit an insurmountable 41\u20137, Brady was benched and rookie [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] stepped in. Garoppolo completed 3 passes on the drive: a 5-yard pass to Edelman, a 37-yard screen to LaFell, then a 13-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, for a 41\u201314 score. After both teams punted, the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock to end the game.\n\nJamaal Charles was the main weapon of the Chiefs' offense, totaling 108 yards from scrimmage (92 rushing, 16 receiving) and three touchdowns. Knile Davis ran the ball 16 times for 107 yards. Alex Smith was 20/26 for 236 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. The Chiefs forced three turnovers and converted them into 17 points while committing no turnovers themselves. Brady completed 14 of 23 passes for a pedestrian 159 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions while being sacked 3 times. Brandon LaFell was the sole offensive star for the Patriots, catching 6 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown.  The 27-point margin of defeat represented the second largest loss for the Patriots in the Bill Belichick era (the Patriots' worst loss was a 31-point loss (31\u20130) [[2003 New England Patriots season|to the Bills in Week 1 of the 2003 season]]). With the loss, the Patriots' record dropped to 2\u20132. In his regular press conference the ensuing Wednesday, when asked about the loss (primarily by [[Albert Breer]]), Belichick replied several times with his now famous line, \"We're on to Cincinnati.\" The Patriots would proceed to win ten of their final twelve regular-season games, clinch the #1 seed, win the AFC Championship, and win the Super Bowl, making that quote a piece of Patriots lore. Following their Super Bowl victory over the Seahawks, several Patriots players, including Brady himself, pointed to this game as the turning point in the Patriots' season.\n\n====Week 5: vs. Cincinnati Bengals====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Five: Cincinnati Bengals at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=October 5\n |time=8:30 p.m. EDT\n |road=Bengals\n |R1=0|R2=3|R3=14|R4=0\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=14|H2=6|H3=14|H4=9\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|47|F|C}}, clear and cool\n |referee=[[Jerome Boger]]\n |TV=[[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]] (play-by-play), [[Cris Collinsworth]] (color commentator) and [[Michele Tafoya]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014100512/2014/REG5/bengals@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56244/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Stevan Ridley]] 1-yard TD run ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] Kick), 10:06.

A wave of public criticism of the organization on national and local media (led by scathing analyses by [[Trent Dilfer]] and former Patriot [[Tedy Bruschi]], including a disputed report before the game of a confrontation between [[Josh McDaniels]] and receiver [[Aaron Dobson]]), the Patriots faced the 3\u20130 Bengals, the last remaining undefeated team, on [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]].\n\nThe Patriots wasted no time against the Bengals highly touted defense, storming 80 yards in 10 plays, including Brady running for 4 yards on 4th-and-1, with Ridley scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Bengals responded by driving to the Patriots 29, but [[Mike Nugent]] missed a 52-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 42, the Patriots raced 58 yards in only 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to [[Tim Wright (American football)|Tim Wright]], increasing the lead to 14\u20130. A 27-yard pass to Gronkowski earlier in the drive gave Brady 50,000 career passing yards, making him the 6th quarterback in NFL history to throw for 50,000 career yards. After both teams punted on their next two drives, the Bengals finally got on board towards the end of the 2nd quarter, marching 57 yards in 10 plays aided by 25 yards in Patriots' penalties, before Nugent drilled a 23-yard field goal. The Patriots answered though on a 48-yard field goal by Gostkowski, increasing the lead to 17\u20133. On the first play of Cincinnati's following drive, [[Andy Dalton]] hit superstar receiver [[A. J. Green]] for a 19-yard gain, but Darrelle Revis forced him to fumble with Jamie Collins recovering, fumbling himself, and cornerback [[Kyle Arrington]] recovering at the Bengals 25. The Patriots drove to the Bengals 1-yard line, but had to settle for a 19-yard Gostkowski field goal and a 20-3 halftime lead. After forcing the Patriots to punt early in the second quarter, [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam Jones]] returned [[Ryan Allen (American football)|Ryan Allen]]'s punt 47 yards to the Patriots 37. On the first play of the drive, Dalton bombed a 37-yard pass to [[Mohamed Sanu]] for a touchdown, trimming the deficit to 20\u201310. However, Brady and the Pats struck right back, advancing 86 yards, aided by a 19-yard run by Shane Vereen on 3rd-and-16, with Brady firing a 16-yard pass to Gronkowski, giving the Patriots a 27\u201310 lead over the flustered Bengals. On the ensuing kickoff, former Patriot [[Brandon Tate]] was hit by running back [[Brandon Bolden]] and fumbled with Kyle Arrington recovering and scampering 9 yards for the touchdown, widening the lead to a shocking 34\u201310. The Bengals responded by racing 82 yards in just 6 plays, scoring on Dalton's 17-yard touchdown pass to Green, trimming the deficit to 34\u201317. The Patriots kept hitting though, as they marched 75 yards in 9 plays to the Cincinnati 5. The Bengals managed to keep the Patriots out of the end zone, but Gostkowski kicked a 23-yard field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter, increasing the lead to 37\u201317. Gostkowski kicked two more field goals and the Patriots, who were left for dead less than a week ago, won a resounding defeat over the best team in football.\n\nBefore the game, the Patriots paid tribute to Bengals defensive tackle [[Devon Still]], whose daughter is battling cancer, with a short film during a television timeout saluting his daughter while the Patriots cheerleaders donned Devon Still #75 jerseys; the gesture and donation by the Kraft family to the Cincinnati hospital at which she is being treated, brought a standing ovation and moved Still to tears. With the win, the Patriots advanced to 3\u20132, making many rethink the \"death\" of the Patriots. The 505 total yards of offense was the Patriots highest output of the season. The Patriots forced the Bengals into three turnovers (all fumbles) while the Patriots didn't turn it over at all. Tom Brady returned to form going 23/35 for 285 yards and 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen combined for 203 rushing yards on 36 carries as the Patriots ran for 220 on the night.\n\n====Week 6: at Buffalo Bills====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Six: New England Patriots at Buffalo Bills \u2013 Game summary\n |date=October 12\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=0|R2=13|R3=10|R4=14\n |home=Bills\n |H1=0|H2=7|H3=7|H4=8\n |stadium=[[Ralph Wilson Stadium]], [[Orchard Park, New York]]\n |attendance=70,185\n |weather={{convert|55|F|C}}, clear & sunny\n |referee=[[Walt Coleman]]\n |TV=[[NFL on Fox|Fox]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Kenny Albert]] (play-by-play), [[Daryl Johnston]] (color commentator) and [[Tony Siragusa]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014101201/2014/REG6/patriots@bills Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56248/BUF_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* No scoring plays\n'''Second quarter'''\n* [[Tim Wright (American football)|Tim Wright]] 1-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 13:04.

On the third play of the Bills resulting possession, though, [[Kyle Orton]] was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Patriots 39-yard line. The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7\u20137 on a [[Kyle Orton]] touchdown pass to [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]]. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped [[C. J. Spiller]] with [[Zach Moore]] recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13\u20137 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20\u20137. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]] scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23\u201314. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on [[Jordan Devey]]. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to [[Chris Hogan]], with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30\u201322. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37\u201322. The Bills reached their own 42 on their final drive, but a sack by [[Rob Ninkovich]] and an incomplete pass intended for [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]] on 4th-and-9 officially sealed the deal.\n\nBrady completed 27 of 37 passes for 361 yards, with 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. Kyle Orton was equally very impressive, finishing the game  24 of 38 for 299 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. With 4 catches for 97 yards and 2 touchdowns, LaFell continued to be the Patriots awaited deep-threat at wide receiver. Both teams struggled to run the football. Stevan Ridley ran for only 23 yards on 10 carries, while Fred Jackson ran for only 26 yards on 10 carries. It was later learned the Patriots lost Stevan Ridley and linebacker [[Jerod Mayo]] to season ending injuries.\n\n====Week 7: vs. New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Seven: New York Jets at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date={{tooltip|October 16|Thursday}}\n |time=8:30 p.m. EDT\n |road=Jets\n |R1=6|R2=6|R3=7|R4=6\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=10|H3=3|H4=7\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|64|F|C}}, cloudy\n |referee=[[Bill Leavy]]\n |TV=CBS/[[NFLN]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Jim Nantz]] (play-by-play), [[Phil Simms]] (color commentator) and [[Tracy Wolfson]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014101600/2014/REG7/jets@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56261/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Shane Vereen]] 49-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 13:31.

For the fourth straight home game the Patriots played the Jets in a contest where the final margin of victory was less than ten points, and third straight where the margin didn't exceed three points. [[Tom Brady]] made his 200th career regular season start.\n\nOn the fourth play of the game, Shane Vereen went completely unnoticed by the Jets' secondary, on a wheel route,  and Brady hit him for a 49-yard touchdown, just 1:29 into the game. Following this, the Jets drove all the ways to the Patriots 9. On 1st-and-goal, [[Geno Smith]] hit [[Jeremy Kerley]] for a touchdown, but the play was nullified when offensive guard [[Oday Aboushi]] was flagged for holding. The Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone over the next three plays and the Jets settled for a 22-yard field goal from [[Nick Folk]]. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets seemed primed for a touchdown, but another critical holding call moved the Jets out of the red zone, and Folk kicked a 47-yard field goal, making the score 7\u20136. The Patriots went three-and-out yet again, but once more the Jets could only get a Folk field goal, this one from 46 yards, but the Jets took their first lead, 9\u20137. This time the Patriots responded this time, racing 80 yards in 10 plays to take the lead on Brady's 3-yard touchdown pass to Vereen, this one for 3 yards, to take the lead. The Jets reached the Patriots 9 for the second time, but the Patriots defense once again turned into a brick wall in the red zone, and Folk had to kick his fourth field goal of the half to bring the score to 14\u201312. A crucial pass-interference penalty on [[Asher Allen]] on the Patriots' next drive, helped them reach Jets' territory and Gostkowski kicked a 39-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17\u201312 lead at halftime.  On the Jets first drive of the third quarter they continued their clock-draining strategy with an 11-play, 6:02 drive, this time reaching the end zone again with [[Chris Ivory]] scoring on a 1-yard touchdown plunge, giving the Jets their second lead of the game, 19\u201317. Once again though, the Patriots countered, moving 53 yards to the Jets 18, and Gostkowski banged in a 36-yard field goal, taking a 20\u201319 lead. The next five combined possessions ended in punts. With 10:51 remaining in the game, Tom Brady engineered a Brady-esque drive reaching the Jets 4. A 6-yard false start penalty on Wright and a 10-yard offensive pass interference penalty on LaFell sent them back to the Jets 19. Following an in-completion to Vereen, on 3rd-and-Goal, Brady rolled out to the left and found [[Danny Amendola]] for the touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 27\u201319. This was Amendola's only catch of the game. The Jets didn't give up though. [[Geno Smith]] engineered a 12-play, 86-yard drive, finding tight end [[Jeff Cumberland]] for a 10-yard TD pass to cut the Patriots' lead to two points with 2:31 remaining. However, the 2-point conversion failed and the Jets still trailed, 27\u201325. Amendola recovered the onside kick, but the Jets defense stepped up, preventing the Patriots from running out the clock, giving the Jets one last chance at an upset with 1:06 remaining. Starting at their own 31, Geno Smith hit [[David Nelson (wide receiver)|David Nelson]] for 11 yards to the Jets 42. Next, completing a pass to [[Jeremy Kerley]] for 13 to the Patriots 45. Chris Ivory ran for five yards before heading out of bounds at the Patriots 40. After an incomplete pass, Folk came on to attempt the game-winning 58-yard field with 0:05 seconds left, but the kick was blocked by defensive lineman [[Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1990)|Chris Jones]], who had been called for a personal foul on a field goal attempt against the Jets the previous season which led to Folk's game winning 42-yard field goal, and the Patriots escaped with their third win in a row.\n\nThough not spectacular, Brady was efficient, completing  20 of 37 passes for 261 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. Geno Smith completed 20 of 34 passes for 226 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions. Vereen was the top rusher & receiver for the Patriots with 43 yards rushing and 71 receiving. It was learned shortly after the game that stalwart defensive end [[Chandler Jones]] injured his hip and would miss seven games. The Jets ran for 218 yards on the night, led by Chris Ivory, who continued to be a pest to the Patriots, gaining 107 yards on 21 carries. Chris Johnson added 61 yards on 13 carries. The Jets outgained the Patriots 423-323 and absolutely controlled the clock winning T.O.P. 40:54-19:06, but the Patriots defense tightened down when it mattered.\n\n====Week 8: vs. Chicago Bears====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Eight: Chicago Bears at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=October 26\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT\n |road=Bears\n |R1=0|R2=7|R3=8|R4=8\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=31|H3=7|H4=6\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|54|F|C}}, cloudy\n |referee=[[Brad Allen]]\n |TV=Fox\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Sam Rosen (sportscaster)|Sam Rosen]] (play-by-play), [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] (color commentator) and [[Pam Oliver]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014102605/2014/REG8/bears@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56282/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Rob Gronkowski]] 6-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 9:41.

After a Bears punt, the Patriots took over 7 minutes off the clock in driving to the Bears 5-yard line, but could only settle for a 23-yard Gostkowski field goal, and a 10\u20130 lead. The Bears fortunes didn't get any better and they punted again on their next drive. The Patriots struck again with a five-and-a-half minute, 76-yard drive culminating with a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, pushing the lead to 17\u20130. On the Bears next drive, McCourty intercepted [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] at the Bears 22, but the play was nullified by an illegal contact penalty on [[Brandon Browner]]. With new life, the Bears marched another 54 yards and Cutler found [[Matt Forte]] on a 25-yard touchdown pass, making the score 17\u20137. Then Patriots took control of the game from there. In a 57-second span, the Patriots scored 3 touchdowns. First, the Patriots marched 80 yards in 10 plays, with Brady throwing a 2-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski. Following a Bears three-and-out, Edelman's 49 yard return plus a 10-yard holding penalty on the Bears' [[Trevor Scott]] set the Patriots up at the Bears 9. On the first play, Brady hit LaFell for a 9-yard touchdown. On the first play of the ensuing Chicago possession, Cutler was strip-sacked by rookie defensive end [[Zach Moore]] with [[Rob Ninkovich]] recovering and returning it 15 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 38\u20137 lead blowout lead. Revis intercepted Cutler on the last play of the first half, and the Patriots lead stood 38\u20137. On the first drive of the 2nd half, Brady hit Gronkowski for 46-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. This was Tom Brady's fifth touchdown pass of the day (his third career five touchdown game), and the third for Gronkowski (his second career three touchdown game), extending the lead to a 45-7 massacre. Later in the third quarter, the Bears marched 80 yards with Cutler hitting [[Martellus Bennett]] on a 20-yard touchdown pass, with a successful 2 pt. conversion, making the score 45\u201315. The Patriots countered by marching 71 yards in just under six minutes, extending the lead to 48\u201315 on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal. With the game well out of reach, backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo took over for Tom Brady. The Bears would score again when Culter marched the bears 80 yards and hit [[Alshon Jeffery]] for a 10-yard touchdown pass, with another successful 2 point conversion, making the score, still insurmountable, 48\u201323. With a short field after an unsuccessful onside kick attempt, the Patriots moved 21 yards before Gostowski made the score 51\u201323. The Bears [[Jimmy Clausen]] drove them to the Patriots 26, but turned the ball over on downs. Garoppolo took a knee to end the game.\n\nThe Patriots' 51 points were their largest single-game total of the season. Tom Brady made history in the game. This was his 17th career game with four touchdown and zero interceptions which tied him with [[Drew Brees]] for the most all time. In addition, this was his 43rd career game with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions which placed him second by [[Peyton Manning]]. On top of that, he threw for 354 yards. The Patriots totaled 122 yards rushing as well. Gronkowski and LaFell combined for 20 catches for 273 yards and four touchdowns, with both catching every ball thrown to them. Jay Cutler actually played well, completing 20 of 30 passes for 220 yards and three touchdowns, but threw an interception and lost a fumble. Matt Forte was fantastic, rushing for 114 yards on just 19 carries with a receiving touchdown. However, the Bears defense couldn't stop New England for anything and it would continue next week when they lost to the Packers 55\u201314.\n\n====Week 9: vs. Denver Broncos====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Nine: Denver Broncos at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=November 2\n |time=4:25&nbsp;p.m. EST\n |road=Broncos\n |R1=7|R2=0|R3=14|R4=0\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=3|H2=24|H3=10|H4=6\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|35|F|C}}, cloudy\n |referee=Walt Anderson\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Jim Nantz (play-by-play), Phil Simms (color commentator) and Tracy Wolfson (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014110208/2014/REG9/broncos@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56300/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*[[Stephen Gostkowski]] 49-yard field goal, 7:09.

Unlike last season, the Broncos had a highly rated defense, with former Patriots [[Aqib Talib]] anchoring the secondary. This was also the [[Tom Brady-Peyton Manning rivalry|16th Brady-Manning match-up]]\n\nAfter the first three drives of the game ended in punts, Amendola waved for a fair catch at the Patriots 46-yard line, but [[Kayvon Webster]] was flagged 15 yards for interfering with Amendola, giving the Patriots the ball at the Denver 39. Despite the great field position, the Patriots failed to get a first down but Gostkowski got the Patriots on the board with a 49-yard field goal. Denver countered, storming 80 yards in just 9 plays, aided by a pass-interference penalty on [[Brandon Browner]], on 3rd-and-10 before [[Ronnie Hillman]] punched in a 1-yard touchdown run for a 7-3 Broncos lead. The Patriots then drove 67 yards in 12 plays to reach the Broncos 11, but Denver's defense held the Patriots to a 29-yard field goal by Gostkowski. On the second play of Denver's ensuing drive, Ninkovich intercepted a pass and returned it 11 yards to the Broncos 34-yard line. With the wonderful field position, the Patriots marched 34 yards, with Brady throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to Edelman. After forcing Denver to punt, [[Dustin Colquitt]] fumbled the snap, but managed to punt the ball away, Edelman fielded the ball on a bounce and returned the punt 84 yards for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 20\u20137. The Broncos marched 52 yards to the Patriots 23, but Broncos kicker [[Brandon McManus]] missed a 41-yard field goal. The Broncos forced a punt and drove to the Patriots 34-yard line. On 4th-and-6, instead of kicking a 51-yard field goal, the Broncos went for it but Manning was sacked by [[Akeem Ayers]]. With pretty good field position, the Patriots marched 57 yards in 9 plays with Vereen scoring on a 5-yard touchdown reception with 0:08 remaining in the half. Manning took a knee and the Patriots led 27\u20137 at halftime, the Broncos largest deficit of the season. On the first drive of the second half, Brady was intercepted by [[Bradley Roby]] at the Broncos 43 (his first turnover since Week 4).  Manning drove the Broncos 57 yards, hitting [[Demaryius Thomas]] for 27 yards on 3rd-and-6 and then tight end [[Julius Thomas]] for an 18-yard touchdown pass, closing the gap to 27\u201314. The Patriots responded again, driving to the Broncos 27 and Gostkowski increased the lead to 30\u201314 on a 45-yard field goal. On the Broncos next possession, Browner intercepted Manning at the Broncos 40 and returned it 30 yards to the Broncos 10. On the very next play, Brady hit LaFell for a 10-yard touchdown pass, making the game a shocking blowout with a 37\u201314 score. Aided by three Patriots penalties, the Broncos stormed 72 yards in just four plays with Hillman catching a 15-yard touchdown pass, trimming the deficit to 37\u201321. Once again The Patriots struck right back, with Tom Brady driving the Patriots 80 yards, using 14 plays, and taking 6:53 off the clock before connecting with Rob Gronkowski on a 1-yard touchdown pass, with a missed two point conversion, increasing the lead to 43\u201321. The Broncos turned the ball over on downs on three straight drives as the Patriots cruised to the sixth straight win.\n\nTom Brady completed 33 of 53 passes for 333 yards, with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. Rob Gronkowski had 9 catches for 105 yards and 1 TD, and Julian Edelman added 9 catches for 89 yards and a TD. Peyton Manning was 34 of 57 for 438 yards and 2 touchdowns, but added 2 interceptions. Both running games struggled, limited to 109 combined yards on the ground. With the win, the Patriots took the lead in the race for the AFC's #1 seed, which they would not relinquish, and made them the team to beat in the AFC. It was Tom Brady's eleventh win in sixteen career meetings against Manning<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/11/2/7143433/tom-brady-peyton-manning-rivalry-patriots-vs-broncos-week-9|title=Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning is 2 decades of NFL dominance|publisher=Vox Media|work=SBNation.com|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref> and was the Patriots' largest margin of victory over Manning since [[2001 New England Patriots season|2001]].\n\n====Week 11: at Indianapolis Colts====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Eleven: New England Patriots at Indianapolis Colts \u2013 Game summary\n |date=November 16\n |time=8:30 p.m. EST\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=7|R2=7|R3=14|R4=14\n |home=Colts\n |H1=3|H2=7|H3=3|H4=7\n |stadium=[[Lucas Oil Stadium]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]\n |attendance=66,751\n |weather=Played indoors ([[retractable roof]] closed)\n |referee=Pete Morelli\n |TV=NBC\n |TVAnnouncers=Al Michaels (play-by-play), Cris Collinsworth (color commentator) and Michele Tafoya (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014111611/2014/REG11/patriots@colts Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56329/IND_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Jonas Gray]] 4-yard run ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 4:38.

The Patriots came in looking for their sixth straight win.\n\nAfter forcing the Colts to a quick three-and-out, the Patriots scored on their opening drive of the game, covering 89 yards, in 11 plays scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run by rookie [[Jonas Gray]]. The Colts responded, aided by a 46-yard completion from Luck to [[T. Y. Hilton]], driving to the Patriots 13, but had to settle for an [[Adam Vinatieri]] 31-yard field goal to bring the score to 7\u20133. The Patriots then drove to their own 49, but safety [[Mike Adams (safety)|Mike Adams]] intercepted a pass intended for Tyms at the Colts 6 for no gain. On their next possession, the Colts reached the Patriots 32, but McCourty intercepted Luck and returned it 10 yards back to the Patriots 32. From there the Patriots struck on an 11-play, 68-yard drive, scoring on Gray's 2-yard touchdown run, extending the lead to 14\u20133. The Patriots forced a three-and-out, but on the third play of the Patriots next drive, Brady was intercepted by Adams again, who returned it 10 yards to the Patriots 23. With the fabulous field position, it took the Colts just three plays for Luck to find [[Hakeem Nicks]] on a 10-yard touchdown pass, making the score 14\u201310 with less than a minute remaining in the first half. After taking the kickoff, the Patriots restarted with an 8 play, 80-yard drive scoring on a  2-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, extending the lead to 21\u201310. The Colts drove to the Patriots 40 on their next drive, and Vinatieri was good from 53 yards away to trim the deficit to 21\u201313. The Patriots struck with another touchdown, with Brady passing for 56 yards on a 10-play, 80-yard drive before Gray scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and increasing the Patriots lead to 28\u201313. The Colts pulled back into the game on their next drive, with Luck completing 5 passes on the next drive for 77 yards, capping it off with his 1-yard touchdown pass to [[Anthony Castonzo]], pulling the game back to 28\u201320. Despite the effort from Luck and the offense, the Colt defense had no answer for the Patriots, with them driving 80 more yards in 10 more plays, scoring on Gray's 1-yard touchdown run, his fourth, increasing the lead to 35\u201320 with just 8:43 remaining. The Colts actually stuffed Gray for a two-yard loss at the Colts 31 which would've made it 4th-and-4, but a 15-yard face mask penalty on [[Jerrell Freeman]] moved the ball to the 14 and Gray scored 4 plays later. Four straight incompletions gave the Patriots the ball at the Colts 32. After two three-yard runs by Gray, Tom Brady threw a short pass to Gronkowski who broke it off for a 26-yard touchdown, effectively ending the game and clinching the Patriots' sixth straight win. The game also saw several skirmishes between Gronkowski and [[Sergio Brown]], with Gronkowski throwing Brown into an NBC camera after the play on Gray's 4th touchdown. Gronkowski referred to this incident as throwing Sergio Brown \"out of the club\" for talking trash all game, including posting Gronk's stats on Twitter during the game.\n\nJonas Gray broke out, running all over the Colts for 201 yards and 4 touchdowns on 37 carries. Tom Brady threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns, but threw two interceptions. The Patriots scored on every drive of the second half with exception of their final drive of the game which was used to run out the clock. Luck threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns, but the running game was a non-factor, totaling just 19 yards on 16 carries, with [[Trent Richardson]] running 6 times for 0 yards. Tom Brady improved to 3\u20130 against Andrew Luck.\n\n====Week 12: vs. Detroit Lions====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Twelve: Detroit Lions at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=November 23\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road=Lions\n |R1=3|R2=3|R3=0|R4=3\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=17|H3=3|H4=7\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|58|F|C}}, mostly sunny\n |referee=Tony Corrente\n |TV=Fox\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Joe Buck]] (play-by-play), [[Troy Aikman]] (color commentator) and [[Erin Andrews]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014112306/2014/REG12/lions@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56338/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Matt Prater]] 48-yard field goal, 11:44.

The Patriots re-signed last season's star [[LeGarrette Blount]] who had been released by the Steelers earlier that week after leaving a game early.\n\nOn the opening possession of the game [[Matthew Stafford]] hit [[Golden Tate]] for gains of 24 and 17 yards en route to the Patriots 34, but could only settle for a [[Matt Prater]] 48-yard field goal. Later, midway through the first quarter, the Patriots raced 64 yards in 9 plays scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright. The Lions replied on their very next possession, driving 78 yards to the Patriots 2-yard line, but the Patriots and their elite red zone defense did their thing and Prater added a 20-yard field goal. It was all Patriots for the rest of the half. Danny Amendola returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards to the Detroit 22. A 16-yard pass to LaFell and a 3-yard encroachment penalty to Ndamukong Suh moved the ball to the 3-yard line. On the very next play Blount added a 3-yard rushing touchdown, increasing the lead to 14\u20136. The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays, culminating with Brady find Wright again, for an 8-yard touchdown pass, increasing their lead to 21\u20136. The Lions drove to the Patriots 35 on the ensuing possession, but Prater missed a 53-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 43, the Patriots needed just four plays to reach the Lions 17 and Gostkowski closed out the half with a 35-yard field goal as they went into the locker room up 24\u20136. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the half 70 yards down to the Lions 10-yard line trying to bury Detroit, but on 1st down Tom Brady was intercepted by [[James Ihedigbo]]. Like almost every possession on the day, the Lions did nothing and punted after five plays. The Patriots proceeded to march 50 yards to the Lions 25 and Gostkowski added a 43-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 27\u20136. After both teams swapped three-and-outs the Lions advanced to the Patriots 31, but once again settled for a Matt Prater field goal, making the score 27-9 early in the fourth quarter. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.\n\nThe Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper [[Danny Aiken]], who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center [[Dominic Raiola]]. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman [[Zach Moore]] by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9\u20132, not only running their winning streak to 7 games, but also making it the 14th straight winning season for the Patriots.\n\n====Week 13: at Green Bay Packers====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Thirteen: New England Patriots at Green Bay Packers \u2013 Game summary\n |date=November 30\n |time=4:25 p.m. EST/3:25 p.m. CST\n |road=Patriots\n |R1=0|R2=14|R3=0|R4=7\n |home='''Packers'''\n |H1=13|H2=10|H3=0|H4=3\n |stadium=[[Lambeau Field]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]\n |attendance=78,431\n |weather={{convert|28|F|C}}, mostly cloudy\n |referee=[[Ed Hochuli]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Jim Nantz (play-by-play), Phil Simms (color commentator) and Tracy Wolfson (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014113010/2014/REG13/patriots@packers Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56359/GB_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Mason Crosby]] 32-yard field goal, 11:14.

This was the first matchup between Rodgers and Brady, as Rodgers missed the 2010 contest at Gillette Stadium with a concussion.\n\nOn the opening drive of the game, the Packers drove all the way to the Patriots 14, but the Patriots red zone defense continued to stay hot and forced them to settle for a 32-yard field goal by [[Mason Crosby]]. After a Patriots punt, the Packers, aided by a 33-yard completion from Rodgers to [[Davante Adams]], reached the Patriots 17, but once again the Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone and Mason Crosby kicked a 35-yard field goal, increasing the Packers lead to 6\u20130. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Packers stormed 85 yards in only 4 plays with Rodgers finding [[Richard Rodgers (American football)|Richard Rodgers]] deep for a 45-yard touchdown pass, increasing the lead to 13\u20130. After a terrible first quarter, the Patriots got things going on their next drive. On the first play of the second quarter, Tom Brady darted a pass to Gronkowski for a 29-yard gain to the Packers 41. Three plays later [[Brandon Bolden]] scampered for a 6-yard touchdown, trimming the deficit to 13\u20137. The Patriots defense responded by getting the Packers to a 3rd-and-5, but no pass rush allowed Rodgers 14 seconds to find [[Randall Cobb (American football)|Randall Cobb]] for a 33-yard gain to the Patriots 34. The Packers reached the Patriots 6, but Hightower sacked Rodgers for a 9-yard loss on 3rd-and-goal, and Crosby kicked a 33-yard field goal with just under six minutes remaining in the first half. Down 16\u20137, Brady drove the Patriots back down the field again on an 80-yard drive, finding LaFell in the back of the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown pass, trimming the score to 16\u201314. However, 1:05 would prove to be too much time for Aaron Rodgers. After an incompletion to Adams, Rodgers threw a screen pass to [[James Starks]] who took it 28 yards to the Packers 47. An 8-yard completion to [[Jordy Nelson]] moved the ball to the Patriots 45. Two plays later, Rodgers hit Nelson in stride, who outran Revis and McCourty, for a 45-yard touchdown with 00:14 remaining in the first half, increasing the lead to 23\u201314. That was only the 2nd touchdown Revis allowed all season. The third quarter was a stalemate, as both defenses began to take over and neither team scored. The Patriots took over with 2:21 remaining in the third and constructed a 9 play, 78-yard drive with Brady throwing a laser to LaFell for a 15-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, pulling the Patriots within two, 23\u201321. The Packers countered, reaching the Patriots 10, but Adams dropped a sure touchdown on a wide-open slant on 3rd-and-5, but Crosby kicked a 28-yard field goal, making the score 26\u201321 with 8:41 remaining. On their next drive, Brady converted a 4th-and-3 to Edelman at their own 49, and two plays later converted a 3rd-and-7 with a 10-yard pass to Gronkowski. Three plays later, Brady dropped a pass into the arms of Rob Gronkowski who caught the ball momentarily, but [[Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix]] punched it out before it could be ruled a catch, wiping out a touchdown. On the very next play, [[Mike Daniels (American football)|Mike Daniels]] and [[Mike Neal]] combined to sack Brady for a 9-yard loss. Instead of calling a timeout Gostkowski was sent out on the field for a 47-yard field goal attempt with the clock running to preserve a timeout at the two-minute warning, but Gostkowski missed the hurried field goal attempt, keeping the score 26\u201321 with just 2:40 remaining. The Patriots forced a 3rd-and-4, but Rodgers converted it with a 7-yard pass to Cobb, enabling the Packers to run out the clock and win the game.\n\nThe Patriots fell to 9\u20133 with the loss, snapping their 7-game winning streak. The Patriots looked nothing like the team that had won 7 straight games, struggling in all facets of the game. Tom Brady was 22 of 35 for 245 yards 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Patriots managed 84 yards rushing, but only carried the ball 19 times.  Rob Gronkowski was the receiving star for the Patriots with 7 catches for 98 yards.  Aaron Rodgers, continuing his home dominance, turned in another great performance, completing 24 of 38 passes for 368 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, benefiting from the Patriots almost non-existent pass rush. They managed three sacks, but couldn't get any consistent pressure. Meanwhile, Eddie Lacy had 98 yards on 21 carries. Davante Adams was the receiving star for the Packers with 6 catches for 121 yards.\n\n====Week 14: at San Diego Chargers====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Fourteen: New England Patriots at San Diego Chargers \u2013 Game summary\n |date=December 7\n |time=8:30 p.m. EST/5:30 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=3|R2=10|R3=0|R4=10\n |home=Chargers\n |H1=0|H2=14|H3=0|H4=0\n |stadium=[[Qualcomm Stadium]], [[San Diego, California]]\n |attendance=68,815\n |weather={{convert|67|F|C}}, partly cloudy\n |referee=Bill Leavy\n |TV=NBC\n |TVAnnouncers=Al Michaels (play-by-play), Cris Collinsworth (color commentator) and Michele Tafoya (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014120713/2014/REG14/patriots@chargers Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56376/SD_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Stephen Gostkowski]] 22-yard field goal, 3:15.

The Chargers answered the Patriots on their next drive, marching 80 yards in 11 plays with [[Philip Rivers]] hitting [[Malcolm Floyd]] for a 15-yard touchdown to put the Chargers up 7\u20133. On the fourth play of the Patriots next drive, Brady threw a two-yard pass to LaFell, who was stripped by [[Jahleel Addae]] with [[Darrell Stuckey]] picking up the fumble and rumbling 53 yards for a touchdown and a 14\u20133 Chargers lead. The Patriots drove all the way to the Charges 4-yard line, but the Chargers defense made a stand and the Patriots settled for a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal, and the score was 14\u20136. After forcing a Chargers three-and-out, Bolden blocked [[Mike Scifres]]' punt, knocking him out of the game, at the Chargers 25. Four plays later, Brady threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, cutting the deficit to 14\u201313. After another Chargers punt, the Patriots drove to the Chargers 18, but Brady was intercepted by [[Manti Te'o]] at the 4, concluding a sloppy, unimpressive, first half for both offenses. Both offenses came out just as bad in the second half, resulting in a combined five consecutive 3-and-outs. Midway through the third quarter, [[Devin McCourty]] intercepted Rivers at the Patriots 44 and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, but a helmet-to-helmet hit by Browner on [[Ladarius Green]] nullified the score. Replays showed Browner hit his shoulder, not his head, but the ruling was upheld. The break seemed to spur the Chargers to a score, as they reached Patriots territory but Rivers was intercepted by [[Akeem Ayers]] at the Patriots 30-yard line. The Patriots offense continued their cold streak by going three-and-out on their fourth straight drive, but their defense continued to shut down San Diego. A 16-yard punt return by Edelman set the Patriots up at their own 25. They marched 55 yards to the Chargers 20, and took the lead on a 38-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriot a 16\u201314 lead midway through the fourth quarter. After the Chargers went three-and-out for the fourth time in five drives(the lone exception ending in an interception), Brady hit Edelman on the first play of their next drive for a 69-yard catch-and-run touchdown. The extra point made the score 23\u201314, sealing another Patriots win.\n\nDespite the win, the Chargers showed that the Patriots offense was still prone to mistakes. Edelman was the star, with 8 catches for 141 yards and a touchdown. The Patriots defense had a great showing, holding the Chargers to just 216 total yards, sacking Philip Rivers four times, with an interception. This loss would send the Chargers to ultimately lose three of their last four and their season.\n\n====Week 15: vs. Miami Dolphins====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Fifteen: Miami Dolphins at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=December 14\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road=Dolphins\n |R1=3|R2=10|R3=0|R4=0\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=7|H3=24|H4=3\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|43|F|C}}, sunny\n |referee=[[Bill Vinovich]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Ian Eagle (play-by-play), Dan Fouts (color commentator) and Jenny Dell (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014121408/2014/REG15/dolphins@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56387/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Kyle Arrington]] 62-yard blocked field goal return ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 12:36.

After a Dolphins punt, the Pats drove 42 yards to the Dolphins 38, but Brady was intercepted by [[Jason Trusnik]] at the 34. The Dolphins drove 60 yards to the Patriots 6, but the red zone defense forced them to kick a 24-yard field goal. After a Patriots punt, the Dolphins drove to their own 45, but Ryan Tannehill was intercepted by [[Duron Harmon]] at the Patriots 34 and returned the ball 60 yards to the Dolphins 8. Three plays later, Shane Vereen ran in a 3-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 14\u20133. [[Jarvis Landry]] returned the ensuing kick 26 yards to the Dolphins 37. They drove 38 yards to the Patriots 35, but Sturgis kicked a 53-yard field goal. After the next three drives ended in punts, with the first half winding down, Tannehill connected with Wallace on a 32-yard touchdown bomb with 0:05 left to trim the score to 14\u201313 on a play that was initially ruled a drop. After a decent offensive showing in the first half, the Patriots went on a barrage of scoring in the third quarter. After returning the kickoff 19 yards to the 21, the Patriots stormed 79 yards in just 8 plays, increasing their lead to 21\u201313 on LeGarrette Blount's 3-yard touchdown run. After a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots drove 47 yards to the Dolphins 17 where Gostkowski drilled a 35-yard for goal, increasing the lead to 24\u201313. Patrick Chung intercepted a pass on the first play of the next drive and returned it 10 yards to the Dolphins 27. The Patriots cashed it in for a touchdown on the first play with Brady air mailing a 27-yard touchdown strike to [[Rob Gronkowski]], upping the lead to 31\u201313. After another Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots need just three plays to put the game on ice. First [[Jonas Gray]] ran for 6 yards to the Dolphins 41, followed by Brady hooking up with Gronkowski for 35 yards to the Patriots 6. Brady then found Edelman for the 6-yard touchdown pass on the next play, making the score 38\u201313. The Dolphins drove 65 yards in 14 plays to the Patriots 25, but on 4th-and-18, [[Daniel Thomas (American football)|Daniel Thomas]] could only gain 10 yards and the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots scored the final points on a 36-yarder, making the score 41\u201313. The Dolphins turned the ball over on downs and the Patriots took a knee to end the game.\n\nThe Patriots offensive line was immensely better than the opening day game against Miami as Brady wasn't sacked at all. Brady tossed 2 TDs to Edelman and Gronkowski while Vereen and Blount picked up rushing TDs. Gronkowski was their leading receiver with 96 yards and 1 touchdown on just 3 catches, and in the process secured his second 1,000 yard season. Miami picked up 384 yards of offense, but mostly couldn't get out of their own way with two turnovers and some awful drops, including a dropped touchdown by Mike Wallace. With the blowout win, the Patriots improved to 11\u20133, clinching their 17th AFC East title in franchise history, the 12th in the Brady\u2013Belichick era, and their 6th straight.\n\n====Week 16: at New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Sixteen: New England Patriots at New York Jets \u2013 Game summary\n |date=December 21\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=0|R2=7|R3=3|R4=7\n |home=Jets\n |H1=0|H2=10|H3=3|H4=3\n |stadium=[[MetLife Stadium]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n |attendance=78,160\n |weather={{convert|34|F|C}}, cloudy\n |referee=Brad Allen\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Spero Dedes]] (play-by-play) and [[Solomon Wilcots]] (color commentator)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014122105/2014/REG16/patriots@jets Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56402/NYJ_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*No scoring plays\n'''Second quarter'''\n* [[Rob Gronkowski]] 3-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 12:10.

Four the fourth time in their last five games against the Jets, the Patriots won by three points or less (the exception being the [[butt fumble]] game of 2012).\n\nThe first seven drives of the game ended in punts. On the second play of the quarter, Amendola returned [[Ryan Quigley]]'s punt 39 yards to the Jets 36. Eight plays later, Brady hit Gronkowski on a 3-yard touchdown pass for a 7\u20130 lead. The Jets countered on their next drive marching 87 yards in just over 6 minutes, scoring on [[Geno Smith]]'s 20-yard touchdown pass to [[Jeff Cumberland]] to tie the game. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets drove 54 yards to the Patriots 8, but, like the first match-up, had to settle for a 26-yard field goal by Nick Folk and a 10\u20137 lead at halftime. The Patriots offensive line was dominated by [[Sheldon Richardson]] and the Jets defensive line, as they sacked Brady four times in the first half. The Patriots received the second-half kickoff, but were forced to punt. The Jets capitalized by marching 66 yards in just over 6 minutes to the Patriots 5-yard line, but only could muster a 23-yard field goal from Folk, extending the lead to 13\u20137. The Patriots drove 81 yards to the Jets 6, but Brady threw an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-2 and Gostkowski kicked a 24-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 13\u201310.  On the second play of the Jets next drive, Smith was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Jets 40-yard line, he lateraled to Browner who reached the Jets 38. Eight plays later Jonas Gray scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Patriots a 17\u201313 lead on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Jets drove 59 yards to the Patriots 10, but on 2nd-and-8, Smith was sacked by [[Sealver Siliga]] for a 9-yard loss and an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-17 forced them to settle for a 37-yard field goal by Folk, trimming the deficit to 17\u201316 with 7:53 remaining. On the second play of the Patriots' next drive, Brady was intercepted by [[Marcus Williams (cornerback)|Marcus Williams]] at the Patriots 30-yard line. After two runs for 6 yards, Smith was sacked for a 10-yard loss on 3rd down by [[Dont'a Hightower]], setting up Folk's 52-yard go-ahead field goal attempt, but Vince Wilfork blocked Folk's attempt, keeping the Patriots ahead 17\u201316. On the Patriots' next drive, two third-down conversions allowed the Patriots to run out the clock. With the win, the Patriots improved to 12\u20133, and they clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs after the Broncos' loss to the Bengals on Monday night. This would wind up being Rex Ryan's last game against the Patriots as head coach of the New York Jets.\n\nThe Patriots were far from outstanding on offense. Brady finished 23/35 but for just 146 yards and 1 touchdown with 1 interception. The Patriots combined for just 85 rushing yards on 24 carries, but the defense came through again. The Jets once again out-gained the Patriots in total yards, but yet again, couldn't score touchdowns, and fell to big plays by the Patriots.\n\n====Week 17: vs. Buffalo Bills====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Seventeen: Buffalo Bills at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=December 28\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road='''Bills'''\n |R1=7|R2=10|R3=0|R4=0\n |home=Patriots\n |H1=3|H2=3|H3=3|H4=0\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|49|F|C}}, mostly cloudy |referee=[[Terry McAulay]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Spero Dedes (play-by-play) and Solomon Wilcots (color commentator)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014122807/2014/REG17/bills@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56417/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] 6-yard pass from [[Kyle Orton]] ([[Dan Carpenter]] kick), 11:59.

After both teams punted, the Patriots engineered a 13 play, 80-yard drive marching all the way to the Bills 6, but the Bills defense held them to a 24-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski. The Bills countered with an 80-yard drive, covering 13 plays in seven-and-a-half minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run from [[Anthony Dixon]] a few minutes into the second quarter, extending the lead to 14\u20133. Following a Patriots three-and-out, Jamie Collins strip-sacked Orton and recovered it at the Bills 44. The Patriots drove to the Bills 26, and Gostkowski kicked a 44-yard field goal and the score read 14\u20136. The Bills answered again though. [[Marcus Thigpen]] returned the ensuing kickoff 49 yards to the Patriots 47. The Bills only reached the Patriots 30, but [[Dan Carpenter]] was good on a 48-yard field goal, increasing the Bills lead to 17\u20136 at halftime. Jimmy Garoppolo took over for Brady in the second half. After the first two drives of the second half ended in punts, the Patriots marched 70 yards, using 11 plays in over 6 minutes to the Bills 13, but the Bills stuffed Garoppolo for a 1-yard loss on 4th-and-1. The Patriots forced the Bills to punt on their next drive, and Amendola returned the Bills punt 26 yards to the Bills 44. After a 20-yard pass to LaFell the Patriots were unable to get another first down, but Gostkowski hit a 35-yard field goal, trimming the score to 17\u20139. The Bills drove to the Patriots 43 on their next possession, but punted. The Patriots reached the Bills 30, but Brandon Bolden was stuffed for a 1-yard loss and Garoppolo was sacked for a 15-yard loss by [[Manny Lawson]] and [[Jerry Hughes]], bringing up a 3rd-and-26. Garoppolo completed an 18-yard pass to Tyms, making it a manageable 4th-and-8, but the catch was nullified by a holding call on [[Marcus Cannon]], making it 3rd-and-36. Garoppolo completed a 15-yard pass to Wright, but the Patriots decided to punt rather than try and convert a 4th-and-21. The Bills drove to the Patriots 41, but the Patriots forced another punt. Back-to-back completions to [[James White (running back)|James White]] brought up a 3rd-and-2, but back-to-back incompletions resulted in a turnover on downs and two knees gave the Bills the win.\n\nBrady started the game for the first half and finished 8 of 16 for 80 yards. Backup quarterback [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] would finish the game 10 of 17 for 90 yards, as the Patriots would lose the game 17\u20139. With the loss, the Patriots finished the regular season at 12\u20134, and is their first loss at home to the Bills since [[2000 New England Patriots season|2000]], Brady's rookie season. It was also their first loss at home since December 16, 2012, when they lost to that year's eventual NFC Champions, the [[2012 San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco 49ers]]. They finished 4\u20131 against teams that would make the playoffs, their only loss, a five-point loss against the Packers in Green Bay. The Patriots defense once again played well, holding the Bills to just 268 total yards and forced a turnover.\n\n===Postseason===\n{{see also|2014\u201315 NFL playoffs}}\n\n====AFC Divisional Playoffs: vs. #6 Baltimore Ravens====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=AFC Divisional Playoffs: #6 Baltimore Ravens at #1 New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date={{tooltip|January 10, 2015|Saturday}}\n |time=4:35 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n |road=Ravens\n |R1=14|R2=7|R3=7|R4=3\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=7|H3=14|H4=7\n |stadium=[[Gillette Stadium]], [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|20|F|C}}, clear, windy and cold\n |referee=[[Bill Vinovich]]\n |TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]] ([[Sports commentator|play-by-play]]), [[Cris Collinsworth]] ([[color commentator]]) and [[Michele Tafoya]] ([[sideline reporter]])\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2015011000/2014/POST19/ravens@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56495/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Kamar Aiken]] 19-yard pass from [[Joe Flacco]] ([[Justin Tucker]] kick), 12:18.

[[Tom Brady]] threw for three touchdowns and ran in a fourth.\n\nOn the opening possession of the game, The Ravens stormed 71 yards in under three minutes to take a 7\u20130 lead, with [[Joe Flacco]] hitting rookie wide receiver [[Kamar Aiken]] on a 19-yard TD pass. After a Patriots three-and-out, Flacco drove the Ravens down the field once again, this time 79 yards in exactly six minutes, capping the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to [[Steve Smith, Sr.|Steve Smith]], giving Baltimore a surprising 14\u20130 lead. The Patriots countered on their next drive. Aided by a 46-yard pass to Gronkowski, the Patriots drove 78 yards culminating in 8 plays with Brady tucking and running in a 4-yard touchdown, (in the process Brady tied [[Curtis Martin]]'s club record for rushing touchdowns in the playoffs) with less than a minute remaining in the first quarter. Midway through the second quarter, the Patriots marched 67 yards in three-and-a half minutes to tie the game at 14\u201314 with a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Danny Amendola]]. A 23-yard completion to Gronkowski earlier on the drive gave Brady 6,595 career passing yards in the postseason, a new NFL record. The touchdown pass gave him 44 touchdown passes in the playoffs, tying him with [[Brett Favre]] with second behind only Montana (who has 45). After a Ravens three-and-out, with just over a minute remaining in the first half, Brady was intercepted by Ravens linebacker [[Daryl Smith (American football)|Daryl Smith]] at the Ravens 43 for no gain. On 2nd-and-10 from the Patriots 44, Flacco threw an incomplete pass intended for Steve Smith, but Revis was flagged for illegal contact, giving the Ravens a first down at the Patriots 24. Three plays later, Flacco hit tight end [[Owen Daniels]] for a touchdown to give the Ravens a 21\u201314 with 10 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee to end the half. Amendola returned the second half kick 28 yards to the Patriots 26, but the Patriots were forced to punt after a Brady pass intended for Gronkowski fell incomplete, with a controversial pass interference no-call on Ravens rookie linebacker [[C. J. Mosley (linebacker)|C. J. Mosley]]. The Ravens took advantage of the no-call and drove 70 yards with Flacco throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass to Ravens running back [[Justin Forsett]] out of the backfield, marking Flacco's fourth touchdown pass of the game and giving the Ravens the lead 28\u201314, their second 14-point lead of the game, quieting the Patriots once raucous crowd. The Patriots drove to the Ravens 24 on their next drive. A 14-yard catch by Michael Hoomanawanui gave the Patriots a first down at the Ravens 10 with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the Ravens bench moving the ball to the 5. Two plays later, Brady found Gronk for the touchdown, trimming the deficit to 28\u201321 and tying him with Joe Montana for the most postseason touchdown passes. After a Ravens three-and-out, the Patriots needed just three plays to tie the game. Brady completed passes to Edelman and Vereen for 9 and 10 yards, respectively. Then, Brady threw a lateral pass to Edelman, who then proceeded to throw to a 51-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Danny Amendola, in what was Edelman's first career passing touchdown, tying the game at 28\u201328. On the second play of the Ravens next drive, McCourty intercepted Flacco at the Ravens 37 for no gain. Despite the fantastic field position, the Patriots didn't gain a single yard, and they decided to punt rather than attempt a 55-yard field goal. Taking over with just over three minutes remaining in the third quarter, the Ravens marched 73 yards to the Patriots 7, in 16 plays. On third down, Daniels dropped a pass in the end zone from Flacco, thanks to excellent coverage by [[Patrick Chung]], who was having a renaissance season, and the Ravens settled for a 25-yard field goal from [[Justin Tucker]], taking a 31\u201328 lead fairly early in the fourth quarter. On the next drive, Brady led the Patriots down the field, with the drive culminating in a 23-yard touchdown pass to LaFell with 5:21, giving the Patriots their first lead of the game, 35\u201331. With the pass, Brady set a new NFL record with 46 career postseason touchdown passes. He also set franchise single-game postseason records in passing yards (367) and completions (33). On the ensuing drive, the Ravens were able to move the ball to the Patriots' 36-yard line. On 2nd-and-5, with 1:47 to go, Flacco was intercepted at the Patriots 1-yard line by Duron Harmon on a deep pass intended for Ravens receiver [[Torrey Smith]]. After three Patriots kneel downs following the interception, the Ravens called their last timeout with 14 seconds to go, necessitating a Patriots punt. On the final play of the game Flacco's desperation heave was batted out of the end zone, and was batted down around the 5-yard line, sealing the Patriots' victory, and sending them to their fourth consecutive AFC Championship Game.\n\nThe game saw several skirmishes between Patriot and Raven players, and controversy ensued when Ravens coach [[John Harbaugh]] accused the Patriots of using a formation that made unclear which receivers were eligible or ineligible, causing confusion on the field. The Patriots used this formation to gain a total of over 40 yards on their game-winning drive. Brady dismissed Harbaugh's comments in his postgame press conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/01/11/league-will-review-whether-ravens-got-proper-notice-of-ineligible-player|title=League will review whether Ravens got proper notice of ineligible player|date=11 January 2015|publisher=}}</ref> The NFL confirmed that the substitutions and plays by the Patriots were legal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/12150444/2014-15-nfl-playoffs-league-says-new-england-patriots-substitutions-vs-baltimore-ravens-legal|title=2014-15 NFL playoffs -- League says New England Patriots substitutions vs. Baltimore Ravens legal\u2013ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref> Similar formations were used by the [[2014 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]], the [[2014 Detroit Lions season|Lions]], and the [[2014 Cincinnati Bengals season|Bengals]] during the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nesn.com/2015/01/bill-belichick-patriots-were-allowed-to-use-four-ol-so-we-did-it/|title=Bill Belichick: Patriots Were Allowed To Use Four O-Linemen, So We Did It|work=NESN.com|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4776177/another-nfl-team-used-four-offensive-linemen-set|title=Patriots' inspiration?

As the Patriots punted on their first drive, Colts return-man, [[Josh Cribbs]] muffed the punt with the ball bouncing off his helmet and [[Darius Fleming]] recovering for the Patriots at the Colts 26. Five plays later, Blount appeared to score  on a 4-yard touchdown run, but after official review was down short of the end zone, but Blount did score from 1-yard out on the very next play. The Colts drove 47 yards to the Patriots 34, but ex-Patriots Vinatieri missed wide-right on his 52-yard field goal attempt. With great field position at the Colts 47, aided by a 30-yard catch by Vereen, the Patriots took a 14\u20130 lead when Tom Brady hit fullback [[James Develin]] for a 1-yard touchdown late in the first quarter. Following a Colts punt, the Patriots marched 44 yards to the Colts 26, but [[D'Qwell Jackson]] intercepted Brady at the 1-yard line and returned it to the Colts 7. Aided by a 36-yard catch by [[T. Y. Hilton]], the Colts marched 93 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Zurlon Tipton]], trimming the deficit to 14\u20137. The Patriots countered, driving 65 yards to the Colts 3, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving the Patriots 17\u20137 lead. Luck took a knee and the game went to halftime. Though it was a fairly even ballgame after a half of play, but the Patriots blew the top off in the second half. After receiving the kickoff, the Patriots stormed 87 yards in just 9 plays, with Brady hitting left tackle Nate Solder, in as an eligible receiver for the play, for a 16-yard touchdown increasing their lead to 24\u20137. It was Solder's first career reception and touchdown. As the defense continued to shut down Colt quarterback Andrew Luck, Brady and the offense continued to roll. After a Colts three-and-out, the Patriots marched 62 yards in 8 plays with Brady hitting Gronkowski for a 5-yard touchdown to run the lead to 31\u20137. The Colts next drive last only four plays with Darrelle Revis intercepted Luck, Revis' third career playoff interception, and returning it 30 yards to the Colts 13. On the very next play, Blount took it 13 yards to the endzone, his 2nd touchdown of the night, cementing the fate of the game at 38\u20137. Edelman returned the next Colts punt 45 yards to the Colts 45, with a penalty moving the ball 5 yards to the Colts 40. 11 plays and over six minutes later, Blount burrowed through for his third touchdown of the night. The run gave him 148 rushing yards for the game, second most in franchise history. On the next drive, Jamie Collins intercepted Luck. The next three drives were all three-and-outs before the Colts ran out the final 1:51.\n\nBrady, extending his NFL record of playoff starts to 28, finished 23 of 35 for 226 yards three touchdowns and 1 interception. This was Brady's 7th career playoff game with 3 touchdowns, second only to [[Joe Montana]]'s 9. Blount was once again the star for the Pats against the Colts, carrying the ball 30 times, a Patriots postseason record, for 148 yard and three touchdowns. Continuing a trend of poor play versus the Patriots, Luck completed an abysmal 12 of 33 passes for 126 yards, no touchdowns and 2 interceptions. For his career, Luck fell to 0\u20134 against the Patriots, including two playoff losses. They would lose 34\u201327 in 2015. In those four games, the Patriots have outscored the Colts 189\u201373.

For the second year in a row the Seahawks boasted the #1 ranked defense (1st against the pass, 3rd against the run). This was the Patriots' first Super Bowl appearance since 2011, when they lost to the Giants. This was the stadium where the 18-0 Patriots lost to the Giants in [[Super Bowl XLII]].\n\nAfter both teams punted on their initial drive, the Patriots marched 58 yards in 13 plays, in just under 8 minutes, reaching the Seahawks 10-yard line, but on third and goal, facing a blitz, Brady was intercepted by [[Jeremy Lane]] in the end zone, who returned it to the Seahawks 15. Lane suffered a broken wrist on the play and didn't return to the game. The Seahawks were able to get their first first down on their next drive, but nothing more and punted. Taking over at their own 35, the Patriots struck first blood, marching 65 yards in 9 plays, converting a 3rd-and-9 with a 23-yard catch by Edelman, culminating with Brady hitting Brandon LaFell on an 11-yard touchdown pass. After trading three-and-outs, Seattle marched 70 yards in 8 plays, converting three third down, culminating with Marshawn Lynch plunging in from 3 yards out to tie the game 7\u20137. The Patriots countered, racing 80 yards in under two minutes and with Brady lofting a 22-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski they retook the lead 14\u20137 with only 31 seconds left in the half. With only 31 second left in the half, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that the Seahawks would kneel to end the half; however, this was not the case. The ensuing Seahawks possession began with a 19-yard [[Robert Turbin]] run. Following a 17-yard Russell Wilson scramble to the Patriots 44, Wilson lofted a 23-yard completion [[Ricardo Lockette]] and, with an additional 10 yards on a Kyle Arrington facemask penalty, moved the ball to the Patriots' 11 yard line with 0:06 seconds remaining in the half. Wilson then hit [[Chris Matthews]] for the touchdown, the first of the latter's career, tying the game at 14\u201314 at halftime. The Seahawks marched 72 yards to the Patriots 8 line on the first drive of the second half, but the Patriots defense stiffened and held them to a 27-yard field goal by [[Steven Hauschka]], giving the Seahawks their first lead of the game, 17\u201314. On the Patriots first drive, facing a 3rd-and-9 from their own 32, linebacker [[Bobby Wagner]] intercepted Brady's pass, intended for Rob Gronkowski, and returned it 6 yards to the Patriots 34. An illegal contact penalty on [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]] moved the ball to midfield, but it didn't stop the Seahawks. Wilson hit [[Doug Baldwin]] on a 3-yard touchdown pass wide open in the back of the end zone, increasing the Seahawks lead to 24\u201314. Baldwin was later fined for an obscene gesture after the play. Sherman was also scene mocking Darrelle Revis (who was covering Baldwin) after the play. Seattle looked to be taking over, forcing the Patriots to a three-and-out. They drove to the Patriots 47, but Wilson threw an incomplete pass intended for [[Jermaine Kearse]] on 3rd-and-2. Once again though, the Seahawks forced the Patriots to a three-and-out after stuffing LeGarrette Blount for a 1-yard loss on 3rd-and-1. Facing their largest 4th quarter deficit in a Super Bowl during the Brady-Belichick era, the Patriots appeared finished, but Rob Ninkovich sacked Wilson for an 8-yard loss on 3rd-and-7, forcing Seattle to punt. [[Bruce Irvin (American football)|Bruce Irvin]] sacked Brady for an 8-yard loss on first down. Two plays later, facing a 3rd-and-14, Brady completed a 21-yard pass to Edelman for a first down to their own 49. A 9-yard completion to Vereen coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on [[Earl Thomas (defensive back)|Earl Thomas]] moved the ball to the Seahawks 27. Three plays later, Brady found Edelman again, for another 21 yard gain on 3rd-and-14. Two plays later, Brady found Amendola for a 4-yard touchdown pass, trimming the deficit to 24\u201321. The Seahawks went three-and-out on their next drive, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 36 yard line with 6:52 remaining. Tom Brady completed all of his eight pass attempts on the drive, marching the Patriots 64 yards, culminating in a 3-yard touchdown pass to Julian Edelman with 2:02 left to retake the lead, Brady's fourth touchdown pass of the evening. However, Seattle had 2 minutes and a full complement of timeouts at their disposal. On the first play of the ensuing Seahawk possession, Russell Wilson hit Lynch on a 31-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots 49. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10, Wilson found Lockette for an 11-yard gain to the Patriots 38. On the next play with 1:13 remaining, Kearse caught a 33-yard pass that bounced off of his body multiple times (which has been compared to the David Tyree [[Helmet Catch|helmet catch]] which also came against the Patriots at University of Phoenix Stadium). The Seahawks now had the ball at the Patriots' 5 yard line. Marshawn Lynch carried the ball to the 1 yard line on the next play, setting up 2nd and goal at the 1 yard line. On the next play, Wilson's pass, intended for Ricardo Lockette, was intercepted by undrafted free-agent rookie [[Malcolm Butler]] on the goal line with 20 seconds remaining. Butler also made a big play two plays earlier, he was the only one who had the presence of mind to push Kearse out of bounds after his catch.  After taking over possession at their own 1 yard line, the Patriots induced an offsides penalty on Seattle defensive end [[Michael Bennett (defensive lineman, born 1985)|Michael Bennett]]. A brawl broke out between the two teams after that, resulting in the ejection of Irvin, and fines against Bennett, Gronkowski and Michael Hoomanawanui. The Patriots took a knee, killing the clock, winning their fourth Super Bowl Championship; their first since [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], ten years earlier. Pete Carroll suffered severe backlash for failing to change Darrell Bevell's final play call on the goal line. This controversy sparked multiple memes and even a commercial which featured Marshawn Lynch saying, \"you should've ran the ball.\"\n\nTom Brady was named Super Bowl MVP (his third, tying Joe Montana for most all time) after completing 37 of 50 passes for 328 yards, with 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.  Brady was 13 of 15 for 124 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 140.7 passer rating with a QBR of 97.0 in the 4th quarter. Brady tied Montana and [[Terry Bradshaw]] for most Super Bowl victories by a quarterback, with four. Blount was a non-factor with just 40 yards on just 14 carries. Edelman was the top receiver of the game with 9 catches for 109 yards and 1 touchdown with three huge third-down catches. Russell Wilson was 12 of 21 for 247 yards, 2 TDs and 1 INT and added 39 yards on 3 carries. Rob Gronkowski had 6 catches for 68 yards and 1 touchdown. Shane Vereen led all players in receptions, with 11 catches for 64 yards, while Seattle counterpart Marshawn Lynch had 102 yards on 24 carries and 1 touchdown. Receiver Danny Amendola had 5 catches for 48 yards and 1 touchdown. Chris Matthews broke out with 4 catches for 109 yards and a touchdown.\n\n==Standings==\n\n===Division===\n{{2014 AFC East standings|team=NE}}\n\n===Conference===\n{{2014 AFC standings|team=NE}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Deflategate]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.patriots.com/schedule-and-stats/index.html}}\n*[http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/year/2014 2014 New England Patriots season at ESPN]\n*[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2014.htm 2014 New England Patriots season at Pro Football Reference]\n\n{{Super Bowl champions}}\n{{New England Patriots seasons}}\n{{Super Bowl XLIX}}\n{{New England Patriots}}\n{{2014 NFL season by team}}\n\n[[Category:2014 National Football League season by team|New England]]\n[[Category:New England Patriots seasons]]\n[[Category:2014 in sports in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:AFC East championship seasons]]\n[[Category:American Football Conference championship seasons]]\n[[Category:Super Bowl champion seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|55th season in franchise history; fourth Super Bowl win}}\n{{Infobox NFL team season\n| logo =\n| team = New England Patriots\n| year = 2014\n| record = 12\u20134\n| division_place = 1st [[AFC East]]\n| coach = [[Bill Belichick]]\n| owner = [[Robert Kraft]]\n| stadium = [[Gillette Stadium]]\n| playoffs = '''Won [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|Divisional Playoffs]]''' ([[2014 Baltimore Ravens season|Ravens]]) 35\u201331<br>'''Won [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|AFC Championship]]''' ([[2014 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]]) 45\u20137 <br>'''Won [[Super Bowl XLIX]]''' (vs. [[2014 Seattle Seahawks season|Seahawks]]) 28\u201324\n| pro_bowlers = {{Collapsible list\n|title = 5\n|QB [[Tom Brady]]<br>K [[Stephen Gostkowski]]<br>TE [[Rob Gronkowski]]<br>CB [[Darrelle Revis]]<br>ST [[Matthew Slater]]\n}}\n| AP All-pros = {{Collapsible list\n|title = 4\n|1 = K [[Stephen Gostkowski]]\n|2 = TE [[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|3 = CB [[Darrelle Revis]]\n|4 = ST [[Matthew Slater]]\n}}\n| uniform = \n| colors = Nautical Blue, Red, New Century Silver, White\n{{Color box|#002244}} {{Color box|#C60C30}} {{Color box|#B0B7BC}} {{Color box|white}}\n| shortnavlink = Patriots seasons\n}}\nThe '''2014 [[New England Patriots]] season''' was the franchise's 45th season in the [[National Football League]], the 55th overall and the 15th under [[List of New England Patriots head coaches|head coach]] [[Bill Belichick]].\n\nThe [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]] would mark the ten-year anniversary of the Patriots third and most recent [[Super Bowl]] win, when they defeated the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIX]]. Despite their championship drought, Belichick's Patriots remained historically dominant throughout much of the 2000s/2010s. They qualified for the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]] nine times (missing only the 2008 postseason), reached the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] five times, appeared in two Super Bowls and, in the eyes of many, solidified [[Tom Brady|Tom Brady's]] status as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. In [[2007 NFL season|2007]], the Patriots [[2007 New England Patriots season|completed just the second undefeated regular season]] in the history of the modern NFL (the first being their [[Dolphins-Patriots rivalry|division rival]] [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972]]), as well as the first since the league expanded its seasons to sixteen games (though only the '72 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl). It was achievements such as these that made the Patriots a particularly intriguing media target. A miserable loss in week four against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], where New England dropped to 2\u20132, frequent off-field antics of tight-end [[Rob Gronkowski]] and highly publicized [[Deflategate]] scandal were all important chronicles of the 2014 Patriots\u2019 wild season, the latter of which would ultimately result in the four-game suspension of Brady for the beginning of the [[2016 NFL season]]. Despite all this, the Patriots managed to emerge victorious in the end.\n\nThe Patriots finished 12\u20134 for the third straight year, winning their sixth straight [[AFC East]] title, as well as the top-overall seed and home field advantage for the AFC playoffs. With their seeding, New England was awarded a first-round bye in the playoffs for the fifth season in a row, the first such occurrence for any team since the league switched to a 12-team playoff format in 1990 (surpassing the 1992\u201395 [[Dallas Cowboys]]). They finished fourth in the NFL in scoring (468 points) and eighth in points allowed (313), and first in point differential (with an average margin of victory of 9.7 points).\n\nThe Patriots defeated the [[Baltimore Ravens]] 35\u201331 in the Divisional Round of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|playoffs]], advancing to their fourth straight [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] game. There, they defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 45\u20137 to advance to their 8th Super Bowl, their 6th under Bill Belichick. On February 1, 2015, the Patriots played the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Super Bowl XLIX]]. After allowing the Seahawks to tie the game 14\u201314 at halftime and falling behind ten points in the third quarter, the Patriots rallied in the final quarter of the game to secure a 28\u201324 lead. The win secured their fourth championship in franchise history.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=400749027|title=Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception gives Pats Super

The Patriots featured several key additions: [[Brandon LaFell]], [[Darrelle Revis]], and [[Brandon Browner]] (even though he was suspended for the first four games).\n\nAfter forcing a Patriots three-and-out, [[Chris McCain]] blocked the punt by [[Ryan Allen (American football)|Ryan Allen]] with [[Jason Trusnik]] recovering at the Patriots 15. Four plays later, [[Lamar Miller]] scored on a 4-yard touchdown pass from [[Ryan Tannehill]], for a 7-0 Dolphins lead. The Patriots responded, marching 80 yards in 13 plays, with [[Shane Vereen]] tying the game on a 2-yard run. On the third play of the Dolphins next drive, [[Mike Wallace]] was stripped by [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] with [[Jerod Mayo]] recovering at the Dolphins 35. The Dolphins  defense stiffened, and held New England to a 47-yard field goal by [[Stephen Gostkowski]]. The Dolphins responded by driving all the way to the Patriots 37, but [[Alfonzo Dennard]] intercepted Tannehill at the Patriots 6-yard line. The Patriots proceeded to march 94 yards in 11 plays, aided by a 44-yard bomb from [[Tom Brady]] to [[Julian Edelman]], culminating with Brady finding [[Rob Gronkowski]] on a six-yard touchdown pass giving the Patriots a commanding 17\u20137 lead midway through the second quarter. After reaching their own 47, the Dolphins turnover woes continued with [[Logan Ryan]] stripping Miller and [[Darrelle Revis]] recovering at the Patriots 34. The Dolphins defense stiffened and the Patriots punted. The Dolphins answered with a drive deep into Patriot territory, but had to settle for a 38-yard field goal from [[Caleb Sturgis]], trimming the score to 17\u201310 with 1:59 to go in the half. A 30-yard kickoff return by [[Patrick Chung]] and a 33-yard catch by Edelman, helped the Patriots reach the Dolphins 27 where Gostkowski drilled a 45-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 20\u201310 at halftime. The second half was a different story entirely. The Dolphins stormed all the way to the Patriots 6-yard line on their first possession, but the Patriots defense clamped down and held the Dolphins to a 24-yard field goal to trim the lead back to 7. On the fourth play of the Patriots next drive, Brady was strip-sacked by [[Cameron Wake]] with [[Louis Delmas]] recovering at the Patriots 34. Four plays later Tannehill found Wallace for a 14-yard touchdown pass to tie the game midway through the third quarter. Following a Patriots three-and-out, the Dolphins were set up with good position at their own 47. They reached the Patriots 3, but once again the Patriots clamped down and Sturgis booted a 21-yard field goal, regaining the lead for the Dolphins, 23\u201320. It only got worse for New England. Early in the fourth quarter, facing a 3rd-and-9 at the Dolphins 44, Brady had his best pocket of the 2nd half, but overthrew an open Edelman and the Patriots punted. The Dolphins pulled away on their next drive, methodically marching 85 yards in 12 plays, converting three third-downs, with Moreno rushing for a 4-yard touchdown, increasing the Dolphins lead to 30\u201320 with just 3:29 remaining in the 4th quarter. Any hope of a Patriots comeback died on their next possession when Brady was sacked by [[Anthony Johnson (defensive lineman)|Anthony Johnson]] on 4th-and-10. The Dolphins didn't get a first down, but Sturgis' 27-yard field goal, his 4th, was good and the Dolphins led 33\u201320. The Patriots drove deep into Miami territory in the final seconds, but turned the ball over on downs.\n\nThe loss was the Patriots first to open a season since losing 31\u20130 to the [[Buffalo Bills]] in 2003. Tom Brady was sacked four times, losing two fumbles and finishing the day completing only 29 of 56 pass attempts, including 14/35 in the second half, for 249 yards and 1 touchdown. Edelman had 95 yards on just 6 catches, but Brandon LaFell, the new deep-threat, didn't have a single catch. The Patriots defense played well in the first half, forcing three turnovers and holding the Dolphins to just ten points, but allowed 23 points and forced no turnovers in the second half. Ryan Tannehill was efficient, 18 of 32 for 178 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. Moreno ran for 134 yards, including 91 yards in the 2nd half, and the Dolphins as a team rushed for 191 yards and out-gained the Patriots in total yards in the second half, 222\u201367.\n\n====Week 2: at Minnesota Vikings====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Two: New England Patriots at Minnesota Vikings \u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 14\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT/12:00 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CDT]]\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=10|R2=14|R3=3|R4=3\n |home=Vikings\n |H1=7|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0\n |stadium=[[TCF Bank Stadium]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]\n |attendance=52,350\n |weather={{convert|58|F|C}}, partly cloudy\n |referee=[[Tony Corrente]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Ian Eagle]] (play-by-play), [[Dan Fouts]] (color commentator) and [[Jenny Dell]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014091404/2014/REG2/patriots@vikings Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56191/MIN_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Matt Asiata]] 25-yard pass from [[Matt Cassel]] ([[Blair Walsh]] kick), 11:02.

This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety [[Devin McCourty]] intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, [[Stevan Ridley]] scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10\u20137 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to [[Darrelle Revis]] at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17\u20137. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but [[Chandler Jones]] blocked [[Blair Walsh]]'s field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24\u20137 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27\u20137. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30\u20137 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie [[Dominique Easley]] intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game.\n\nBrady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be. Stevan Ridley led the Patriots in rushing, carrying the ball 25 times for 101 yards and a touchdown. Filling in for the suspended [[Adrian Peterson]], Matt Asiata carried the ball 13 times for only 36 yards. Matt Cassel went 19 of 36 for 202 yards with 1 touchdown, but was intercepted 4 times by the Patriots.\n\n====Week 3: vs. Oakland Raiders====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Three: Oakland Raiders at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 21\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT\n |road=Raiders\n |R1=3|R2=0|R3=6|R4=0\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=0|H2=10|H3=0|H4=6\n |stadium=[[Gillette Stadium]], [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|78|F|C}}, cloudy and humid\n |referee=[[Pete Morelli]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Greg Gumbel (play-by-play), Trent Green (color commentator) and Evan Washburn (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014092105/2014/REG3/raiders@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56208/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Sebastian Janikowski]] 49-yard field goal, 4:42.

After both teams punted again, the Patriots embarked on a 15 play, 84-yard drive, converting four third-downs,  and scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski midway through the second quarter to take a 7\u20133 lead. The Raiders punted on their next drive, and [[Marquette King]] punted only 22 yards to midfield. With the great field position, the Patriots drove all the way to the Raiders 2, but their red zone struggles continued, and they settled for a 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving them a 10\u20133 lead at halftime. Strong defense continued in the second half. The Raiders drove deep into Patriots territory early in the second quarter, but could only score on a 37-yard field goal by Janikowski. Following a Patriots punt, the Raiders drove from their own 14, to the Patriots 37, but a false start penalty on guard [[Donald Penn]] made it 3rd-and-15, and then Carr completed a 13-yard pass to [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]] to the Patriots 29, bringing up a 4th-and-2. The Raiders decided to settle with Janikowski's 47 yard field goal, making the score 10\u20139. [[Matthew Slater]] returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to the Patriots 41. With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13\u20139 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, [[Darren McFadden]] scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard [[Gabe Jackson]]. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by [[Vince Wilfork]] with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots.\n\nTom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots). With the win the Patriots advanced to 2-1 and Brady won his 150th career game, 3rd most by a starting quarterback in NFL history.\n\n====Week 4: at Kansas City Chiefs====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Four: New England Patriots at Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 Game summary\n |date={{tooltip|September 29|Monday}}\n |time=8:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CDT\n |road=Patriots\n |R1=0|R2=0|R3=7|R4=7\n |home='''Chiefs'''\n |H1=7|H2=10|H3=10|H4=14\n |stadium=[[Arrowhead Stadium]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n |attendance=76,613\n |weather={{convert|82|F|C}}, clear\n |referee=[[John Parry (American football official)|John Parry]]\n |TV=[[Monday Night Football|ESPN]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Mike Tirico]] (play-by-play), [[Jon Gruden]] (color commentator) and [[Lisa Salters]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014092900/2014/REG4/patriots@chiefs Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56230/KC_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* KC \u2013 [[Jamaal Charles]] 2-yard run ([[Cairo Santos]] kick), 2:15.

The Patriots' struggling offensive line combined with Brady's accuracy issues doomed them against [[Tamba Hali]] and [[Justin Houston]] while the Patriots had no answer for the Chiefs' balanced offensive attack.\n\nThe Chiefs had a strong opening possession, reaching the Patriots' 46, but were forced to punt. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Chiefs struck with an 11-play, 73-yard drive, with [[Jamaal Charles]] scoring on a 2-yard touchdown run. The Patriots managed to reach the Chiefs' 42-yard line on their next drive but were once again forced to punt. On the Chiefs' next possession, [[Knile Davis]] powered his way for a 48-yard carry to the Patriots' 38-yard line. Next, [[Alex Smith]] hit star tight-end [[Travis Kelce]] on a 33-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots' 5-yard line. Finally, Smith hit Charles for a five-yard touchdown pass, extending the Chiefs' lead to 14\u20130. The Patriots once again drove into Chiefs' territory on their next drive, but again punted away. Later, the Chiefs drove all the way to the Patriots' 4-yard line, and Smith hit [[Dwayne Bowe]] at the Patriots' 1-yard line, which should have ended the half, but Logan Ryan was called for a hands-to-the face on [[Donnie Avery]], giving the Chiefs one more play, and [[Cairo Santos]] booted a 22-yard chip-shot field goal for a 17\u20130 Chiefs' lead at halftime. The Chiefs had gained 303 yards of offense in the first half, the most allowed in one half by the Patriots under Belichick. Both teams punted on their initial second-half possession, but on 2nd and 7 on the Patriots' next possession, [[Tamba Hali]], almost completely untouched by left tackle [[Nate Solder]], strip-sacked Brady and recovered for Kansas City at the Patriots' 9. Two plays later, Smith threw a quick pass to Charles out of the backfield for a touchdown, Charles' third, increasing Kansas City's lead to 24\u20130. On the Patriots' second play of their next drive, a miscommunication between Brady and Edelman led to an interception by [[Sean Smith (cornerback)|Sean Smith]], who returned the ball 34 yards to the New England 13-yard line. The Patriots' defense managed to keep Kansas City out of the end zone, but Santos booted a 31-yard field goal, giving Kansas City a 27\u20130 lead. On the Patriots' next drive, Vereen ran for 9 yards on 1st down. After being stuffed for no gain on the next play, Brady hit Vereen for a 28-yard gain to the Chiefs' 44. On the very next play, Brady hit Brandon LaFell, who broke through three defenders and raced off for a 44-yard touchdown, making the score 27\u20137. However, the Chiefs couldn't be stopped. Kansas City answered right back, marching 80 yards in 12 plays, converting two third-and-longs in the process, and scoring on Smith's two-yard touchdown strike to Kelce, extending the lead to 34\u20137, and killing any hope of a Patriots' comeback. On the ensuing Patriot drive, facing a 3rd-and-4 from their own 26, [[Husain Abdullah]] intercepted a Brady pass and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving the Chiefs a 41\u20137 lead. Abdullah fell to his knees in a Muslim prayer, and was flagged for unnecessary roughness. This caused controversy as many thought it was for his praying. With the deficit an insurmountable 41\u20137, Brady was benched and rookie [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] stepped in. Garoppolo completed 3 passes on the drive: a 5-yard pass to Edelman, a 37-yard screen to LaFell, then a 13-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, for a 41\u201314 score. After both teams punted, the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock to end the game.\n\nJamaal Charles was the main weapon of the Chiefs' offense, totaling 108 yards from scrimmage (92 rushing, 16 receiving) and three touchdowns. Knile Davis ran the ball 16 times for 107 yards. Alex Smith was 20/26 for 236 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. The Chiefs forced three turnovers and converted them into 17 points while committing no turnovers themselves. Brady completed 14 of 23 passes for a pedestrian 159 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions while being sacked 3 times. Brandon LaFell was the sole offensive star for the Patriots, catching 6 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown.  The 27-point margin of defeat represented the second largest loss for the Patriots in the Bill Belichick era (the Patriots' worst loss was a 31-point loss (31\u20130) [[2003 New England Patriots season|to the Bills in Week 1 of the 2003 season]]). With the loss, the Patriots' record dropped to 2\u20132. In his regular press conference the ensuing Wednesday, when asked about the loss (primarily by [[Albert Breer]]), Belichick replied several times with his now famous line, \"We're on to Cincinnati.\" The Patriots would proceed to win ten of their final twelve regular-season games, clinch the #1 seed, win the AFC Championship, and win the Super Bowl, making that quote a piece of Patriots lore. Following their Super Bowl victory over the Seahawks, several Patriots players, including Brady himself, pointed to this game as the turning point in the Patriots' season.\n\n====Week 5: vs. Cincinnati Bengals====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Five: Cincinnati Bengals at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=October 5\n |time=8:30 p.m. EDT\n |road=Bengals\n |R1=0|R2=3|R3=14|R4=0\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=14|H2=6|H3=14|H4=9\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|47|F|C}}, clear and cool\n |referee=[[Jerome Boger]]\n |TV=[[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]] (play-by-play), [[Cris Collinsworth]] (color commentator) and [[Michele Tafoya]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014100512/2014/REG5/bengals@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56244/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Stevan Ridley]] 1-yard TD run ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] Kick), 10:06.

A wave of public criticism of the organization on national and local media (led by scathing analyses by [[Trent Dilfer]] and former Patriot [[Tedy Bruschi]], including a disputed report before the game of a confrontation between [[Josh McDaniels]] and receiver [[Aaron Dobson]]), the Patriots faced the 3\u20130 Bengals, the last remaining undefeated team, on [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]].\n\nThe Patriots wasted no time against the Bengals highly touted defense, storming 80 yards in 10 plays, including Brady running for 4 yards on 4th-and-1, with Ridley scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Bengals responded by driving to the Patriots 29, but [[Mike Nugent]] missed a 52-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 42, the Patriots raced 58 yards in only 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to [[Tim Wright (American football)|Tim Wright]], increasing the lead to 14\u20130. A 27-yard pass to Gronkowski earlier in the drive gave Brady 50,000 career passing yards, making him the 6th quarterback in NFL history to throw for 50,000 career yards. After both teams punted on their next two drives, the Bengals finally got on board towards the end of the 2nd quarter, marching 57 yards in 10 plays aided by 25 yards in Patriots' penalties, before Nugent drilled a 23-yard field goal. The Patriots answered though on a 48-yard field goal by Gostkowski, increasing the lead to 17\u20133. On the first play of Cincinnati's following drive, [[Andy Dalton]] hit superstar receiver [[A. J. Green]] for a 19-yard gain, but Darrelle Revis forced him to fumble with Jamie Collins recovering, fumbling himself, and cornerback [[Kyle Arrington]] recovering at the Bengals 25. The Patriots drove to the Bengals 1-yard line, but had to settle for a 19-yard Gostkowski field goal and a 20-3 halftime lead. After forcing the Patriots to punt early in the second quarter, [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam Jones]] returned [[Ryan Allen (American football)|Ryan Allen]]'s punt 47 yards to the Patriots 37. On the first play of the drive, Dalton bombed a 37-yard pass to [[Mohamed Sanu]] for a touchdown, trimming the deficit to 20\u201310. However, Brady and the Pats struck right back, advancing 86 yards, aided by a 19-yard run by Shane Vereen on 3rd-and-16, with Brady firing a 16-yard pass to Gronkowski, giving the Patriots a 27\u201310 lead over the flustered Bengals. On the ensuing kickoff, former Patriot [[Brandon Tate]] was hit by running back [[Brandon Bolden]] and fumbled with Kyle Arrington recovering and scampering 9 yards for the touchdown, widening the lead to a shocking 34\u201310. The Bengals responded by racing 82 yards in just 6 plays, scoring on Dalton's 17-yard touchdown pass to Green, trimming the deficit to 34\u201317. The Patriots kept hitting though, as they marched 75 yards in 9 plays to the Cincinnati 5. The Bengals managed to keep the Patriots out of the end zone, but Gostkowski kicked a 23-yard field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter, increasing the lead to 37\u201317. Gostkowski kicked two more field goals and the Patriots, who were left for dead less than a week ago, won a resounding defeat over the best team in football.\n\nBefore the game, the Patriots paid tribute to Bengals defensive tackle [[Devon Still]], whose daughter is battling cancer, with a short film during a television timeout saluting his daughter while the Patriots cheerleaders donned Devon Still #75 jerseys; the gesture and donation by the Kraft family to the Cincinnati hospital at which she is being treated, brought a standing ovation and moved Still to tears. With the win, the Patriots advanced to 3\u20132, making many rethink the \"death\" of the Patriots. The 505 total yards of offense was the Patriots highest output of the season. The Patriots forced the Bengals into three turnovers (all fumbles) while the Patriots didn't turn it over at all. Tom Brady returned to form going 23/35 for 285 yards and 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen combined for 203 rushing yards on 36 carries as the Patriots ran for 220 on the night.\n\n====Week 6: at Buffalo Bills====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Six: New England Patriots at Buffalo Bills \u2013 Game summary\n |date=October 12\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=0|R2=13|R3=10|R4=14\n |home=Bills\n |H1=0|H2=7|H3=7|H4=8\n |stadium=[[Ralph Wilson Stadium]], [[Orchard Park, New York]]\n |attendance=70,185\n |weather={{convert|55|F|C}}, clear & sunny\n |referee=[[Walt Coleman]]\n |TV=[[NFL on Fox|Fox]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Kenny Albert]] (play-by-play), [[Daryl Johnston]] (color commentator) and [[Tony Siragusa]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014101201/2014/REG6/patriots@bills Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56248/BUF_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* No scoring plays\n'''Second quarter'''\n* [[Tim Wright (American football)|Tim Wright]] 1-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 13:04.

On the third play of the Bills resulting possession, though, [[Kyle Orton]] was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Patriots 39-yard line. The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7\u20137 on a [[Kyle Orton]] touchdown pass to [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]]. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped [[C. J. Spiller]] with [[Zach Moore]] recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13\u20137 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20\u20137. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]] scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23\u201314. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on [[Jordan Devey]]. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to [[Chris Hogan]], with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30\u201322. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37\u201322. The Bills reached their own 42 on their final drive, but a sack by [[Rob Ninkovich]] and an incomplete pass intended for [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]] on 4th-and-9 officially sealed the deal.\n\nBrady completed 27 of 37 passes for 361 yards, with 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. Kyle Orton was equally very impressive, finishing the game  24 of 38 for 299 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. With 4 catches for 97 yards and 2 touchdowns, LaFell continued to be the Patriots awaited deep-threat at wide receiver. Both teams struggled to run the football. Stevan Ridley ran for only 23 yards on 10 carries, while Fred Jackson ran for only 26 yards on 10 carries. It was later learned the Patriots lost Stevan Ridley and linebacker [[Jerod Mayo]] to season ending injuries.\n\n====Week 7: vs. New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Seven: New York Jets at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date={{tooltip|October 16|Thursday}}\n |time=8:30 p.m. EDT\n |road=Jets\n |R1=6|R2=6|R3=7|R4=6\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=10|H3=3|H4=7\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|64|F|C}}, cloudy\n |referee=[[Bill Leavy]]\n |TV=CBS/[[NFLN]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Jim Nantz]] (play-by-play), [[Phil Simms]] (color commentator) and [[Tracy Wolfson]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014101600/2014/REG7/jets@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56261/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Shane Vereen]] 49-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 13:31.

For the fourth straight home game the Patriots played the Jets in a contest where the final margin of victory was less than ten points, and third straight where the margin didn't exceed three points. [[Tom Brady]] made his 200th career regular season start.\n\nOn the fourth play of the game, Shane Vereen went completely unnoticed by the Jets' secondary, on a wheel route,  and Brady hit him for a 49-yard touchdown, just 1:29 into the game. Following this, the Jets drove all the ways to the Patriots 9. On 1st-and-goal, [[Geno Smith]] hit [[Jeremy Kerley]] for a touchdown, but the play was nullified when offensive guard [[Oday Aboushi]] was flagged for holding. The Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone over the next three plays and the Jets settled for a 22-yard field goal from [[Nick Folk]]. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets seemed primed for a touchdown, but another critical holding call moved the Jets out of the red zone, and Folk kicked a 47-yard field goal, making the score 7\u20136. The Patriots went three-and-out yet again, but once more the Jets could only get a Folk field goal, this one from 46 yards, but the Jets took their first lead, 9\u20137. This time the Patriots responded this time, racing 80 yards in 10 plays to take the lead on Brady's 3-yard touchdown pass to Vereen, this one for 3 yards, to take the lead. The Jets reached the Patriots 9 for the second time, but the Patriots defense once again turned into a brick wall in the red zone, and Folk had to kick his fourth field goal of the half to bring the score to 14\u201312. A crucial pass-interference penalty on [[Asher Allen]] on the Patriots' next drive, helped them reach Jets' territory and Gostkowski kicked a 39-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17\u201312 lead at halftime.  On the Jets first drive of the third quarter they continued their clock-draining strategy with an 11-play, 6:02 drive, this time reaching the end zone again with [[Chris Ivory]] scoring on a 1-yard touchdown plunge, giving the Jets their second lead of the game, 19\u201317. Once again though, the Patriots countered, moving 53 yards to the Jets 18, and Gostkowski banged in a 36-yard field goal, taking a 20\u201319 lead. The next five combined possessions ended in punts. With 10:51 remaining in the game, Tom Brady engineered a Brady-esque drive reaching the Jets 4. A 6-yard false start penalty on Wright and a 10-yard offensive pass interference penalty on LaFell sent them back to the Jets 19. Following an in-completion to Vereen, on 3rd-and-Goal, Brady rolled out to the left and found [[Danny Amendola]] for the touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 27\u201319. This was Amendola's only catch of the game. The Jets didn't give up though. [[Geno Smith]] engineered a 12-play, 86-yard drive, finding tight end [[Jeff Cumberland]] for a 10-yard TD pass to cut the Patriots' lead to two points with 2:31 remaining. However, the 2-point conversion failed and the Jets still trailed, 27\u201325. Amendola recovered the onside kick, but the Jets defense stepped up, preventing the Patriots from running out the clock, giving the Jets one last chance at an upset with 1:06 remaining. Starting at their own 31, Geno Smith hit [[David Nelson (wide receiver)|David Nelson]] for 11 yards to the Jets 42. Next, completing a pass to [[Jeremy Kerley]] for 13 to the Patriots 45. Chris Ivory ran for five yards before heading out of bounds at the Patriots 40. After an incomplete pass, Folk came on to attempt the game-winning 58-yard field with 0:05 seconds left, but the kick was blocked by defensive lineman [[Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1990)|Chris Jones]], who had been called for a personal foul on a field goal attempt against the Jets the previous season which led to Folk's game winning 42-yard field goal, and the Patriots escaped with their third win in a row.\n\nThough not spectacular, Brady was efficient, completing  20 of 37 passes for 261 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. Geno Smith completed 20 of 34 passes for 226 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions. Vereen was the top rusher & receiver for the Patriots with 43 yards rushing and 71 receiving. It was learned shortly after the game that stalwart defensive end [[Chandler Jones]] injured his hip and would miss seven games. The Jets ran for 218 yards on the night, led by Chris Ivory, who continued to be a pest to the Patriots, gaining 107 yards on 21 carries. Chris Johnson added 61 yards on 13 carries. The Jets outgained the Patriots 423-323 and absolutely controlled the clock winning T.O.P. 40:54-19:06, but the Patriots defense tightened down when it mattered.\n\n====Week 8: vs. Chicago Bears====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Eight: Chicago Bears at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=October 26\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT\n |road=Bears\n |R1=0|R2=7|R3=8|R4=8\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=31|H3=7|H4=6\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|54|F|C}}, cloudy\n |referee=[[Brad Allen]]\n |TV=Fox\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Sam Rosen (sportscaster)|Sam Rosen]] (play-by-play), [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] (color commentator) and [[Pam Oliver]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014102605/2014/REG8/bears@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56282/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Rob Gronkowski]] 6-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 9:41.

After a Bears punt, the Patriots took over 7 minutes off the clock in driving to the Bears 5-yard line, but could only settle for a 23-yard Gostkowski field goal, and a 10\u20130 lead. The Bears fortunes didn't get any better and they punted again on their next drive. The Patriots struck again with a five-and-a-half minute, 76-yard drive culminating with a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, pushing the lead to 17\u20130. On the Bears next drive, McCourty intercepted [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] at the Bears 22, but the play was nullified by an illegal contact penalty on [[Brandon Browner]]. With new life, the Bears marched another 54 yards and Cutler found [[Matt Forte]] on a 25-yard touchdown pass, making the score 17\u20137. Then Patriots took control of the game from there. In a 57-second span, the Patriots scored 3 touchdowns. First, the Patriots marched 80 yards in 10 plays, with Brady throwing a 2-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski. Following a Bears three-and-out, Edelman's 49 yard return plus a 10-yard holding penalty on the Bears' [[Trevor Scott]] set the Patriots up at the Bears 9. On the first play, Brady hit LaFell for a 9-yard touchdown. On the first play of the ensuing Chicago possession, Cutler was strip-sacked by rookie defensive end [[Zach Moore]] with [[Rob Ninkovich]] recovering and returning it 15 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 38\u20137 lead blowout lead. Revis intercepted Cutler on the last play of the first half, and the Patriots lead stood 38\u20137. On the first drive of the 2nd half, Brady hit Gronkowski for 46-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. This was Tom Brady's fifth touchdown pass of the day (his third career five touchdown game), and the third for Gronkowski (his second career three touchdown game), extending the lead to a 45-7 massacre. Later in the third quarter, the Bears marched 80 yards with Cutler hitting [[Martellus Bennett]] on a 20-yard touchdown pass, with a successful 2 pt. conversion, making the score 45\u201315. The Patriots countered by marching 71 yards in just under six minutes, extending the lead to 48\u201315 on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal. With the game well out of reach, backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo took over for Tom Brady. The Bears would score again when Culter marched the bears 80 yards and hit [[Alshon Jeffery]] for a 10-yard touchdown pass, with another successful 2 point conversion, making the score, still insurmountable, 48\u201323. With a short field after an unsuccessful onside kick attempt, the Patriots moved 21 yards before Gostowski made the score 51\u201323. The Bears [[Jimmy Clausen]] drove them to the Patriots 26, but turned the ball over on downs. Garoppolo took a knee to end the game.\n\nThe Patriots' 51 points were their largest single-game total of the season. Tom Brady made history in the game. This was his 17th career game with four touchdown and zero interceptions which tied him with [[Drew Brees]] for the most all time. In addition, this was his 43rd career game with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions which placed him second by [[Peyton Manning]]. On top of that, he threw for 354 yards. The Patriots totaled 122 yards rushing as well. Gronkowski and LaFell combined for 20 catches for 273 yards and four touchdowns, with both catching every ball thrown to them. Jay Cutler actually played well, completing 20 of 30 passes for 220 yards and three touchdowns, but threw an interception and lost a fumble. Matt Forte was fantastic, rushing for 114 yards on just 19 carries with a receiving touchdown. However, the Bears defense couldn't stop New England for anything and it would continue next week when they lost to the Packers 55\u201314.\n\n====Week 9: vs. Denver Broncos====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Nine: Denver Broncos at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=November 2\n |time=4:25&nbsp;p.m. EST\n |road=Broncos\n |R1=7|R2=0|R3=14|R4=0\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=3|H2=24|H3=10|H4=6\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|35|F|C}}, cloudy\n |referee=Walt Anderson\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Jim Nantz (play-by-play), Phil Simms (color commentator) and Tracy Wolfson (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014110208/2014/REG9/broncos@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56300/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*[[Stephen Gostkowski]] 49-yard field goal, 7:09.

Unlike last season, the Broncos had a highly rated defense, with former Patriots [[Aqib Talib]] anchoring the secondary. This was also the [[Tom Brady-Peyton Manning rivalry|16th Brady-Manning match-up]]\n\nAfter the first three drives of the game ended in punts, Amendola waved for a fair catch at the Patriots 46-yard line, but [[Kayvon Webster]] was flagged 15 yards for interfering with Amendola, giving the Patriots the ball at the Denver 39. Despite the great field position, the Patriots failed to get a first down but Gostkowski got the Patriots on the board with a 49-yard field goal. Denver countered, storming 80 yards in just 9 plays, aided by a pass-interference penalty on [[Brandon Browner]], on 3rd-and-10 before [[Ronnie Hillman]] punched in a 1-yard touchdown run for a 7-3 Broncos lead. The Patriots then drove 67 yards in 12 plays to reach the Broncos 11, but Denver's defense held the Patriots to a 29-yard field goal by Gostkowski. On the second play of Denver's ensuing drive, Ninkovich intercepted a pass and returned it 11 yards to the Broncos 34-yard line. With the wonderful field position, the Patriots marched 34 yards, with Brady throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to Edelman. After forcing Denver to punt, [[Dustin Colquitt]] fumbled the snap, but managed to punt the ball away, Edelman fielded the ball on a bounce and returned the punt 84 yards for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 20\u20137. The Broncos marched 52 yards to the Patriots 23, but Broncos kicker [[Brandon McManus]] missed a 41-yard field goal. The Broncos forced a punt and drove to the Patriots 34-yard line. On 4th-and-6, instead of kicking a 51-yard field goal, the Broncos went for it but Manning was sacked by [[Akeem Ayers]]. With pretty good field position, the Patriots marched 57 yards in 9 plays with Vereen scoring on a 5-yard touchdown reception with 0:08 remaining in the half. Manning took a knee and the Patriots led 27\u20137 at halftime, the Broncos largest deficit of the season. On the first drive of the second half, Brady was intercepted by [[Bradley Roby]] at the Broncos 43 (his first turnover since Week 4).  Manning drove the Broncos 57 yards, hitting [[Demaryius Thomas]] for 27 yards on 3rd-and-6 and then tight end [[Julius Thomas]] for an 18-yard touchdown pass, closing the gap to 27\u201314. The Patriots responded again, driving to the Broncos 27 and Gostkowski increased the lead to 30\u201314 on a 45-yard field goal. On the Broncos next possession, Browner intercepted Manning at the Broncos 40 and returned it 30 yards to the Broncos 10. On the very next play, Brady hit LaFell for a 10-yard touchdown pass, making the game a shocking blowout with a 37\u201314 score. Aided by three Patriots penalties, the Broncos stormed 72 yards in just four plays with Hillman catching a 15-yard touchdown pass, trimming the deficit to 37\u201321. Once again The Patriots struck right back, with Tom Brady driving the Patriots 80 yards, using 14 plays, and taking 6:53 off the clock before connecting with Rob Gronkowski on a 1-yard touchdown pass, with a missed two point conversion, increasing the lead to 43\u201321. The Broncos turned the ball over on downs on three straight drives as the Patriots cruised to the sixth straight win.\n\nTom Brady completed 33 of 53 passes for 333 yards, with 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. Rob Gronkowski had 9 catches for 105 yards and 1 TD, and Julian Edelman added 9 catches for 89 yards and a TD. Peyton Manning was 34 of 57 for 438 yards and 2 touchdowns, but added 2 interceptions. Both running games struggled, limited to 109 combined yards on the ground. With the win, the Patriots took the lead in the race for the AFC's #1 seed, which they would not relinquish, and made them the team to beat in the AFC. It was Tom Brady's eleventh win in sixteen career meetings against Manning<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/11/2/7143433/tom-brady-peyton-manning-rivalry-patriots-vs-broncos-week-9|title=Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning is 2 decades of NFL dominance|publisher=Vox Media|work=SBNation.com|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref> and was the Patriots' largest margin of victory over Manning since [[2001 New England Patriots season|2001]].\n\n====Week 11: at Indianapolis Colts====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Eleven: New England Patriots at Indianapolis Colts \u2013 Game summary\n |date=November 16\n |time=8:30 p.m. EST\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=7|R2=7|R3=14|R4=14\n |home=Colts\n |H1=3|H2=7|H3=3|H4=7\n |stadium=[[Lucas Oil Stadium]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]\n |attendance=66,751\n |weather=Played indoors ([[retractable roof]] closed)\n |referee=Pete Morelli\n |TV=NBC\n |TVAnnouncers=Al Michaels (play-by-play), Cris Collinsworth (color commentator) and Michele Tafoya (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014111611/2014/REG11/patriots@colts Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56329/IND_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Jonas Gray]] 4-yard run ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 4:38.

The Patriots came in looking for their sixth straight win.\n\nAfter forcing the Colts to a quick three-and-out, the Patriots scored on their opening drive of the game, covering 89 yards, in 11 plays scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run by rookie [[Jonas Gray]]. The Colts responded, aided by a 46-yard completion from Luck to [[T. Y. Hilton]], driving to the Patriots 13, but had to settle for an [[Adam Vinatieri]] 31-yard field goal to bring the score to 7\u20133. The Patriots then drove to their own 49, but safety [[Mike Adams (safety)|Mike Adams]] intercepted a pass intended for Tyms at the Colts 6 for no gain. On their next possession, the Colts reached the Patriots 32, but McCourty intercepted Luck and returned it 10 yards back to the Patriots 32. From there the Patriots struck on an 11-play, 68-yard drive, scoring on Gray's 2-yard touchdown run, extending the lead to 14\u20133. The Patriots forced a three-and-out, but on the third play of the Patriots next drive, Brady was intercepted by Adams again, who returned it 10 yards to the Patriots 23. With the fabulous field position, it took the Colts just three plays for Luck to find [[Hakeem Nicks]] on a 10-yard touchdown pass, making the score 14\u201310 with less than a minute remaining in the first half. After taking the kickoff, the Patriots restarted with an 8 play, 80-yard drive scoring on a  2-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, extending the lead to 21\u201310. The Colts drove to the Patriots 40 on their next drive, and Vinatieri was good from 53 yards away to trim the deficit to 21\u201313. The Patriots struck with another touchdown, with Brady passing for 56 yards on a 10-play, 80-yard drive before Gray scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and increasing the Patriots lead to 28\u201313. The Colts pulled back into the game on their next drive, with Luck completing 5 passes on the next drive for 77 yards, capping it off with his 1-yard touchdown pass to [[Anthony Castonzo]], pulling the game back to 28\u201320. Despite the effort from Luck and the offense, the Colt defense had no answer for the Patriots, with them driving 80 more yards in 10 more plays, scoring on Gray's 1-yard touchdown run, his fourth, increasing the lead to 35\u201320 with just 8:43 remaining. The Colts actually stuffed Gray for a two-yard loss at the Colts 31 which would've made it 4th-and-4, but a 15-yard face mask penalty on [[Jerrell Freeman]] moved the ball to the 14 and Gray scored 4 plays later. Four straight incompletions gave the Patriots the ball at the Colts 32. After two three-yard runs by Gray, Tom Brady threw a short pass to Gronkowski who broke it off for a 26-yard touchdown, effectively ending the game and clinching the Patriots' sixth straight win. The game also saw several skirmishes between Gronkowski and [[Sergio Brown]], with Gronkowski throwing Brown into an NBC camera after the play on Gray's 4th touchdown. Gronkowski referred to this incident as throwing Sergio Brown \"out of the club\" for talking trash all game, including posting Gronk's stats on Twitter during the game.\n\nJonas Gray broke out, running all over the Colts for 201 yards and 4 touchdowns on 37 carries. Tom Brady threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns, but threw two interceptions. The Patriots scored on every drive of the second half with exception of their final drive of the game which was used to run out the clock. Luck threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns, but the running game was a non-factor, totaling just 19 yards on 16 carries, with [[Trent Richardson]] running 6 times for 0 yards. Tom Brady improved to 3\u20130 against Andrew Luck.\n\n====Week 12: vs. Detroit Lions====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Twelve: Detroit Lions at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=November 23\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road=Lions\n |R1=3|R2=3|R3=0|R4=3\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=17|H3=3|H4=7\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|58|F|C}}, mostly sunny\n |referee=Tony Corrente\n |TV=Fox\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Joe Buck]] (play-by-play), [[Troy Aikman]] (color commentator) and [[Erin Andrews]] (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014112306/2014/REG12/lions@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56338/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Matt Prater]] 48-yard field goal, 11:44.

The Patriots re-signed last season's star [[LeGarrette Blount]] who had been released by the Steelers earlier that week after leaving a game early.\n\nOn the opening possession of the game [[Matthew Stafford]] hit [[Golden Tate]] for gains of 24 and 17 yards en route to the Patriots 34, but could only settle for a [[Matt Prater]] 48-yard field goal. Later, midway through the first quarter, the Patriots raced 64 yards in 9 plays scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright. The Lions replied on their very next possession, driving 78 yards to the Patriots 2-yard line, but the Patriots and their elite red zone defense did their thing and Prater added a 20-yard field goal. It was all Patriots for the rest of the half. Danny Amendola returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards to the Detroit 22. A 16-yard pass to LaFell and a 3-yard encroachment penalty to Ndamukong Suh moved the ball to the 3-yard line. On the very next play Blount added a 3-yard rushing touchdown, increasing the lead to 14\u20136. The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays, culminating with Brady find Wright again, for an 8-yard touchdown pass, increasing their lead to 21\u20136. The Lions drove to the Patriots 35 on the ensuing possession, but Prater missed a 53-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 43, the Patriots needed just four plays to reach the Lions 17 and Gostkowski closed out the half with a 35-yard field goal as they went into the locker room up 24\u20136. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the half 70 yards down to the Lions 10-yard line trying to bury Detroit, but on 1st down Tom Brady was intercepted by [[James Ihedigbo]]. Like almost every possession on the day, the Lions did nothing and punted after five plays. The Patriots proceeded to march 50 yards to the Lions 25 and Gostkowski added a 43-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 27\u20136. After both teams swapped three-and-outs the Lions advanced to the Patriots 31, but once again settled for a Matt Prater field goal, making the score 27-9 early in the fourth quarter. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.\n\nThe Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper [[Danny Aiken]], who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center [[Dominic Raiola]]. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman [[Zach Moore]] by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9\u20132, not only running their winning streak to 7 games, but also making it the 14th straight winning season for the Patriots.\n\n====Week 13: at Green Bay Packers====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Thirteen: New England Patriots at Green Bay Packers \u2013 Game summary\n |date=November 30\n |time=4:25 p.m. EST/3:25 p.m. CST\n |road=Patriots\n |R1=0|R2=14|R3=0|R4=7\n |home='''Packers'''\n |H1=13|H2=10|H3=0|H4=3\n |stadium=[[Lambeau Field]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]\n |attendance=78,431\n |weather={{convert|28|F|C}}, mostly cloudy\n |referee=[[Ed Hochuli]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Jim Nantz (play-by-play), Phil Simms (color commentator) and Tracy Wolfson (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014113010/2014/REG13/patriots@packers Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56359/GB_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Mason Crosby]] 32-yard field goal, 11:14.

This was the first matchup between Rodgers and Brady, as Rodgers missed the 2010 contest at Gillette Stadium with a concussion.\n\nOn the opening drive of the game, the Packers drove all the way to the Patriots 14, but the Patriots red zone defense continued to stay hot and forced them to settle for a 32-yard field goal by [[Mason Crosby]]. After a Patriots punt, the Packers, aided by a 33-yard completion from Rodgers to [[Davante Adams]], reached the Patriots 17, but once again the Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone and Mason Crosby kicked a 35-yard field goal, increasing the Packers lead to 6\u20130. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Packers stormed 85 yards in only 4 plays with Rodgers finding [[Richard Rodgers (American football)|Richard Rodgers]] deep for a 45-yard touchdown pass, increasing the lead to 13\u20130. After a terrible first quarter, the Patriots got things going on their next drive. On the first play of the second quarter, Tom Brady darted a pass to Gronkowski for a 29-yard gain to the Packers 41. Three plays later [[Brandon Bolden]] scampered for a 6-yard touchdown, trimming the deficit to 13\u20137. The Patriots defense responded by getting the Packers to a 3rd-and-5, but no pass rush allowed Rodgers 14 seconds to find [[Randall Cobb (American football)|Randall Cobb]] for a 33-yard gain to the Patriots 34. The Packers reached the Patriots 6, but Hightower sacked Rodgers for a 9-yard loss on 3rd-and-goal, and Crosby kicked a 33-yard field goal with just under six minutes remaining in the first half. Down 16\u20137, Brady drove the Patriots back down the field again on an 80-yard drive, finding LaFell in the back of the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown pass, trimming the score to 16\u201314. However, 1:05 would prove to be too much time for Aaron Rodgers. After an incompletion to Adams, Rodgers threw a screen pass to [[James Starks]] who took it 28 yards to the Packers 47. An 8-yard completion to [[Jordy Nelson]] moved the ball to the Patriots 45. Two plays later, Rodgers hit Nelson in stride, who outran Revis and McCourty, for a 45-yard touchdown with 00:14 remaining in the first half, increasing the lead to 23\u201314. That was only the 2nd touchdown Revis allowed all season. The third quarter was a stalemate, as both defenses began to take over and neither team scored. The Patriots took over with 2:21 remaining in the third and constructed a 9 play, 78-yard drive with Brady throwing a laser to LaFell for a 15-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, pulling the Patriots within two, 23\u201321. The Packers countered, reaching the Patriots 10, but Adams dropped a sure touchdown on a wide-open slant on 3rd-and-5, but Crosby kicked a 28-yard field goal, making the score 26\u201321 with 8:41 remaining. On their next drive, Brady converted a 4th-and-3 to Edelman at their own 49, and two plays later converted a 3rd-and-7 with a 10-yard pass to Gronkowski. Three plays later, Brady dropped a pass into the arms of Rob Gronkowski who caught the ball momentarily, but [[Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix]] punched it out before it could be ruled a catch, wiping out a touchdown. On the very next play, [[Mike Daniels (American football)|Mike Daniels]] and [[Mike Neal]] combined to sack Brady for a 9-yard loss. Instead of calling a timeout Gostkowski was sent out on the field for a 47-yard field goal attempt with the clock running to preserve a timeout at the two-minute warning, but Gostkowski missed the hurried field goal attempt, keeping the score 26\u201321 with just 2:40 remaining. The Patriots forced a 3rd-and-4, but Rodgers converted it with a 7-yard pass to Cobb, enabling the Packers to run out the clock and win the game.\n\nThe Patriots fell to 9\u20133 with the loss, snapping their 7-game winning streak. The Patriots looked nothing like the team that had won 7 straight games, struggling in all facets of the game. Tom Brady was 22 of 35 for 245 yards 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Patriots managed 84 yards rushing, but only carried the ball 19 times.  Rob Gronkowski was the receiving star for the Patriots with 7 catches for 98 yards.  Aaron Rodgers, continuing his home dominance, turned in another great performance, completing 24 of 38 passes for 368 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, benefiting from the Patriots almost non-existent pass rush. They managed three sacks, but couldn't get any consistent pressure. Meanwhile, Eddie Lacy had 98 yards on 21 carries.

The Chargers answered the Patriots on their next drive, marching 80 yards in 11 plays with [[Philip Rivers]] hitting [[Malcolm Floyd]] for a 15-yard touchdown to put the Chargers up 7\u20133. On the fourth play of the Patriots next drive, Brady threw a two-yard pass to LaFell, who was stripped by [[Jahleel Addae]] with [[Darrell Stuckey]] picking up the fumble and rumbling 53 yards for a touchdown and a 14\u20133 Chargers lead. The Patriots drove all the way to the Charges 4-yard line, but the Chargers defense made a stand and the Patriots settled for a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal, and the score was 14\u20136. After forcing a Chargers three-and-out, Bolden blocked [[Mike Scifres]]' punt, knocking him out of the game, at the Chargers 25. Four plays later, Brady threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, cutting the deficit to 14\u201313. After another Chargers punt, the Patriots drove to the Chargers 18, but Brady was intercepted by [[Manti Te'o]] at the 4, concluding a sloppy, unimpressive, first half for both offenses. Both offenses came out just as bad in the second half, resulting in a combined five consecutive 3-and-outs. Midway through the third quarter, [[Devin McCourty]] intercepted Rivers at the Patriots 44 and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, but a helmet-to-helmet hit by Browner on [[Ladarius Green]] nullified the score. Replays showed Browner hit his shoulder, not his head, but the ruling was upheld. The break seemed to spur the Chargers to a score, as they reached Patriots territory but Rivers was intercepted by [[Akeem Ayers]] at the Patriots 30-yard line. The Patriots offense continued their cold streak by going three-and-out on their fourth straight drive, but their defense continued to shut down San Diego. A 16-yard punt return by Edelman set the Patriots up at their own 25. They marched 55 yards to the Chargers 20, and took the lead on a 38-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriot a 16\u201314 lead midway through the fourth quarter. After the Chargers went three-and-out for the fourth time in five drives(the lone exception ending in an interception), Brady hit Edelman on the first play of their next drive for a 69-yard catch-and-run touchdown. The extra point made the score 23\u201314, sealing another Patriots win.\n\nDespite the win, the Chargers showed that the Patriots offense was still prone to mistakes. Edelman was the star, with 8 catches for 141 yards and a touchdown. The Patriots defense had a great showing, holding the Chargers to just 216 total yards, sacking Philip Rivers four times, with an interception. This loss would send the Chargers to ultimately lose three of their last four and their season.\n\n====Week 15: vs. Miami Dolphins====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Fifteen: Miami Dolphins at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=December 14\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road=Dolphins\n |R1=3|R2=10|R3=0|R4=0\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=7|H3=24|H4=3\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|43|F|C}}, sunny\n |referee=[[Bill Vinovich]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Ian Eagle (play-by-play), Dan Fouts (color commentator) and Jenny Dell (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014121408/2014/REG15/dolphins@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56387/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Kyle Arrington]] 62-yard blocked field goal return ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 12:36.

After a Dolphins punt, the Pats drove 42 yards to the Dolphins 38, but Brady was intercepted by [[Jason Trusnik]] at the 34. The Dolphins drove 60 yards to the Patriots 6, but the red zone defense forced them to kick a 24-yard field goal. After a Patriots punt, the Dolphins drove to their own 45, but Ryan Tannehill was intercepted by [[Duron Harmon]] at the Patriots 34 and returned the ball 60 yards to the Dolphins 8. Three plays later, Shane Vereen ran in a 3-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 14\u20133. [[Jarvis Landry]] returned the ensuing kick 26 yards to the Dolphins 37. They drove 38 yards to the Patriots 35, but Sturgis kicked a 53-yard field goal. After the next three drives ended in punts, with the first half winding down, Tannehill connected with Wallace on a 32-yard touchdown bomb with 0:05 left to trim the score to 14\u201313 on a play that was initially ruled a drop. After a decent offensive showing in the first half, the Patriots went on a barrage of scoring in the third quarter. After returning the kickoff 19 yards to the 21, the Patriots stormed 79 yards in just 8 plays, increasing their lead to 21\u201313 on LeGarrette Blount's 3-yard touchdown run. After a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots drove 47 yards to the Dolphins 17 where Gostkowski drilled a 35-yard for goal, increasing the lead to 24\u201313. Patrick Chung intercepted a pass on the first play of the next drive and returned it 10 yards to the Dolphins 27. The Patriots cashed it in for a touchdown on the first play with Brady air mailing a 27-yard touchdown strike to [[Rob Gronkowski]], upping the lead to 31\u201313. After another Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots need just three plays to put the game on ice. First [[Jonas Gray]] ran for 6 yards to the Dolphins 41, followed by Brady hooking up with Gronkowski for 35 yards to the Patriots 6. Brady then found Edelman for the 6-yard touchdown pass on the next play, making the score 38\u201313. The Dolphins drove 65 yards in 14 plays to the Patriots 25, but on 4th-and-18, [[Daniel Thomas (American football)|Daniel Thomas]] could only gain 10 yards and the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots scored the final points on a 36-yarder, making the score 41\u201313. The Dolphins turned the ball over on downs and the Patriots took a knee to end the game.\n\nThe Patriots offensive line was immensely better than the opening day game against Miami as Brady wasn't sacked at all. Brady tossed 2 TDs to Edelman and Gronkowski while Vereen and Blount picked up rushing TDs. Gronkowski was their leading receiver with 96 yards and 1 touchdown on just 3 catches, and in the process secured his second 1,000 yard season. Miami picked up 384 yards of offense, but mostly couldn't get out of their own way with two turnovers and some awful drops, including a dropped touchdown by Mike Wallace. With the blowout win, the Patriots improved to 11\u20133, clinching their 17th AFC East title in franchise history, the 12th in the Brady\u2013Belichick era, and their 6th straight.\n\n====Week 16: at New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Sixteen: New England Patriots at New York Jets \u2013 Game summary\n |date=December 21\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=0|R2=7|R3=3|R4=7\n |home=Jets\n |H1=0|H2=10|H3=3|H4=3\n |stadium=[[MetLife Stadium]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n |attendance=78,160\n |weather={{convert|34|F|C}}, cloudy\n |referee=Brad Allen\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Spero Dedes]] (play-by-play) and [[Solomon Wilcots]] (color commentator)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014122105/2014/REG16/patriots@jets Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56402/NYJ_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*No scoring plays\n'''Second quarter'''\n* [[Rob Gronkowski]] 3-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 12:10.

Four the fourth time in their last five games against the Jets, the Patriots won by three points or less (the exception being the [[butt fumble]] game of 2012).\n\nThe first seven drives of the game ended in punts. On the second play of the quarter, Amendola returned [[Ryan Quigley]]'s punt 39 yards to the Jets 36. Eight plays later, Brady hit Gronkowski on a 3-yard touchdown pass for a 7\u20130 lead. The Jets countered on their next drive marching 87 yards in just over 6 minutes, scoring on [[Geno Smith]]'s 20-yard touchdown pass to [[Jeff Cumberland]] to tie the game. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets drove 54 yards to the Patriots 8, but, like the first match-up, had to settle for a 26-yard field goal by Nick Folk and a 10\u20137 lead at halftime. The Patriots offensive line was dominated by [[Sheldon Richardson]] and the Jets defensive line, as they sacked Brady four times in the first half. The Patriots received the second-half kickoff, but were forced to punt. The Jets capitalized by marching 66 yards in just over 6 minutes to the Patriots 5-yard line, but only could muster a 23-yard field goal from Folk, extending the lead to 13\u20137. The Patriots drove 81 yards to the Jets 6, but Brady threw an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-2 and Gostkowski kicked a 24-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 13\u201310.  On the second play of the Jets next drive, Smith was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Jets 40-yard line, he lateraled to Browner who reached the Jets 38. Eight plays later Jonas Gray scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Patriots a 17\u201313 lead on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Jets drove 59 yards to the Patriots 10, but on 2nd-and-8, Smith was sacked by [[Sealver Siliga]] for a 9-yard loss and an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-17 forced them to settle for a 37-yard field goal by Folk, trimming the deficit to 17\u201316 with 7:53 remaining. On the second play of the Patriots' next drive, Brady was intercepted by [[Marcus Williams (cornerback)|Marcus Williams]] at the Patriots 30-yard line. After two runs for 6 yards, Smith was sacked for a 10-yard loss on 3rd down by [[Dont'a Hightower]], setting up Folk's 52-yard go-ahead field goal attempt, but Vince Wilfork blocked Folk's attempt, keeping the Patriots ahead 17\u201316. On the Patriots' next drive, two third-down conversions allowed the Patriots to run out the clock. With the win, the Patriots improved to 12\u20133, and they clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs after the Broncos' loss to the Bengals on Monday night. This would wind up being Rex Ryan's last game against the Patriots as head coach of the New York Jets.\n\nThe Patriots were far from outstanding on offense. Brady finished 23/35 but for just 146 yards and 1 touchdown with 1 interception. The Patriots combined for just 85 rushing yards on 24 carries, but the defense came through again. The Jets once again out-gained the Patriots in total yards, but yet again, couldn't score touchdowns, and fell to big plays by the Patriots.\n\n====Week 17: vs. Buffalo Bills====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Seventeen: Buffalo Bills at New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date=December 28\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road='''Bills'''\n |R1=7|R2=10|R3=0|R4=0\n |home=Patriots\n |H1=3|H2=3|H3=3|H4=0\n |stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|49|F|C}}, mostly cloudy |referee=[[Terry McAulay]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=Spero Dedes (play-by-play) and Solomon Wilcots (color commentator)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014122807/2014/REG17/bills@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56417/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] 6-yard pass from [[Kyle Orton]] ([[Dan Carpenter]] kick), 11:59.

After both teams punted, the Patriots engineered a 13 play, 80-yard drive marching all the way to the Bills 6, but the Bills defense held them to a 24-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski. The Bills countered with an 80-yard drive, covering 13 plays in seven-and-a-half minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run from [[Anthony Dixon]] a few minutes into the second quarter, extending the lead to 14\u20133. Following a Patriots three-and-out, Jamie Collins strip-sacked Orton and recovered it at the Bills 44. The Patriots drove to the Bills 26, and Gostkowski kicked a 44-yard field goal and the score read 14\u20136. The Bills answered again though. [[Marcus Thigpen]] returned the ensuing kickoff 49 yards to the Patriots 47. The Bills only reached the Patriots 30, but [[Dan Carpenter]] was good on a 48-yard field goal, increasing the Bills lead to 17\u20136 at halftime. Jimmy Garoppolo took over for Brady in the second half. After the first two drives of the second half ended in punts, the Patriots marched 70 yards, using 11 plays in over 6 minutes to the Bills 13, but the Bills stuffed Garoppolo for a 1-yard loss on 4th-and-1. The Patriots forced the Bills to punt on their next drive, and Amendola returned the Bills punt 26 yards to the Bills 44. After a 20-yard pass to LaFell the Patriots were unable to get another first down, but Gostkowski hit a 35-yard field goal, trimming the score to 17\u20139. The Bills drove to the Patriots 43 on their next possession, but punted. The Patriots reached the Bills 30, but Brandon Bolden was stuffed for a 1-yard loss and Garoppolo was sacked for a 15-yard loss by [[Manny Lawson]] and [[Jerry Hughes]], bringing up a 3rd-and-26. Garoppolo completed an 18-yard pass to Tyms, making it a manageable 4th-and-8, but the catch was nullified by a holding call on [[Marcus Cannon]], making it 3rd-and-36. Garoppolo completed a 15-yard pass to Wright, but the Patriots decided to punt rather than try and convert a 4th-and-21. The Bills drove to the Patriots 41, but the Patriots forced another punt. Back-to-back completions to [[James White (running back)|James White]] brought up a 3rd-and-2, but back-to-back incompletions resulted in a turnover on downs and two knees gave the Bills the win.\n\nBrady started the game for the first half and finished 8 of 16 for 80 yards. Backup quarterback [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] would finish the game 10 of 17 for 90 yards, as the Patriots would lose the game 17\u20139. With the loss, the Patriots finished the regular season at 12\u20134, and is their first loss at home to the Bills since [[2000 New England Patriots season|2000]], Brady's rookie season. It was also their first loss at home since December 16, 2012, when they lost to that year's eventual NFC Champions, the [[2012 San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco 49ers]]. They finished 4\u20131 against teams that would make the playoffs, their only loss, a five-point loss against the Packers in Green Bay. The Patriots defense once again played well, holding the Bills to just 268 total yards and forced a turnover.\n\n===Postseason===\n{{see also|2014\u201315 NFL playoffs}}\n\n====AFC Divisional Playoffs: vs. #6 Baltimore Ravens====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=AFC Divisional Playoffs: #6 Baltimore Ravens at #1 New England Patriots \u2013 Game summary\n |date={{tooltip|January 10, 2015|Saturday}}\n |time=4:35 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n |road=Ravens\n |R1=14|R2=7|R3=7|R4=3\n |home='''Patriots'''\n |H1=7|H2=7|H3=14|H4=7\n |stadium=[[Gillette Stadium]], [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]\n |attendance=68,756\n |weather={{convert|20|F|C}}, clear, windy and cold\n |referee=[[Bill Vinovich]]\n |TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]] ([[Sports commentator|play-by-play]]), [[Cris Collinsworth]] ([[color commentator]]) and [[Michele Tafoya]] ([[sideline reporter]])\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2015011000/2014/POST19/ravens@patriots Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56495/NE_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* [[Kamar Aiken]] 19-yard pass from [[Joe Flacco]] ([[Justin Tucker]] kick), 12:18.

[[Tom Brady]] threw for three touchdowns and ran in a fourth.\n\nOn the opening possession of the game, The Ravens stormed 71 yards in under three minutes to take a 7\u20130 lead, with [[Joe Flacco]] hitting rookie wide receiver [[Kamar Aiken]] on a 19-yard TD pass. After a Patriots three-and-out, Flacco drove the Ravens down the field once again, this time 79 yards in exactly six minutes, capping the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to [[Steve Smith, Sr.|Steve Smith]], giving Baltimore a surprising 14\u20130 lead. The Patriots countered on their next drive. Aided by a 46-yard pass to Gronkowski, the Patriots drove 78 yards culminating in 8 plays with Brady tucking and running in a 4-yard touchdown, (in the process Brady tied [[Curtis Martin]]'s club record for rushing touchdowns in the playoffs) with less than a minute remaining in the first quarter. Midway through the second quarter, the Patriots marched 67 yards in three-and-a half minutes to tie the game at 14\u201314 with a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Danny Amendola]]. A 23-yard completion to Gronkowski earlier on the drive gave Brady 6,595 career passing yards in the postseason, a new NFL record. The touchdown pass gave him 44 touchdown passes in the playoffs, tying him with [[Brett Favre]] with second behind only Montana (who has 45). After a Ravens three-and-out, with just over a minute remaining in the first half, Brady was intercepted by Ravens linebacker [[Daryl Smith (American football)|Daryl Smith]] at the Ravens 43 for no gain. On 2nd-and-10 from the Patriots 44, Flacco threw an incomplete pass intended for Steve Smith, but Revis was flagged for illegal contact, giving the Ravens a first down at the Patriots 24. Three plays later, Flacco hit tight end [[Owen Daniels]] for a touchdown to give the Ravens a 21\u201314 with 10 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee to end the half. Amendola returned the second half kick 28 yards to the Patriots 26, but the Patriots were forced to punt after a Brady pass intended for Gronkowski fell incomplete, with a controversial pass interference no-call on Ravens rookie linebacker [[C. J. Mosley (linebacker)|C. J. Mosley]]. The Ravens took advantage of the no-call and drove 70 yards with Flacco throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass to Ravens running back [[Justin Forsett]] out of the backfield, marking Flacco's fourth touchdown pass of the game and giving the Ravens the lead 28\u201314, their second 14-point lead of the game, quieting the Patriots once raucous crowd. The Patriots drove to the Ravens 24 on their next drive. A 14-yard catch by Michael Hoomanawanui gave the Patriots a first down at the Ravens 10 with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the Ravens bench moving the ball to the 5. Two plays later, Brady found Gronk for the touchdown, trimming the deficit to 28\u201321 and tying him with Joe Montana for the most postseason touchdown passes. After a Ravens three-and-out, the Patriots needed just three plays to tie the game. Brady completed passes to Edelman and Vereen for 9 and 10 yards, respectively. Then, Brady threw a lateral pass to Edelman, who then proceeded to throw to a 51-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Danny Amendola, in what was Edelman's first career passing touchdown, tying the game at 28\u201328. On the second play of the Ravens next drive, McCourty intercepted Flacco at the Ravens 37 for no gain. Despite the fantastic field position, the Patriots didn't gain a single yard, and they decided to punt rather than attempt a 55-yard field goal. Taking over with just over three minutes remaining in the third quarter, the Ravens marched 73 yards to the Patriots 7, in 16 plays. On third down, Daniels dropped a pass in the end zone from Flacco, thanks to excellent coverage by [[Patrick Chung]], who was having a renaissance season, and the Ravens settled for a 25-yard field goal from [[Justin Tucker]], taking a 31\u201328 lead fairly early in the fourth quarter. On the next drive, Brady led the Patriots down the field, with the drive culminating in a 23-yard touchdown pass to LaFell with 5:21, giving the Patriots their first lead of the game, 35\u201331. With the pass, Brady set a new NFL record with 46 career postseason touchdown passes. He also set franchise single-game postseason records in passing yards (367) and completions (33). On the ensuing drive, the Ravens were able to move the ball to the Patriots' 36-yard line. On 2nd-and-5, with 1:47 to go, Flacco was intercepted at the Patriots 1-yard line by Duron Harmon on a deep pass intended for Ravens receiver [[Torrey Smith]]. After three Patriots kneel downs following the interception, the Ravens called their last timeout with 14 seconds to go, necessitating a Patriots punt. On the final play of the game Flacco's desperation heave was batted out of the end zone, and was batted down around the 5-yard line, sealing the Patriots' victory, and sending them to their fourth consecutive AFC Championship Game.\n\nThe game saw several skirmishes between Patriot and Raven players, and controversy ensued when Ravens coach [[John Harbaugh]] accused the Patriots of using a formation that made unclear which receivers were eligible or ineligible, causing confusion on the field. The Patriots used this formation to gain a total of over 40 yards on their game-winning drive. Brady dismissed Harbaugh's comments in his postgame press conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/01/11/league-will-review-whether-ravens-got-proper-notice-of-ineligible-player|title=League will review whether Ravens got proper notice of ineligible player|date=11 January 2015|publisher=}}</ref> The NFL confirmed that the substitutions and plays by the Patriots were legal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/12150444/2014-15-nfl-playoffs-league-says-new-england-patriots-substitutions-vs-baltimore-ravens-legal|title=2014-15 NFL playoffs -- League says New England Patriots substitutions vs. Baltimore Ravens legal\u2013ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref> Similar formations were used by the [[2014 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]], the [[2014 Detroit Lions season|Lions]], and the [[2014 Cincinnati Bengals season|Bengals]] during the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nesn.com/2015/01/bill-belichick-patriots-were-allowed-to-use-four-ol-so-we-did-it/|title=Bill Belichick: Patriots Were Allowed To Use Four O-Linemen, So We Did It|work=NESN.com|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4776177/another-nfl-team-used-four-offensive-linemen-set|title=Patriots' inspiration?

As the Patriots punted on their first drive, Colts return-man, [[Josh Cribbs]] muffed the punt with the ball bouncing off his helmet and [[Darius Fleming]] recovering for the Patriots at the Colts 26. Five plays later, Blount appeared to score  on a 4-yard touchdown run, but after official review was down short of the end zone, but Blount did score from 1-yard out on the very next play. The Colts drove 47 yards to the Patriots 34, but ex-Patriots Vinatieri missed wide-right on his 52-yard field goal attempt. With great field position at the Colts 47, aided by a 30-yard catch by Vereen, the Patriots took a 14\u20130 lead when Tom Brady hit fullback [[James Develin]] for a 1-yard touchdown late in the first quarter. Following a Colts punt, the Patriots marched 44 yards to the Colts 26, but [[D'Qwell Jackson]] intercepted Brady at the 1-yard line and returned it to the Colts 7. Aided by a 36-yard catch by [[T. Y. Hilton]], the Colts marched 93 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Zurlon Tipton]], trimming the deficit to 14\u20137. The Patriots countered, driving 65 yards to the Colts 3, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving the Patriots 17\u20137 lead. Luck took a knee and the game went to halftime. Though it was a fairly even ballgame after a half of play, but the Patriots blew the top off in the second half. After receiving the kickoff, the Patriots stormed 87 yards in just 9 plays, with Brady hitting left tackle Nate Solder, in as an eligible receiver for the play, for a 16-yard touchdown increasing their lead to 24\u20137. It was Solder's first career reception and touchdown. As the defense continued to shut down Colt quarterback Andrew Luck, Brady and the offense continued to roll. After a Colts three-and-out, the Patriots marched 62 yards in 8 plays with Brady hitting Gronkowski for a 5-yard touchdown to run the lead to 31\u20137. The Colts next drive last only four plays with Darrelle Revis intercepted Luck, Revis' third career playoff interception, and returning it 30 yards to the Colts 13. On the very next play, Blount took it 13 yards to the endzone, his 2nd touchdown of the night, cementing the fate of the game at 38\u20137. Edelman returned the next Colts punt 45 yards to the Colts 45, with a penalty moving the ball 5 yards to the Colts 40. 11 plays and over six minutes later, Blount burrowed through for his third touchdown of the night. The run gave him 148 rushing yards for the game, second most in franchise history. On the next drive, Jamie Collins intercepted Luck. The next three drives were all three-and-outs before the Colts ran out the final 1:51.\n\nBrady, extending his NFL record of playoff starts to 28, finished 23 of 35 for 226 yards three touchdowns and 1 interception. This was Brady's 7th career playoff game with 3 touchdowns, second only to [[Joe Montana]]'s 9. Blount was once again the star for the Pats against the Colts, carrying the ball 30 times, a Patriots postseason record, for 148 yard and three touchdowns. Continuing a trend of poor play versus the Patriots, Luck completed an abysmal 12 of 33 passes for 126 yards, no touchdowns and 2 interceptions. For his career, Luck fell to 0\u20134 against the Patriots, including two playoff losses. They would lose 34\u201327 in 2015. In those four games, the Patriots have outscored the Colts 189\u201373. Luck has thrown 9 career interceptions in three games played at Gillette Stadium.\n\n====Super Bowl XLIX: vs. Seattle Seahawks====\n{{see also|Super Bowl XLIX}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Super Bowl XLIX: New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks \u2013 Game summary\n |date=February 1, 2015\n |time=6:30 p.m. EST/4:30 p.m. [[Mountain Time Zone|MST]]\n |road='''Patriots'''\n |R1=0|R2=14|R3=0|R4=14\n |home=Seahawks\n |H1=0|H2=14|H3=10|H4=0\n |stadium=[[University of Phoenix Stadium]], [[Glendale, Arizona]]\n |attendance= 70,288\n |weather={{convert|66|F|C}}, clear ([[retractable roof]] open)\n |referee=[[Bill Vinovich]]\n |TV=NBC\n |TVAnnouncers=Al Michaels (play-by-play), Cris Collinsworth (color commentator) and Michele Tafoya (sideline reporter)\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2015020100/2014/POST22/patriots@seahawks Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56502/SEA_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* ''None''.\n'''Second quarter'''\n*NE \u2013 [[Brandon LaFell]] 11-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] ([[Stephen Gostkowski]] kick), 9:47.

For the second year in a row the Seahawks boasted the #1 ranked defense (1st against the pass, 3rd against the run). This was the Patriots' first Super Bowl appearance since 2011, when they lost to the Giants. This was the stadium where the 18-0 Patriots lost to the Giants in [[Super Bowl XLII]].\n\nAfter both teams punted on their initial drive, the Patriots marched 58 yards in 13 plays, in just under 8 minutes, reaching the Seahawks 10-yard line, but on third and goal, facing a blitz, Brady was intercepted by [[Jeremy Lane]] in the end zone, who returned it to the Seahawks 15. Lane suffered a broken wrist on the play and didn't return to the game. The Seahawks were able to get their first first down on their next drive, but nothing more and punted. Taking over at their own 35, the Patriots struck first blood, marching 65 yards in 9 plays, converting a 3rd-and-9 with a 23-yard catch by Edelman, culminating with Brady hitting Brandon LaFell on an 11-yard touchdown pass. After trading three-and-outs, Seattle marched 70 yards in 8 plays, converting three third down, culminating with Marshawn Lynch plunging in from 3 yards out to tie the game 7\u20137. The Patriots countered, racing 80 yards in under two minutes and with Brady lofting a 22-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski they retook the lead 14\u20137 with only 31 seconds left in the half. With only 31 second left in the half, it seemed like a forgone conclusion that the Seahawks would kneel to end the half; however, this was not the case. The ensuing Seahawks possession began with a 19-yard [[Robert Turbin]] run. Following a 17-yard Russell Wilson scramble to the Patriots 44, Wilson lofted a 23-yard completion [[Ricardo Lockette]] and, with an additional 10 yards on a Kyle Arrington facemask penalty, moved the ball to the Patriots' 11 yard line with 0:06 seconds remaining in the half. Wilson then hit [[Chris Matthews]] for the touchdown, the first of the latter's career, tying the game at 14\u201314 at halftime. The Seahawks marched 72 yards to the Patriots 8 line on the first drive of the second half, but the Patriots defense stiffened and held them to a 27-yard field goal by [[Steven Hauschka]], giving the Seahawks their first lead of the game, 17\u201314. On the Patriots first drive, facing a 3rd-and-9 from their own 32, linebacker [[Bobby Wagner]] intercepted Brady's pass, intended for Rob Gronkowski, and returned it 6 yards to the Patriots 34. An illegal contact penalty on [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]] moved the ball to midfield, but it didn't stop the Seahawks. Wilson hit [[Doug Baldwin]] on a 3-yard touchdown pass wide open in the back of the end zone, increasing the Seahawks lead to 24\u201314. Baldwin was later fined for an obscene gesture after the play. Sherman was also scene mocking Darrelle Revis (who was covering Baldwin) after the play. Seattle looked to be taking over, forcing the Patriots to a three-and-out. They drove to the Patriots 47, but Wilson threw an incomplete pass intended for [[Jermaine Kearse]] on 3rd-and-2. Once again though, the Seahawks forced the Patriots to a three-and-out after stuffing LeGarrette Blount for a 1-yard loss on 3rd-and-1. Facing their largest 4th quarter deficit in a Super Bowl during the Brady-Belichick era, the Patriots appeared finished, but Rob Ninkovich sacked Wilson for an 8-yard loss on 3rd-and-7, forcing Seattle to punt. [[Bruce Irvin (American football)|Bruce Irvin]] sacked Brady for an 8-yard loss on first down. Two plays later, facing a 3rd-and-14, Brady completed a 21-yard pass to Edelman for a first down to their own 49. A 9-yard completion to Vereen coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on [[Earl Thomas (defensive back)|Earl Thomas]] moved the ball to the Seahawks 27. Three plays later, Brady found Edelman again, for another 21 yard gain on 3rd-and-14. Two plays later, Brady found Amendola for a 4-yard touchdown pass, trimming the deficit to 24\u201321. The Seahawks went three-and-out on their next drive, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 36 yard line with 6:52 remaining. Tom Brady completed all of his eight pass attempts on the drive, marching the Patriots 64 yards, culminating in a 3-yard touchdown pass to Julian Edelman with 2:02 left to retake the lead, Brady's fourth touchdown pass of the evening. However, Seattle had 2 minutes and a full complement of timeouts at their disposal. On the first play of the ensuing Seahawk possession, Russell Wilson hit Lynch on a 31-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots 49. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10, Wilson found Lockette for an 11-yard gain to the Patriots 38. On the next play with 1:13 remaining, Kearse caught a 33-yard pass that bounced off of his body multiple times (which has been compared to the David Tyree [[Helmet Catch|helmet catch]] which also came against the Patriots at University of Phoenix Stadium). The Seahawks now had the ball at the Patriots' 5 yard line. Marshawn Lynch carried the ball to the 1 yard line on the next play, setting up 2nd and goal at the 1 yard line. On the next play, Wilson's pass, intended for Ricardo Lockette, was intercepted by undrafted free-agent rookie [[Malcolm Butler]] on the goal line with 20 seconds remaining. Butler also made a big play two plays earlier, he was the only one who had the presence of mind to push Kearse out of bounds after his catch.  After taking over possession at their own 1 yard line, the Patriots induced an offsides penalty on Seattle defensive end [[Michael Bennett (defensive lineman, born 1985)|Michael Bennett]]. A brawl broke out between the two teams after that, resulting in the ejection of Irvin, and fines against Bennett, Gronkowski and Michael Hoomanawanui. The Patriots took a knee, killing the clock, winning their fourth Super Bowl Championship; their first since [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], ten years earlier. Pete Carroll suffered severe backlash for failing to change Darrell Bevell's final play call on the goal line. This controversy sparked multiple memes and even a commercial which featured Marshawn Lynch saying, \"you should've ran the ball.\"\n\nTom Brady was named Super Bowl MVP (his third, tying Joe Montana for most all time) after completing 37 of 50 passes for 328 yards, with 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.  Brady was 13 of 15 for 124 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 140.7 passer rating with a QBR of 97.0 in the 4th quarter. Brady tied Montana and [[Terry Bradshaw]] for most Super Bowl victories by a quarterback, with four. Blount was a non-factor with just 40 yards on just 14 carries. Edelman was the top receiver of the game with 9 catches for 109 yards and 1 touchdown with three huge third-down catches. Russell Wilson was 12 of 21 for 247 yards, 2 TDs and 1 INT and added 39 yards on 3 carries. Rob Gronkowski had 6 catches for 68 yards and 1 touchdown. Shane Vereen led all players in receptions, with 11 catches for 64 yards, while Seattle counterpart Marshawn Lynch had 102 yards on 24 carries and 1 touchdown. Receiver Danny Amendola had 5 catches for 48 yards and 1 touchdown. Chris Matthews broke out with 4 catches for 109 yards and a touchdown.\n\n==Standings==\n\n===Division===\n{{2014 AFC East standings|team=NE}}\n\n===Conference===\n{{2014 AFC standings|team=NE}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Deflategate]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.patriots.com/schedule-and-stats/index.html}}\n*[http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/year/2014 2014 New England Patriots season at ESPN]\n*[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2014.htm 2014 New England Patriots season at Pro Football Reference]\n\n{{Super Bowl champions}}\n{{New England Patriots seasons}}\n{{Super Bowl XLIX}}\n{{New England Patriots}}\n{{2014 NFL season by team}}\n\n[[Category:2014 National Football League season by team|New England]]\n[[Category:New England Patriots seasons]]\n[[Category:2014 in sports in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:AFC East championship seasons]]\n[[Category:American Football Conference championship seasons]]\n[[Category:Super Bowl champion seasons]]\n", "name_user": "Allenthalben", "label": "safe", "comment": "forgone conclusion  > foregone conclusion", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_New_England_Patriots_season"}

This school is known in Delhi by a famous address, that is Sarkaari School ke bagal waala aur koode dan ke paas waala school. This school has tremendous rate of producing successful students. There are students who are usually caught for their mischief and many of them are criminals. This school is having a great experience to have a word with Police since they are usually doing this.

The meeting took place in the final of the February edition of the Carlton Club tournament on the French Riviera.

The Riviera season lasted from January through April and attracted many of the best players in the world in the lead-up to Europe's two Grand Slam tournaments: the French Championships in early June and the Wimbledon Championships in late June. The Carlton Club hosted two tournaments in Cannes annually, one in February and another in April.\n\nWith 58 competitors entered in the women's singles draw at the February edition of the Carlton Club, the event was played as a six-round single-elimination knockout bracket. Lenglen and Wills were placed on opposite sides of the draw to set up the possibility of them meeting in the final. Although they each needed to win five matches to ensure that they meet, once both players entered the singles event, it was regarded as a foregone conclusion that they would both reach the final due to the gap in playing ability between them and the other players.\n\n==Competitors==\n===Suzanne Lenglen===\n[[Suzanne Lenglen]] was a 26-year-old French tennis player who was widely acknowledged as the best women's player in the world at the time. She had been ranked No. 1 in the world by [[A. Wallis Myers]] at the end of 1925, a position she had held since the year-end rankings began in 1921. She entered the Match of the Century on a win streak of over 150 matches, having not lost a singles match in over four years. Lenglen was a Wimbledon champion a then-record six times. She had lost just one match in singles and three sets in total since the end of World War I, a period of seven years. Lenglen was rarely challenged in singles, as further evidenced by the lopsided scores with which she won the overwhelming majority of her matches. Lenglen's success led the press to call her as ''La Divine'', which translates to \"the Goddess\", and gave her an aura of invincibility.\n\n===Helen Wills===\n[[Helen Wills]] was a 20-year-old American tennis player who was regarded as an up-and-coming star and a potential challenger to Lenglen's dominance. She had been ranked No. 2 in the world by A. Wallis Myers at the end of 1925 by virtue of having won the [[U.S. National Championships (tennis)|U.S. National Championships]] the previous three years. Her first two such titles came against compatriot [[Molla Mallory]], the only player to defeat Lenglen in singles after World War I. The third title was a victory over British player [[Kitty McKane]], who had previously defeated Wills in the 1924 Wimbledon final.\n\n==Background==\n===Earlier missed encounters===\nThe hype for a match between Lenglen and Wills began in late 1923 following Wills's first major title at the U.S. National Championships. Their first encounter was expected to take place in 1924 when Wills made her first trip to Europe to compete in the Wightman Cup against Great Britain before partaking in Wimbledon and the Olympics later that summer. However, such a meeting never materialized. In April, Lenglen contracted [[jaundice]] in Spain after winning the Barcelona International. This illness prevented her from playing another competitive match until Wimbledon and notably kept her out of the French Championships, where she was the four-time defending champion. Although both Lenglen and Wills entered Wimbledon in late June, Lenglen had not fully recovered. She entered her quarterfinal against her doubles partner [[Elizabeth Ryan]] as an overwhelming favorite, having not lost a game in any of her first three matches. Although she defeated Ryan, she dropped the middle set, the first set of tennis she had lost in singles since 1921. Following the match, Lenglen withdrew from the tournament, asserting she had not yet recovered from her illness. She did not play another match that year. In the other half of the draw, Wills reached the final without losing more than two games in any set. Though, she could not capitalize on Lenglen's withdrawal and ultimately finished runner-up to [[Kitty McKane]] despite taking the first set.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|p=81\u201386}} A week later, Wills did take advantage of Lenglen's absence at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, winning the gold medals in both singles and doubles. This Olympic success bolstered her popularity in the United States and helped her rise to a level of stardom comparable to that of Lenglen, adding more interest for a match between tennis's two leading female stars.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|p=88\u201394}}\n\nWills did not return to Europe in 1925, instead focusing on her college studies as a sophomore at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in the early part of the year and competing in tournaments on the east coast of the United States during the summer. During that year, Lenglen reestablished her perceived invincibility, going undefeated in both singles and doubles, and winning titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at both the first open French Championships as well as Wimbledon. In the United States, Wills was unable to match Lenglen's level of success. Although she won the U.S. National Championships for the third year in a row, she lost a singles match in straight sets to Elizabeth Ryan and needed three sets to defeat Kitty McKane in the U.S. National Championship final. She also lost the decisive doubles match in the Wightman Cup to the visiting British pair of McKane and [[Evelyn Colyer]]. With these lapses, Wills had yet to attain the reputation of invincibility that Lenglen had. As a result, Lenglen was still regarded as the best player of the world and a clear favourite in a potential match against Wills.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|p=100\u2013106}}\n\n===Lead-up to the match===\nIn January 1926, Wills travelled to France with the goal of facing Lenglen in a tournament on the French Riviera, where Lenglen typically played the majority of her season outside of the Grand Slam tournaments.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|p=107\u2013118}}\n\n===Contrast of playing styles===\nThe two players also dealt with illness in opposite ways. Lenglen had developed a reputation for potentially faking illnesses when she was nervous, while Wills did not attribute poor performances to her health even when she was sick.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|p=85\u201386}}\n\n===Venue===\nThe tickets cost more than 20 times what tickets at the U.S. National Championship men's singles final cost at the time.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|p=161}}\n\n==Match summary==\n===First set===\nAfter Wills took an early lead in the match, Lenglen rebounded to win the first set comfortably. The set began with both players holding serve, Lenglen to love and Wills to 30 after falling behind 15\u201330. Wills carried over the momentum from her service game to break Lenglen and take a 2\u20131 lead. Although Lenglen had initially saved two break points at 15\u201340, Wills was eventually able to break on a long point that ended with her hitting a defensive cross-court backhand winner far up the line from well behind the baseline. The final shot prompted a standing ovation from the crowd, who did not expect Lenglen's well-placed previous shot to be returned, let alone hit for a winner. Wills' performance in this game convinced the spectators that Wills could compete with Lenglen and in turn that the match would be competitive.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=166\u2013168}}\n\nNonetheless, Lenglen was able to break Wills in her next three service games after devising a new tactic. In the first three games, she observed that Wills only attempted cross-court backhand winners, never hitting her backhand up the line. Lenglen took advantage of this weakness beginning in the fourth game by hitting drop shots to lure Wills into the net. If Wills was able to get to the drop shot, Lenglen would follow it up with a passing shot to win the point. She had little difficulty in setting up these drop shots because she knew where to position herself whenever Wills was hitting a backhand shot. Meanwhile, Wills lacked the speed to hit a good offensive return off of Lenglen's drop shots. This strategy also made Wills do more running and tired her later in the match. Lenglen's first two breaks and a service hold gave her a 4\u20132 lead.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nHaving lost three games in a row, Wills changed her own tactics and opted to come to the net voluntarily in Lenglen's next service game. This strategy helped her get another break to get to 3\u20134 after Lenglen was only able to hit one passing shot in the game. However, Lenglen was able to adjust and get her third break of serve in the next game by hitting deep lobs instead of passing shots whenever Wills came to the next. She then consolidated the break to win the set 6\u20133. Despite taking the first set, Lenglen went to her mother in the stands for a glass of cognac in-between sets, a practice she was known for doing in her most competitive matches such as the 1919 Wimbledon final. Conversely, Wills was not dismayed by losing the first set, as she had a reputation for starting matches slowly only to end up winning in three sets.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\n===Second set===\nThe second set was more competitive than the first. After three service holds to begin the set, Wills again picked up the first break to take a 3\u20131 lead. She continued to employ her strategy of coming to the net on every point and not giving Lenglen good opportunities to hitting passing shots. At this point, Lenglen stalled the match and again went to the stands for another glass of cognac. When she returned to the court, she broke back as Wills began playing more passively and stopped coming to the net in an effort to conserve energy. After Lenglen held serve to level the set at 3\u20133, the two competitors played what turned out to be the longest game of the match. Wills began the game trailing 15\u201340, but saved both break points by coming to the net. She then missed two routine shots on game points before prevailing on the fourteenth point of the game, an unforced error by Lenglen two points after the fourth deuce.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=171\u2013173}}\n\nWith Wills leading 4\u20133, the next game became the most controversial. After Lenglen briefly left the court a third time for more cognac, Wills took a 15\u201330 lead in Lenglen's service game. The next point featured a long rally that ended with Lenglen hitting the ball cross-court near the intersection of the service line and the sideline. Although the shot was called good, it is generally accepted that the linesman Cyril Tolley missed the call. Reporter Don Skene in particular noted that it landed wide by \"three inches at least\". Wills, who typically had a calm demeanor, became enraged and screamed at Tolley to question his call. Although the spectators also backed Wills, the call stood and Lenglen ended up winning the game. Wills then held serve in a game that went to deuce. Lenglen followed suit with a hold to love to keep the set level at 5\u20135.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=173\u2013175}}\n\n{{quote box|width=25%|border=1px|align=right|quote=\"And incidentally it will go down as one of the most grotesque and thrilling and momentous games on record.\"|source=\u2014[[James Thurber]] on the confusion in the game at 6\u20135 in the second set.{{sfn|Phillips|1999|p=49}}|}}\nIn the next game, Lenglen broke Wills to 30 to give herself the chance to serve for the match. She took a 40\u201315 in her service game to earn two match points. The first match point became another critical juncture in the match. Lenglen and Wills engaged in a long rally that ended with Wills hitting a powerful cross-court forehand into the corner near the line. Both players, the umpire, and the crowd heard the ball called out, signaling the end of the match. Within moments, photographers and reporters flooded the court and a picture was taken of Lenglen and Wills about to shake hands at the net. However, the linesman told the umpire that the ball was in and the call had from a spectator in the stands. Several minutes were needed to clear out all of the people and flowers on the court so that play could resume. When the match continued, Wills won the next three points to break Lenglen and level the match at 6\u20136.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\nBoth players had game points in each of the final two games of the match. Wills could not carry her momentum into her service game and fell behind 0\u201340. Although she won the next four points, Lenglen responded by taking the last three points and the game, setting up a second chance to serve out the match. Wills had a break point at 30\u201340 and a second after Lenglen had a rare double fault at deuce. However, Lenglen saved both break chances, and won the next two points to earn a third match point. On Lenglen's second shot of the point, she drew Wills into the net with a drop shot that she was barely able to get back. Wills's weak subsequent shot gave Lenglen enough time to run up to near the service line and hit a volley for a winner to end the match 6\u20133, 8\u20136.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=177\u2013178}}\n\n==Match statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, Lenglen was able to adjust and get her third break of serve in the next game by hitting deep lobs instead of passing shots whenever Wills came to the next. She then consolidated the break to win the set 6\u20133. Despite taking the first set, Lenglen went to her mother in the stands for a glass of cognac in-between sets, a practice she was known for doing in her most competitive matches such as the 1919 Wimbledon final. Conversely, Wills was not dismayed by losing the first set, as she had a reputation for starting matches slowly only to end up winning in three sets.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\n===Second set===\nThe second set was more competitive than the first. After three service holds to begin the set, Wills again picked up the first break to take a 3\u20131 lead. She continued to employ her strategy of coming to the net on every point and not giving Lenglen good opportunities to hitting passing shots. At this point, Lenglen stalled the match and again went to the stands for another glass of cognac. When she returned to the court, she broke back as Wills began playing more passively and stopped coming to the net in an effort to conserve energy. After Lenglen held serve to level the set at 3\u20133, the two competitors played what turned out to be the longest game of the match. Wills began the game trailing 15\u201340, but saved both break points by coming to the net. She then missed two routine shots on game points before prevailing on the fourteenth point of the game, an unforced error by Lenglen two points after the fourth deuce.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=171\u2013173}}\n\nWith Wills leading 4\u20133, the next game became the most controversial. After Lenglen briefly left the court a third time for more cognac, Wills took a 15\u201330 lead in Lenglen's service game. The next point featured a long rally that ended with Lenglen hitting the ball cross-court near the intersection of the service line and the sideline. Although the shot was called good, it is generally accepted that the linesman Cyril Tolley missed the call. Reporter Don Skene in particular noted that it landed wide by \"three inches at least\". Wills, who typically had a calm demeanor, became enraged and screamed at Tolley to question his call. Although the spectators also backed Wills, the call stood and Lenglen ended up winning the game. Wills then held serve in a game that went to deuce. Lenglen followed suit with a hold to love to keep the set level at 5\u20135.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=173\u2013175}}\n\n{{quote box|width=25%|border=1px|align=right|quote=\"And incidentally it will go down as one of the most grotesque and thrilling and momentous games on record.\"|source=\u2014[[James Thurber]] on the confusion in the game at 6\u20135 in the second set.{{sfn|Phillips|1999|p=49}}|}}\nIn the next game, Lenglen broke Wills to 30 to give herself the chance to serve for the match. She took a 40\u201315 in her service game to earn two match points. The first match point became another critical juncture in the match. Lenglen and Wills engaged in a long rally that ended with Wills hitting a powerful cross-court forehand into the corner near the line. Both players, the umpire, and the crowd heard the ball called out, signaling the end of the match. Within moments, photographers and reporters flooded the court and a picture was taken of Lenglen and Wills about to shake hands at the net. However, the linesman told the umpire that the ball was in and the call had from a spectator in the stands. Several minutes were needed to clear out all of the people and flowers on the court so that play could resume. When the match continued, Wills won the next three points to break Lenglen and level the match at 6\u20136.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\nBoth players had game points in each of the final two games of the match. Wills could not carry her momentum into her service game and fell behind 0\u201340. Although she won the next four points, Lenglen responded by taking the last three points and the game, setting up a second chance to serve out the match. Wills had a break point at 30\u201340 and a second after Lenglen had a rare double fault at deuce. However, Lenglen saved both break chances, and won the next two points to earn a third match point. On Lenglen's second shot of the point, she drew Wills into the net with a drop shot that she was barely able to get back. Wills's weak subsequent shot gave Lenglen enough time to run up to near the service line and hit a volley for a winner to end the match 6\u20133, 8\u20136.{{sfn|Engelmann|1988|pp=177\u2013178}}\n\n==Match statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

H. Irving''', was an English stage actor in the [[Victorian era]], known as an [[actor-manager]] because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the West End\u2019s [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre.  In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a [[knighthood]], indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.\n\nIrving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for [[Count Dracula]], the title character of the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' whose author, [[Bram Stoker]], was business manager of the theatre.\n\n==Life and career==\nIrving was born to a [[working-class]] family in [[Keinton Mandeville]] in the county of [[Somerset]].<ref name=dnbsup>{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Irving, Henry|volume=2|page=352}}</ref> [[W.H. Davies]], the celebrated poet, was a cousin. Irving spent his childhood living with his aunt, Mrs Penberthy, at [[Halsetown]] in [[Cornwall]]. He competed in a recitation contest at a local [[Methodist]] chapel where he was beaten by [[William Curnow]], later the editor of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.<ref>[[John Langdon Bonython]], Address of the President, Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, Volume XXIV, Parts 1 and 2, 1933-34, p8-9.</ref> He attended City Commercial School for two years before going to work in the office of a law firm at age 13. When he saw [[Samuel Phelps]] play [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] soon after this, he sought lessons, letters of introduction, and work in a theatre in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] in 1856, labouring against great odds until his 1871 success in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'' in [[London]] set him apart from all the rest.\n\nHe married Florence O'Callaghan on 15 July 1869 at St. Marylebone, London, but his personal life took second place to his professional life. On opening night of ''The Bells'', 25 November 1871, Florence, who was pregnant with their second child, criticised his profession: \"Are you going on making a fool of yourself like this all your life?\" Irving exited their carriage at [[Hyde Park Corner]], walked off into the night, and chose never to see her again.  He maintained a discreet distance from his children as well, but became closer to them as they grew older. Florence Irving never divorced Irving, and once he had been knighted she styled herself \"Lady Irving\"; Irving never remarried.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Michael|title=Sir Henry Irving \u2013 Biography|url=http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/henry-irving/|publisher=The Irving Society|accessdate=12 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Irving - Project Gutenberg eBook 12223.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sir Henry Irving, as [[Hamlet]], in an 1893 illustration from ''[[The Idler (1892\u20131911)|The Idler]]'' magazine]]\nHis elder son, [[Harry Brodribb Irving]] (1870\u20131919), usually known as \"H B Irving\", became a famous actor and later a theatre manager.

It could be said that Irving found his family in his professional company, which included his ardent supporter and manager Bram Stoker and Terry's two illegitimate children, Teddy and Edy.\n\nWhether Irving's long, spectacularly successful relationship with leading lady [[Ellen Terry]] was romantic as well as professional has been the subject of much historical speculation.

Craig, who came to be regarded as something of a visionary for the theatre of the future, wrote an especially vivid, book-length tribute to Irving.  (\"Let me state at once, in clearest unmistakable terms, that I have never known of, or seen, or heard, a greater actor than was Irving.\") [[George Bernard Shaw]], at the time a theatre critic who was jealous of Irving's connection to Ellen Terry (whom Shaw himself wanted in his own plays), conceded Irving's genius after Irving died.\n\n===Early career===\n[[File:Henry Irving Vanity Fair.jpg|thumb|[[List of Vanity Fair caricatures|Caricature]] (by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Ape]]) of Irving in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]''.

On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer Lytton]]'s play, ''Richelieu'', billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor [[Samuel Johnson (comedian)|Samuel Johnson]] was among those who supported him with practical advice.

One piece that he directed there was [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s first successful solo play, ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866)<ref>Crowther, Andrew.  ''Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan'', p. 60, The History Press Ltd (2011) {{ISBN|0-7524-5589-3}}</ref> The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen's Theatre, where he acted with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], [[J.

This was followed by short engagements at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], Drury Lane, and the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]].  Finally he made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in [[James Albery]]'s ''Two Roses'', which was produced at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights.\n\nIn 1871, Irving began his association with the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] by an engagement under Bateman's management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]],'' a version of [[Erckmann-Chatrian]]'s ''[[Le Juif polonais]]'' by [[Leopold Lewis]], a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. With Bateman, Irving was seen in [[William Gorman Wills|W. G. Wills]]' ''Charles I'' and ''Eugene Aram'', in ''Richelieu'', and in 1874 in ''[[Hamlet]]''. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in ''[[Macbeth]]''; in 1876 as [[Othello (character)|Othello]], and as Philip in [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s ''Queen Mary''; in 1877 in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''; and in The Lyons ''Mail''. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of ''Hamlet'' and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company.\n\n===Peak years===\n\n[[File:St Paul's Girls' School, London 04.JPG|thumb|Plaque at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], London]]\n\nIn 1878, Irving entered into a partnership with actress [[Ellen Terry]] and re-opened the Lyceum under his own management. With Terry as Ophelia and Portia, he revived ''[[Hamlet]]'' and produced ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1879). His [[Shylock]] was as much discussed as his Hamlet had been, the dignity with which he invested the vengeful [[Jew]]ish merchant marking a departure from the traditional interpretation of the role.\n[[File:HenryIrvingInHisStudy.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Irving in his study in 1892]]\n[[File:Henry Irving ca 1893.jpg|thumb|Mr. Henry Irving watching a rehearsal ca.1893]]\nAfter the production of Tennyson's ''The Cup'' and revivals of ''Othello'' (in which Irving played [[Iago]] to [[Edwin Booth]]'s title character) and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', there began a period at the Lyceum which had a potent effect on the English stage.\n\n''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' (1882) was followed by ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (1884); an adaptation of [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]]'s ''[[Vicar of Wakefield]]'' by W. G.

During these years, too, Irving, with the whole Lyceum company, paid several successful visits to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Music and the Drama: Irving's Vsit|journal=The Week : A Canadian Journal of Politics, Literature, Science and Arts|date=28 Feb 1884|volume=1|issue=13|page=204|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n103/mode/1up|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> which were repeated in succeeding years.  As Terry aged, there seemed to be fewer opportunities for her in his company; that was one reason she eventually left, moving on into less steady but nonetheless beloved stage work, including solo performances of Shakespeare's women.\n\n===Influence on Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''===\n{{main|Dracula}}\nFrom 1878, [[Bram Stoker]] worked for Irving as a business manager at the Lyceum. Stoker idolised Irving to the point that \"As one contemporary remarked, 'To Bram, Irving is as a god, and can do no wrong.' In the considered judgment of one biographer, Stoker's friendship with Irving was 'the most important love relationship of his adult life.'\"<ref name=\"Warren2002\"/> Irving, however, \"\u2026 was a self-absorbed and profoundly manipulative man.

Terriss had been stabbed at the stage door of the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in December 1897 and in the wake of his death, Prince was committed to [[Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum]]. Irving was critical of the unusually lenient sentence, remarking 'Terriss was an actor, so his murderer will not be executed.' Two years later, Prince had found Irving's home address and threatened to murder him 'when he gets out'. Irving was advised to submit the letter to the Home Office to ensure Prince's continued incarceration, which Irving declined to do.<ref>Aberdeen Evening Express [[British Newspaper Archive]] 05 April 1899, p.3.</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Irving, 1905-10.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A c. 1905-1910 portrait of Irving by [[Reginald Grenville Eves|R.

In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a [[knighthood]], indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.\n\nIrving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for [[Count Dracula]], the title character of the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' whose author, [[Bram Stoker]], was business manager of the theatre.\n\n==Life and career==\nIrving was born to a [[working-class]] family in [[Keinton Mandeville]] in the county of [[Somerset]].<ref name=dnbsup>{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Irving, Henry|volume=2|page=352}}</ref> [[W.H.

When he saw [[Samuel Phelps]] play [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] soon after this, he sought lessons, letters of introduction, and work in a theatre in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] in 1856, labouring against great odds until his 1871 success in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'' in [[London]] set him apart from all the rest.\n\nHe married Florence O'Callaghan on 15 July 1869 at St. Marylebone, London, but his personal life took second place to his professional life. On opening night of ''The Bells'', 25 November 1871, Florence, who was pregnant with their second child, criticised his profession: \"Are you going on making a fool of yourself like this all your life?\" Irving exited their carriage at [[Hyde Park Corner]], walked off into the night, and chose never to see her again.  He maintained a discreet distance from his children as well, but became closer to them as they grew older.

On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer Lytton]]'s play, ''Richelieu'', billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor [[Samuel Johnson (comedian)|Samuel Johnson]] was among those who supported him with practical advice.

One piece that he directed there was [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s first successful solo play, ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866)<ref>Crowther, Andrew.  ''Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan'', p. 60, The History Press Ltd (2011) {{ISBN|0-7524-5589-3}}</ref> The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen's Theatre, where he acted with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], [[J. L. Toole]], Lionel Brough, John Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. [[Alfred Wigan]], [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Nellie Farren]]. This was followed by short engagements at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], Drury Lane, and the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]].  Finally he made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in [[James Albery]]'s ''Two Roses'', which was produced at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights.\n\nIn 1871, Irving began his association with the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] by an engagement under Bateman's management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]],'' a version of [[Erckmann-Chatrian]]'s ''[[Le Juif polonais]]'' by [[Leopold Lewis]], a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. With Bateman, Irving was seen in [[William Gorman Wills|W. G. Wills]]' ''Charles I'' and ''Eugene Aram'', in ''Richelieu'', and in 1874 in ''[[Hamlet]]''. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in ''[[Macbeth]]''; in 1876 as [[Othello (character)|Othello]], and as Philip in [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s ''Queen Mary''; in 1877 in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''; and in The Lyons ''Mail''. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of ''Hamlet'' and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company.\n\n===Peak years===\n\n[[File:St Paul's Girls' School, London 04.JPG|thumb|Plaque at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], London]]\n\nIn 1878, Irving entered into a partnership with actress [[Ellen Terry]] and re-opened the Lyceum under his own management. With Terry as Ophelia and Portia, he revived ''[[Hamlet]]'' and produced ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1879). His [[Shylock]] was as much discussed as his Hamlet had been, the dignity with which he invested the vengeful [[Jew]]ish merchant marking a departure from the traditional interpretation of the role.\n[[File:HenryIrvingInHisStudy.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Irving in his study in 1892]]\n[[File:Henry Irving ca 1893.jpg|thumb|Mr. Henry Irving watching a rehearsal ca.1893]]\nAfter the production of Tennyson's ''The Cup'' and revivals of ''Othello'' (in which Irving played [[Iago]] to [[Edwin Booth]]'s title character) and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', there began a period at the Lyceum which had a potent effect on the English stage.\n\n''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' (1882) was followed by ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (1884); an adaptation of [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]]'s ''[[Vicar of Wakefield]]'' by W. G. Wills (1885); ''Faust'' (1886); ''Macbeth'' (1888, with [[incidental music]] by [[Arthur Sullivan]]<ref>[http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/sullivan/macbeth/index.html \"Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's ''Macbeth''], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 January 2005, accessed 21 August 2016; Hugill, Robert.

During these years, too, Irving, with the whole Lyceum company, paid several successful visits to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Music and the Drama: Irving's Vsit|journal=The Week : A Canadian Journal of Politics, Literature, Science and Arts|date=28 Feb 1884|volume=1|issue=13|page=204|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n103/mode/1up|accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> which were repeated in succeeding years.  As Terry aged, there seemed to be fewer opportunities for her in his company; that was one reason she eventually left, moving on into less steady but nonetheless beloved stage work, including solo performances of Shakespeare's women.\n\n===Influence on Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''===\n{{main|Dracula}}\nFrom 1878, [[Bram Stoker]] worked for Irving as a business manager at the Lyceum. Stoker idolised Irving to the point that \"As one contemporary remarked, 'To Bram, Irving is as a god, and can do no wrong.' In the considered judgment of one biographer, Stoker's friendship with Irving was 'the most important love relationship of his adult life.'\"<ref name=\"Warren2002\"/> Irving, however, \"\u2026 was a self-absorbed and profoundly manipulative man.

Terriss had been stabbed at the stage door of the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in December 1897 and in the wake of his death, Prince was committed to [[Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum]]. Irving was critical of the unusually lenient sentence, remarking 'Terriss was an actor, so his murderer will not be executed.' Two years later, Prince had found Irving's home address and threatened to murder him 'when he gets out'. Irving was advised to submit the letter to the Home Office to ensure Prince's continued incarceration, which Irving declined to do.<ref>Aberdeen Evening Express [[British Newspaper Archive]] 05 April 1899, p.3.</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Irving, 1905-10.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A c. 1905-1910 portrait of Irving by [[Reginald Grenville Eves|R.
