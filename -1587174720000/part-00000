It is also the first and only Kazakhstani university to receive an '''international accreditation for its Oil and Gas programs''' in the UK by the Institution of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology '''(IMarEST), UK''' .\n\nKBTU Business School is awarded the prestigious international accreditation, '''ACBSP (The Accreditation Council of Business Schools and Programs)'''.\nThe following KBTU programs are now ACBSP Accredited:\n\n'''Undergraduate: Finance, Management;'''\n\n'''Graduate: MBA in the Oil and Gas, MBA in Leadership, MBA in Finance, Financial Analysis, Supply and Project Management.\n''''''\n\n'''Quick Facts:''' \n* The only English-language Technical University in Kazakhstan\n* 100% classes are taught in English\n* International faculty representing many cultures \n* KBTU hosts Central Asia's only marine academy, The Kazakhstan Maritime Academy (KMA)\n\n'''Unique Features:'''\n\na)\tKBTU has exceptionally strong, live links with business and industry. Business leaders sit at the University\u2019s Advisory Board. Instead of having academic committees the KBTU has industrial committees at each of its school. These Committees are headed by business and industry leaders of national and international companies.\n\nb)\tBusinesses advise on course design and content that is tailored to the industry needs. Many companies provide student grants and later hire KBTU graduates.\n \nc)\tTeaching staff also includes a large number of professionals who work for business and industry at international IT brands and oil and gas industry.\n \nd)\tItaly's energy giant Eni is working closely with KBTU. Eni professionals teach master's degree program in petroleum engineering. A new master's degree program in facility management will be launched in cooperation with Eni.\n \ne)\tKBTU has a new very practical MBA in digital media program which brings together business, IT, law and journalism education/training in a 12-month very intensive study program.\n \nf)\tKBTU IT faculty has the largest number of students. Some work at big companies and earn money and also receive academic credits for their work in the industry. Some full-time students attend classes in the evenings and on weekends. Thus students have the academic and practical experience at the same time.\n\ng)\tKBTU has several scientific institutes and labs where learned scientists work. Top scientists and researchers from the Soviet times work also work at KBTU\u2019s scientific laboratories.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea of creating Kazakh-British Technical University was conceived by the former President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is now the leader of the nation.
