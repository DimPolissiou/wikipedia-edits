Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]] shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on [[Hispaniola]], after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]].\n\nThe Bahamas became a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[crown colony]] in 1718, when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] to The Bahamas; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in The Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the [[Royal Navy]], while some [[Slavery in North America|North American slaves]] and [[Seminole]]s escaped to The Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognise the freedom of slaves carried by the ships of other nations which reached The Bahamas.

After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] to The Bahamas; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in The Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the [[Royal Navy]], while some [[Slavery in North America|North American slaves]] and [[Seminole]]s escaped to The Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognise the freedom of slaves carried by the ships of other nations which reached The Bahamas.

The first distinct ''lamassu'' motif appeared in Assyria during the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] as a symbol of power.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/mesopotamia_gallery_09.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |title= History \u2013 Mesopotamia }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ancientneareast.net/religion_mesopotamian/lamassu.html |title=Lamassu |publisher=ancientneaeast.net }}</ref>\n\n[[Assyrian sculpture]] typically placed prominent pairs of ''lamassu'' at entrances in palaces, facing the street and also internal courtyards. They were represented as \"double-aspect\" figures on corners, in high [[relief]]. From the front they appear to stand, and from the side, walk, and in earlier versions have five legs, as is apparent when viewed obliquely. Lumasi do not generally appear as large figures in the low-relief schemes running round palace rooms, where [[winged genie]] figures are common, but they sometimes appear within narrative reliefs, apparently protecting the Assyrians.<ref>Frankfort, 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nThe colossal entranceway figures were often followed by a hero grasping a wriggling lion, also colossal in scale and in high relief.  In the palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Dur-Sharrukin]], a group of at least seven ''lamassu'' and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the \"throne room\", \"a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power.\"<ref>Frankfort, 147\u2013148, 148 quoted</ref> They also appear on [[cylinder seal]]s.  Notable examples include those at the [[Gate of All Nations]] at [[Persepolis]] in Iran, the [[British Museum]] in London, the [[Louvre]] in Paris, the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in Baghdad, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]]. Several examples left ''in situ'' in northern [[Iraq]] were destroyed in the 2010s by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] when they occupied the area, as were [[destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts#Assyrian|those in the Mosul Museum]].\n\n==Terminology==\n''Lamassu'' represent the zodiacs, parent-stars, or constellations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> They are depicted as protective deities because they encompass all life within them. In the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', they are depicted as physical deities as well, which is where the lammasu iconography originates, these deities could be microcosms of their microcosmic zodiac, parent-star, or constellation. Although ''lamassu'' had a different [[iconography]] and portrayal in [[Sumer#Culture|the culture of Sumer]], the terms \"''lamassu''\", \"''alad''\", and \"''shedu''\" evolved throughout the Assyro-Akkadian culture from the Sumerian culture to denote the Assyrian-winged-man-bull symbol and statues during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. Female ''lamassu'' were called \"''apsas\u00fb''\".<ref name=\"Livius.org\"/> \n[[File:Door guardian figure (Lamassu) from Nimrud 2.jpg|thumb|Cast from the original in Iraq, this is one of a pair of five-legged ''lamassu'' with lion's feet in [[Berlin]]]]\n\nThe motif of the Assyrian-winged-man-bull called ''Aladlammu'' and ''Lamassu'' interchangeably is not the ''lamassu'' or alad of Sumerian origin, which were depicted with different iconography.{{Clarify|date=May 2014}} These monumental statues were called aladlamm\u00fb or ''lamassu'' which meant \"protective spirit\".<ref name=\"Livius.org\"/>{{Clarify|date=May 2014}} In Hittite, the Sumerian form {{smallcaps|<sup>d</sup>lamma}} is used both as a name for the so-called \"[[tutelary deity]]\", identified in certain later texts with [[Inara (goddess)|Inara]], and a title given to similar protective gods.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=McMahon|first=John Gregory|title=The Hittite State Cult of the Tutelary Deities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22sOAAAAYAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago|isbn=978-0-918986-69-6}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Gate of nations.JPG|thumb|The ''lamassu'' in [[Persepolis]]|300px]]\nThe ''lamassu'' is a celestial being from [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] bearing a human head, bull's body, sometimes with the horns and the ears of a bull, and wings. It appears frequently in [[Art of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian art]]. The ''lamassu'' and shedu were household protective spirits of the common Babylonian people, becoming associated later as royal protectors, and were placed as sentinels at entrances.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/winged-human-headed-bull|title=Winged human-headed bull|last1=Castor|first1=Marie-Jos\u00e9 |publisher=[[Louvre]].fr|date=|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> The Akkadians associated the god [[Papsukkal]] with a ''lamassu'' and the god [[Ishum|I\u0161um]] with ''shedu''.\n\nTo protect houses, the ''lamassu'' were engraved in clay tablets, which were then buried under the door's threshold. They were often placed as a pair at the entrance of [[palace]]s. At the entrance of cities, they were sculpted in colossal size, and placed as a pair, one at each side of the door of the city, that generally had doors in the surrounding wall, each one looking towards one of the [[cardinal direction|cardinal point]]s.\n\nThe ancient Jewish people were influenced by the iconography of Assyrian culture. The prophet [[Ezekiel]] wrote about a fantastic being made up of aspects of a human being, a lion, an eagle and a bull.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/152074/1/Bodi_1991_The_Book_of_Ezekiel_and_the_Poem_of_Erra.pdf|title=The Book of Ezekiel and the Poem of Erra|last1=Bodi|first1=Daniel}}</ref> Later, in the early Christian period, the four Gospels were ascribed to each of these components. When it was depicted in art, this image was called the [[Tetramorph]].\n\n==In modern culture==\nThe [[Tenth Army (United Kingdom)|British 10th Army]], which operated in [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] in 1942\u20131943, adopted the ''lamassu'' as its insignia. A bearded man with a winged bull body appears on the logo of the [[United States Forces \u2013 Iraq]].\n\nA man with a bull's body is found among the creatures that make up Aslan's army in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]]. He appears at the Stone Table, challenging the White Witch \"with a great bellowing voice\". In the film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), ''lamassu'' are seen at the [[Ishtar Gate]] in [[Babylon]]. In the Disney movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), a gold ''lamassu'' can be found in the scene where Aladdin and Abu enter the cave in the desert to find the lamp.\n\n[[Michael Rakowitz]], a [[Northwestern University]] professor of Art Theory & Practice won a [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|Fourth Plinth]] commission to recreate the ''Lamassu'' that stood in Nineveh, Iraq, from 700 BC until it was destroyed by ISIS in 2015.

The first distinct ''lamassu'' motif appeared in Assyria during the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] as a symbol of power.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/mesopotamia_gallery_09.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |title= History \u2013 Mesopotamia }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ancientneareast.net/religion_mesopotamian/lamassu.html |title=Lamassu |publisher=ancientneaeast.net }}</ref>\n\n[[Assyrian sculpture]] typically placed prominent pairs of ''lamassu'' at entrances in palaces, facing the street and also internal courtyards. They were represented as \"double-aspect\" figures on corners, in high [[relief]]. From the front they appear to stand, and from the side, walk, and in earlier versions have five legs, as is apparent when viewed obliquely. Lumasi do not generally appear as large figures in the low-relief schemes running round palace rooms, where [[winged genie]] figures are common, but they sometimes appear within narrative reliefs, apparently protecting the Assyrians.<ref>Frankfort, 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nThe colossal entranceway figures were often followed by a hero grasping a wriggling lion, also colossal in scale and in high relief.  In the palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Dur-Sharrukin]], a group of at least seven ''lamassu'' and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the \"throne room\", \"a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power.\"<ref>Frankfort, 147\u2013148, 148 quoted</ref> They also appear on [[cylinder seal]]s.  Notable examples include those at the [[Gate of All Nations]] at [[Persepolis]] in Iran, the [[British Museum]] in London, the [[Louvre]] in Paris, the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in Baghdad, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]]. Several examples left ''in situ'' in northern [[Iraq]] were destroyed in the 2010s by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] when they occupied the area, as were [[destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts#Assyrian|those in the Mosul Museum]].\n\n==Terminology==\n''Lamassu'' represent the zodiacs, parent-stars, or constellations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> They are depicted as protective deities because they encompass all life within them. In the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', they are depicted as physical deities as well, which is where the lammasu iconography originates, these deities could be microcosms of their microcosmic zodiac, parent-star, or constellation. Although ''lamassu'' had a different [[iconography]] and portrayal in [[Sumer#Culture|the culture of Sumer]], the terms \"''lamassu''\", \"''alad''\", and \"''shedu''\" evolved throughout the Assyro-Akkadian culture from the Sumerian culture to denote the Assyrian-winged-man-bull symbol and statues during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. Female ''lamassu'' were called \"''apsas\u00fb''\".<ref name=\"Livius.org\"/> \n[[File:Door guardian figure (Lamassu) from Nimrud 2.jpg|thumb|Cast from the original in Iraq, this is one of a pair of five-legged ''lamassu'' with lion's feet in [[Berlin]]]]\n\nThe motif of the Assyrian-winged-man-bull called ''Aladlammu'' and ''Lamassu'' interchangeably is not the ''lamassu'' or alad of Sumerian origin, which were depicted with different iconography.{{Clarify|date=May 2014}} These monumental statues were called aladlamm\u00fb or ''lamassu'' which meant \"protective spirit\".<ref name=\"Livius.org\"/>{{Clarify|date=May 2014}} In Hittite, the Sumerian form {{smallcaps|<sup>d</sup>lamma}} is used both as a name for the so-called \"[[tutelary deity]]\", identified in certain later texts with [[Inara (goddess)|Inara]], and a title given to similar protective gods.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=McMahon|first=John Gregory|title=The Hittite State Cult of the Tutelary Deities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22sOAAAAYAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago|isbn=978-0-918986-69-6}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Gate of nations.JPG|thumb|The ''lamassu'' in [[Persepolis]]|300px]]\nThe ''lamassu'' is a celestial being from [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] bearing a human head, bull's body, sometimes with the horns and the ears of a bull, and wings. It appears frequently in [[Art of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian art]]. The ''lamassu'' and shedu were household protective spirits of the common Babylonian people, becoming associated later as royal protectors, and were placed as sentinels at entrances.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/winged-human-headed-bull|title=Winged human-headed bull|last1=Castor|first1=Marie-Jos\u00e9 |publisher=[[Louvre]].fr|date=|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> The Akkadians associated the god [[Papsukkal]] with a ''lamassu'' and the god [[Ishum|I\u0161um]] with ''shedu''.\n\nTo protect houses, the ''lamassu'' were engraved in clay tablets, which were then buried under the door's threshold. They were often placed as a pair at the entrance of [[palace]]s. At the entrance of cities, they were sculpted in colossal size, and placed as a pair, one at each side of the door of the city, that generally had doors in the surrounding wall, each one looking towards one of the [[cardinal direction|cardinal point]]s.\n\nThe ancient Jewish people were influenced by the iconography of Assyrian culture. The prophet [[Ezekiel]] wrote about a fantastic being made up of aspects of a human being, a lion, an eagle and a bull.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/152074/1/Bodi_1991_The_Book_of_Ezekiel_and_the_Poem_of_Erra.pdf|title=The Book of Ezekiel and the Poem of Erra|last1=Bodi|first1=Daniel}}</ref> Later, in the early Christian period, the four Gospels were ascribed to each of these components. When it was depicted in art, this image was called the [[Tetramorph]].\n\n==In modern culture==\nThe [[Tenth Army (United Kingdom)|British 10th Army]], which operated in [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] in 1942\u20131943, adopted the ''lamassu'' as its insignia. A bearded man with a winged bull body appears on the logo of the [[United States Forces \u2013 Iraq]].\n\nA man with a bull's body is found among the creatures that make up Aslan's army in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]]. He appears at the Stone Table, challenging the White Witch \"with a great bellowing voice\". In the film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), ''lamassu'' are seen at the [[Ishtar Gate]] in [[Babylon]]. In the Disney movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), a gold ''lamassu'' can be found in the scene where Aladdin and Abu enter the cave in the desert to find the lamp.\n\n[[Michael Rakowitz]], a [[Northwestern University]] professor of Art Theory & Practice won a [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|Fourth Plinth]] commission to recreate the ''Lamassu'' that stood in Nineveh, Iraq, from 700 BC until it was destroyed by ISIS in 2015.

During this time, the Supreme Court issued several decisions invalidating federal and state statutes that sought to regulate working conditions during the [[Progressive Era]] and the [[Great Depression]]. This period ended with ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'' (1937), in which the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of [[minimum wage]] legislation enacted by the State of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Philips |first=Michael J. |title=The Lochner Court, Myth and Reality: Substantive Due Process from the 1890s to the 1930s |location= |publisher=Greenwood |year=2001 |page=10 |isbn=0-275-96930-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Facts==\nJoseph Lochner, who owned Lochner's Home Bakery in [[Utica, New York|Utica]], claimed that the [[New York Legislature]]'s Bakeshop Act of 1895 was unconstitutional. The Bakeshop Act regulated health conditions in bakeries and prohibited employees from working in bakeries for more than 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week. In 1899, Lochner was indicted on a charge that he violated Section 110 of Article 8, Chapter 415, of the Laws of 1897, as he had wrongfully and unlawfully permitted an employee working for him to work more than 60 hours in one week. He was fined $25 ({{Inflation|US|25|1897|fmt=eq|r=-2}}). For a second offense in 1901, Lochner drew a fine of $50 ({{Inflation|US|50|1897|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) from the Oneida County Court. Lochner appealed his second conviction. However, the conviction was upheld, 3\u20132, by the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court]]. He appealed again to the [[New York Court of Appeals]], New York's highest court, where he lost, 4\u20133. He then took his case to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nLochner's appeal was based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution: \"... nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" In a series of cases, the Supreme Court established that the Due Process Clause (found in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments) is not only a procedural guarantee, but also a substantive limitation on the type of control that the government may exercise over individuals. Although that interpretation of the due process clause is a controversial one (see [[substantive due process]]), it had become firmly embedded in American jurisprudence by the end of the 19th century. Lochner argued that the right to contract freely was one of the rights encompassed by substantive due process.\n\nScholars have noted that when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, 27 out of 37 state constitutions had Lockean Provisos, which typically said: \"All men are by nature free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring and possessing and protecting property: and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\" As such clauses were \"deeply rooted in American history and tradition,\" they likely informed the original meaning of the scope and nature of the fundamental rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment in the eyes of Lochner-era justices.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Calabresi |first1=Steven G. |last2=Agudo |first2=Sarah |title=Individual Rights Under State Constitutions When the Fourteenth Amendment Was Ratified in 1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition? |volume=87 |journal=Tex. L. Rev. |issue=7 |page=88 |year=2008<!--Note: http://www.texaslrev.com/ archives go back only to volume 91 as of May 2013-->}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court had accepted the argument that the due process clause protected the right to contract seven years earlier, in ''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' (1897). However, the Court had acknowledged that the right was not absolute, but subject to the [[police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] of the states. For example, in ''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'' (1898), the Supreme Court upheld a [[Utah]] law setting an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for [[mining|miners]]. In ''Holden'', Justice [[Henry Billings Brown|Henry Brown]] wrote that while \"the police power cannot be put forward as an excuse for oppressive and unjust legislation, it may be lawfully resorted to for the purpose of preserving the public health, safety, or morals.\" The issue facing the Supreme Court in ''Lochner'' was whether the Bakeshop Act represented a reasonable exercise of the state's police power.\n\nLochner's case was argued by Henry Weismann, who had been one of the foremost advocates of the Bakeshop Act when he was Secretary of the Journeymen Bakers' Union. In his [[brief (law)|brief]], Weismann decried the idea that \"the treasured freedom of the individual ... should be swept away under the guise of the police power of the State.\" He denied New York's argument that the Bakeshop Act was a necessary health measure by claiming that the \"average bakery of the present day is well ventilated, comfortable both summer and winter, and always sweet smelling.\" Weismann's brief contained an appendix providing statistics showing that bakers' mortality rates were comparable to that of white-collar professionals.\n\n==Judgment==\nThe Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that the law limiting bakers' working hours did not constitute a legitimate exercise of state police powers, so it was unconstitutional. It argued for [[freedom of contract]], and that [[unequal bargaining power]] was irrelevant. The opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice [[Rufus Peckham]]. Lochner did not have to pay the fine.\n\n===Harlan's dissent===\nJustice [[John Marshall Harlan]] wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices [[Edward Douglass White]] and [[William R. Day]]. Harlan contended that the liberty to contract is subject to regulation imposed by a state acting within the scope of its police powers. Harlan offered the following rule for determining whether such statutes are unconstitutional:\n\n{{quote|The power of the courts to review legislative action in respect of a matter affecting the general welfare exists only \"when that which the legislature has done comes within the rule that, if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.\"}}\n\nHarlan asserted that the burden of proof should rest with the party seeking to have such a statute deemed unconstitutional.\n\nHarlan's dissent argued that the Court gave insufficient weight to the state's argument that the law was a valid health measure addressing a legitimate state interest. Harlan contended that it was \"plain that this statute was enacted to protect the physical well-being of those who work in bakery and confectionery establishments.\" Responding to the majority's assertion that the profession of a baker was not an unhealthy one, he quoted at length from academic studies describing the respiratory ailments and other risks that bakers faced. He argued that the Supreme Court should have deferred to the New York Legislature's judgment that long working hours threatened the health of bakery employees. According to Harlan, \"If the end which the legislature seeks to accomplish be one to which its power extends, and if the means employed to that end, although not the wisest or best, are yet not plainly and palpably unauthorized by law, then the court cannot interfere.\"\n\n===Holmes' dissent===\nJustice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote three paragraphs accusing the majority of [[judicial activism]], claiming the case was \"decided upon an economic theory which a large part of the country does not entertain.\" He did not agree that the Fourteenth Amendment enshrined liberty of contract, citing laws against [[Sunday shopping|Sunday trading]] and [[usury]] as \"ancient examples\" to the contrary: \"The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''[[Social Statics]]''\" (a book advocating strict ''[[laissez faire]]'' philosophy). He emphasized that \"a constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory.\"\n\n==Significance and legacy==\n{{main|Lochner era}}\n{{quotebox |width=30% |quote=The case is famous because there is virtually universal agreement among judges and scholars that it was incorrectly decided. More important, it is the case in which Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the most influential dissenting opinion in the Court's history.|source= \u2014Retired Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], writing in 2011.<ref>{{cite book |title=Five Chiefs: A Supreme Court Memoir |first=John Paul |last=Stevens |authorlink=John Paul Stevens |date=2011 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |isbn=978-0-316-19980-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fivechiefssuprem00stev/page/25 25] |url=https://archive.org/details/fivechiefssuprem00stev/page/25 }}.</ref>}}\n\nThe Supreme Court's due process jurisprudence over the next three decades was inconsistent, but it took a narrow view of states' police powers in several major labor cases after ''Lochner''. For example, in ''[[Coppage v. Kansas]]'' (1915), the Court struck down statutes forbidding \"[[yellow-dog contract]]s.\" Similarly, in ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'' (1923), the Supreme Court held that [[minimum wage]] laws violated the due process clause, but Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] strongly dissented, suggesting that the Court instead should have overruled ''Lochner''. The doctrine of substantive due process was coupled with a narrow interpretation of congressional power under the [[commerce clause]]. Justices [[James Clark McReynolds|James McReynolds]], [[George Sutherland]], [[Willis Van Devanter]], and [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]] emerged during the 1920s and 1930s as the foremost defenders of traditional limitations on government power on the Supreme Court, so were collectively dubbed by partisans of the New Deal the \"[[Four Horsemen (Supreme Court)|Four Horsemen of Reaction]].\" All four believed in ''[[laissez faire]]'' economics.\n\nIn 1934, the Supreme Court decided ''[[Nebbia v. New York]]'' stating that  no constitutional fundamental right to freedom of contract exists. In 1937, the Supreme Court decided ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'', which expressly overruled ''Adkins'' and implicitly signaled the end of the ''Lochner'' era by repudiating the idea that freedom of contract should be unrestricted.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court did not explicitly overrule ''Lochner'',<ref name=\"ABA Not explicitly overruled\">{{cite web|last1=Quimbee|title=SCOTUS shifts from workers protections starting with Lochner v. New York|url=http://abaforlawstudents.com/2016/07/08/quimbee-case-week/|website=American Bar Association for Students|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}</ref> it agreed to give more deference to the decisions of state legislatures. The Court sounded the death knell for economic substantive due process several years later in ''[[Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma]]'' (1955). In that case, a unanimous Supreme Court declared, \"The day is gone when this Court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.\"\n\nComing at a time of mounting political pressure over the judiciary's stance toward the New Deal, the Court's shift is sometimes called \"[[the switch in time that saved nine]].\"\n\n===Modern substantive due process===\nIn the post-''Lochner'' era, the Supreme Court has applied a lower standard of review to confront restrictions on economic liberty. A higher standard is used in reviewing legislation infringing on personal liberties. A line of cases dating back to the 1923 opinion by Justice McReynolds in ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'', citing Lochner as establishing limits on the police power, has established a privacy right under substantive due process. More recently, in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973), the Supreme Court held that women have a privacy right to determine whether or not to have an abortion. In 1992, ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' reaffirmed that right, but the Court no longer used the term \"privacy\" to describe it.\n\n===Scholarly reaction===\nThe Supreme Court's decision in ''Lochner v. New York'' has been criticized by legal scholars. Law professor [[Bernard Siegan]] described it as \"one of the most condemned cases in United States history.\"<ref name=Siegan>{{cite book |first=Bernard H. |last=Siegan |title=Economic Liberties and the Constitution |url=https://archive.org/details/economiclibertie0000sieg |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/economiclibertie0000sieg/page/23 23] |year=1980 |publisher=Univ of Chicago Pr |isbn=978-0226756639}}, cited in {{cite book |title=Constitutional Law |last1=Stone |first1=Geoffrey R |edition=6th |year=2009 |publisher=Aspen Publishers |page=744 |isbn=978-0735577190|display-authors=etal}}</ref> According to the [[Center for American Progress]], a left-leaning think tank, law professors often use ''Lochner'', along with ''[[Plessy v.

The Bakeshop Act regulated health conditions in bakeries and prohibited employees from working in bakeries for more than 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week. In 1899, Lochner was indicted on a charge that he violated Section 110 of Article 8, Chapter 415, of the Laws of 1897, as he had wrongfully and unlawfully permitted an employee working for him to work more than 60 hours in one week. He was fined $25 ({{Inflation|US|25|1897|fmt=eq|r=-2}}). For a second offense in 1901, Lochner drew a fine of $50 ({{Inflation|US|50|1897|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) from the Oneida County Court. Lochner appealed his second conviction. However, the conviction was upheld, 3\u20132, by the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court]]. He appealed again to the [[New York Court of Appeals]], New York's highest court, where he lost, 4\u20133. He then took his case to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nLochner's appeal was based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution: \"... nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" In a series of cases, the Supreme Court established that the Due Process Clause (found in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments) is not only a procedural guarantee, but also a substantive limitation on the type of control that the government may exercise over individuals. Although that interpretation of the due process clause is a controversial one (see [[substantive due process]]), it had become firmly embedded in American jurisprudence by the end of the 19th century. Lochner argued that the right to contract freely was one of the rights encompassed by substantive due process.\n\nScholars have noted that when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, 27 out of 37 state constitutions had Lockean Provisos, which typically said: \"All men are by nature free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring and possessing and protecting property: and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\" As such clauses were \"deeply rooted in American history and tradition,\" they likely informed the original meaning of the scope and nature of the fundamental rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment in the eyes of Lochner-era justices.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Calabresi |first1=Steven G. |last2=Agudo |first2=Sarah |title=Individual Rights Under State Constitutions When the Fourteenth Amendment Was Ratified in 1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition? |volume=87 |journal=Tex. L. Rev. |issue=7 |page=88 |year=2008<!--Note: http://www.texaslrev.com/ archives go back only to volume 91 as of May 2013-->}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court had accepted the argument that the due process clause protected the right to contract seven years earlier, in ''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' (1897). However, the Court had acknowledged that the right was not absolute, but subject to the [[police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] of the states. For example, in ''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'' (1898), the Supreme Court upheld a [[Utah]] law setting an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for [[mining|miners]]. In ''Holden'', Justice [[Henry Billings Brown|Henry Brown]] wrote that while \"the police power cannot be put forward as an excuse for oppressive and unjust legislation, it may be lawfully resorted to for the purpose of preserving the public health, safety, or morals.\" The issue facing the Supreme Court in ''Lochner'' was whether the Bakeshop Act represented a reasonable exercise of the state's police power.\n\nLochner's case was argued by Henry Weismann, who had been one of the foremost advocates of the Bakeshop Act when he was Secretary of the Journeymen Bakers' Union. In his [[brief (law)|brief]], Weismann decried the idea that \"the treasured freedom of the individual ... should be swept away under the guise of the police power of the State.\" He denied New York's argument that the Bakeshop Act was a necessary health measure by claiming that the \"average bakery of the present day is well ventilated, comfortable both summer and winter, and always sweet smelling.\" Weismann's brief contained an appendix providing statistics showing that bakers' mortality rates were comparable to that of white-collar professionals.\n\n==Judgment==\nThe Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that the law limiting bakers' working hours did not constitute a legitimate exercise of state police powers, so it was unconstitutional. It argued for [[freedom of contract]], and that [[unequal bargaining power]] was irrelevant. The opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice [[Rufus Peckham]]. Lochner did not have to pay the fine.\n\n===Harlan's dissent===\nJustice [[John Marshall Harlan]] wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices [[Edward Douglass White]] and [[William R. Day]]. Harlan contended that the liberty to contract is subject to regulation imposed by a state acting within the scope of its police powers. Harlan offered the following rule for determining whether such statutes are unconstitutional:\n\n{{quote|The power of the courts to review legislative action in respect of a matter affecting the general welfare exists only \"when that which the legislature has done comes within the rule that, if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.\"}}\n\nHarlan asserted that the burden of proof should rest with the party seeking to have such a statute deemed unconstitutional.\n\nHarlan's dissent argued that the Court gave insufficient weight to the state's argument that the law was a valid health measure addressing a legitimate state interest. Harlan contended that it was \"plain that this statute was enacted to protect the physical well-being of those who work in bakery and confectionery establishments.\" Responding to the majority's assertion that the profession of a baker was not an unhealthy one, he quoted at length from academic studies describing the respiratory ailments and other risks that bakers faced. He argued that the Supreme Court should have deferred to the New York Legislature's judgment that long working hours threatened the health of bakery employees. According to Harlan, \"If the end which the legislature seeks to accomplish be one to which its power extends, and if the means employed to that end, although not the wisest or best, are yet not plainly and palpably unauthorized by law, then the court cannot interfere.\"\n\n===Holmes' dissent===\nJustice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote three paragraphs accusing the majority of [[judicial activism]], claiming the case was \"decided upon an economic theory which a large part of the country does not entertain.\" He did not agree that the Fourteenth Amendment enshrined liberty of contract, citing laws against [[Sunday shopping|Sunday trading]] and [[usury]] as \"ancient examples\" to the contrary: \"The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''[[Social Statics]]''\" (a book advocating strict ''[[laissez faire]]'' philosophy). He emphasized that \"a constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory.\"\n\n==Significance and legacy==\n{{main|Lochner era}}\n{{quotebox |width=30% |quote=The case is famous because there is virtually universal agreement among judges and scholars that it was incorrectly decided. More important, it is the case in which Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the most influential dissenting opinion in the Court's history.|source= \u2014Retired Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], writing in 2011.<ref>{{cite book |title=Five Chiefs: A Supreme Court Memoir |first=John Paul |last=Stevens |authorlink=John Paul Stevens |date=2011 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |isbn=978-0-316-19980-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fivechiefssuprem00stev/page/25 25] |url=https://archive.org/details/fivechiefssuprem00stev/page/25 }}.</ref>}}\n\nThe Supreme Court's due process jurisprudence over the next three decades was inconsistent, but it took a narrow view of states' police powers in several major labor cases after ''Lochner''. For example, in ''[[Coppage v. Kansas]]'' (1915), the Court struck down statutes forbidding \"[[yellow-dog contract]]s.\" Similarly, in ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'' (1923), the Supreme Court held that [[minimum wage]] laws violated the due process clause, but Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] strongly dissented, suggesting that the Court instead should have overruled ''Lochner''. The doctrine of substantive due process was coupled with a narrow interpretation of congressional power under the [[commerce clause]]. Justices [[James Clark McReynolds|James McReynolds]], [[George Sutherland]], [[Willis Van Devanter]], and [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]] emerged during the 1920s and 1930s as the foremost defenders of traditional limitations on government power on the Supreme Court, so were collectively dubbed by partisans of the New Deal the \"[[Four Horsemen (Supreme Court)|Four Horsemen of Reaction]].\" All four believed in ''[[laissez faire]]'' economics.\n\nIn 1934, the Supreme Court decided ''[[Nebbia v. New York]]'' stating that  no constitutional fundamental right to freedom of contract exists. In 1937, the Supreme Court decided ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'', which expressly overruled ''Adkins'' and implicitly signaled the end of the ''Lochner'' era by repudiating the idea that freedom of contract should be unrestricted.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court did not explicitly overrule ''Lochner'',<ref name=\"ABA Not explicitly overruled\">{{cite web|last1=Quimbee|title=SCOTUS shifts from workers protections starting with Lochner v. New York|url=http://abaforlawstudents.com/2016/07/08/quimbee-case-week/|website=American Bar Association for Students|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}</ref> it agreed to give more deference to the decisions of state legislatures. The Court sounded the death knell for economic substantive due process several years later in ''[[Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma]]'' (1955). In that case, a unanimous Supreme Court declared, \"The day is gone when this Court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.\"\n\nComing at a time of mounting political pressure over the judiciary's stance toward the New Deal, the Court's shift is sometimes called \"[[the switch in time that saved nine]].\"\n\n===Modern substantive due process===\nIn the post-''Lochner'' era, the Supreme Court has applied a lower standard of review to confront restrictions on economic liberty. A higher standard is used in reviewing legislation infringing on personal liberties. A line of cases dating back to the 1923 opinion by Justice McReynolds in ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'', citing Lochner as establishing limits on the police power, has established a privacy right under substantive due process. More recently, in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973), the Supreme Court held that women have a privacy right to determine whether or not to have an abortion. In 1992, ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' reaffirmed that right, but the Court no longer used the term \"privacy\" to describe it.\n\n===Scholarly reaction===\nThe Supreme Court's decision in ''Lochner v. New York'' has been criticized by legal scholars. Law professor [[Bernard Siegan]] described it as \"one of the most condemned cases in United States history.\"<ref name=Siegan>{{cite book |first=Bernard H. |last=Siegan |title=Economic Liberties and the Constitution |url=https://archive.org/details/economiclibertie0000sieg |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/economiclibertie0000sieg/page/23 23] |year=1980 |publisher=Univ of Chicago Pr |isbn=978-0226756639}}, cited in {{cite book |title=Constitutional Law |last1=Stone |first1=Geoffrey R |edition=6th |year=2009 |publisher=Aspen Publishers |page=744 |isbn=978-0735577190|display-authors=etal}}</ref> According to the [[Center for American Progress]], a left-leaning think tank, law professors often use ''Lochner'', along with ''[[Plessy v.

from country to country. Most countries allow at least some form of pornography. In some countries, softcore pornography is considered tame enough to be sold in general stores or to be shown on TV. [[Hardcore pornography]], on the other hand, is usually regulated. The production and sale, and to a slightly lesser degree the possession, of [[child pornography]] is illegal in almost all countries, and some countries have restrictions on pornography depicting violence, for example [[rape pornography]] or [[animal pornography]].\n\n[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pornographic entertainment on display in a [[sex shop]] window, where there is usually a minimum age to go into pornographic stores]]\nMost countries attempt to restrict minors' access to hardcore materials, limiting availability to [[sex shop]]s, mail-order, and television channels that parents can restrict, among other means. There is usually an age minimum for entrance to pornographic stores, or the materials are displayed partly covered or not displayed at all. More generally, [[disseminating pornography to a minor]] is often illegal. Many of these efforts have been rendered practically irrelevant by widely available [[Internet pornography]]. A [[Child Online Protection Act|failed US law]] would have made these same restrictions apply to the internet.\n\nThe adult film industry regulations in California require that all actors and actresses practice safe sex using condoms. It is rare to see condom use in pornography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/adultfilmindustry.html|title=Safety in the Adult Film Industry|website=www.dir.ca.gov|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> Since porn does better when actors are unprotected, many companies chose to film in other states. Miami is a major area for ammeter porn. Twitter also plays a big part in an actors success. Since Twitter doesn't censor their content, they can post what they want and doesn't have to worry about it getting taken down, unlike Instagram and Facebook.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/title/80038162|title=Hot Girls Wanted {{!}} Netflix Official Site|website=www.netflix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a person receiving unwanted [[direct marketing|commercial mail]] he or she deems pornographic (or otherwise offensive) may obtain a [[Prohibitory Order]], either against all mail from a particular sender, or against all sexually explicit mail, by applying to the [[United States Postal Service]]. There are recurring [[urban legend]]s of [[snuff film|snuff movies]], in which murders are filmed for pornographic purposes.

In those countries, any film or photo with a child subject in a sexual act is considered pornography and illegal.\n\nPornography can infringe into basic [[human rights]] of those involved, especially when [[sexual consent]] was not obtained. For example, [[revenge porn]] is a phenomenon where disgruntled sexual partners release images or video footage of intimate sexual activity, usually on the internet, without authorization from the other person.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salter|first=Michael|year=2013|title=Responding to revenge porn: Gender, justice and online legal impunity|url=https://www.academia.edu/4585975|journal=Presented at \"whose Justice?

Pornography featuring heterosexual acts composes the bulk of pornography and is \"centred and invisible\", marking the industry as heteronormative.

Certainly, mainstream heteroporn makes up the main bulk of the genre, and is most easily accessible. As stated above, this style of porn includes highly formulaic displays of paired or group sex, enacted by bodies exhibiting a conventional gendered aesthetic, moving through various sexual positions and penetrations. Nonetheless, some forms of porn are more normative than others, and indeed not all forms of heteroporn are normative, such as 'rimming', girl on boy strap-on anal sex, and hard-core BDSM. Pornography also includes an endless array of different kinds of fetish, 'fat' porn, amateur porn, disabled porn, porn produced by women, queer porn, BDSM and body modification. The list of non- mainstream porn is endless and displays bodies, gender scenarios and sexual activity differently to heteronormative formulations of mainstream heteroporn.}}</ref>\n\nPornography can be classified according to the physical characteristics of the participants, fetish, sexual orientation, etc., as well as the types of sexual activity featured. Reality and voyeur pornography, [[animation|animated]] videos, and legally prohibited acts also influence the classification of pornography. Pornography may fall into more than one genre. The genres of pornography are based on the type of activity featured and the category of participants, for example:\n* [[Alt porn]]\n* [[Amateur pornography]]\n* [[Bondage pornography]]\n* [[Ethnic pornography]]\n* [[Sexual fetishism|Fetish pornography]]\n* [[Group sex]]\n* [[Reality pornography]]\n* [[Porn parody]]\n* [[Sexual orientation|Sexual-orientation]]-based pornography\n** Straight porn\n** [[Gay pornography]]\n** [[Lesbian pornography]]\n** [[Bisexual pornography]]\n\n==Commercialism==\n\n===Economics===\n{{Main|Sex industry}}\nRevenues of the adult industry in the United States are difficult to determine.

Most countries allow at least some form of pornography. In some countries, softcore pornography is considered tame enough to be sold in general stores or to be shown on TV. [[Hardcore pornography]], on the other hand, is usually regulated. The production and sale, and to a slightly lesser degree the possession, of [[child pornography]] is illegal in almost all countries, and some countries have restrictions on pornography depicting violence, for example [[rape pornography]] or [[animal pornography]].\n\n[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pornographic entertainment on display in a [[sex shop]] window, where there is usually a minimum age to go into pornographic stores]]\nMost countries attempt to restrict minors' access to hardcore materials, limiting availability to [[sex shop]]s, mail-order, and television channels that parents can restrict, among other means. There is usually an age minimum for entrance to pornographic stores, or the materials are displayed partly covered or not displayed at all. More generally, [[disseminating pornography to a minor]] is often illegal. Many of these efforts have been rendered practically irrelevant by widely available [[Internet pornography]]. A [[Child Online Protection Act|failed US law]] would have made these same restrictions apply to the internet.\n\nIn the United States, a person receiving unwanted [[direct marketing|commercial mail]] he or she deems pornographic (or otherwise offensive) may obtain a [[Prohibitory Order]], either against all mail from a particular sender, or against all sexually explicit mail, by applying to the [[United States Postal Service]]. There are recurring [[urban legend]]s of [[snuff film|snuff movies]], in which murders are filmed for pornographic purposes. Despite extensive work to ascertain the truth of these rumors, law enforcement officials have not found any such works.\n\nSome people, including pornography producer [[Larry Flynt]] and the writer [[Salman Rushdie]],<ref name=\"TimesRushdie\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article466971.ece|title=Porn is vital to freedom, says Rushdie|accessdate=8 November 2007|last1=Baxter|first1=Sarah|last2=Brooks|first2=Richard|date=8 August 2004|work=The Times|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5TD5Q8UAz?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article466971.ece|archivedate=9 November 2007|quote=Pornography exists everywhere, of course, but when it comes into societies in which it's difficult for young men and women to get together and do what young men and women often like doing, it satisfies a more general need{{nbsp}}...

In those countries, any film or photo with a child subject in a sexual act is considered pornography and illegal.\n\nPornography can infringe into basic [[human rights]] of those involved, especially when [[sexual consent]] was not obtained.
