In [[Cleveland]], Leonard met Emilie Krause, an ethnic German, who had emigrated from [[Danzig]], [[Prussia]] (today [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]]).

The poet's father was German-American and a sergeant in the [[United States Army]] serving in Germany following Germany's defeat in 1918.<ref name=\"Miles\" /> He had an affair with Katharina, a German friend's sister, and she became pregnant.

Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life, p. 8</ref> Afterwards, Henry Bukowski became a building contractor, set to make great financial gains in the aftermath of the war, and after two years moved the family to Pfaffendorf (today part of [[Koblenz]]). However, given the crippling reparations being required of Germany, which led to a stagnant economy and high levels of inflation, Henry Bukowski was unable to make a living, so he decided to move the family to the United States. On April 23, 1923, they sailed from [[Bremerhaven]] to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where they settled.\n\nThe family moved to [[Mid-City, Los Angeles]], US <ref>https://la.curbed.com/2015/5/26/9956946/charles-bukowski-childhood-home</ref> in 1930, the city where Charles Bukowski's father and grandfather had previously worked and lived.<ref name=\"Miles\" /><ref name=Sounes8 /> Young Charles spoke English with a strong German accent and was taunted by his childhood playmates with the epithet \"Heini,\" German diminutive of Heinrich, in his early youth. In the 1930s the poet's father was often unemployed. In the autobiographical ''[[Ham on Rye]]'' Charles Bukowski says that, with his mother's acquiescence, his father was frequently abusive, both physically and mentally, beating his son for the smallest imagined offense.<ref name=\"hor\">{{cite book|last=Bukowski|first=Charles|title=Ham on Rye|year=1982|publisher=Ecco|isbn=0-06-117758-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hamonryenovel0000buko}}</ref><ref name=\"Found\">{{cite web|last=Young |first=Molly |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/charles-bukowski |title=Poetry Foundation of America.

In ''Bukowski: Born Into This'', a 2003 film, Bukowski states that his father beat him with a [[razor strop]] three times a week from the ages of six to 11 years. He says that it helped his writing, as he came to understand undeserved pain. The depression bolstered his rage as he grew, and gave him much of his voice and material for his writings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Bukowski 1920\u201394|publisher=Routlage}}</ref>{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn his early teen years, Bukowski had an epiphany when he was introduced to alcohol by his loyal friend William \"Baldy\" Mullinax, depicted as \"Eli LaCrosse\" in ''Ham on Rye'', son of an alcoholic surgeon. \"This [alcohol] is going to help me for a very long time,\" he later wrote, describing a method (drinking) he could use to come to more amicable terms with his own life.<ref name=\"hor\" /> After graduating from [[Los Angeles High School]], Bukowski attended [[Los Angeles City College]] for two years, taking courses in art, journalism, and literature, before quitting at the start of [[World War II]]. He then moved to [[New York City|New York]] to begin a career as a financially pinched blue-collar worker with dreams of becoming a writer.<ref name=\"Found\" />\n\nOn July 22, 1944, with World War II ongoing, Bukowski was arrested by [[F.B.I.]] agents in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], where he lived at the time, on suspicion of [[draft evasion]]. His German birth was troubling at a time when the United States was at war with Germany and many Germans and German-Americans in the United States were suspected of disloyalty. He was held for 17 days in Philadelphia's [[Moyamensing Prison]]. Sixteen days later, he failed a psychological examination that was part of his mandatory military entrance physical test and was given a [[Selective Service]] Classification of [[Class 1-A|4-F]] (unfit for military service).\n\n=== Early writing ===\nWhen Bukowski was 24, his short story \"Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip\" was published in ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine. Two years later, another short story, \"20 Tanks from Kasseldown\", was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in Issue III of ''[[Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly]]'', a limited-run, loose-leaf broadside collection printed in 1946 and edited by [[Caresse Crosby]]. Failing to break into the literary world, Bukowski grew disillusioned with the publication process and quit writing for almost a decade, a time that he referred to as a \"ten-year drunk\". These \"lost years\" formed the basis for his later semiautobiographical chronicles, and there are fictionalized versions of Bukowski's life through his highly stylized alter-ego, Henry Chinaski.<ref name=\"Bukowski, Charles\" />\n\nDuring part of this period he continued living in Los Angeles, working at a pickle factory for a short time but also spending some time roaming about the United States, working sporadically and staying in cheap [[rooming house]]s.<ref name=Miles />\n\nIn the early 1950s, Bukowski took a job as a fill-in [[letter carrier]] with the [[United States Post Office Department]] in Los Angeles, but resigned just before he reached three years' service.\n\nIn 1955 he was treated for a near-fatal bleeding ulcer. After leaving the hospital he began to write poetry.<ref name=Miles /> In 1955 he agreed to marry small-town Texas poet Barbara Frye, but they divorced in 1958. According to [[Howard Sounes]]'s ''[[Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life]]'', she later died under mysterious circumstances in [[India]]. Following his divorce, Bukowski resumed drinking and continued writing poetry.<ref name=\"Miles\" />\n\nSeveral of his poems were published in the late 1950s in ''Gallows'', a small poetry magazine published briefly (the magazine lasted for two issues) by Jon Griffith.<ref>''\"Sheaf, Hearse, Coffin, Poetry NOW\"'' by E.V. Griffith (Hearse Press, 1996), pp. 23</ref>\n\nThe small ''[[avant-garde]]'' [[literary magazine]] ''[[Nomad (magazine)|Nomad]]'', published by [[Anthony Linick]] and Donald Factor (the son of [[Max Factor Jr.]]), offered a home to Bukowski's early work. ''Nomad''{{'}}s inaugural issue in 1959 featured two of his poems. A year later, ''Nomad'' published one of Bukowski's best known essays, ''Manifesto: A Call for Our Own Critics''.<ref>Debritto (2013), p.90.</ref>\n\n=== 1960s ===\nBy 1960, Bukowski had returned to the post office in Los Angeles where he began work as a letter filing clerk, a position he held for more than a decade. In 1962, he was distraught over the death of Jane Cooney Baker, his first serious girlfriend. Bukowski turned his inner devastation into a series of poems and stories lamenting her death. In 1964 a daughter, Marina Louise Bukowski, was born to Bukowski and his live-in girlfriend [[FrancEyE|Frances Smith]], whom he referred to as a \"white-haired [[hippie]]\", \"shack-job\", and \"old snaggle-tooth\".<ref>Bukowski, Charles ''Run with the hunted: a Charles Bukowski reader'', Edited by John Martin (Ecco, 2003), pp. 363-365</ref>\n\nE.V. Griffith, editor of Hearse Press, published Bukowski's first separately printed publication, a broadside titled \u201cHis Wife, the Painter,\u201d in June 1960. This event was followed by Hearse Press's publication of \u201cFlower, Fist and Bestial Wail,\u201d Bukowski's first [[chapbook]] of poems, in October, 1960.\n[[File:Bukowski Court, 5124 DeLongpre Avenue, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|5124 DeLongpre Avenue, Los Angeles, now Bukowski Court, where Bukowski resided from 1963 to 1972]]\n\u201cHis Wife, the Painter\u201d and three other broadsides (\u201cThe Paper on the Floor\u201d, \u201cThe Old Man on the Corner\u201d and \u201cWaste Basket\u201d) formed the centerpiece of Hearse Press's \u201cCoffin 1,\u201d an innovative small-poetry publication consisting of a pocketed folder containing 42 broadsides and lithographs which was published in 1964. Hearse Press continued to publish poems by Bukowski through the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s.<ref>''\"Sheaf, Hearse, Coffin, Poetry NOW\"'' by E.V. Griffith (Hearse Press, 1996), pp. 30, 32</ref>\n\nJon and Louise Webb, publishers of ''[[The Outsider (magazine)|The Outsider]]'' literary magazine, featured some of Bukowski's poetry in its pages. Under the Loujon Press imprint, the Webbs published Bukowski's ''It Catches My Heart in Its Hands'' in 1963 and ''Crucifix in a Deathhand'' in 1965.\n\nBeginning in 1967, Bukowski wrote the column \"[[Notes of a Dirty Old Man]]\" for Los Angeles' ''[[Open City (newspaper)|Open City]]'', an underground newspaper. When ''Open City'' was shut down in 1969, the column was picked up by the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' as well as the hippie underground paper ''[[NOLA Express]]'' in [[New Orleans]]. In 1969 Bukowski and [[Neeli Cherkovski]] launched their own short-lived [[mimeograph]]ed literary magazine, ''[[Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns]]''. They produced three issues over the next two years.\n\n=== Black Sparrow years ===\nIn 1969 Bukowski accepted an offer from legendary [[Black Sparrow Press]] publisher [[John Martin (publisher)|John Martin]] and quit his post office job to dedicate himself to full-time writing. He was then 49 years old. As he explained in a letter at the time, \"I have one of two choices \u2013 stay in the post office and go crazy ... or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.\"<ref name=buktro>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaydougherty.com/bukowski/index.html |title=''Introduction to Charles Bukowski'' by Jay Dougherty |publisher=Jaydougherty.com |date=1920-08-16 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref> Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, ''[[Post Office (novel)|Post Office]]''. As a measure of respect for Martin's financial support and faith in a relatively unknown writer, Bukowski published almost all of his subsequent major works with Black Sparrow Press, which became a highly successful enterprise owing to Martin's business acumen and editorial skills.  An avid supporter of small independent presses, Bukowski continued to submit poems and short stories to innumerable small publications throughout his career.<ref name=\"Found\" />\n\nBukowski embarked on a series of love affairs and one-night trysts. One of these relationships was with [[Linda King]], a poet and sculptress. Critic [[Robert Peters (playwright)|Robert Peters]] reported seeing the poet as actor in Linda King's play ''Only a Tenant'', in which she and Bukowski stage-read the first act at the Pasadena Museum of the Artist. This was a one-off performance of what was a shambolic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/criticism/bukowski-charles-19201994/11/|title=Charles Bukowski \u2013 Criticism|work=[[BookRags]]}}</ref> His other affairs were with a recording executive and a twenty-three-year-old redhead; he wrote a book of poetry as a tribute to his love for the latter, titled, \"Scarlet\" (Black Sparrow Press, 1976). His various affairs and relationships provided material for his stories and poems. Another important relationship was with \"Tanya\", pseudonym of \"Amber O'Neil\" (also a pseudonym), described in Bukowski's \"Women\" as a pen-pal that evolved into a week-end tryst at Bukowski's residence in Los Angeles in the 1970s. \"Amber O'Neil\" later self-published a chapbook about the affair entitled \"Blowing My Hero\".<ref>Sounes, Howard. ''Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life''. Grove Press, 1998. 275.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Bukowski met Linda Lee Beighle, a health food restaurant owner, rock-and-roll groupie, aspiring actress, heiress to a small Philadelphia \"Main Line\" fortune and devotee of [[Meher Baba]]. Two years later Bukowski moved from the East [[Hollywood]] area, where he had lived for most of his life, to the harborside community of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]],<ref>Ciotti, Paul.

Beighle followed him and they lived together intermittently over the next two years.

Beighle is referred to as \"Sara\" in Bukowski's novels ''[[Women (Bukowski novel)|Women]]'' and ''[[Hollywood (Bukowski novel)|Hollywood]]''.\n\nIn May, 1978, he returned to Germany and gave a live poetry reading of his work before an audience in [[Hamburg]]. This was released as a double 12\" L.P. stereo record titled \"CHARLES BUKOWSKI 'Hello.

The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, were conducted by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in [[Rancho Palos Verdes]]. An account of the proceedings can be found in [[Gerald Locklin]]'s book ''Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet''. His gravestone reads: \"Don't Try\", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to [[John William Corrington]]: \"Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: ''not'' to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or, if you like its looks, you make a pet out of it.\"\n\nBukowski was an atheist.<ref>\"For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command or faith a dictum. I am my own God. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state and our education system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.\"--Charles Bukowski, Life (magazine), December 1988, quoted from James A. Haught, ed, ''2000 Years of Disbelief''.</ref>\n\nBukowski's work was subject to controversy throughout his career, and [[Hugh Fox]] claimed that his sexism in poetry, at least in part, translated into his life. In 1969, Fox published the first critical study of Bukowski in [[North American Review|The North American Review]], and mentioned Bukowski's attitude toward women: \"When women are around, he has to play Man. In a way it's the same kind of 'pose' he plays at in his poetry\u2014[[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]], [[Erich von Stroheim|Eric Von Stroheim]].

Copies of all editions of his work published by the Black Sparrow Press are held at [[Western Michigan University]], which purchased the archive of the publishing house after its closure in 2003.\n\n[[Ecco Press]] continues to release new collections of his poetry, culled from the thousands of works published in small literary magazines.

In a 1974 interview he said, \"You live in a town all your life, and you get to know every bitch on the street corner and half of them you have already messed around with. You've got the layout of the whole land. You have a picture of where you are.... Since I was raised in L.A., I've always had the geographical and spiritual feeling of being here. I've had time to learn this city. I can't see any other place than L.A.\"<ref name=buktro />\n\nBukowski also performed live readings of his works, beginning in 1962 on radio station [[KPFK]] in Los Angeles and increasing in frequency through the 1970s.

However, given the crippling reparations being required of Germany, which led to a stagnant economy and high levels of inflation, Henry Bukowski was unable to make a living, so he decided to move the family to the United States. On April 23, 1923, they sailed from [[Bremerhaven]] to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where they settled.\n\nThe family moved to [[Mid-City, Los Angeles]], US <ref>https://la.curbed.com/2015/5/26/9956946/charles-bukowski-childhood-home</ref> in 1930, the city where Charles Bukowski's father and grandfather had previously worked and lived.<ref name=\"Miles\" /><ref name=Sounes8 /> Young Charles spoke English with a strong German accent and was taunted by his childhood playmates with the epithet \"Heini,\" German diminutive of Heinrich, in his early youth. In the 1930s the poet's father was often unemployed. In the autobiographical ''[[Ham on Rye]]'' Charles Bukowski says that, with his mother's acquiescence, his father was frequently abusive, both physically and mentally, beating his son for the smallest imagined offense.<ref name=\"hor\">{{cite book|last=Bukowski|first=Charles|title=Ham on Rye|year=1982|publisher=Ecco|isbn=0-06-117758-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hamonryenovel0000buko}}</ref><ref name=\"Found\">{{cite web|last=Young |first=Molly |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/charles-bukowski |title=Poetry Foundation of America.

In ''Bukowski: Born Into This'', a 2003 film, Bukowski states that his father beat him with a [[razor strop]] three times a week from the ages of six to 11 years. He says that it helped his writing, as he came to understand undeserved pain. The depression bolstered his rage as he grew, and gave him much of his voice and material for his writings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Bukowski 1920\u201394|publisher=Routlage}}</ref>{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn his early teen years, Bukowski had an epiphany when he was introduced to alcohol by his loyal friend William \"Baldy\" Mullinax, depicted as \"Eli LaCrosse\" in ''Ham on Rye'', son of an alcoholic surgeon. \"This [alcohol] is going to help me for a very long time,\" he later wrote, describing a method (drinking) he could use to come to more amicable terms with his own life.<ref name=\"hor\" /> After graduating from [[Los Angeles High School]], Bukowski attended [[Los Angeles City College]] for two years, taking courses in art, journalism, and literature, before quitting at the start of [[World War II]]. He then moved to [[New York City|New York]] to begin a career as a financially pinched blue-collar worker with dreams of becoming a writer.<ref name=\"Found\" />\n\nOn July 22, 1944, with World War II ongoing, Bukowski was arrested by [[F.B.I.]] agents in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], where he lived at the time, on suspicion of [[draft evasion]]. His German birth was troubling at a time when the United States was at war with Germany and many Germans and German-Americans in the United States were suspected of disloyalty. He was held for 17 days in Philadelphia's [[Moyamensing Prison]]. Sixteen days later, he failed a psychological examination that was part of his mandatory military entrance physical test and was given a [[Selective Service]] Classification of [[Class 1-A|4-F]] (unfit for military service).\n\n=== Early writing ===\nWhen Bukowski was 24, his short story \"Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip\" was published in ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine. Two years later, another short story, \"20 Tanks from Kasseldown\", was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in Issue III of ''[[Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly]]'', a limited-run, loose-leaf broadside collection printed in 1946 and edited by [[Caresse Crosby]]. Failing to break into the literary world, Bukowski grew disillusioned with the publication process and quit writing for almost a decade, a time that he referred to as a \"ten-year drunk\". These \"lost years\" formed the basis for his later semiautobiographical chronicles, and there are fictionalized versions of Bukowski's life through his highly stylized alter-ego, Henry Chinaski.<ref name=\"Bukowski, Charles\" />\n\nDuring part of this period he continued living in Los Angeles, working at a pickle factory for a short time but also spending some time roaming about the United States, working sporadically and staying in cheap [[rooming house]]s.<ref name=Miles />\n\nIn the early 1950s, Bukowski took a job as a fill-in [[letter carrier]] with the [[United States Post Office Department]] in Los Angeles, but resigned just before he reached three years' service.\n\nIn 1955 he was treated for a near-fatal bleeding ulcer. After leaving the hospital he began to write poetry.<ref name=Miles /> In 1955 he agreed to marry small-town Texas poet Barbara Frye, but they divorced in 1958. According to [[Howard Sounes]]'s ''[[Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life]]'', she later died under mysterious circumstances in [[India]]. Following his divorce, Bukowski resumed drinking and continued writing poetry.<ref name=\"Miles\" />\n\nSeveral of his poems were published in the late 1950s in ''Gallows'', a small poetry magazine published briefly (the magazine lasted for two issues) by Jon Griffith.<ref>''\"Sheaf, Hearse, Coffin, Poetry NOW\"'' by E.V. Griffith (Hearse Press, 1996), pp. 23</ref>\n\nThe small ''[[avant-garde]]'' [[literary magazine]] ''[[Nomad (magazine)|Nomad]]'', published by [[Anthony Linick]] and Donald Factor (the son of [[Max Factor Jr.]]), offered a home to Bukowski's early work. ''Nomad''{{'}}s inaugural issue in 1959 featured two of his poems. A year later, ''Nomad'' published one of Bukowski's best known essays, ''Manifesto: A Call for Our Own Critics''.<ref>Debritto (2013), p.90.</ref>\n\n=== 1960s ===\nBy 1960, Bukowski had returned to the post office in Los Angeles where he began work as a letter filing clerk, a position he held for more than a decade. In 1962, he was distraught over the death of Jane Cooney Baker, his first serious girlfriend. Bukowski turned his inner devastation into a series of poems and stories lamenting her death. In 1964 a daughter, Marina Louise Bukowski, was born to Bukowski and his live-in girlfriend [[FrancEyE|Frances Smith]], whom he referred to as a \"white-haired [[hippie]]\", \"shack-job\", and \"old snaggle-tooth\".<ref>Bukowski, Charles ''Run with the hunted: a Charles Bukowski reader'', Edited by John Martin (Ecco, 2003), pp. 363-365</ref>\n\nE.V. Griffith, editor of Hearse Press, published Bukowski's first separately printed publication, a broadside titled \u201cHis Wife, the Painter,\u201d in June 1960. This event was followed by Hearse Press's publication of \u201cFlower, Fist and Bestial Wail,\u201d Bukowski's first [[chapbook]] of poems, in October, 1960.\n[[File:Bukowski Court, 5124 DeLongpre Avenue, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|5124 DeLongpre Avenue, Los Angeles, now Bukowski Court, where Bukowski resided from 1963 to 1972]]\n\u201cHis Wife, the Painter\u201d and three other broadsides (\u201cThe Paper on the Floor\u201d, \u201cThe Old Man on the Corner\u201d and \u201cWaste Basket\u201d) formed the centerpiece of Hearse Press's \u201cCoffin 1,\u201d an innovative small-poetry publication consisting of a pocketed folder containing 42 broadsides and lithographs which was published in 1964. Hearse Press continued to publish poems by Bukowski through the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s.<ref>''\"Sheaf, Hearse, Coffin, Poetry NOW\"'' by E.V. Griffith (Hearse Press, 1996), pp. 30, 32</ref>\n\nJon and Louise Webb, publishers of ''[[The Outsider (magazine)|The Outsider]]'' literary magazine, featured some of Bukowski's poetry in its pages. Under the Loujon Press imprint, the Webbs published Bukowski's ''It Catches My Heart in Its Hands'' in 1963 and ''Crucifix in a Deathhand'' in 1965.\n\nBeginning in 1967, Bukowski wrote the column \"[[Notes of a Dirty Old Man]]\" for Los Angeles' ''[[Open City (newspaper)|Open City]]'', an underground newspaper. When ''Open City'' was shut down in 1969, the column was picked up by the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' as well as the hippie underground paper ''[[NOLA Express]]'' in [[New Orleans]]. In 1969 Bukowski and [[Neeli Cherkovski]] launched their own short-lived [[mimeograph]]ed literary magazine, ''[[Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns]]''. They produced three issues over the next two years.\n\n=== Black Sparrow years ===\nIn 1969 Bukowski accepted an offer from legendary [[Black Sparrow Press]] publisher [[John Martin (publisher)|John Martin]] and quit his post office job to dedicate himself to full-time writing. He was then 49 years old. As he explained in a letter at the time, \"I have one of two choices \u2013 stay in the post office and go crazy ... or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.\"<ref name=buktro>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaydougherty.com/bukowski/index.html |title=''Introduction to Charles Bukowski'' by Jay Dougherty |publisher=Jaydougherty.com |date=1920-08-16 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref> Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, ''[[Post Office (novel)|Post Office]]''. As a measure of respect for Martin's financial support and faith in a relatively unknown writer, Bukowski published almost all of his subsequent major works with Black Sparrow Press, which became a highly successful enterprise owing to Martin's business acumen and editorial skills.  An avid supporter of small independent presses, Bukowski continued to submit poems and short stories to innumerable small publications throughout his career.<ref name=\"Found\" />\n\nBukowski embarked on a series of love affairs and one-night trysts. One of these relationships was with [[Linda King]], a poet and sculptress. Critic [[Robert Peters]] reported seeing the poet as actor in Linda King's play ''Only a Tenant'', in which she and Bukowski stage-read the first act at the Pasadena Museum of the Artist. This was a one-off performance of what was a shambolic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/criticism/bukowski-charles-19201994/11/|title=Charles Bukowski \u2013 Criticism|work=[[BookRags]]}}</ref> His other affairs were with a recording executive and a twenty-three-year-old redhead; he wrote a book of poetry as a tribute to his love for the latter, titled, \"Scarlet\" (Black Sparrow Press, 1976). His various affairs and relationships provided material for his stories and poems. Another important relationship was with \"Tanya\", pseudonym of \"Amber O'Neil\" (also a pseudonym), described in Bukowski's \"Women\" as a pen-pal that evolved into a week-end tryst at Bukowski's residence in Los Angeles in the 1970s. \"Amber O'Neil\" later self-published a chapbook about the affair entitled \"Blowing My Hero\".<ref>Sounes, Howard. ''Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life''. Grove Press, 1998. 275.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Bukowski met Linda Lee Beighle, a health food restaurant owner, rock-and-roll groupie, aspiring actress, heiress to a small Philadelphia \"Main Line\" fortune and devotee of [[Meher Baba]]. Two years later Bukowski moved from the East [[Hollywood]] area, where he had lived for most of his life, to the harborside community of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]],<ref>Ciotti, Paul.

Beighle followed him and they lived together intermittently over the next two years.

Beighle is referred to as \"Sara\" in Bukowski's novels ''[[Women (Bukowski novel)|Women]]'' and ''[[Hollywood (Bukowski novel)|Hollywood]]''.\n\nIn May, 1978, he returned to Germany and gave a live poetry reading of his work before an audience in [[Hamburg]]. This was released as a double 12\" L.P. stereo record titled \"CHARLES BUKOWSKI 'Hello.

The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, were conducted by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in [[Rancho Palos Verdes]]. An account of the proceedings can be found in [[Gerald Locklin]]'s book ''Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet''. His gravestone reads: \"Don't Try\", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to [[John William Corrington]]: \"Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: ''not'' to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or, if you like its looks, you make a pet out of it.\"\n\nBukowski was an atheist.<ref>\"For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command or faith a dictum. I am my own God. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state and our education system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.\"--Charles Bukowski, Life (magazine), December 1988, quoted from James A. Haught, ed, ''2000 Years of Disbelief''.</ref>\n\nBukowski's work was subject to controversy throughout his career, and [[Hugh Fox]] claimed that his sexism in poetry, at least in part, translated into his life. In 1969, Fox published the first critical study of Bukowski in [[North American Review|The North American Review]], and mentioned Bukowski's attitude toward women: \"When women are around, he has to play Man.

In a 1974 interview he said, \"You live in a town all your life, and you get to know every bitch on the street corner and half of them you have already messed around with. You've got the layout of the whole land. You have a picture of where you are.... Since I was raised in L.A., I've always had the geographical and spiritual feeling of being here.

{"title_page": "Thoroughbred (series)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n[[Image:Thoroughbred 01 cover.jpg|thumb|right|''A Horse Called Wonder'', the first book in ''Thoroughbred'' series, was published in 1991]]\n'''''Thoroughbred''''' is a series of young-adult novels that revolves around [[Kentucky]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racing]] and [[equestrianism]]. The series was started in 1991 by Joanna Campbell (better known as Jo Ann Simon, previously Haessig), and numbered 72 books, in addition to several \"super editions\" and a spin-off series, ''Ashleigh'', by the time it ended in 2005. The series focuses on a group of core characters, primarily Ashleigh Griffen, Samantha McLean, Cindy Blake/McLean and Ashleigh's daughter Christina, as well as Christina's friends. The series originally followed the adventures of Ashleigh as she was growing up; when Ashleigh reached adulthood, the focus of the books shifted to young Samantha McLean. During Samantha's college and adult years, the books centered on Cindy Blake McLean, Samantha's adopted younger sister. Late in the series, there was a large \"time gap\" before the series focused on to a teenaged Christina and her cousin Melanie.\n\nThe books, which are intended for a primarily pre-teen, female audience, explore the characters' adventures in horse racing, [[eventing]], and [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]]. Christina and Melanie, the two main characters, are both [[jockey]]s, and many of the books deal with their challenges on and off the track: while their life with their horses comprises the main storyline, school, boyfriends, and family life often provide [[subplot]]s. The Reese family farm, Whitebrook, is the setting for most of the series.\n\n''Thoroughbred'' is published by [[HarperEntertainment]], an imprint of [[HarperCollins]]. A total of twelve different authors have contributed to the series over the fifteen years of its existence. There are currently over two million ''Thoroughbred'' books in print {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.\n\n== Structure of the books ==\nThe ''Thoroughbred'' series is written in the [[third-person narrative]] and is typically told from a single person's viewpoint. For the first twenty-three books, the series is told from the viewpoints of Ashleigh Griffen (#1 - #5), Samantha McLean (#6 - #12), and Cindy McLean (#13 - #23). After book twenty-three, the series started what was called the \"New Generation\" and skipped ten years to a new group of characters: Christina Reese, Melanie Graham, Parker Townsend, and a small group of minor characters. These books were still written in the third-person, but the viewpoints of characters would alternate between books.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{main|List of Thoroughbred novels}}\n\n=== The early books ===\n\nEarly on, the series primarily focuses on Ashleigh Griffen and her adventures at Townsend Acres, a racing and breeding farm owned by Clay Townsend.  Ashleigh's parents, Derek and Elaine Griffen, take over at the breeding area of Townsend Acres after their own farm, Edgardale, has to be sold because of a virus that spread around the farm and killed both mares and foals.  Ashleigh dislikes her new life at first, but becomes more accustomed to it after an older mare named Townsend Holly gives birth to a small filly whom she names Wonder.  Though Wonder is very weak and nearly dies multiple  times,  through Ashleigh's care, the filly grows up to be a Kentucky Derby and Belmont-winning racehorse.  After Ashleigh grows up, the plot is focused on Samantha McLean afterward.\n\n=== The new generation ===\nAfter book 23, ''Cindy's Honor'', the series skipped forward ten years and began anew with a focus on eventing. The new series involved Ashleigh Griffen's daughter, Christina, who traded Wonder's latest foal, Wonder's Legacy, for a racehorse, named Sterling Dream, which she turned into an eventer. After 12 books, the series quickly shifted from eventing back to racing due to popular demand from fans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nAfter Ashleigh's Wonder's death, Christina became attached to Wonder's last foal, Wonder's Star. From this point, the series retained a predominantly Thoroughbred-racing focus, leaving eventing to Parker Townsend, who became a regular part of the series soon after Wonder's death. The series then became focused on Christina and Melanie and their horses Wonder's Star, Perfect Image, and Hi Jinx.\n\n=== The last main character ===\nAllie Avery, the final main character of ''Thoroughbred'', was introduced at the very end of the series as the daughter of Craig and Jilly Avery; Craig and Jilly had been removed from the series early on, but were brought back to make the introduction of a new character possible. Allie was both interested in eventing and racing, bringing together the two disciplines in the ''Thoroughbred'' series, although she ultimately decided upon becoming a jockey. She is given Wonder's Legacy, the often-forgotten son of Ashleigh's Wonder, as a gift when she is fourteen.\n\nBy late 2005, the ''Thoroughbred'' series was officially ended. The last book of the series was ''Legacy's Gift'', a book centered on Allie and Wonder's Legacy, as well as the birth of Legacy's daughter, Allie's Wonder.

Clay Townsend then gives Ashleigh a half-interest in Wonder and all her foals, which then sets up a majority of plots in the early series as conflicts occur around the management and training of her offspring. She is the daughter of '''Townsend Holly''' and '''Townsend Pride''', half sister to '''Shining''' (through her sire) and the dam of six foals throughout the series '''Wonder's Pride''', '''Townsend Princess''', '''Mr. Wonderful''', '''Wonder's Champion''', '''Wonder's Legacy''' and '''Wonder's Star'''. She dies after complications of the birth of her last [[foal]].\n*'''Townsend Prince''', Wonder's half-brother and racing rival, he dies in an accident early in the series once Wonder has her first foals.\n*'''Fleet Goddess''', a filly by '''Battlecry'''. Fleet Goddess was the first horse that Ashleigh purchased and trained after Wonder had retired from racing. Fleet Goddess had a successful career, but also became well known as a successful broodmare, with her off-spring being featured as minor characters throughout the series, '''Fleeting Moment''', '''Precocious''', '''Limitless Time''', and '''Fleet Street'''.\n*'''Wonder's Pride''', Wonder's first colt, a very successful racehorse winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Breeder's Cup Classic. He retired from racing due to complications from a twisted intestine that nearly killed him in Book #10 Pride's Last Race.\n*'''Townsend Princess''', Wonder's first and only filly featured in the series, had a rough start. Injured early in her training by Lavinia Townsend, Princess was forced to spend months healing from a fractured cannon bone. She would later repeat the injury in the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] race and have to retire from racing at an early age. Princess is the dam of Wonder's first granddaughter '''Honor Bright''' (by Union Honour) who would feature as the main horse in Book #23.\n*'''Mr. Wonderful''', Wonder's second colt, often described as honey coloured, was not featured as a major character throughout the stories (Shining and Glory had arisen as more of the stars of Whitebrook). He injured a tendon in his two-year-old season. He won the Champagne Stakes in #18 Glory's Rival. He retired from racing due to a mysterious virus when he was four and was put up to stud alongside his older brother.\n*'''Shining''' Wonder's half-sister purchased at an auction by Mike Reese in Book #11, was given to Samantha McLean as a gift due to her involvement nursing the abused and neglected filly back to health. Shining became the star racer of Whitebrook Farm winning several stakes races including the Breeder's Cup Distaff (#18 Glory's Rival).

A half-interest in Glory was given to the Townsends in order to keep Champion training at Whitebrook (Book 18 Glory's Rival.) Glory was the subject of a scandal as a fellow trainer and veterinarian tried to drug and kill him in #16 Glory in Danger. Glory won the Breeder's Cup Classic by 30 lengths setting a new world record in Glory's Rival (#18).\n*'''Storm's Ransom''', a grey sprinter, purchased at the Saratoga Yearling Sale in Book #17 Ashleigh's Farewell. He was the subject of Book 19 as he contracted a fatal illness and died. Cindy was responsible for his early training and would continue to visit his grave throughout the series.\n*'''Wonder's Legacy''', a forgotten colt who was Wonder's 5th foal, given to Christina Reese (#24) who would later trade her half-interest in Wonder's Legacy for '''Sterling Dream''' a Thoroughbred she would later train to become a successful eventer.

In Legacy's Gift (#72) Sterling was the dam of '''Allie's Wonder'''\n*'''Wonder's Star''' Wonder's last colt who won the last leg of the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes. He runs his best for Christina Reese.\n\n==Authors==\nJoanna Campbell created the first fourteen ''Thoroughbred'' books, as well as the first two books in the spin-off series, ''Ashleigh''. After Campbell stopped writing, long-time editor Karen Bentley took over, writing books fifteen through twenty-three. After Karen Bentley left the series, there was a rotating \"panel\" of contributing authors: Allison Estes, Alice Leonhardt, Dale Blackwell Gasque, Lois Symanski, Mary Newhall Anderson, Karle Dickerson, and Jennifer Chu. ''Thoroughbred'' #36, ''Without Wonder'', was written under the [[pseudonym|pen name]] \"Brooke James\" by an unknown author.\n\n==List of Thoroughbred Books==\n[[List of Thoroughbred novels]]\n\n==Special editions, spin offs, and story arcs==\n\n===The \"super editions\"===\nThere have been four \"super edition\" ''Thoroughbred'' books. The events described in the super editions often take place during an interval between two of the regular books; for instance, ''Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle'' is supposedly set between books eighteen and nineteen of the regular series. The four super editions are:\n*''Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle'', which deals with the events surrounding the birth of Christina.\n*''Ashleigh's Diary'', which chronicles the events prior to Ashleigh's moving to Townsend Acres in ''A Horse Called Wonder''\n*''Ashleigh's Hope'', which precedes the events of the ''Ashleigh'' series\n*''Samantha's Journey'', which follows Samantha's early life before she becomes acquainted with Ashleigh\n\nThe super editions sometimes present problems of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in the regular series.  For example, it is stated in ''Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle'' during Ashleigh's dream that the son of Brad and Lavinia Townsend is named Ross.  In book #16 of the regular series Brad and Lavinia's infant son is also named Ross, who disappears shortly after and returns during the New Generation with a different name all together (Parker Jamison Townsend).  It is also suspected that the dream sequence of ''Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle'' influenced the series' plot lines, such as Christina's early interest in eventing.\n\n===Wonder's Legacy===\n''Wonder's Legacy'' is a trilogy within the regular series itself, comprising books thirty-six through thirty-eight. The trilogy deals with the aftermath of the death of Wonder, Ashleigh's favorite racehorse, as well as Christina's decision to shift her focus from eventing to racing in order to become the jockey of Wonder's last colt, Wonder's Star. This has led to mixed criticism as some wanted Christina, whose preference for eventing was so clear that she often felt like an outsider, to stick with eventing. Others were pleased, but most agreed it was a too-sudden turnaround.\n\n===Cindy's Lost Diaries===\n''Cindy's Desert Adventure'' and ''Cindy's Bold Start'', volumes forty-seven and forty-eight, are two \"lost diary specials\" published within the regular series in an attempt to explain the missing characters and continuity problems created by the ten-year gap which occurred between ''Cindy's Honor'' and the New Generation.  These books detail how Ashleigh miscarried her second pregnancy, the fate of Wonder's Champion, and Cindy McLean's travels to the United Arab Emirates, New York City, and finally back to Whitebrook Farm.\n\n===Samantha's Arc===\nSimilar to the \"lost diary specials\", Samantha also had a two book special, volumes sixty-five and sixty-six, published within the regular series.  These books, ''Bridal Dreams'' and ''Samantha's Irish Luck'' are not distinguished with a separate title indicating their \"special\" status within the series, but are generally regarded as such and were included within the regular series also in attempts to explain Samantha's story during the ten-year gap created by the New Generation.  The books detail Samantha's marriage to Tor and their subsequent relocation to Ireland, Samantha's shifting focus from horse racing to eventing and show jumping, and the birth of Samantha and Tor's children.\n\n===''Ashleigh''===\nThe spin-off series, Ashleigh, is 'supposedly' set in between Ashleigh's Hope and Ashleigh's Diary. However, this spin-off presents some major inconsistencies. In #2 Wonder's Promise (original series), Ashleigh states she's never attended a live horse race before; however, in the Ashleigh series (and Ashleigh's Diary, the Super Edition), she attends several races. This leads to the other error/inconsistency. In #7 Derby Day (Ashleigh series), it is said that Rhoda Kat is the first female jockey to win the Kentucky Derby. However, in the original series, Jilly Gordon clearly is. When the plague hits Ashleigh's family, various horses who survive or are sold before the first book, die (Midnight Wanderer, for example, who is put to sleep in the book, 'Goodbye Midnight Wanderer', apparently dies of the mysterious plague, rather than from the accident.) There is also large changes as to how Ashleigh and Mona get their horses. Ashleigh meets Stardust in Ashleigh's Hope and then owns (and must sell her) in Ashleigh's Diary, but in the Ashleigh Series she gets Stardust in #3 Waiting for Stardust and Stardust is expecting a foal in #15 Stardust's Foal (which this in never mentioned in Ashleigh's Hope or Ashleigh's Diary). In Ashleigh's Hope Mona gets a Thoroughbred she names Frisky on Thanksgiving Day, rubs it in, won't let Ashleigh ride Frisky, and the girls have a big fight. But in the Ashleigh Series Mona gets a Thoroughbred for Christmas, names her Frisky like she and Ashleigh had planned, says she is sorry and is not trying to rub it in as soon as she tells Ashleigh, and asks her to come over tomorrow to ride Frisky. The entire Ashleigh series is in a sort of \"time bubble\" and none of the events really line up with the events in the other Thoroughbred books, so it is almost a stand alone series in and of itself.\n\n===Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection===\nIn 1998, HarperCollins republished three books as part of the ''Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection'', books that were similar to ''Thoroughbred'' and were also written by authors of the series.  Of the three books published in this collection, only characters in ''Battlecry Forever!'' have been referenced in the regular ''Thoroughbred'' series. Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection contains three stand alone books that do not tie into/effect the storylines of the other series. Battlecry Forever! is a slight exception though. It is about Battlecry (the sire of Fleet Goddess, a filly that Ashleigh Griffen purchases in #5 Ashleigh's Dream of the Thoroughbred series) but it is considered stand alone (due to not playing a major role in the storyline of Thoroughbred), even though it is also still technically considered the only book written outside of the Thoroughbred series that is canon.\n\n==== Star of Shadowbrook Farm ====\nWritten by Joanna Campbell, ''Star of Shadowbrook Farm'' was first published in 1992 by HarperEntertainment, and again in 1998 as part of ''Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection''. It is the story of two unlikely eventing champions, Susan Holmes and Evening Star. The characters and storyline do not connect with the ''Thoroughbred'' series.\n\n==== The Forgotten Filly ====\nWritten by Karle Dickerson, ''The Forgotten Filly'' was published in 1993 by HarperTorch, and republished in 1998 as part of ''Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection''. The characters and storyline do not connect with the ''Thoroughbred'' series.\n\n==== Battlecry Forever! ====\nWritten by Joanna Campbell, ''Battlecry Forever!'' was first published in 1992 by HarperEntertainment, and again in 1998 as part of ''Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection''. The story concerns Battlecry, an unruly black stallion, and Leslie D'Andrea, who sets out to try to turn him into a champion.  Battlecry is the sire of Fleet Goddess, a filly that Ashleigh Griffen purchases in the ''Thoroughbred'' series.  It is the only book written outside of the ''Thoroughbred'' series that is considered canon.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thoroughbred}}\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:Fictional horses]]\n[[Category:Novel series]]\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:Horse racing novels]]\n[[Category:Pony books]]\n[[Category:HarperCollins books]]\n[[Category:1990s children's books]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n[[Image:Thoroughbred 01 cover.jpg|thumb|right|''A Horse Called Wonder'', the first book in ''Thoroughbred'' series, was published in 1991]]\n'''''Thoroughbred''''' is a series of young-adult novels that revolves around [[Kentucky]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racing]] and [[equestrianism]]. The series was started in 1991 by Joanna Campbell (better known as Jo Ann Simon, previously Haessig), and numbered 72 books, in addition to several \"super editions\" and a spin-off series, ''Ashleigh'', by the time it ended in 2005. The series focuses on a group of core characters, primarily Ashleigh Griffen, Samantha McLean, Cindy Blake/McLean and Ashleigh's daughter Christina, as well as Christina's friends. The series originally followed the adventures of Ashleigh as she was growing up; when Ashleigh reached adulthood, the focus of the books shifted to young Samantha McLean. During Samantha's college and adult years, the books centered on Cindy Blake McLean, Samantha's adopted younger sister. Late in the series, there was a large \"time gap\" before the series focused on to a teenaged Christina and her cousin Melanie.\n\nThe books, which are intended for a primarily pre-teen, female audience, explore the characters' adventures in horse racing, [[eventing]], and [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]]. Christina and Melanie, the two main characters, are both [[jockey]]s, and many of the books deal with their challenges on and off the track: while their life with their horses comprises the main storyline, school, boyfriends, and family life often provide [[subplot]]s. The Reese family farm, Whitebrook, is the setting for most of the series.\n\n''Thoroughbred'' is published by [[HarperEntertainment]], an imprint of [[HarperCollins]]. A total of twelve different authors have contributed to the series over the fifteen years of its existence. There are currently over two million ''Thoroughbred'' books in print {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.\n\n== Structure of the books ==\nThe ''Thoroughbred'' series is written in the [[third-person narrative]] and is typically told from a single person's viewpoint. For the first twenty-three books, the series is told from the viewpoints of Ashleigh Griffen (#1 - #5), Samantha McLean (#6 - #12), and Cindy McLean (#13 - #23). After book twenty-three, the series started what was called the \"New Generation\" and skipped ten years to a new group of characters: Christina Reese, Melanie Graham, Parker Townsend, and a small group of minor characters. These books were still written in the third-person, but the viewpoints of characters would alternate between books.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{main|List of Thoroughbred novels}}\n\n=== The early books ===\n\nEarly on, the series primarily focuses on Ashleigh Griffen and her adventures at Townsend Acres, a racing and breeding farm owned by Clay Townsend.  Ashleigh's parents, Derek and Elaine Griffen, take over at the breeding area of Townsend Acres after their own farm, Edgardale, has to be sold because of a virus that spread around the farm and killed both mares and foals.  Ashleigh dislikes her new life at first, but becomes more accustomed to it after an older mare named Townsend Holly gives birth to a small filly whom she names Wonder.  Though Wonder is very weak and nearly dies multiple  times,  through Ashleigh's care, the filly grows up to be a Kentucky Derby and Belmont-winning racehorse.  After Ashleigh grows up, the plot is focused on Samantha McLean afterward.\n\n=== The new generation ===\nAfter book 23, ''Cindy's Honor'', the series skipped forward ten years and began anew with a focus on eventing. The new series involved Ashleigh Griffen's daughter, Christina, who traded Wonder's latest foal, Wonder's Legacy, for a racehorse, named Sterling Dream, which she turned into an eventer. After 12 books, the series quickly shifted from eventing back to racing due to popular demand from fans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nAfter Ashleigh's Wonder's death, Christina became attached to Wonder's last foal, Wonder's Star. From this point, the series retained a predominantly Thoroughbred-racing focus, leaving eventing to Parker Townsend, who became a regular part of the series soon after Wonder's death. The series then became focused on Christina and Melanie and their horses Wonder's Star, Perfect Image, and Hi Jinx.\n\n=== The last main character ===\nAllie Avery, the final main character of ''Thoroughbred'', was introduced at the very end of the series as the daughter of Craig and Jilly Avery; Craig and Jilly had been removed from the series early on, but were brought back to make the introduction of a new character possible. Allie was both interested in eventing and racing, bringing together the two disciplines in the ''Thoroughbred'' series, although she ultimately decided upon becoming a jockey. She is given Wonder's Legacy, the often-forgotten son of Ashleigh's Wonder, as a gift when she is fourteen.\n\nBy late 2005, the ''Thoroughbred'' series was officially ended. The last book of the series was ''Legacy's Gift'', a book centered on Allie and Wonder's Legacy, as well as the birth of Legacy's daughter, Allie's Wonder. The end of the series was much-protested, despite the seeming decline in quality of plots and writing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n==List of major characters==\n*'''Ashleigh Griffen Reese''', the middle child of Derek and Elaine Griffen and the sister of Caroline and Rory Griffen.

She dies after complications of the birth of her last [[foal]].\n*'''Townsend Prince''', Wonder's half-brother and racing rival, he dies in an accident early in the series once Wonder has her first foals.\n*'''Fleet Goddess''' a filly by '''Battlecry''', Fleet Goddess became Ashleigh's first horse trained and purchased after Wonder's retirement. She had a successful career, but also became well known as a successful broodmare, with her off-spring being featured as minor characters throughout the series, '''Fleeting Moment''', '''Precocious''', '''Limitless Time''', '''Fleet Street'''.\n*'''Wonder's Pride''', Wonder's first colt, a very successful racehorse winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Breeder's Cup Classic. He retired from racing due to complications from a twisted intestine that nearly killed him in Book #10 Pride's Last Race.\n*'''Townsend Princess''', Wonder's first and only filly featured in the series, had a rough start. Injured early in her training by Lavinia Townsend, Princess was forced to spend months healing from a fractured cannon bone. She would later repeat the injury in the Blue Grass Stakes race and have to retire from racing at an early age. Princess is the dam of Wonder's first granddaughter '''Honor Bright''' (by Union Honour) who would feature as the main horse in Book #23.\n*'''Mr. Wonderful''', Wonder's second colt, often described as honey coloured, was not featured as a major character throughout the stories (Shining and Glory had arisen as more of the stars of Whitebrook). He injured a tendon in his two-year-old season. He won the Champagne Stakes in #18 Glory's Rival. He retired from racing due to a mysterious virus when he was four and was put up to stud alongside his older brother.\n*'''Shining''' Wonder's half-sister purchased at an Auction by Mike Reese in Book #11, was given to Samantha McLean as a gift due to her involvement nursing the abused and neglected filly back to health. Shining became the star racer of Whitebrook Farm winning several stakes races including the Breeder's Cup Distaff (#18 Glory's Rival). Shining was the dam of '''Lucky Chance''' a filly the same age as Wonder's granddaughter, '''Honor Bright'''\n*'''Wonder's Champion''', Wonder's arguably most successful foal (by Townsend Victor), won the Triple Crown and the Dubai World Cup (Books 21 and 22) after a rough start in Book 20. He was characterized as mischievous and would often misbehave and get himself into trouble, which nearly cost him his racing career.\n*'''Sierra''', a liver chestnut colt/stallion who Samantha McLean and her boyfriend Tor Nelson trained to be a successful steeplechaser, after his flop as a flat racer.\n*'''Lord Ainsley''', a colt purchased by Brad Townsend, Pride's main racing rival\n*'''Her Majesty''', a filly owned by Lavinia Townsend, would appear as a rival to Samantha Nelson (McLean)'s filly Shining\n*'''March to Glory''', a stolen horse, rescued by Cindy McLean and would later become the Star of the Whitebrook racing line for books 14-18, a half-interest in Glory was given to the Townsends in order to keep Champion training at Whitebrook (Book 18 Glory's Rival) Glory was the subject of a scandal as a fellow trainer and veterarian tried to drug and kill him in #16 Glory in Danger. Glory won the Breeder's Cup Classic by 30 lengths setting a new world record in Glory's Rival (#18).\n*'''Storm's Ransom''', a grey sprinter, purchased at the Saratoga Yearling Sale in Book #17 Ashleigh's Farewell, and was the subject of Book 19 as he contracted a fatal illness and died. Cindy was responsible for his early training and would continue to visit his grave throughout the series.\n*'''Wonder's Legacy''', a forgotten colt who was Wonder's 5th foal, given to Christina Reese (#24) who would later trade her half-interest for '''Sterling Dream''' a thoroughbred she would later train to become a successful eventer. Legacy was given to Allie Avery in the last books.\n*'''Sterling Dream''', Was owned by Christina Reese, and became an eventing horse after coming off the track and was abused by a groom. In Legacy's Gift (#72) Sterling was the dam of '''Allie's Wonder'''\n*'''Wonder's Star''' Ashleigh's Wonder's last colt, and won the last leg of the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes. He runs his best for Christina Reese.\n\n==Authors==\nJoanna Campbell created the first fourteen ''Thoroughbred'' books, as well as the first two books in the spin-off series, ''Ashleigh''. After Campbell stopped writing, long-time editor Karen Bentley took over, writing books fifteen through twenty-three. After Karen Bentley left the series, there was a rotating \"panel\" of contributing authors: Allison Estes, Alice Leonhardt, Dale Blackwell Gasque, Lois Symanski, Mary Newhall Anderson, Karle Dickerson, and Jennifer Chu. ''Thoroughbred'' #36, ''Without Wonder'', was written under the [[pseudonym|pen name]] \"Brooke James\" by an unknown author.\n\n==List of Thoroughbred Books==\n[[List of Thoroughbred novels]]\n\n==Special editions, spin offs, and story arcs==\n\n===The \"super editions\"===\nThere have been four \"super edition\" ''Thoroughbred'' books. The events described in the super editions often take place during an interval between two of the regular books; for instance, ''Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle'' is supposedly set between books eighteen and nineteen of the regular series. The four super editions are:\n*''Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle'', which deals with the events surrounding the birth of Christina.\n*''Ashleigh's Diary'', which chronicles the events prior to Ashleigh's moving to Townsend Acres in ''A Horse Called Wonder''\n*''Ashleigh's Hope'', which precedes the events of the ''Ashleigh'' series\n*''Samantha's Journey'', which follows Samantha's early life before she becomes acquainted with Ashleigh\n\nThe super editions sometimes present problems of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in the regular series.  For example, it is stated in ''Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle'' during Ashleigh's dream that the son of Brad and Lavinia Townsend is named Ross.  In book #16 of the regular series Brad and Lavinia's infant son is also named Ross, who disappears shortly after and returns during the New Generation with a different name all together (Parker Jamison Townsend).  It is also suspected that the dream sequence of ''Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle'' influenced the series' plot lines, such as Christina's early interest in eventing.\n\n===Wonder's Legacy===\n''Wonder's Legacy'' is a trilogy within the regular series itself, comprising books thirty-six through thirty-eight. The trilogy deals with the aftermath of the death of Wonder, Ashleigh's favorite racehorse, as well as Christina's decision to shift her focus from eventing to racing in order to become the jockey of Wonder's last colt, Wonder's Star. This has led to mixed criticism as some wanted Christina, whose preference for eventing was so clear that she often felt like an outsider, to stick with eventing. Others were pleased, but most agreed it was a too-sudden turnaround.\n\n===Cindy's Lost Diaries===\n''Cindy's Desert Adventure'' and ''Cindy's Bold Start'', volumes forty-seven and forty-eight, are two \"lost diary specials\" published within the regular series in an attempt to explain the missing characters and continuity problems created by the ten-year gap which occurred between ''Cindy's Honor'' and the New Generation.  These books detail how Ashleigh miscarried her second pregnancy, the fate of Wonder's Champion, and Cindy McLean's travels to the United Arab Emirates, New York City, and finally back to Whitebrook Farm.\n\n===Samantha's Arc===\nSimilar to the \"lost diary specials\", Samantha also had a two book special, volumes sixty-five and sixty-six, published within the regular series.  These books, ''Bridal Dreams'' and ''Samantha's Irish Luck'' are not distinguished with a separate title indicating their \"special\" status within the series, but are generally regarded as such and were included within the regular series also in attempts to explain Samantha's story during the ten-year gap created by the New Generation.  The books detail Samantha's marriage to Tor and their subsequent relocation to Ireland, Samantha's shifting focus from horse racing to eventing and show jumping, and the birth of Samantha and Tor's children.\n\n===''Ashleigh''===\nThe spin-off series, Ashleigh, is 'supposedly' set in between Ashleigh's Hope and Ashleigh's Diary. However, this spin-off presents some major inconsistencies. In #2 Wonder's Promise (original series), Ashleigh states she's never attended a live horse race before; however, in the Ashleigh series (and Ashleigh's Diary, the Super Edition), she attends several races. This leads to the other error/inconsistency. In #7 Derby Day (Ashleigh series), it is said that Rhoda Kat is the first female jockey to win the Kentucky Derby. However, in the original series, Jilly Gordon clearly is. When the plague hits Ashleigh's family, various horses who survive or are sold before the first book, die (Midnight Wanderer, for example, who is put to sleep in the book, 'Goodbye Midnight Wanderer', apparently dies of the mysterious plague, rather than from the accident.) There is also large changes as to how Ashleigh and Mona get their horses. Ashleigh meets Stardust in Ashleigh's Hope and then owns (and must sell her) in Ashleigh's Diary, but in the Ashleigh Series she gets Stardust in #3 Waiting for Stardust and Stardust is expecting a foal in #15 Stardust's Foal (which this in never mentioned in Ashleigh's Hope or Ashleigh's Diary). In Ashleigh's Hope Mona gets a Thoroughbred she names Frisky on Thanksgiving Day, rubs it in, won't let Ashleigh ride Frisky, and the girls have a big fight. But in the Ashleigh Series Mona gets a Thoroughbred for Christmas, names her Frisky like she and Ashleigh had planned, says she is sorry and is not trying to rub it in as soon as she tells Ashleigh, and asks her to come over tomorrow to ride Frisky. The entire Ashleigh series is in a sort of \"time bubble\" and none of the events really line up with the events in the other Thoroughbred books, so it is almost a stand alone series in and of itself.\n\n===Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection===\nIn 1998, HarperCollins republished three books as part of the ''Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection'', books that were similar to ''Thoroughbred'' and were also written by authors of the series.  Of the three books published in this collection, only characters in ''Battlecry Forever!'' have been referenced in the regular ''Thoroughbred'' series. Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection contains three stand alone books that do not tie into/effect the storylines of the other series. Battlecry Forever! is a slight exception though. It is about Battlecry (the sire of Fleet Goddess, a filly that Ashleigh Griffen purchases in #5 Ashleigh's Dream of the Thoroughbred series) but it is considered stand alone (due to not playing a major role in the storyline of Thoroughbred), even though it is also still technically considered the only book written outside of the Thoroughbred series that is canon.\n\n==== Star of Shadowbrook Farm ====\nWritten by Joanna Campbell, ''Star of Shadowbrook Farm'' was first published in 1992 by HarperEntertainment, and again in 1998 as part of ''Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection''. It is the story of two unlikely eventing champions, Susan Holmes and Evening Star. The characters and storyline do not connect with the ''Thoroughbred'' series.\n\n==== The Forgotten Filly ====\nWritten by Karle Dickerson, ''The Forgotten Filly'' was published in 1993 by HarperTorch, and republished in 1998 as part of ''Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection''. The characters and storyline do not connect with the ''Thoroughbred'' series.\n\n==== Battlecry Forever! ====\nWritten by Joanna Campbell, ''Battlecry Forever!'' was first published in 1992 by HarperEntertainment, and again in 1998 as part of ''Ashleigh's Thoroughbred Collection''. The story concerns Battlecry, an unruly black stallion, and Leslie D'Andrea, who sets out to try to turn him into a champion.  Battlecry is the sire of Fleet Goddess, a filly that Ashleigh Griffen purchases in the ''Thoroughbred'' series.  It is the only book written outside of the ''Thoroughbred'' series that is considered canon.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thoroughbred}}\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:Fictional horses]]\n[[Category:Novel series]]\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:Horse racing novels]]\n[[Category:Pony books]]\n[[Category:HarperCollins books]]\n[[Category:1990s children's books]]\n", "name_user": "KJTS77", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eList of major horse characters", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred_(series)"}

A thermal generating station, the Point Aconi Generating Station is owned and operated by [[Nova Scotia Power|Nova Scotia Power Corporation]].  It opened on August 13, 1994 following four years of construction.\n\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station is situated on the shores of the [[Cabot Strait]] at the northeastern tip of [[Boularderie Island]], located approximately {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the headland named Point Aconi and {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the headland named Table Head. Its civic address is 1800 Prince Mine Rd, Point Aconi, NS. The facility is located at the northern terminus of [[Nova Scotia Highway 162|Prince Mine Rd - Highway 162]].\n\nUnlike the nearby [[Lingan Generating Station]] which has four generating units, Point Aconi has only one.  The Point Aconi unit, however, is the largest producing unit in Nova Scotia and is also the province\u2019s newest. The facility is able to produce 165 MW and, unlike the vast majority of Canadian coal-fired power plants, uses [[Circulating Fluidized Bed]] (CFB) to reduce emissions<ref name=\"CERI Review\">{{cite book |last1=Kralovic |first1=Paul |title=North America natural gas market dynamics : global LNG, a review |date=March 2011 |publisher=Canadian Energy Research Institute |location=Calgary AL |isbn=1-896091-97-0 |page=28 |url=https://ceri.ca/assets/files/Study_123_III_Full_Report.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> of [[NOx|NO<sub>x</sub>]] and [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]].\n\nPoint Aconi was the world\u2019s largest CFB plant\u2014and the first to enter commercial service in North America\u2014when it came on-line in 1993. Tokyo-based Mitsui & Co., Ltd. was the turnkey contractor for Point Aconi; Sargent & Lundy was the project\u2019s architect/engineer.\n\n==Operation==\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station has one 165 MW unit (name plate capacity 186 MW). Its boiler was supplied by Finland\u2019s Ahlstrom Pyropower. The plant burns bituminous [[coal]] and [[petroleum coke]] in a variety of blends, which is transported to the facility using [[semi-trailer truck]]s from a bulk ship unloading pier in [[Sydney Harbour (Nova Scotia)|Sydney Harbour]] near the community of [[Whitney Pier]]. The unit is a fluidized bed combustor built for NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, control. The station has a fabric filter [[baghouse]] for particulate control. Point Aconi station is the only Nova Scotia Power Thermal plant without activated carbon injection system to control mercury emissions as it is an inherently lower emitter due to the injection of limestone into the process.<ref name=\"ESR2016\">{{cite web |title=Improving Air Quality |url=http://emerasustainability.com/2016/environment/improving-air-quality/ |website=2016 Emera Sustainability Report |publisher=Emera Inc. |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> [[Fly ash]] and [[bottom ash]] is handled dry and land-filled.<ref name=\"TECL\">{{cite book |title=Control of Mercury Emission-to-Air |date=June 2010 |publisher=Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd. for Environment Canada |page=17 |url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/meetings/EG1/Assessment_control_electricity_Part1b.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> The unit has one chimney {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground.<ref name=\"NPRI Detail\">{{cite web |title=Company/Facility information: Nova Scotia Power Incorporated/Point Aconi Generating Station (2017) |url=https://pollution-waste.canada.ca/national-release-inventory/archives/index.cfm?do=facility_information&lang=En&opt_npri_id=0000004000&opt_report_year=2017 |website=NPRI Data Search - Detailed Facility Information |publisher=Environment and Climate Change Canada |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=13 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe drum-type reheat CFB boiler was designed to produce 1,207,150 lb/hr of steam (maximum continuous rating) at 1,800 psi and 1,000 F. Toshiba Corp. supplied the multicylinder, tandem-compound steam turbine-generator. The 3,600-rpm generator is totally enclosed and has a cylindrical rotor whose winding is directly cooled by hydrogen at 30 psi. The generator is rated at 217 MVA and has a power factor of 0.85.\n\nPoint Aconi\u2019s coal-handling system comprises an active 27,500-ton storage pile; an inactive storage pile of identical size; receiving hoppers, conveyors, crushing equipment; and four in-plant storage bunkers. The conveying system can handle 440 tons of coal per hour or about 550,000 tons per year. The limestone-handling system consists of receiving hoppers and conveyors common to the coal system, crushers, dryers, storage silos, and a pneumatic conveyor leading to two in-plant storage bunkers. Limestone also arrives by truck, at the rate of about 165,000 tons per year.\n\nThe in-plant ash-handling system conveys fly ash from hoppers under the baghouse, economizer, and air heater, as well as bottom ash from the combustor, to either of two silos located outside the powerhouse. Once in the silos, the ash is conditioned with water, loaded into trucks, and transported to a disposal site located next to the plant.\n\nPoint Aconi uses a once-through circulating seawater system. Seawater is drawn from {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} offshore at a depth of {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} through a velocity cap intake structure. A tunnel {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the seabed connects the offshore velocity cap to the onshore pump house. The two-pass, surface-type deaerating condenser operates at 1 inch HgA.<ref name=\"Rock of Reliability\"/>\n\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station consumes 189,000 tonnes of coal and 213,000 tonnes of petroleum coke per year and currently generates approximately 6.8% of the province's electricity and produces roughly 10.07% of the province's air pollution, including [[hydrochloric acid]], [[sulphuric acid]], [[hexachlorobenzene]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref>[http://www.pollutionwatch.org/pressroom/releases/20030923.jsp \"Dirty Air from Power Plants Fuels Health Problems in Nova Scotia\" Pollution Watch]</ref> In 2007, it created 1.465 million tonnes of [[greenhouse gases]].<ref>[http://www.ec.gc.ca/pdb/ghg/onlinedata/FacilityAndGHG_e.cfm?facil=1191&year=2007 Facility and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Environment Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130627101320/http://www.ec.gc.ca/pdb/ghg/onlinedata/FacilityAndGHG_e.cfm?facil=1191&year=2007 |date=2013-06-27 }}</ref> In 2017 it reported 1,188,377 tonnes [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] under Nova Scotia's Cap-and Trade regulations.<ref name=\"2017gge\">{{cite book |last1=Department of Environment |title=2019 Summary of 2017 Greenhouse Gas Emissions |date=February 2019 |publisher=Province of Nova Scotia |isbn=978-1-55457-930-3 |url=https://climatechange.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/GreenhouseGasReport_LOWRES.PDF |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Seaboard Generating Station]] opened in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] in 1931 by [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] and was the sole supplier of electricity for the [[Industrial Cape Breton]] region until its purchase by Nova Scotia Power in 1966 as part of DOSCO's ongoing asset liquidation. Nova Scotia Power opened the province's largest generating station, the [[Lingan Generating Station]], at the height of the [[1979 energy crisis]] to take advantage of relatively cheap Cape Breton coal being produced by the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]] (DEVCO).\n\nThe idea of replacing the aging Seaboard Generating Station was discussed during the 1980s and was an important promise by the incumbent [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservative Party]] led by Premier [[John Buchanan]] during the [[1988 Nova Scotia general election|1988 provincial election]]. After Buchanan's government was returned to power, Nova Scotia Power issued a call for proposals in October 1988 to construct a 150 megawatt CFB ([[Circulating Fluidized Bed]]) coal-fired electrical generating station in Point Aconi.\n\nSignificant controversy dogged Buchanan's election promise to build a new generating station as the [[Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board|Public Utility Board]] had authority to decide on all applications by Nova Scotia Power to construct new generating stations as well as associated rate increases. The PUB began to conduct hearings into the project in spring 1989 and stated that an economic analysis of Buchanan's election promise (the $500 million Point Aconi Generating Station) was not required as the province's generating needs were met by current sources. Coincidentally, Nova Scotia Power had also promised to purchase 30 megawatts annually from small independent power producers in the province beginning in 1990, however this agreement was abolished after the Small Private Power Association of Nova Scotia intervened at the PUB hearings to block the proposed Point Aconi Generating Station. On April 27, 1989, Buchanan introduced a controversial amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act'', which would remove the requirement for Nova Scotia Power to submit proposals for new generating station to the PUB. Hearings into the Point Aconi project were cancelled after the amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act'' receiving [[Royal Assent]] in early June 1989.<ref>\"Buchanan short-circuits N.S. utilities board with power plant bill.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Thursday, April 27, 1989</ref>\n\n====Request for Proposals====\nIn early January 1990, Nova Scotia Power announced that the [[Japan]]ese industrial conglomerate [[Mitsui]] had won the Request for Proposals (RFP) that had been issued in fall 1988 and a contract was signed on behalf of the Government of Nova Scotia. The proposal detailed a [[turnkey]] project designed by Mitsui with the CFB steam boiler supplied by Pyro-Power through Kamtech Services (a subsidiary of [[Lauren Engineers & Constructors]] of Abilene, Texas), project management and engineering by Chicago-based [[Sargent & Lundy LLC]], and construction of the plant itself by Jones Power Corporation.\n\n====Public hearings====\nTwo weeks later, the provincial government announced that its Environmental Control Council would conduct a one-day hearing into the project on January 18, 1990 in place of the PUB hearings conducted the previous spring which were aborted as a result of the amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act''. The hearing received submissions from citizens and organizations that were strongly opposed to the Point Aconi Generating Station, pointing out the environmental impact, that its generating capacity wasn't required, and that it was a political mega-project that would add to the financial debt of the publicly owned Nova Scotia Power Corporation.\n\nOther submissions from citizens and organizations were supportive of the project, which they claimed would create an estimated 500 construction and operating jobs, as well as theoretically guarantee work in Cape Breton's coal mines; the [[United Mine Workers of America]] Local 26 had lobbied hard for the power plant. [[Richie Mann]], the environment critic for the official opposition [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] asked at the one-day hearing, \"Can you give us some evidence that this process is not an exercise in public relations, a sham?\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Panel asked to show evidence power plant hearing not 'sham'.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Friday, January 19, 1990</ref>\n\nOn Friday, March 9, 1990 the provincial government announced its approval of the estimated $436 million project, even though it had already signed a contract with Mitsui two months earlier. Nova Scotia's Environment Minister [[John Leefe]] defended the projected 1.5 million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions, stating \"[The project will be] absolutely inconsequential in terms of global carbon dioxide production.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 10, 1990</ref>\n\nNova Scotia Power pointed out the environmental benefits of the Point Aconi project, stating that the use of CFB technology whereby [[limestone]] would be used to filter out [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO<sub>x</sub>) which were major contributors to [[acid rain]]. Minister Leefe stated that Nova Scotia Power intended to reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from its generating stations to 100,000 tonnes a year by 2010 from the 1990 level of 160,000 tonnes. Minister Leefe also noted that while the use of CFB technology would reduce acid rain, it would also result in a comparatively massive increase in [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions which was a [[greenhouse gas]]; Leefe told reporters that Nova Scotia's coal-fired plants contributed 32 per cent of the 18 million tonnes per year of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the province (as of 1990).\n\nThe projected increase in Nova Scotia's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result of the Point Aconi Generating Station (an estimated additional 1.5 million tonnes per year) went against a recent (1990) decision by federal and provincial energy ministers to reduce emissions of the gas by at least 20 per cent by 2005.<ref>Kevin Cox \"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 10, 1990</ref>\n\nThe debate over construction of the Point Aconi Generating Station took place in the shadow of a much larger global debate over [[acid rain]] and its contributing factors, such as fossil fueled generating stations. The acid rain controversy resulted in the ''Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement'' which was signed by both countries on March 13, 1991 and stipulated that both countries would agree to reduce emissions of [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO<sub>x</sub>).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/default.asp?lang=En&n=83930AC3-1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20071214101007/http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/default.asp?lang=en&n=83930ac3-1 |archivedate=2007-12-14 }} Canada-United States Clean Air Agreement - Environment Canada</ref>\n\n====Full Federal Environmental Review rejected====\nOn September 20, 1990, federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans [[Bernard Valcourt]] rejected a full environmental review of the project, arguing that any problems to the environment would be relatively minor. Valcourt justified this decision by referring to a scientific report on the project conducted by the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] which stated that use of CFB technology could be mitigated. It noted, however, the widespread concern of local residents over the effect of the generating station's draw on [[ground water]] supplies (CFB requires large amounts of fresh water) as well as ash discharge and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The DFO scientists noted widespread mistrust of the provincial government's decision and that the controversial one-day hearing in January left the impression \"of a cooked-up deal between the province and federal government to slip this project by without a fair assessment of its potential dangers. In fact, problems are relatively minor... Point Aconi is in some respects a model.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Ottawa rejects full review of power station's effects.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Friday, September 21, 1990</ref>\n\nOn December 13, 1990, lawyers for Greenpeace, the [[Ecology Action Centre]] and six property owners who live near Point Aconi argued in the [[Federal Court of Canada]] that Valcourt had made a legal error in rejecting a public environmental review panel and that federal Environmental Assessment Review Panel guidelines should be followed to institute a formal review of the $436 million project. Mr. Justice Andrew MacKay ruled against the application on Friday, January 18, 1991 by stating that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans acted in accordance with the law in deciding not to order a full environmental assessment of the project. MacKay noted that the project has resulted in substantial testing of ground water around the plant.

A thermal generating station, the Point Aconi Generating Station is owned and operated by [[Nova Scotia Power|Nova Scotia Power Corporation]].  It opened on August 13, 1994 following four years of construction.\n\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station is situated on the shores of the [[Cabot Strait]] at the northeastern tip of [[Boularderie Island]], located approximately {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the headland named Point Aconi and {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the headland named Table Head.

The facility is located at the northern terminus of [[Nova Scotia Highway 162|Prince Mine Rd - Highway 162]].\n\nUnlike the nearby [[Lingan Generating Station]] which has four generating units, Point Aconi has only one.  The Point Aconi unit, however, is the largest producing unit in Nova Scotia and is also the province\u2019s newest. The facility is able to produce 165 MW and, unlike the vast majority of Canadian coal-fired power plants, uses [[Circulating Fluidized Bed]] (CFB) to reduce emissions<ref name=\"CERI Review\">{{cite book |last1=Kralovic |first1=Paul |title=North America natural gas market dynamics : global LNG, a review |date=March 2011 |publisher=Canadian Energy Research Institute |location=Calgary AL |isbn=1-896091-97-0 |page=28 |url=https://ceri.ca/assets/files/Study_123_III_Full_Report.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> of [[NOx|NO<sub>x</sub>]] and [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]].\n\nPoint Aconi was the world\u2019s largest CFB plant\u2014and the first to enter commercial service in North America\u2014when it came on-line in 1993.

Toshiba Corp. supplied the multicylinder, tandem-compound steam turbine-generator. The 3,600-rpm generator is totally enclosed and has a cylindrical rotor whose winding is directly cooled by hydrogen at 30 psi. The generator is rated at 217 MVA and has a power factor of 0.85.\n\nPoint Aconi\u2019s coal-handling system comprises an active 27,500-ton storage pile; an inactive storage pile of identical size; receiving hoppers, conveyors, crushing equipment; and four in-plant storage bunkers. The conveying system can handle 440 tons of coal per hour or about 550,000 tons per year. The limestone-handling system consists of receiving hoppers and conveyors common to the coal system, crushers, dryers, storage silos, and a pneumatic conveyor leading to two in-plant storage bunkers. Limestone also arrives by truck, at the rate of about 165,000 tons per year.\n\nThe in-plant ash-handling system conveys fly ash from hoppers under the baghouse, economizer, and air heater, as well as bottom ash from the combustor, to either of two silos located outside the powerhouse. Once in the silos, the ash is conditioned with water, loaded into trucks, and transported to a disposal site located next to the plant.\n\nPoint Aconi uses a once-through circulating seawater system. Seawater is drawn from {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} offshore at a depth of {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} through a velocity cap intake structure. A tunnel {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the seabed connects the offshore velocity cap to the onshore pump house.

Nova Scotia Power opened the province's largest generating station, the [[Lingan Generating Station]], at the height of the [[1979 energy crisis]] to take advantage of relatively cheap Cape Breton coal being produced by the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]] (DEVCO).\n\nThe idea of replacing the aging Seaboard Generating Station was discussed during the 1980s and was an important promise by the incumbent [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservative Party]] led by Premier [[John Buchanan]] during the [[1988 Nova Scotia general election|1988 provincial election]]. After Buchanan's government was returned to power, Nova Scotia Power issued a call for proposals in October 1988 to construct a 150 megawatt CFB ([[Circulating Fluidized Bed]]) coal-fired electrical generating station in Point Aconi.\n\nSignificant controversy dogged Buchanan's election promise to build a new generating station as the [[Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board|Public Utility Board]] had authority to decide on all applications by Nova Scotia Power to construct new generating stations as well as associated rate increases. The PUB began to conduct hearings into the project in spring 1989 and stated that an economic analysis of Buchanan's election promise (the $500 million Point Aconi Generating Station) was not required as the province's generating needs were met by current sources. Coincidentally, Nova Scotia Power had also promised to purchase 30 megawatts annually from small independent power producers in the province beginning in 1990, however this agreement was abolished after the Small Private Power Association of Nova Scotia intervened at the PUB hearings to block the proposed Point Aconi Generating Station. On April 27, 1989, Buchanan introduced a controversial amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act'', which would remove the requirement for Nova Scotia Power to submit proposals for new generating station to the PUB. Hearings into the Point Aconi project were cancelled after the amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act'' receiving [[Royal Assent]] in early June 1989.<ref>\"Buchanan short-circuits N.S. utilities board with power plant bill.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Thursday, April 27, 1989</ref>\n\n====Request for Proposals====\nIn early January 1990, Nova Scotia Power announced that the [[Japan]]ese industrial conglomerate [[Mitsui]] had won the Request for Proposals (RFP) that had been issued in fall 1988 and a contract was signed on behalf of the Government of Nova Scotia. The proposal detailed a [[turnkey]] project designed by Mitsui with the CFB steam boiler supplied by Pyro-Power through Kamtech Services (a subsidiary of [[Lauren Engineers & Constructors]] of Abilene, Texas), project management and engineering by Chicago-based [[Sargent & Lundy LLC]], and construction of the plant itself by Jones Power Corporation.\n\n====Public hearings====\nTwo weeks later, the provincial government announced that its Environmental Control Council would conduct a one-day hearing into the project on January 18, 1990 in place of the PUB hearings conducted the previous spring which were aborted as a result of the amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act''. The hearing received submissions from citizens and organizations that were strongly opposed to the Point Aconi Generating Station, pointing out the environmental impact, that its generating capacity wasn't required, and that it was a political mega-project that would add to the financial debt of the publicly owned Nova Scotia Power Corporation.\n\nOther submissions from citizens and organizations were supportive of the project, which they claimed would create an estimated 500 construction and operating jobs, as well as theoretically guarantee work in Cape Breton's coal mines; the [[United Mine Workers of America]] Local 26 had lobbied hard for the power plant. [[Richie Mann]], the environment critic for the official opposition [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] asked at the one-day hearing, \"Can you give us some evidence that this process is not an exercise in public relations, a sham?\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Panel asked to show evidence power plant hearing not 'sham'.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Friday, January 19, 1990</ref>\n\nOn Friday, March 9, 1990 the provincial government announced its approval of the estimated $436 million project, even though it had already signed a contract with Mitsui two months earlier. Nova Scotia's Environment Minister [[John Leefe]] defended the projected 1.5 million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions, stating \"[The project will be] absolutely inconsequential in terms of global carbon dioxide production.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 10, 1990</ref>\n\nNova Scotia Power pointed out the environmental benefits of the Point Aconi project, stating that the use of CFB technology whereby [[limestone]] would be used to filter out [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO<sub>x</sub>) which were major contributors to [[acid rain]]. Minister Leefe stated that Nova Scotia Power intended to reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from its generating stations to 100,000 tonnes a year by 2010 from the 1990 level of 160,000 tonnes. Minister Leefe also noted that while the use of CFB technology would reduce acid rain, it would also result in a comparatively massive increase in [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions which was a [[greenhouse gas]]; Leefe told reporters that Nova Scotia's coal-fired plants contributed 32 per cent of the 18 million tonnes per year of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the province (as of 1990).\n\nThe projected increase in Nova Scotia's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result of the Point Aconi Generating Station (an estimated additional 1.5 million tonnes per year) went against a recent (1990) decision by federal and provincial energy ministers to reduce emissions of the gas by at least 20 per cent by 2005.<ref>Kevin Cox \"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 10, 1990</ref>\n\nThe debate over construction of the Point Aconi Generating Station took place in the shadow of a much larger global debate over [[acid rain]] and its contributing factors, such as fossil fueled generating stations. The acid rain controversy resulted in the ''Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement'' which was signed by both countries on March 13, 1991 and stipulated that both countries would agree to reduce emissions of [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO<sub>x</sub>).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/default.asp?lang=En&n=83930AC3-1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20071214101007/http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/default.asp?lang=en&n=83930ac3-1 |archivedate=2007-12-14 }} Canada-United States Clean Air Agreement - Environment Canada</ref>\n\n====Full Federal Environmental Review rejected====\nOn September 20, 1990, federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans [[Bernard Valcourt]] rejected a full environmental review of the project, arguing that any problems to the environment would be relatively minor. Valcourt justified this decision by referring to a scientific report on the project conducted by the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] which stated that use of CFB technology could be mitigated. It noted, however, the widespread concern of local residents over the effect of the generating station's draw on [[ground water]] supplies (CFB requires large amounts of fresh water) as well as ash discharge and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The DFO scientists noted widespread mistrust of the provincial government's decision and that the controversial one-day hearing in January left the impression \"of a cooked-up deal between the province and federal government to slip this project by without a fair assessment of its potential dangers.

Mr. Justice Andrew MacKay ruled against the application on Friday, January 18, 1991 by stating that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans acted in accordance with the law in deciding not to order a full environmental assessment of the project. MacKay noted that the project has resulted in substantial testing of ground water around the plant. He also noted that because there are no standards for CO<sub>2</sub>, it was impossible to say that the plant would create a pollution problem with its massive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref>Special to the Globe and Mail \"Lawyer contends minister erred in coal plant ruling\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Friday, December 13, 1990</ref>\n\nA citizens liaison committee was established by Nova Scotia Power to review the project.

The Prince Colliery was owned by the federal Crown corporation [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]] (DEVCO) which was beset with production problems at its three remaining collieries during the mid-late 1990s as a result of flooding, roof collapses and labour difficulties.

[[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not an eyewitness, related in his ''History of Virginia'' that braves of the [[Powhatan]] \"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\".<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/659023 James Mooney, \"The Powhatan Confederacy, Past and Present],\" ''American Anthropologist'' 9, no. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1907), 129\u201352.</ref> The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all the English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages. Chief [[Opchanacanough|Opechancanough]] led the Powhatan Confederacy in a coordinated series of surprise attacks; they killed 347 people, a quarter of the population of the Virginia colony.\n\n[[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 72. \"By 1620 the colonists were simply taking the acres they required for their expanding tobacco economy without even the pretense of negotiation or payment. Increasing encroachments on native American lands, and particularly onto their hunting grounds, largely accounted for the deterioration of relations between the English and the indigenous populations of the Tidewater Chesapeake that finally exploded in 1622.\"</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nAt first, the natives were glad to trade provisions to the colonists for metal tools, but by 1609 the English governor, John Smith, had begun to send raiding parties to demand food. This earned the colonists a bad reputation among the Native Americans and precipitated conflict.<ref>Fausz, ''An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) p. 20</ref> They isolated the Native Americans, burned down houses, and stole their food supplies.<ref>Fausz, \n Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) pp. 6, 22.</ref> The English violence alienated the natives further and they laid siege to the Jamestown fort for several months. Unable to secure more food supplies, many colonists died during the \"[[Starving Time]]\" in 1609\u201310.<ref>Fausz, ''An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) p. 54.</ref>\n\n[[London Company|The London Company]]'s primary concern was the survival of the colony. In England's best interest the colonists would have to maintain civil relations with the Powhatan. The Powhatan and the English realized that they could benefit from each other through trade once peace was restored. In exchange for food, the chief asked the colonists to provide him with metal hatchets and copper.<ref>Jay B. Hubbell, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4246320  The Smith-Pocahontas Story in Literature],\" ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' 65, no. 3 (Jul., 1957), 275\u2013300.</ref> Unlike John Smith, other early leaders of Virginia such as [[Thomas Dale]] and [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] based their actions on different thinking, as they were military men and saw the Powhatan as essentially a \"military problem.\"<ref>Glenn, ''Captain John Smith and the Indians'', 228\u201348.</ref>\n\nThe Powhatan had soon realized that the Englishmen did not settle in Jamestown to trade with them.  The English wanted more; they wanted control over the land. As [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]] said:\n\n{{quote|Your coming is not for trade, but to invade my people and possess my country\u2026Having seen the death of all my people thrice\u2026 I know the difference of peace and were better than any other Country.

As the colonists were about to leave the Bay and head out into the open sea, they were met by the incoming fleet of [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]]. Taking command as governor, de la Warr ordered the fort reoccupied. He plotted conquest of the surrounding tribes.<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" />\n\nIn July 1610 he sent Gates against the Kecoughtan people. \"Gates lured the Indians into the open by means of music-and-dance act by his drummer, and then slaughtered them\".<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" /> This was the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#First Anglo-Powhatan War|First Anglo-Powhatan War]]. The English, led by [[Samuel Argall]], captured [[Pocahontas]], daughter of Powhatan, and held her hostage until he would agree to their demands. \"English demanded that all Powhatan captives be released, return all English weapons taken by his warriors, and agree upon a lasting peace\".\n\nIt was while Pocahontas was held by the English that she met [[John Rolfe]], whom she later married. While in captivity, Pocahontas was taught the English language, and she learned about English customs and religion. She was baptized as a Christian and took the name Rebecca. Rolfe wrote that the way to maintain peace between the Powhatan and the English, was to marry Pocahontas, not \"with the unbridled desire of carnal affection but for the good of the colony and the glory of God. Such a marriage might bring peace between the warring English and Powhatan, just as it would satisfy Pocahontas's desire.\"<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" /> After they married, there were more peaceful relations for a time between the English colonists and the Powhatan Confederacy. Edward Waterhouse, secretary of the Virginia Company, wrote:\n\n{{quote|[S]uch was the conceit of firme peace and amitie, as that there was seldome or never a sword worne, and a Peece [firearm] seldomer, except for a Deere or Fowle....The Plantations of particular Adventurers and Planters were placed scatteringly and straglingly as a choyce veyne of rich ground invited them, and the further from neighbors held the better.

Perhaps in 1620-1621 Opitchapam retired or he was deposed (but possibly he died in 1630) and he was succeeded by his youngest brother, and Opchanacanough and Nemattanew began to predispose plans for the unavoidable war.

The attack took place on March 22, 1621 as reckoned by the colonists, three days before New Years Day 1622. [[Historians]], [[genealogists]], and others who work with dates in this era commonly denote Julian calendar dates in the interval between January 1 and March 24 with the '[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]' suffix (OS) when presenting these dates with their original year value, or to use a [[dual dating]] syntax which combines original and adjusted values.  For example, the date of the attack on Jamestown can be denoted as March 22, 1621(OS), or March 22, 1621/22. The common practice of showing the date as March 22, 1622 is technically inaccurate, but less confusing for those who are unfamiliar with the differences in calendaring systems.\n\nUnder the retroactively-applied modern [[Gregorian calendar]], the date of the attack was April 1, 1622.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{details|Anglo-Powhatan Wars}}\nOpechancanough withdrew his warriors, believing that the English would behave as Native Americans would when defeated: pack up and leave, or learn their lesson and respect the power of the Powhatan.<ref>Helen C.

He planned to return with a ship filled with soldiers, sailors, and ammunition, to establish a \"running Army\" able to fight the Powhatan. Smith's goal was to \"inforce the Savages to leave their Country, or bring them in the feare of subjection that every man should follow their business securely\",<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\" /> but Smith never returned to Virginia.\n\nThe English took revenge against the Powhatan by \"the use of force, surprise attacks, famine resulting from the burning of their corn, destroying their boats, canoes, and houses, breaking their fishing weirs and assaulting them in their hunting expedition, pursuing them with horses and using bloodhounds to find them and mastiffs to seaze them, driving them to flee within reach of their enemies among other tribes, and 'assimilating and abetting their enemies against them\".<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\" />\n\nThe 1622 massacre was used as a justification for ongoing seizure of Powhatan land by the colonists for the next ten years. Historian Betty Wood writes:\n\n<blockquote>What is usually referred to as the \"Massacre of 1622,\" the native American attack that resulted in the death of 347 English settlers and almost wiped out Jamestown, gave the colonists the excuse they needed to take even more of what they wanted from the indigenous population of the Chesapeake. As far as the survivors of the Massacre of 1622 were concerned, by virtue of launching this unprovoked assault native Americans had forfeited any legal and moral rights they might previously have claimed to the ownership of the lands they occupied.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 72.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWood quotes a Virginian settler:\n\n<blockquote>We, who hitherto have had possession of no more ground than their waste and our purchase at a valuable consideration to their own contentment. . . may now by right of war, and law of nations, invade the country, and those who sought to destroy us: whereby we shall enjoy their cultivated places.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 73.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Indian decline and defeat==\nIn 1624 Virginia was made a [[crown colony|royal colony]] of [[England]] by King James I. This meant that the Crown took direct authority rather than allowing guidance by the [[London Company]]. The Crown could exercise its patronage for royal favorites. Settlers continued to encroach on land of the Powhatan tribes, and the colony (and England) tended to change or ignore agreements with the natives when no longer in the colony's interest.  The tribes felt increasing frustration with the settlers.\n\nThe next major confrontation with the Powhatan, the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#Third Anglo-Powhatan War|Third Anglo-Powhatan War]], occurred in 1644, resulting in the deaths of about 500 colonists.  While similar to the death toll in 1622, the loss a generation later represented less than ten percent of the population, and had far less impact upon the colony. This time, the elder Opechancanough, who was being transported by litter, was captured by the colonists. Imprisoned at Jamestown, he was killed by one of his guards.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Spencer C. Tucker|author2=James R.

Its member tribes eventually left the area entirely, gradually lived among the colonists, or lived on one of the few reservations established in Virginia. Most of these were also subject to incursion and seizure of land by the ever-expanding European population.\n\nIn modern times, seven tribes of the original Powhatan Confederacy are recognized in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

[[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not an eyewitness, related in his ''History of Virginia'' that braves of the [[Powhatan]] \"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\".<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/659023 James Mooney, \"The Powhatan Confederacy, Past and Present],\" ''American Anthropologist'' 9, no. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1907), 129\u201352.</ref> The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all the English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages. Chief [[Opchanacanough|Opechancanough]] led the Powhatan Confederacy in a coordinated series of surprise attacks; they killed 347 people, a quarter of the population of the Virginia colony.\n\n[[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 72. \"By 1620 the colonists were simply taking the acres they required for their expanding tobacco economy without even the pretense of negotiation or payment. Increasing encroachments on native American lands, and particularly onto their hunting grounds, largely accounted for the deterioration of relations between the English and the indigenous populations of the Tidewater Chesapeake that finally exploded in 1622.\"</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nAt first, the natives were glad to trade provisions to the colonists for metal tools, but by 1609 the English governor, John Smith, had begun to send raiding parties to demand food. This earned the colonists a bad reputation among the Native Americans and precipitated conflict.<ref>Fausz, ''An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) p. 20</ref> They isolated the Native Americans, burned down houses, and stole their food supplies.<ref>Fausz, \n Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) pp. 6, 22.</ref> The English violence alienated the natives further and they laid siege to the Jamestown fort for several months. Unable to secure more food supplies, many colonists died during the \"[[Starving Time]]\" in 1609\u201310.<ref>Fausz, ''An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) p. 54.</ref>\n\n[[London Company|The London Company]]'s primary concern was the survival of the colony. In England's best interest the colonists would have to maintain civil relations with the Powhatan. The Powhatan and the English realized that they could benefit from each other through trade once peace was restored. In exchange for food, the chief asked the colonists to provide him with metal hatchets and copper.<ref>Jay B. Hubbell, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4246320  The Smith-Pocahontas Story in Literature],\" ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' 65, no. 3 (Jul., 1957), 275\u2013300.</ref> Unlike John Smith, other early leaders of Virginia such as [[Thomas Dale]] and [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] based their actions on different thinking, as they were military men and saw the Powhatan as essentially a \"military problem.\"<ref>Glenn, ''Captain John Smith and the Indians'', 228\u201348.</ref>\n\nThe Powhatan had soon realized that the Englishmen did not settle in Jamestown to trade with them.  The English wanted more; they wanted control over the land. As [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]] said:\n\n{{quote|Your coming is not for trade, but to invade my people and possess my country\u2026Having seen the death of all my people thrice\u2026 I know the difference of peace and were better than any other Country.  [If he fought the English, Powhatan predicted], he would be so haunted by Smith that he can neither rest eat nor sleep, but his tired men must watch, and if a twig but break, every one cry, there comes Captain John Smith; then he must fly he know not whether, and thus with miserable fear end his miserable life<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\">Alden T.

As the colonists were about to leave the Bay and head out into the open sea, they were met by the incoming fleet of [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]]. Taking command as governor, de la Warr ordered the fort reoccupied. He plotted conquest of the surrounding tribes.<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" />\n\nIn July 1610 he sent Gates against the Kecoughtan people. \"Gates lured the Indians into the open by means of music-and-dance act by his drummer, and then slaughtered them\".<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" /> This was the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#First Anglo-Powhatan War|First Anglo-Powhatan War]]. The English, led by [[Samuel Argall]], captured [[Pocahontas]], daughter of Powhatan, and held her hostage until he would agree to their demands. \"English demanded that all Powhatan captives be released, return all English weapons taken by his warriors, and agree upon a lasting peace\".\n\nIt was while Pocahontas was held by the English that she met [[John Rolfe]], whom she later married. While in captivity, Pocahontas was taught the English language, and she learned about English customs and religion. She was baptized as a Christian and took the name Rebecca. Rolfe wrote that the way to maintain peace between the Powhatan and the English, was to marry Pocahontas, not \"with the unbridled desire of carnal affection but for the good of the colony and the glory of God. Such a marriage might bring peace between the warring English and Powhatan, just as it would satisfy Pocahontas's desire.\"<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" /> After they married, there were more peaceful relations for a time between the English colonists and the Powhatan Confederacy. Edward Waterhouse, secretary of the Virginia Company, wrote:\n\n{{quote|[S]uch was the conceit of firme peace and amitie, as that there was seldome or never a sword worne, and a Peece [firearm] seldomer, except for a Deere or Fowle....The Plantations of particular Adventurers and Planters were placed scatteringly and straglingly as a choyce veyne of rich ground invited them, and the further from neighbors held the better.

Their youngest brother, [[Opchanacanough]], was probably the effective leader, with his friend, war-chief and advisor [[Nemattanew]], and both of them did not believe peaceful relations with the colonists could be maintained. Perhaps in 1620-1621 Opitchapam retired or he was deposed (but possibly he died in 1630) and he was succeeded by his youngest brother, and Opchanacanough and Nemattanew began to predispose plans for the unavoidable war. Having recovered from their defeat commanding [[Pamunkey]] warriors during the First Anglo-Powhatan War, they planned to shock the English with an attack that would leave them contained in a small trading outpost, rather than expanding throughout the area with new plantations.<ref name = \"Bailyn\">{{cite book | last = Bailyn | first = Bernard | authorlink = Bernard Bailyn | year = 2012 | title = The Barbarous Years: The Peopling of British North America: The Conflict of Civilizations, 1600\u20131675 | publisher = [[Alfred A.

The Indian woke Pace and told him of the planned attack.  Living across the river from Jamestown, Pace secured his family and rowed to the settlement to spread the alarm. Jamestown increased its defenses.\n\nThe name of the Indian who warned Pace is not recorded in any of the contemporary accounts.  Although legend has named him \"[[Chanco]]\", this may be a misidentification.  An Indian named \"Chauco\" is mentioned in a letter from the Virginia Council to the Virginia Company of London dated April 4, 1623.

The attack took place on March 22, 1621 as reckoned by the colonists, three days before New Years Day 1622. [[Historians]], [[genealogists]], and others who work with dates in this era commonly denote Julian calendar dates in the interval between January 1 and March 24 with the '[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]' suffix (OS) when presenting these dates with their original year value, or to use a [[dual dating]] syntax which combines original and adjusted values.  For example, the date of the attack on Jamestown can be denoted as March 22, 1621(OS), or March 22, 1621/22. The common practice of showing the date as March 22, 1622 is technically inaccurate, but less confusing for those who are unfamiliar with the differences in calendaring systems.\n\nUnder the retroactively-applied modern [[Gregorian calendar]], the date of the attack was April 1, 1622.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{details|Anglo-Powhatan Wars}}\nOpechancanough withdrew his warriors, believing that the English would behave as Native Americans would when defeated: pack up and leave, or learn their lesson and respect the power of the Powhatan.<ref>Helen C. Rountree and E. Randolph Turner III, ''Before and After Jamestown: Virginia's Powhatans and Their Predecessors''</ref>  Following the event, Opechancanough told the [[Patawomeck]], who were not part of the Confederacy and had remained neutral, that he expected \"before the end of two Moones there should not be an Englishman in all their Countries.\"<ref>Helen Rountree, ''Pocahontas's People'' p. 75, citing John Smith's 1624 ''Generall Historie''.</ref> He misunderstood the English colonists and their backers overseas.\n\nThe surviving English settlers were in shock after the attacks. As they began to recover, the men worked on a plan of action. \"By unanimous decision both the council and planters it was agreed to draw people together into fewer settlements\" for better defense.<ref>\"\"to quitt many of our Plantacons and to vnite more neerely together in fewer places the better for to Strengthen and Defende ourselve.\", Gov. Francis Wyatt, quoted in [http://www.apva.org/resource/other/sandys.pdf Seth Mallios, \"At the Edge of the Precipice: Frontier Ventures, Jamestown\u2019s Hinterland, and the Archaeology of 44JC802\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724094320/http://www.apva.org/resource/other/sandys.pdf |date=July 24, 2008 }}, ''APVA Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities'', July 2000</ref>  The colony intended to gather men together to plan attack, but this was difficult because of the survivors, \"two-thirds were said to have been women and children and men who were unable to work or to go against the Indians\".<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4246389 William S. Powell, \"Aftermath of the Massacre]: The First Indian War, 1622\u20131632\", ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'', Vol. 66, no. 1 (Jan., 1958), pp. 44\u201375</ref>\n\nIn England \nwhen the [[massacre]] occurred, John Smith believed that the settlers would not leave their plantations to defend the colony.  He planned to return with a ship filled with soldiers, sailors, and ammunition, to establish a \"running Army\" able to fight the Powhatan. Smith's goal was to \"inforce the Savages to leave their Country, or bring them in the feare of subjection that every man should follow their business securely\",<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\" /> but Smith never returned to Virginia.\n\nThe English took revenge against the Powhatan by \"the use of force, surprise attacks, famine resulting from the burning of their corn, destroying their boats, canoes, and houses, breaking their fishing [[weir]]s and assaulting them in their hunting expedition, pursuing them with horses and using [[bloodhound]]s to find them and [[mastiff]]s to seaze them, driving them to flee within reach of their enemies among other tribes, and 'assimilating and abetting their enemies against them\".<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\" />\n\nThe 1622 massacre was used as a justification for ongoing seizure of Powhatan land by the colonists for the next ten years. Historian Betty Wood writes:\n\n<blockquote>What is usually referred to as the \"Massacre of 1622,\" the native American attack that resulted in the death of 347 English settlers and almost wiped out Jamestown, gave the colonists the excuse they needed to take even more of what they wanted from the indigenous population of the Chesapeake. As far as the survivors of the Massacre of 1622 were concerned, by virtue of launching this unprovoked assault native Americans had forfeited any legal and moral rights they might previously have claimed to the ownership of the lands they occupied.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 72.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWood quotes a Virginian settler:\n\n<blockquote>We, who hitherto have had possession of no more ground than their waste and our purchase at a valuable consideration to their own contentment. . . may now by right of war, and law of nations, invade the country, and those who sought to destroy us: whereby we shall enjoy their cultivated places.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 73.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Indian decline and defeat==\nIn 1624 Virginia was made a [[crown colony|royal colony]] of [[England]] by King James I. This meant that the Crown took direct authority rather than allowing guidance by the [[London Company]]. The Crown could exercise its patronage for royal favorites. Settlers continued to encroach on land of the Powhatan tribes, and the colony (and England) tended to change or ignore agreements with the natives when no longer in the colony's interest.  The tribes felt increasing frustration with the settlers.\n\nThe next major confrontation with the Powhatan, the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#Third Anglo-Powhatan War|Third Anglo-Powhatan War]], occurred in 1644, resulting in the deaths of about 500 colonists.  While similar to the death toll in 1622, the loss a generation later represented less than ten percent of the population, and had far less impact upon the colony. This time, the elder Opechancanough, who was being transported by litter, was captured by the colonists. Imprisoned at Jamestown, he was killed by one of his guards.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Spencer C. Tucker|author2=James R.

Its member tribes eventually left the area entirely, gradually lived among the colonists, or lived on one of the few reservations established in Virginia. Most of these were also subject to incursion and seizure of land by the ever-expanding European population.\n\nIn modern times, seven tribes of the original Powhatan Confederacy are recognized in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  The [[Pamunkey]] and [[Mattaponi]] still have control of their reservations established in the 17th century, each located between the rivers of the same names within the boundaries of present-day [[King William County, Virginia|King William County]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of events named massacres]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last=Fausz |first=J.
