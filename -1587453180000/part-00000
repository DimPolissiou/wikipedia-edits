The [[Bell (wind instrument)|bell]] is pear-shaped and the instrument uses a [[bocal]], similar to but shorter than that of the cor anglais.\n\n== Invention and use ==\nThe oboe d'amore was invented in the eighteenth century and was first used by [[Christoph Graupner]] in his [[cantata]] ''{{Lang|de|Wie wunderbar ist Gottes G\u00fct}}'' (1717). [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote many pieces\u2014a concerto, many of his cantatas, and the {{Lang|la|Et in Spiritum sanctum|italic=no}} [[Movement (music)|movement]] of his [[Mass in B minor]]\u2014for the instrument. [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] also frequently employed the oboe d'amore.\n\nIts popularity waning in the late eighteenth century, the oboe d'amore fell into disuse for about 100 years until composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] (''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'', where the instrument represents the child), [[Claude Debussy]] (''[[Images pour orchestre#I. Gigues (1909\u20131912)|Gigues]]'', where the oboe d'amore has a long solo passage), [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Frederick Delius]], and others began using it once again in the early years of the twentieth century. It can be heard in [[Toru Takemitsu]]'s {{Lang|fr|Vers, l'arc-en-ciel, Palma}} (1984), but its most famous modern usage is, perhaps, in Ravel's ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'' (1928), where the oboe d'amore follows the [[E-flat clarinet]] to recommence the main theme for the second time. [[Gustav Mahler]] employed the instrument once, in {{lang|de|Um Mitternacht|italic=no}} (1901), one of his five ''[[R\u00fcckert-Lieder]]''. American composer [[William P. Perry|William Perry]] uses the oboe d'amore in his film scores, in the third movement of his ''Jamestown Concerto'' for cello and orchestra (2007) and most recently in his suite ''Toujours Provence'' (2018) where two are called for. In his [[orchestration]] of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] uses the oboe d'amore to highlight the plaintive solo of the {{Lang|it|Il vecchio castello|italic=no}} movement.\n\n== Modern instruments ==\nModern makers of oboes d'amore include [[Howarth of London]] (instruments in [[African blackwood]] or [[cocobolo]] wood), [[F.&nbsp;Lor\u00e9e]] in Paris (instruments in African blackwood or [[Dalbergia cearensis|violetwood]]) and others such as French makers {{ill|Rigoutat|fr}}, Fossati and [[Marigaux]], Italian maker Bulgheroni (who offer instruments in grenadilla, violetwood, cocobolo, [[rosewood]], palisander, and [[cocus wood]]), Japanese maker Joseph and German makers P\u00fcchner, M\u00f6nnig and Ludwig Franck. New instruments cost approximately [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]8,250 at 2016 prices (roughly $11,885 US), comparable to the cost of a new cor anglais. This cost, coupled with the limited call for the instrument, leads many oboists not to possess their own oboe d'amore, but to rent one when their work dictates the need.

(For other uses of the symbol \u03c3 in science and mathematics see [[Sigma#Science and mathematics|the main article]].)\n\nThe standard deviation of a [[random variable]], [[statistical population]], [[data set]], or [[probability distribution]] is the [[square root]] of its [[variance]].  It is [[algebra]]ically simpler, though in practice less [[Robust statistics|robust]], than the [[average absolute deviation]].<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Gauss  | first = Carl Friedrich  | authorlink = Carl Friedrich Gauss\n  | title = Bestimmung der Genauigkeit der Beobachtungen\n  | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Astronomie und Verwandte Wissenschaften\n  | volume = 1  | pages = 187\u2013197\n  | year = 1816 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Walker | first = Helen | title = Studies in the History of the Statistical Method\n  | publisher = Williams & Wilkins Co | year = 1931 | location = Baltimore, MD\n  | pages = 24\u201325 }}</ref>\nA useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data.\n\nIn addition to expressing the variability of a population, the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions.  For example, the [[margin of error]] in [[opinion poll|polling]] data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times.  This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the \"[[standard error]]\" of the estimate or \"standard error of the mean\" when referring to a mean.  It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed.\n\nThe standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population (such as the mean) are quite different but related (related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations). The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean (or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing) and is typically about twice the standard deviation\u2014the half-width of a 95 percent [[confidence interval]].\n\nIn science, many researchers report the standard deviation of experimental data, and by convention, only effects more than two standard deviations away from a null expectation are considered [[statistically significant]]\u2014normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations.  The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the [[rate of return]] on an investment is a measure of the [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the investment.\n\nWhen only a [[statistical sample|sample]] of data from a population is available, the term ''standard deviation of the sample'' or ''sample standard deviation'' can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data, or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the ''population standard deviation'' (the standard deviation of the entire population).\n\n==Basic examples==\n\n===Sample standard deviation of metabolic rate of northern fulmars===\n\nLogan<ref name=\"Logan2010\">{{Citation\n|last1= Logan\n|first1= Murray\n|title= Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R\n|edition=First\t\n|year=2010\n|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell\n| url = http://users.monash.edu.au/~murray/BDAR/\n}}\n</ref>\ngives the following example.

The table shows the Furness data set.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Furness data set on metabolic rates of northern fulmars\n|-\n! Sex !! Metabolic rate !! Sex !! Metabolic rate\n|-\n| Male || 525.8 || Female || 727.7\n|-\n| Male || 605.7 || Female || 1086.5\n|-\n| Male || 843.3 || Female || 1091.0\n|-\n| Male || 1195.5 || Female || 1361.3\n|-\n| Male || 1945.6 || Female || 1490.5\n|-\n| Male || 2135.6 || Female || 1956.1\n|-\n| Male || 2308.7 ||  || \n|-\n| Male || 2950.0 ||  || \n|}\n\nThe graph shows the metabolic rate for males and females. By visual inspection, it appears that the variability of the metabolic rate is greater for males than for females.\n\n[[File:Metabolic rates for northern fulmars.svg|Graph of metabolic rates for northern fulmars]]\n\nThe sample standard deviation of the metabolic rate for the female fulmars is calculated as follows. The formula for the sample standard deviation is\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },</math>\n\nwhere \n<math>\\textstyle\\{x_1,\\,x_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,x_N\\}</math> are the observed values of the sample items, <math>\\textstyle\\bar{x}</math> is the mean value of these observations, and\n''N'' is the number of observations in the sample.\n\nIn the sample standard deviation formula, for this example, the numerator is the sum of the squared deviation of each individual animal's metabolic rate from the mean metabolic rate. The table below shows the calculation of this sum of squared deviations for the female fulmars. For females, the sum of squared deviations is 886047.09, as shown in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sum of squares calculation for female fulmars\n|-\n! Animal !! Sex !! Metabolic rate !!

Squared difference from mean\n|-\n| 1 || Female || 727.7 || 1285.5 || -557.8 || 311140.84\n|-\n| 2 || Female || 1086.5 || 1285.5 || -199.0 || 39601.00\n|-\n| 3 || Female || 1091.0 || 1285.5 || -194.5 || 37830.25\n|-\n| 4 || Female || 1361.3 || 1285.5 || 75.8 || 5745.64\n|-\n| 5 || Female || 1490.5 || 1285.5 || 205.0 || 42025.00\n|-\n| 6 || Female || 1956.1 || 1285.5 || 670.6 || 449704.36\n|- \n| colspan=6 |\n|- \n| colspan=3 | ''Mean of metabolic rates'' || 1285.5 || ''Sum of squared differences'' || 886047.09\n|}\n\nThe denominator in the sample standard deviation formula is ''N'' \u2013 1, where ''N'' is the number of animals. In this example, there are ''N'' = 6 females, so the denominator is 6 \u2013 1 = 5. The sample standard deviation for the female fulmars is therefore\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{N-1} } = \\sqrt{\\frac{886047.09}{5}} = 420.96.</math>\n\nFor the male fulmars, a similar calculation gives a sample standard deviation of 894.37, approximately twice as large as the standard deviation for the females. The graph shows the metabolic rate data, the means (red dots), and the standard deviations (red lines) for females and males.\n\n[[File:SD of metabolic rate of fulmars.svg|Graph of standard deviation of metabolic rate of fulmars]]\n\nUse of the sample standard deviation implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger population of fulmars. If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population (perhaps the last 14 surviving fulmars), then instead of the sample standard deviation, the calculation would use the population standard deviation. In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator is ''N'' instead of ''N'' - 1. It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, statistical [[computer program]]s calculate the sample standard deviation. Similarly, journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified.\n\n===Population standard deviation of grades of eight students===\n\nSuppose that the entire population of interest was eight students in a particular class. For a finite set of numbers, the population standard deviation is found by taking the [[square root]] of the [[Arithmetic average|average]] of the squared deviations of the values subtracted from their average value. The marks of a class of eight students (that is, a [[statistical population]]) are the following eight values:\n: <math>2,\\  4,\\  4,\\  4,\\  5,\\  5,\\  7,\\  9.</math>\nThese eight data points have the mean (average) of 5:\n: <math> \\mu = \\frac{2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9}{8} = 5. </math>\nFirst, calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean, and [[square (algebra)|square]] the result of each:\n: <math>\n    \\begin{array}{lll}\n    (2-5)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (7-5)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (9-5)^2 = 4^2 = 16. \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n  </math>\nThe [[variance]] is the mean of these values:\n<!-- Notice:  DO NOT CHANGE the denominator below to 7. If you don't understand why it is 8, read the Talk page. -->\n:<math>\\sigma^2 = \\frac{9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16}{8} = 4.</math><!-- DO NOT CHANGE the denominator to 7. See talk page-->\n\nand the ''population'' standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{ 4 } = 2.</math>\nThis <!-- 1.  the ''population'' standard deviation, 2. \"the ''population'' standard deviation is equal to the square root of the [[variance]]\" --> formula is valid only if the eight values with which we began form the complete population. If the values instead were a random sample drawn from some large parent population (for example, they were 8 students randomly and independently chosen from a class of 2&nbsp;million), then one often divides by {{nowrap|7&nbsp;(which is ''n'' \u2212 1)}} instead of {{nowrap|8&nbsp;(which is ''n'')}} in the denominator of the last formula. In that case the result of the original formula would be called the ''sample'' standard deviation. Dividing by ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 rather than by ''n'' gives an unbiased estimate of the variance of the larger parent population. This is known as ''[[Bessel's correction]]''.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=BesselsCorrection|title=Bessel's Correction}}</ref>\n\n===Standard deviation of average height for adult men===\n\nIf the population of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the [[Average human height|average height for adult men]] in the [[United States]] is about 70&nbsp;inches (177.8&nbsp;cm), with a standard deviation of around 3&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;cm). This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a [[normal distribution]]) have a height within 3&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;cm) of the mean (67\u201373&nbsp;inches (170.18\u2013185.42&nbsp;cm)){{snd}}one standard deviation{{snd}}and almost all men (about 95%) have a height within 6&nbsp;inches (15.24&nbsp;cm) of the mean (64\u201376&nbsp;inches (162.56\u2013193.04&nbsp;cm)){{snd}}two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70&nbsp;inches (177.8&nbsp;cm) tall. If the standard deviation were 20&nbsp;inches (50.8&nbsp;cm), then men would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about 50\u201390&nbsp;inches (127\u2013228.6&nbsp;cm). Three standard deviations account for 99.7% of the sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is [[Normal distribution|normal]] (bell-shaped). (See the [[68-95-99.7 rule]], or the ''empirical rule,'' for more information.)\n\n==Definition of population values==\nLet ''X'' be a [[random variable]] with mean value ''\u03bc'':\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[X] = \\mu.\\,\\!</math>\nHere the operator E denotes the average or [[expected value]] of ''X''.  Then the standard deviation of ''X'' is the quantity\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\sigma & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[(X - \\mu)^2]}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] + \\operatorname E[-2 \\mu X] + \\operatorname E[\\mu^2]}\\\\\n            & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] -2 \\mu \\operatorname E[X] + \\mu^2}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] -2 \\mu^2 + \\mu^2}\\\\\n           & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] - \\mu^2}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2]-(\\operatorname E[X])^2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n(derived using the [[expected value#Basic properties|properties of expected value]]).\n\nIn other words, the standard deviation ''\u03c3'' ([[sigma]]) is the square root of the [[variance]] of ''X''; i.e., it is the square root of the average value of (''X''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03bc'')<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe standard deviation of a ([[univariate]]) probability distribution is the same as that of a random variable having that distribution.  Not all random variables have a standard deviation, since these expected values need not exist. For example, the standard deviation of a random variable that follows a [[Cauchy distribution]] is undefined because its expected value ''\u03bc'' is undefined.\n\n===Discrete random variable===\nIn the case where ''X'' takes random values from a finite data set ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>N</sub>'', with each value having the same probability, the standard deviation is\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\left[(x_1-\\mu)^2 + (x_2-\\mu)^2 + \\cdots + (x_N - \\mu)^2\\right]}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} (x_1 + \\cdots + x_N),</math>\n\nor, using [[summation]] notation,\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i.</math><!-- In the previous, not N - 1 but N.  This is the whole population. -->\n\nIf, instead of having equal probabilities, the values have different probabilities, let ''x''<sub>1</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>''N''</sub>.  In this case, the standard deviation will be\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(x_i - \\mu)^2} , {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i x_i.</math>\n\n===Continuous random variable===\nThe standard deviation of a [[continuous distribution|continuous real-valued random variable]] ''X'' with [[probability density function]] ''p''(''x'') is\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\int_\\mathbf{X} (x-\\mu)^2 \\, p(x) \\, {\\rm d} x}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\int_\\mathbf{X} x \\, p(x) \\, {\\rm d} x,</math>\n\nand where the integrals are [[definite integral]]s taken for ''x'' ranging over the set of possible values of the random variable&nbsp;''X''.\n\nIn the case of a [[parametric model|parametric family of distributions]], the standard deviation can be expressed in terms of the parameters.  For example, in the case of the [[log-normal distribution]] with parameters ''\u03bc'' and ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>, the standard deviation is\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{(e^{\\sigma^2} - 1)e^{2\\mu + \\sigma^2}}.</math>\n\n==Estimation==\n{{anchor|Estimation}}{{anchor|Sample standard deviation}}\n{{see also|Sample variance}}\n{{main|Unbiased estimation of standard deviation}}\n\nOne can find the standard deviation of an entire population in cases (such as [[Standardized testing (statistics)|standardized testing]]) where every member of a population is sampled. In cases where that cannot be done, the standard deviation ''\u03c3'' is estimated by examining a random sample taken from the population and computing a [[statistic]] of the sample, which is used as an estimate of the population standard deviation. Such a statistic is called an [[estimator]], and the estimator (or the value of the estimator, namely the estimate) is called a sample standard deviation, and is denoted by ''s'' (possibly with modifiers).\n\nUnlike in the case of estimating the population mean, for which the [[sample mean]] is a simple estimator with many desirable properties ([[unbiased estimator|unbiased]], [[Efficient estimator|efficient]], maximum likelihood), there is no single estimator for the standard deviation with all these properties, and [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]] is a very technically involved problem. Most often, the standard deviation is estimated using the ''[[#Corrected sample standard deviation|corrected sample standard deviation]]'' (using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), defined below, and this is often referred to as the \"sample standard deviation\", without qualifiers. However, other estimators are better in other respects: the uncorrected estimator (using ''N'') yields lower mean squared error, while using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5 (for the normal distribution) almost completely eliminates bias.\n\n===Uncorrected sample standard deviation===\nThe formula for the ''population'' standard deviation (of a finite population) can be applied to the sample, using the size of the sample as the size of the population (though the actual population size from which the sample is drawn may be much larger). This estimator, denoted by ''s''<sub>''N''</sub>, is known as the ''uncorrected sample standard deviation'', or sometimes the ''standard deviation of the sample'' (considered as the entire population), and is defined as follows:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n:<math>\ns_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\textstyle\\{x_1,\\,x_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,x_N\\}</math> are the observed values of the sample items and <math>\\textstyle\\bar{x}</math> is the mean value of these observations, while the denominator&nbsp;''N'' stands for the size of the sample: this is the square root of the sample variance, which is the average of the [[squared deviations]] about the sample mean.\n\nThis is a [[consistent estimator]] (it converges in probability to the population value as the number of samples goes to infinity), and is the [[maximum likelihood|maximum-likelihood estimate]] when the population is normally distributed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, this is a [[biased estimator]], as the estimates are generally too low. The bias decreases as sample size grows, dropping off as 1/''N'', and thus is most significant for small or moderate sample sizes; for <math>N > 75</math> the bias is below 1%. Thus for very large sample sizes, the uncorrected sample standard deviation is generally acceptable. This estimator also has a uniformly smaller [[mean squared error]] than the corrected sample standard deviation.\n\n===Corrected sample standard deviation===\n\nIf the ''biased [[sample variance]]'' (the second [[central moment]] of the sample, which is a downward-biased estimate of the population variance) is used to compute an estimate of the population's standard deviation, the result is\n\n:<math>\ns_N =\\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.\n</math>\nHere taking the square root introduces further downward bias, by [[Jensen's inequality]], due to the square root's being a [[concave function]]. The bias in the variance is easily corrected, but the bias from the square root is more difficult to correct, and depends on the distribution in question.\n\nAn unbiased estimator for the ''variance'' is given by applying [[Bessel's correction]], using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 instead of ''N'' to yield the ''unbiased sample variance,'' denoted ''s''<sup>2</sup>:\n:<math>s^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2.</math>\nThis estimator is unbiased if the variance exists and the sample values are drawn independently with replacement. ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 corresponds to the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] in the vector of deviations from the mean, <math>\\textstyle(x_1-\\overline{x},\\; \\dots,\\; x_n-\\overline{x}).</math>\n\nTaking square roots reintroduces bias (because the square root is a nonlinear function, which does not [[Commutative property|commute]] with the expectation), yielding the ''corrected sample standard deviation,'' denoted by ''s:''\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.</math>\nAs explained above, while ''s''<sup>2</sup> is an unbiased estimator for the population variance, ''s'' is still a biased estimator for the population standard deviation, though markedly less biased than the uncorrected sample standard deviation. This estimator is commonly used and generally known simply as the \"sample standard deviation\". The bias may still be large for small samples (''N'' less than 10). As sample size increases, the amount of bias decreases. We obtain more information and the difference between <math>\\frac{1}{N}</math> and <math>\\frac{1}{N-1}</math> becomes smaller.\n\n===Unbiased sample standard deviation===\nFor [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]], there is no formula that works across all distributions, unlike for mean and variance. Instead, ''s'' is used as a basis, and is scaled by a correction factor to produce an unbiased estimate. For the normal distribution, an unbiased estimator is given by ''s''/''c''<sub>4</sub>, where the correction factor (which depends on ''N'') is given in terms of the [[Gamma function]], and equals:\n:<math>c_4(N)\\,=\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N-1}}\\,\\,\\,\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{N-1}{2}\\right)}.</math>\nThis arises because the sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation follows a (scaled) [[chi distribution]], and the correction factor is the mean of the chi distribution.\n\nAn approximation can be given by replacing ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 with ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5, yielding:\n: <math>\n    \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N - 1.5} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },\n  </math>\nThe error in this approximation decays quadratically (as 1/''N''<sup>2</sup>), and it is suited for all but the smallest samples or highest precision: for ''N'' = 3 the bias is equal to 1.3%, and for ''N'' = 9 the bias is already less than 0.1%.\nA more accurate approximation is to replace <math>N-1.5</math> above with <math>N-1.5+1/(8(N-1))</math>.<ref>{{Citation|first1=John |last1=Gurland |first2=Ram C. |last2=Tripathi|title=A Simple Approximation for Unbiased Estimation of the Standard Deviation|journal=The American Statistician|volume=25|issue=4|year=1971|pages=30\u201332|doi=10.2307/2682923|jstor=2682923 }}</ref>\n\nFor other distributions, the correct formula depends on the distribution, but a rule of thumb is to use the further refinement of the approximation:\n: <math>\n    \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N - 1.5 - \\tfrac14 \\gamma_2} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },\n  </math>\nwhere ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub> denotes the population [[excess kurtosis]]. The excess kurtosis may be either known beforehand for certain distributions, or estimated from the data.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Confidence interval of a sampled standard deviation===\n{{see also|Margin of error|Variance#Distribution of the sample variance|Student's_t-distribution#Robust_parametric_modeling}}\nThe standard deviation we obtain by sampling a distribution is itself not absolutely accurate, both for mathematical reasons (explained here by the confidence interval) and for practical reasons of measurement (measurement error). The mathematical effect can be described by the [[confidence interval]] or CI. \nTo show how a larger sample will make the confidence interval narrower, consider the following examples: \nA small population of ''N'' = 2 has only 1 degree of freedom for estimating the standard deviation.  The result is that a 95% CI of the SD runs from 0.45&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 31.9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD;  [[Confidence interval#Statistical theory|the factors here are as follows]]:\n\n:<math> \\Pr \\left( q_{\\frac \\alpha 2} < k \\frac{s^2}{\\sigma^2} < q_{1-\\frac \\alpha 2} \\right) = 1-\\alpha,</math>\n\nwhere <math>q_p</math> is the ''p''-th quantile of the chi-square distribution with ''k'' degrees of freedom, and <math>1-\\alpha</math> is the confidence level.  This is equivalent to the following:\n\n:<math> \\Pr \\left( k \\frac{s^2}{q_{1-\\frac \\alpha 2}} < \\sigma^2 < k \\frac{s^2}{q_{\\frac \\alpha 2}} \\right) = 1-\\alpha.</math>\n\nWith ''k'' = 1, <math>q_{0.025} = 0.000982</math> and <math>q_{0.975} = 5.024</math>.  The reciprocals of the square roots of these two numbers give us the factors 0.45 and 31.9 given above.\n\nA larger population of ''N'' = 10 has 9 degrees of freedom for estimating the standard deviation.  The same computations as above give us in this case a 95% CI running from 0.69&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 1.83&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD. So even with a sample population of 10, the actual SD can still be almost a factor 2 higher than the sampled SD. For a sample population N=100, this is down to 0.88&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 1.16&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD. To be more certain that the sampled SD is close to the actual SD we need to sample a large number of points.\n\nThese same formulae can be used to obtain confidence intervals on the variance of residuals from a [[least squares]] fit under standard normal theory, where ''k'' is now the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for error.\n\n===Bounds on standard deviation===\nFor a set of  ''N'' > 4 data spanning a range of values ''R'', an upper bound on the standard deviation ''s'' is given by ''s = 0.6R''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9639.1980.tb00398.x| title=Upper and Lower Bounds for the Sample Standard Deviation| journal=Teaching Statistics| volume=2| issue=3| pages=84\u201386| year=1980| last1=Shiffler| first1=Ronald E.| last2=Harsha| first2=Phillip D.}}</ref> \nAn estimate of the standard deviation for ''N'' > 100 data taken to be approximately normal follows from the heuristic that 95% of the area under the normal curve lies roughly two standard deviations to either side of the mean, so that, with 95% probability the total range of values ''R'' represents four standard deviations so that ''s \u2248 R/4''. This so-called range rule is useful in [[sample size]] estimation, as the range of possible values is easier to estimate than the standard deviation.

Red population has mean 100 and SD 10; blue population has mean 100 and SD 50.]]\nA large standard deviation indicates that the data points can spread far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean.\n\nFor example, each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. Their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7.  These standard deviations have the same units as the data points themselves. If, for instance, the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years. As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes, measured in meters. It has a mean of 1007 meters, and a standard deviation of 5 meters.\n\nStandard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty.  In physical science, for example, the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated [[measurement]]s gives the [[accuracy and precision|precision]] of those measurements.  When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance: if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction (with the distance measured in standard deviations), then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised. This makes sense since they fall outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur, if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified.  See [[prediction interval]].\n\nWhile the standard deviation does measure how far typical values tend to be from the mean, other measures are available. An example is the [[mean absolute deviation]], which might be considered a more direct measure of average distance, compared to the [[Root-mean-square deviation|root mean square distance]] inherent in the standard deviation.\n\n===Application examples===\nThe practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation there is from the average (mean).\n\n====Experiment, industrial and hypothesis testing====\nStandard deviation is often used to compare real-world data against a model to test the model.\nFor example, in industrial applications the weight of products coming off a production line may need to comply with a legally required value. By weighing some fraction of the products an average weight can be found, which will always be slightly different from the long-term average. By using standard deviations, a minimum and maximum value can be calculated that the averaged weight will be within some very high percentage of the time (99.9% or more). If it falls outside the range then the production process may need to be corrected. Statistical tests such as these are particularly important when the testing is relatively expensive. For example, if the product needs to be opened and drained and weighed, or if the product was otherwise used up by the test.\n\nIn experimental science, a theoretical model of reality is used. [[Particle physics]] conventionally uses a standard of \"5 sigma\" for the declaration of a discovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=103 |title=What does the 5 sigma mean? |publisher=Physics.org |accessdate=2019-02-05}}</ref> A five-sigma level translates to one chance in 3.5 million that a random fluctuation would yield the result.

It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland. Thus, while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature, the standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as, on any particular day, the actual maximum temperature is more likely to be farther from the average maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one.\n\n====Finance====\nIn finance, standard deviation is often used as a measure of the [[Risk#Finance|risk]] associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edupristine.com/blog/what-is-standard-deviation |title=What is Standard Deviation |publisher=Pristine |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is an important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as [[Modern portfolio theory|mean-variance optimization]]). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.\n\nFor example, assume an investor had to choose between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, with a standard deviation of 20 [[percentage point]]s (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, an investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to \u221210 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to \u221250 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).\n\nCalculating the average (or arithmetic mean) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the expected return of the asset. For each period, subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the difference from the mean.  Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of the return of the asset.  The larger the variance, the greater risk the security carries.  Finding the square root of this variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question.\n\nPopulation standard deviation is used to set the width of [[Bollinger Bands]], a widely adopted [[technical analysis]] tool. For example, the upper Bollinger Band is given as {{nowrap|<span style{{=}}\"text-decoration:overline;\">''x''</span> + ''n\u03c3<sub>x</sub>''.}} The most commonly used value for ''n'' is 2; there is about a five percent chance of going outside, assuming a normal distribution of returns.\n\nFinancial time series are known to be non-stationary series, whereas the statistical calculations above, such as standard deviation, apply only to stationary series. To apply the above statistical tools to non-stationary series, the series first must be transformed to a stationary series, enabling use of statistical tools that now have a valid basis from which to work.\n\n===Geometric interpretation===\nTo gain some geometric insights and clarification, we will start with a population of three values, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>. This defines a point ''P'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>) in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. Consider the line ''L'' = {(''r'', ''r'', ''r'') : ''r'' \u2208 '''R'''}. This is the \"main diagonal\" going through the origin. If our three given values were all equal, then the standard deviation would be zero and ''P'' would lie on ''L''. So it is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the ''distance'' of ''P'' to ''L''. That is indeed the case. To move orthogonally from ''L'' to the point ''P'', one begins at the point:\n\n:<math>M = (\\overline{x},\\overline{x},\\overline{x})</math>\n\nwhose coordinates are the mean of the values we started out with. \n{{Collapse top|title=Derivation of <math>M = (\\overline{x},\\overline{x},\\overline{x})</math>}}\n<math>M</math> is on <math>L</math> therefore <math>M = (\\ell,\\ell,\\ell)</math> for some <math>\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\nThe line <math>L</math> is to be orthogonal to the vector from <math>M</math> to <math>P</math>.

Chebyshev's inequality ensures that, for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined, the amount of data within a number of standard deviations of the mean is at least as much as given in the following table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The standard deviation therefore is simply a scaling variable that adjusts how broad the curve will be, though it also appears in the [[normalizing constant]].\n\nIf a data distribution is approximately normal, then the proportion of data values within ''z'' standard deviations of the mean is defined by:\n\n: <math> \\text{Proportion} = \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac z {\\sqrt 2}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\textstyle\\operatorname{erf}</math> is the [[error function]]. The proportion that is less than or equal to a number, ''x'', is given by the [[cumulative distribution function]]:\n\n: <math> \\text{Proportion} \\le x = \\frac12\\left[1 + \\operatorname{erf}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right] = \\frac12\\left[1 + \\operatorname{erf}\\left( \\frac z {\\sqrt{2}} \\right)\\right]</math>.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DistributionFunction.html |author= Eric W.

In a certain sense, the standard deviation is a \"natural\" measure of [[statistical dispersion]] if the center of the data is measured about the mean. This is because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point. The precise statement is the following: suppose ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are real numbers and define the function:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - r)^2}.</math>\n\nUsing [[calculus]] or by [[completing the square]], it is possible to show that ''\u03c3''(''r'') has a unique minimum at the mean:\n\n:<math>r = \\overline{x}.\\,</math>\n\nVariability can also be measured by the [[coefficient of variation]], which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.  It is a [[dimensionless number]].\n\n===Standard deviation of the mean===\n{{Main|Standard error of the mean}}\nOften, we want some information about the precision of the mean we obtained. We can obtain this by determining the standard deviation of the sampled mean.\nAssuming statistical independence of the values in the sample, the standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by:\n\n:<math>\\sigma_{\\text{mean}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sigma</math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the number of observations in the sample used to estimate the mean. This can easily be proven with (see [[Variance#Basic properties|basic properties of the variance]]):\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}(X) &\\equiv \\sigma^2_X\\\\\n\\operatorname{var}(X_1+X_2) &\\equiv \\operatorname{var}(X_1) + \\operatorname{var}(X_2)\\\\  \n\\end{align}</math>\n(Statistical Independence is assumed.)\n:<math>\\begin{align}  \n\\operatorname{var}(cX_1) &\\equiv c^2 \\, \\operatorname{var}(X_1)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nhence\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}(\\text{mean})\n &= \\operatorname{var}\\left (\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\right)\n   = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\operatorname{var}\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\right ) \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\operatorname{var}(X_i)\n   = \\frac{N}{N^2} \\operatorname{var}(X)\n   = \\frac{1}{N} \\operatorname{var} (X).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nResulting in:\n:<math>\\sigma_\\text{mean} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}.</math>\nIn order to estimate the standard deviation of the mean <math>\\sigma_\\text{mean}</math> it is necessary to know the standard deviation of the entire population <math>\\sigma</math> beforehand. However, in most applications this parameter is unknown. For example, if a series of 10 measurements of a previously unknown quantity is performed in a laboratory, it is possible to calculate the resulting sample mean and sample standard deviation, but it is impossible to calculate the standard deviation of the mean.\n\n==Rapid calculation methods==\n{{See also|Algorithms for calculating variance}}\nThe following two formulas can represent a running (repeatedly updated) standard deviation. A set of two power sums ''s''<sub>1</sub> and ''s''<sub>2</sub> are computed over a set of ''N'' values of ''x'', denoted as ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\ s_j=\\sum_{k=1}^N{x_k^j}.</math>\n\nGiven the results of these running summations, the values ''N'', ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub> can be used at any time to compute the ''current'' value of the running standard deviation:\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\frac{\\sqrt{Ns_2-s_1^2} }{N}</math>\n\nWhere N, as mentioned above, is the size of the set of values (or can also be regarded as ''s''<sub>0</sub>).\n\nSimilarly for sample standard deviation,\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{Ns_2-s_1^2}{N(N-1)}}.</math>\n\nIn a computer implementation, as the three ''s''<sub>''j''</sub> sums become large, we need to consider [[round-off error]], [[arithmetic overflow]], and [[arithmetic underflow]]. The method below calculates the running sums method with reduced rounding errors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Welford, BP |title=Note on a Method for Calculating Corrected Sums of Squares and Products |journal=Technometrics |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=August 1962 |pages=419\u2013420 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1962.10490022|citeseerx=10.1.1.302.7503 }}</ref> This is a \"one pass\" algorithm for calculating variance of ''n'' samples without the need to store prior data during the calculation.

For example, the [[margin of error]] in [[opinion poll|polling]] data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times.  This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the \"[[standard error]]\" of the estimate or \"standard error of the mean\" when referring to a mean.  It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed.\n\nThe standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population (such as the mean) are quite different but related (related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations). The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean (or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing) and is typically about twice the standard deviation\u2014the half-width of a 95 percent [[confidence interval]].\n\nIn science, many researchers report the standard deviation of experimental data, and by convention, only effects more than two standard deviations away from a null expectation are considered [[statistically significant]]\u2014normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations.  The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the [[rate of return]] on an investment is a measure of the [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the investment.\n\nWhen only a [[statistical sample|sample]] of data from a population is available, the term ''standard deviation of the sample'' or ''sample standard deviation'' can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data, or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the ''population standard deviation'' (the standard deviation of the entire population).\n\n==Basic examples==\n\n===Sample standard deviation of metabolic rate of northern fulmars===\n\nLogan<ref name=\"Logan2010\">{{Citation\n|last1= Logan\n|first1= Murray\n|title= Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R\n|edition=First\t\n|year=2010\n|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell\n| url = http://users.monash.edu.au/~murray/BDAR/\n}}\n</ref>\ngives the following example.

By visual inspection, it appears that the variability of the metabolic rate is greater for males than for females.\n\n[[File:Metabolic rates for northern fulmars.svg|Graph of metabolic rates for northern fulmars]]\n\nThe sample standard deviation of the metabolic rate for the female fulmars is calculated as follows.

The table below shows the calculation of this sum of squared deviations for the female fulmars. For females, the sum of squared deviations is 886047.09, as shown in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sum of squares calculation for female fulmars\n|-\n! Animal !! Sex !! Metabolic rate !!

The sample standard deviation for the female fulmars is therefore\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{N-1} } = \\sqrt{\\frac{886047.09}{5}} = 420.96.</math>\n\nFor the male fulmars, a similar calculation gives a sample standard deviation of 894.37, approximately twice as large as the standard deviation for the females. The graph shows the metabolic rate data, the means (red dots), and the standard deviations (red lines) for females and males.\n\n[[File:SD of metabolic rate of fulmars.svg|Graph of standard deviation of metabolic rate of fulmars]]\n\nUse of the sample standard deviation implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger population of fulmars. If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population (perhaps the last 14 surviving fulmars), then instead of the sample standard deviation, the calculation would use the population standard deviation. In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator is ''N'' instead of ''N'' - 1. It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, statistical [[computer program]]s calculate the sample standard deviation. Similarly, journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified.\n\n===Population standard deviation of grades of eight students===\n\nSuppose that the entire population of interest was eight students in a particular class. For a finite set of numbers, the population standard deviation is found by taking the [[square root]] of the [[Arithmetic average|average]] of the squared deviations of the values subtracted from their average value. The marks of a class of eight students (that is, a [[statistical population]]) are the following eight values:\n: <math>2,\\  4,\\  4,\\  4,\\  5,\\  5,\\  7,\\  9.</math>\nThese eight data points have the mean (average) of 5:\n: <math> \\mu = \\frac{2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9}{8} = 5. </math>\nFirst, calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean, and [[square (algebra)|square]] the result of each:\n: <math>\n    \\begin{array}{lll}\n    (2-5)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (7-5)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (9-5)^2 = 4^2 = 16. \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n  </math>\nThe [[variance]] is the mean of these values:\n<!-- Notice:  DO NOT CHANGE the denominator below to 7. If you don't understand why it is 8, read the Talk page. -->\n:<math>\\sigma^2 = \\frac{9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16}{8} = 4.</math><!-- DO NOT CHANGE the denominator to 7. See talk page-->\n\nand the ''population'' standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{ 4 } = 2.</math>\nThis <!-- 1.  the ''population'' standard deviation, 2. \"the ''population'' standard deviation is equal to the square root of the [[variance]]\" --> formula is valid only if the eight values with which we began form the complete population. If the values instead were a random sample drawn from some large parent population (for example, they were 8 students randomly and independently chosen from a class of 2&nbsp;million), then one often divides by {{nowrap|7&nbsp;(which is ''n'' \u2212 1)}} instead of {{nowrap|8&nbsp;(which is ''n'')}} in the denominator of the last formula. In that case the result of the original formula would be called the ''sample'' standard deviation. Dividing by ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 rather than by ''n'' gives an unbiased estimate of the variance of the larger parent population. This is known as ''[[Bessel's correction]]''.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=BesselsCorrection|title=Bessel's Correction}}</ref>\n\n===Standard deviation of average height for adult men===\n\nIf the population of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the [[Average human height|average height for adult men]] in the [[United States]] is about 70&nbsp;inches (177.8&nbsp;cm), with a standard deviation of around 3&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;cm). This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a [[normal distribution]]) have a height within 3&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;cm) of the mean (67\u201373&nbsp;inches (170.18\u2013185.42&nbsp;cm)){{snd}}one standard deviation{{snd}}and almost all men (about 95%) have a height within 6&nbsp;inches (15.24&nbsp;cm) of the mean (64\u201376&nbsp;inches (162.56\u2013193.04&nbsp;cm)){{snd}}two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70&nbsp;inches (177.8&nbsp;cm) tall. If the standard deviation were 20&nbsp;inches (50.8&nbsp;cm), then men would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about 50\u201390&nbsp;inches (127\u2013228.6&nbsp;cm). Three standard deviations account for 99.7% of the sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is [[Normal distribution|normal]] (bell-shaped). (See the [[68-95-99.7 rule]], or the ''empirical rule,'' for more information.)\n\n==Definition of population values==\nLet ''X'' be a [[random variable]] with mean value ''\u03bc'':\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[X] = \\mu.\\,\\!</math>\nHere the operator E denotes the average or [[expected value]] of ''X''.  Then the standard deviation of ''X'' is the quantity\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\sigma & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[(X - \\mu)^2]}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] + \\operatorname E[-2 \\mu X] + \\operatorname E[\\mu^2]}\\\\\n            & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] -2 \\mu \\operatorname E[X] + \\mu^2}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] -2 \\mu^2 + \\mu^2}\\\\\n           & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] - \\mu^2}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2]-(\\operatorname E[X])^2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n(derived using the [[expected value#Basic properties|properties of expected value]]).\n\nIn other words, the standard deviation ''\u03c3'' ([[sigma]]) is the square root of the [[variance]] of ''X''; i.e., it is the square root of the average value of (''X''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03bc'')<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe standard deviation of a ([[univariate]]) probability distribution is the same as that of a random variable having that distribution.  Not all random variables have a standard deviation, since these expected values need not exist. For example, the standard deviation of a random variable that follows a [[Cauchy distribution]] is undefined because its expected value ''\u03bc'' is undefined.\n\n===Discrete random variable===\nIn the case where ''X'' takes random values from a finite data set ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>N</sub>'', with each value having the same probability, the standard deviation is\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\left[(x_1-\\mu)^2 + (x_2-\\mu)^2 + \\cdots + (x_N - \\mu)^2\\right]}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} (x_1 + \\cdots + x_N),</math>\n\nor, using [[summation]] notation,\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i.</math><!-- In the previous, not N - 1 but N.  This is the whole population. -->\n\nIf, instead of having equal probabilities, the values have different probabilities, let ''x''<sub>1</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>''N''</sub>.  In this case, the standard deviation will be\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(x_i - \\mu)^2} , {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i x_i.</math>\n\n===Continuous random variable===\nThe standard deviation of a [[continuous distribution|continuous real-valued random variable]] ''X'' with [[probability density function]] ''p''(''x'') is\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\int_\\mathbf{X} (x-\\mu)^2 \\, p(x) \\, {\\rm d} x}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\int_\\mathbf{X} x \\, p(x) \\, {\\rm d} x,</math>\n\nand where the integrals are [[definite integral]]s taken for ''x'' ranging over the set of possible values of the random variable&nbsp;''X''.\n\nIn the case of a [[parametric model|parametric family of distributions]], the standard deviation can be expressed in terms of the parameters.  For example, in the case of the [[log-normal distribution]] with parameters ''\u03bc'' and ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>, the standard deviation is\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{(e^{\\sigma^2} - 1)e^{2\\mu + \\sigma^2}}.</math>\n\n==Estimation==\n{{anchor|Estimation}}{{anchor|Sample standard deviation}}\n{{see also|Sample variance}}\n{{main|Unbiased estimation of standard deviation}}\n\nOne can find the standard deviation of an entire population in cases (such as [[Standardized testing (statistics)|standardized testing]]) where every member of a population is sampled. In cases where that cannot be done, the standard deviation ''\u03c3'' is estimated by examining a random sample taken from the population and computing a [[statistic]] of the sample, which is used as an estimate of the population standard deviation. Such a statistic is called an [[estimator]], and the estimator (or the value of the estimator, namely the estimate) is called a sample standard deviation, and is denoted by ''s'' (possibly with modifiers).\n\nUnlike in the case of estimating the population mean, for which the [[sample mean]] is a simple estimator with many desirable properties ([[unbiased estimator|unbiased]], [[Efficient estimator|efficient]], maximum likelihood), there is no single estimator for the standard deviation with all these properties, and [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]] is a very technically involved problem. Most often, the standard deviation is estimated using the ''[[#Corrected sample standard deviation|corrected sample standard deviation]]'' (using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), defined below, and this is often referred to as the \"sample standard deviation\", without qualifiers. However, other estimators are better in other respects: the uncorrected estimator (using ''N'') yields lower mean squared error, while using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5 (for the normal distribution) almost completely eliminates bias.\n\n===Uncorrected sample standard deviation===\nThe formula for the ''population'' standard deviation (of a finite population) can be applied to the sample, using the size of the sample as the size of the population (though the actual population size from which the sample is drawn may be much larger). This estimator, denoted by ''s''<sub>''N''</sub>, is known as the ''uncorrected sample standard deviation'', or sometimes the ''standard deviation of the sample'' (considered as the entire population), and is defined as follows:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n:<math>\ns_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\textstyle\\{x_1,\\,x_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,x_N\\}</math> are the observed values of the sample items and <math>\\textstyle\\bar{x}</math> is the mean value of these observations, while the denominator&nbsp;''N'' stands for the size of the sample: this is the square root of the sample variance, which is the average of the [[squared deviations]] about the sample mean.\n\nThis is a [[consistent estimator]] (it converges in probability to the population value as the number of samples goes to infinity), and is the [[maximum likelihood|maximum-likelihood estimate]] when the population is normally distributed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, this is a [[biased estimator]], as the estimates are generally too low. The bias decreases as sample size grows, dropping off as 1/''N'', and thus is most significant for small or moderate sample sizes; for <math>N > 75</math> the bias is below 1%. Thus for very large sample sizes, the uncorrected sample standard deviation is generally acceptable. This estimator also has a uniformly smaller [[mean squared error]] than the corrected sample standard deviation.\n\n===Corrected sample standard deviation===\n\nIf the ''biased [[sample variance]]'' (the second [[central moment]] of the sample, which is a downward-biased estimate of the population variance) is used to compute an estimate of the population's standard deviation, the result is\n\n:<math>\ns_N =\\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.\n</math>\nHere taking the square root introduces further downward bias, by [[Jensen's inequality]], due to the square root's being a [[concave function]]. The bias in the variance is easily corrected, but the bias from the square root is more difficult to correct, and depends on the distribution in question.\n\nAn unbiased estimator for the ''variance'' is given by applying [[Bessel's correction]], using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 instead of ''N'' to yield the ''unbiased sample variance,'' denoted ''s''<sup>2</sup>:\n:<math>s^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2.</math>\nThis estimator is unbiased if the variance exists and the sample values are drawn independently with replacement. ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 corresponds to the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] in the vector of deviations from the mean, <math>\\textstyle(x_1-\\overline{x},\\; \\dots,\\; x_n-\\overline{x}).</math>\n\nTaking square roots reintroduces bias (because the square root is a nonlinear function, which does not [[Commutative property|commute]] with the expectation), yielding the ''corrected sample standard deviation,'' denoted by ''s:''\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.</math>\nAs explained above, while ''s''<sup>2</sup> is an unbiased estimator for the population variance, ''s'' is still a biased estimator for the population standard deviation, though markedly less biased than the uncorrected sample standard deviation. This estimator is commonly used and generally known simply as the \"sample standard deviation\". The bias may still be large for small samples (''N'' less than 10). As sample size increases, the amount of bias decreases. We obtain more information and the difference between <math>\\frac{1}{N}</math> and <math>\\frac{1}{N-1}</math> becomes smaller.\n\n===Unbiased sample standard deviation===\nFor [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]], there is no formula that works across all distributions, unlike for mean and variance. Instead, ''s'' is used as a basis, and is scaled by a correction factor to produce an unbiased estimate. For the normal distribution, an unbiased estimator is given by ''s''/''c''<sub>4</sub>, where the correction factor (which depends on ''N'') is given in terms of the [[Gamma function]], and equals:\n:<math>c_4(N)\\,=\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N-1}}\\,\\,\\,\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{N-1}{2}\\right)}.</math>\nThis arises because the sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation follows a (scaled) [[chi distribution]], and the correction factor is the mean of the chi distribution.\n\nAn approximation can be given by replacing ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 with ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5, yielding:\n: <math>\n    \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N - 1.5} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },\n  </math>\nThe error in this approximation decays quadratically (as 1/''N''<sup>2</sup>), and it is suited for all but the smallest samples or highest precision: for ''N'' = 3 the bias is equal to 1.3%, and for ''N'' = 9 the bias is already less than 0.1%.\nA more accurate approximation is to replace <math>N-1.5</math> above with <math>N-1.5+1/(8(N-1))</math>.<ref>{{Citation|first1=John |last1=Gurland |first2=Ram C. |last2=Tripathi|title=A Simple Approximation for Unbiased Estimation of the Standard Deviation|journal=The American Statistician|volume=25|issue=4|year=1971|pages=30\u201332|doi=10.2307/2682923|jstor=2682923 }}</ref>\n\nFor other distributions, the correct formula depends on the distribution, but a rule of thumb is to use the further refinement of the approximation:\n: <math>\n    \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N - 1.5 - \\tfrac14 \\gamma_2} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },\n  </math>\nwhere ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub> denotes the population [[excess kurtosis]]. The excess kurtosis may be either known beforehand for certain distributions, or estimated from the data.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Confidence interval of a sampled standard deviation===\n{{see also|Margin of error|Variance#Distribution of the sample variance|Student's_t-distribution#Robust_parametric_modeling}}\nThe standard deviation we obtain by sampling a distribution is itself not absolutely accurate, both for mathematical reasons (explained here by the confidence interval) and for practical reasons of measurement (measurement error). The mathematical effect can be described by the [[confidence interval]] or CI. \nTo show how a larger sample will make the confidence interval narrower, consider the following examples: \nA small population of ''N'' = 2 has only 1 degree of freedom for estimating the standard deviation.  The result is that a 95% CI of the SD runs from 0.45&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 31.9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD;  [[Confidence interval#Statistical theory|the factors here are as follows]]:\n\n:<math> \\Pr \\left( q_{\\frac \\alpha 2} < k \\frac{s^2}{\\sigma^2} < q_{1-\\frac \\alpha 2} \\right) = 1-\\alpha,</math>\n\nwhere <math>q_p</math> is the ''p''-th quantile of the chi-square distribution with ''k'' degrees of freedom, and <math>1-\\alpha</math> is the confidence level.  This is equivalent to the following:\n\n:<math> \\Pr \\left( k \\frac{s^2}{q_{1-\\frac \\alpha 2}} < \\sigma^2 < k \\frac{s^2}{q_{\\frac \\alpha 2}} \\right) = 1-\\alpha.</math>\n\nWith ''k'' = 1, <math>q_{0.025} = 0.000982</math> and <math>q_{0.975} = 5.024</math>.  The reciprocals of the square roots of these two numbers give us the factors 0.45 and 31.9 given above.\n\nA larger population of ''N'' = 10 has 9 degrees of freedom for estimating the standard deviation.  The same computations as above give us in this case a 95% CI running from 0.69&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 1.83&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD. So even with a sample population of 10, the actual SD can still be almost a factor 2 higher than the sampled SD. For a sample population N=100, this is down to 0.88&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 1.16&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD. To be more certain that the sampled SD is close to the actual SD we need to sample a large number of points.\n\nThese same formulae can be used to obtain confidence intervals on the variance of residuals from a [[least squares]] fit under standard normal theory, where ''k'' is now the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for error.\n\n===Bounds on standard deviation===\nFor a set of  ''N'' > 4 data spanning a range of values ''R'', an upper bound on the standard deviation ''s'' is given by ''s = 0.6R''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9639.1980.tb00398.x| title=Upper and Lower Bounds for the Sample Standard Deviation| journal=Teaching Statistics| volume=2| issue=3| pages=84\u201386| year=1980| last1=Shiffler| first1=Ronald E.| last2=Harsha| first2=Phillip D.}}</ref> \nAn estimate of the standard deviation for ''N'' > 100 data taken to be approximately normal follows from the heuristic that 95% of the area under the normal curve lies roughly two standard deviations to either side of the mean, so that, with 95% probability the total range of values ''R'' represents four standard deviations so that ''s \u2248 R/4''. This so-called range rule is useful in [[sample size]] estimation, as the range of possible values is easier to estimate than the standard deviation.

Red population has mean 100 and SD 10; blue population has mean 100 and SD 50.]]\nA large standard deviation indicates that the data points can spread far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean.\n\nFor example, each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. Their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7.  These standard deviations have the same units as the data points themselves. If, for instance, the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years. As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes, measured in meters. It has a mean of 1007 meters, and a standard deviation of 5 meters.\n\nStandard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty.  In physical science, for example, the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated [[measurement]]s gives the [[accuracy and precision|precision]] of those measurements.  When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance: if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction (with the distance measured in standard deviations), then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised. This makes sense since they fall outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur, if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified.  See [[prediction interval]].\n\nWhile the standard deviation does measure how far typical values tend to be from the mean, other measures are available. An example is the [[mean absolute deviation]], which might be considered a more direct measure of average distance, compared to the [[Root-mean-square deviation|root mean square distance]] inherent in the standard deviation.\n\n===Application examples===\nThe practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation there is from the average (mean).\n\n====Experiment, industrial and hypothesis testing====\nStandard deviation is often used to compare real-world data against a model to test the model.\nFor example, in industrial applications the weight of products coming off a production line may need to comply with a legally required value. By weighing some fraction of the products an average weight can be found, which will always be slightly different from the long-term average. By using standard deviations, a minimum and maximum value can be calculated that the averaged weight will be within some very high percentage of the time (99.9% or more). If it falls outside the range then the production process may need to be corrected. Statistical tests such as these are particularly important when the testing is relatively expensive. For example, if the product needs to be opened and drained and weighed, or if the product was otherwise used up by the test.\n\nIn experimental science, a theoretical model of reality is used. [[Particle physics]] conventionally uses a standard of \"5 sigma\" for the declaration of a discovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=103 |title=What does the 5 sigma mean? |publisher=Physics.org |accessdate=2019-02-05}}</ref> A five-sigma level translates to one chance in 3.5 million that a random fluctuation would yield the result.

It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland. Thus, while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature, the standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as, on any particular day, the actual maximum temperature is more likely to be farther from the average maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one.\n\n====Finance====\nIn finance, standard deviation is often used as a measure of the [[Risk#Finance|risk]] associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edupristine.com/blog/what-is-standard-deviation |title=What is Standard Deviation |publisher=Pristine |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is an important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as [[Modern portfolio theory|mean-variance optimization]]). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.\n\nFor example, assume an investor had to choose between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, with a standard deviation of 20 [[percentage point]]s (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, an investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to \u221210 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to \u221250 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).\n\nCalculating the average (or arithmetic mean) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the expected return of the asset. For each period, subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the difference from the mean.  Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of the return of the asset.  The larger the variance, the greater risk the security carries.  Finding the square root of this variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question.\n\nPopulation standard deviation is used to set the width of [[Bollinger Bands]], a widely adopted [[technical analysis]] tool. For example, the upper Bollinger Band is given as {{nowrap|<span style{{=}}\"text-decoration:overline;\">''x''</span> + ''n\u03c3<sub>x</sub>''.}} The most commonly used value for ''n'' is 2; there is about a five percent chance of going outside, assuming a normal distribution of returns.\n\nFinancial time series are known to be non-stationary series, whereas the statistical calculations above, such as standard deviation, apply only to stationary series. To apply the above statistical tools to non-stationary series, the series first must be transformed to a stationary series, enabling use of statistical tools that now have a valid basis from which to work.\n\n===Geometric interpretation===\nTo gain some geometric insights and clarification, we will start with a population of three values, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>. This defines a point ''P'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>) in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. Consider the line ''L'' = {(''r'', ''r'', ''r'') : ''r'' \u2208 '''R'''}. This is the \"main diagonal\" going through the origin. If our three given values were all equal, then the standard deviation would be zero and ''P'' would lie on ''L''. So it is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the ''distance'' of ''P'' to ''L''. That is indeed the case. To move orthogonally from ''L'' to the point ''P'', one begins at the point:\n\n:<math>M = (\\overline{x},\\overline{x},\\overline{x})</math>\n\nwhose coordinates are the mean of the values we started out with. \n{{Collapse top|title=Derivation of <math>M = (\\overline{x},\\overline{x},\\overline{x})</math>}}\n<math>M</math> is on <math>L</math> therefore <math>M = (\\ell,\\ell,\\ell)</math> for some <math>\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\nThe line <math>L</math> is to be orthogonal to the vector from <math>M</math> to <math>P</math>. Therefore:\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \nL \\cdot (P-M) &= 0 \\\\[4pt]\n(r,r,r) \\cdot (x_1 - \\ell, x_2 -\\ell, x_3 -\\ell)&=0 \\\\[4pt]\nr(x_1 - \\ell+ x_2 -\\ell+ x_3 -\\ell) &=0 \\\\[4pt]\nr\\left(\\sum_i x_i - 3\\ell\\right)  &=0 \\\\[4pt]\n\\sum_i x_i - 3\\ell  &=0 \\\\[4pt]\n\\frac1{3}\\sum_i x_i &=\\ell\\\\[4pt]\n\\overline{x}&=\\ell\n\\end{align}</math>\n{{Collapse bottom}}\nA little algebra shows that the distance between ''P'' and ''M'' (which is the same as the orthogonal distance between ''P'' and the line ''L'') <math>\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_i (x_i-\\overline{x})^2}</math> is equal to the standard deviation of the vector (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>), multiplied by the square root of the number of dimensions of the vector (3 in this case).\n\n===Chebyshev's inequality===\n{{main|Chebyshev's inequality}}\nAn observation is rarely more than a few standard deviations away from the mean. Chebyshev's inequality ensures that, for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined, the amount of data within a number of standard deviations of the mean is at least as much as given in the following table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The two points of the curve that are one standard deviation from the mean are also the [[inflection point]]s.]]\n\nThe [[central limit theorem]] states that the distribution of an average of many independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward the famous bell-shaped normal distribution with a [[probability density function]] of\n\n:<math>f(x;\\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{ -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 }\n</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03bc'' is the [[expected value]] of the random variables, ''\u03c3'' equals their distribution's standard deviation divided by ''n''<sup>1/2</sup>, and ''n'' is the number of random variables.  The standard deviation therefore is simply a scaling variable that adjusts how broad the curve will be, though it also appears in the [[normalizing constant]].\n\nIf a data distribution is approximately normal, then the proportion of data values within ''z'' standard deviations of the mean is defined by:\n\n: <math> \\text{Proportion} = \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac z {\\sqrt 2}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\textstyle\\operatorname{erf}</math> is the [[error function]]. The proportion that is less than or equal to a number, ''x'', is given by the [[cumulative distribution function]]:\n\n: <math> \\text{Proportion} \\le x = \\frac12\\left[1 + \\operatorname{erf}\\left( \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right] = \\frac12\\left[1 + \\operatorname{erf}\\left( \\frac z {\\sqrt{2}} \\right)\\right]</math>.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DistributionFunction.html |author= Eric W.

In a certain sense, the standard deviation is a \"natural\" measure of [[statistical dispersion]] if the center of the data is measured about the mean. This is because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point. The precise statement is the following: suppose ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are real numbers and define the function:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - r)^2}.</math>\n\nUsing [[calculus]] or by [[completing the square]], it is possible to show that ''\u03c3''(''r'') has a unique minimum at the mean:\n\n:<math>r = \\overline{x}.\\,</math>\n\nVariability can also be measured by the [[coefficient of variation]], which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.  It is a [[dimensionless number]].\n\n===Standard deviation of the mean===\n{{Main|Standard error of the mean}}\nOften, we want some information about the precision of the mean we obtained. We can obtain this by determining the standard deviation of the sampled mean.\nAssuming statistical independence of the values in the sample, the standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by:\n\n:<math>\\sigma_{\\text{mean}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sigma</math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the number of observations in the sample used to estimate the mean. This can easily be proven with (see [[Variance#Basic properties|basic properties of the variance]]):\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}(X) &\\equiv \\sigma^2_X\\\\\n\\operatorname{var}(X_1+X_2) &\\equiv \\operatorname{var}(X_1) + \\operatorname{var}(X_2)\\\\  \n\\end{align}</math>\n(Statistical Independence is assumed.)\n:<math>\\begin{align}  \n\\operatorname{var}(cX_1) &\\equiv c^2 \\, \\operatorname{var}(X_1)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nhence\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}(\\text{mean})\n &= \\operatorname{var}\\left (\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\right)\n   = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\operatorname{var}\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\right ) \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\operatorname{var}(X_i)\n   = \\frac{N}{N^2} \\operatorname{var}(X)\n   = \\frac{1}{N} \\operatorname{var} (X).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nResulting in:\n:<math>\\sigma_\\text{mean} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}.</math>\nIn order to estimate the standard deviation of the mean <math>\\sigma_\\text{mean}</math> it is necessary to know the standard deviation of the entire population <math>\\sigma</math> beforehand. However, in most applications this parameter is unknown. For example, if a series of 10 measurements of a previously unknown quantity is performed in a laboratory, it is possible to calculate the resulting sample mean and sample standard deviation, but it is impossible to calculate the standard deviation of the mean.\n\n==Rapid calculation methods==\n{{See also|Algorithms for calculating variance}}\nThe following two formulas can represent a running (repeatedly updated) standard deviation. A set of two power sums ''s''<sub>1</sub> and ''s''<sub>2</sub> are computed over a set of ''N'' values of ''x'', denoted as ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\ s_j=\\sum_{k=1}^N{x_k^j}.</math>\n\nGiven the results of these running summations, the values ''N'', ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub> can be used at any time to compute the ''current'' value of the running standard deviation:\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\frac{\\sqrt{Ns_2-s_1^2} }{N}</math>\n\nWhere N, as mentioned above, is the size of the set of values (or can also be regarded as ''s''<sub>0</sub>).\n\nSimilarly for sample standard deviation,\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{Ns_2-s_1^2}{N(N-1)}}.</math>\n\nIn a computer implementation, as the three ''s''<sub>''j''</sub> sums become large, we need to consider [[round-off error]], [[arithmetic overflow]], and [[arithmetic underflow]].

During the early 1980s, the founders onboarded [[Howard Schultz]] as their directer of retail operations and marketing. Schultz, after visiting [[Milan|Milan, Italy]], opened a specialty cafe that merged with Starbucks in the late-1980s. His first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[British Columbia]], the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into [[California]] in the early 1990s through a series of highly-publicized [[coffee wars]]. Schultz was succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]] who ran the company for five years who positioned Starbucks as a large player in [[fair trade]] coffee and grew sales to $5 billion. [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale [[earnings]] expansion. Schultz returned as CEO in the middle of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]]. Starbucks spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around [[corporate social responsibility]]. [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] took over from Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive.\n\nMany stores sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and [[Whiskey tumbler|tumblers]]; select \"Starbucks Evenings\" locations offer [[beer]], [[wine]], and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at [[grocery stores]]. In 2010, the company began its [[Starbucks Reserve]] program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. Starbucks operates six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. In November 2019, the world's largest Starbucks opened in [[Chicago]] on the [[Magnificent Mile]] as the sixth roastery location. Starbucks has received [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] about its business practices, corporate affairs, and role in society. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial [[brand loyalty]], market share, and [[Valuation (finance)|company value]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pike Place Market - Starbucks circa 1977A.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Pike Place Market]] location in 1977]]\n\n===Founding===\nThe first Starbucks was opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 31, 1971,<ref>Starbucks [http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/store-design/1st-and-pike \"1st and Pike\"], \"Starbucks\", 2016</ref> by three partners who met while they were students at the [[University of San Francisco]]:<ref name=\"TimeOutSF\">{{cite book|author=Time Out|title=Time Out Guide San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esY90CkrXbYC|accessdate=April 9, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Time Out Guides|isbn=978-1-84670-220-4}}</ref> English teacher [[Jerry Baldwin]], history teacher [[Zev Siegl]], and writer [[Gordon Bowker]] were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur [[Alfred Peet]] after he taught them his style of roasting beans.<ref name=Pren2523>Pendergrast, pp. 252\u201353</ref> Bowker recalls that Terry Heckler, with whom Bowker owned an advertising agency, thought words beginning with \"st\" were powerful.

In 2000, San Francisco [[cartoonist]] [[Kieron Dwyer]] was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on the cover of one of his comics, later placing it on coffee mugs, T-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to [[free speech]] under U.S. law. The case was eventually settled [[Settlement (litigation)|out of court]], as Dwyer claimed he did not have the financial ability to endure a trial case with Starbucks. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially \"profiting\" from using a \"confusingly similar\" image of the Starbucks siren logo.

Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating \"helping children get clean water,\" referring to the fact that US$0.05 from each US$1.80 bottle sold (US$0.10 per bottle in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over US$6.2 million for clean water efforts, the brand is not incorporated as a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a for-profit brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date= |title= Stealing water day|url= http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110231/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php|archivedate=October 11, 2007|magazine= NOW Toronto|quote= \"Maybe they're not trying to sell anything on World Water Day, but every other day of they year they are selling water.\" |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shareholder.com/visitors/dynamicdoc/document.cfm?CompanyID=SBUX&DocumentID=1382 |title=Starbucks Corporation 2006 Annual Report |publisher=Shareholder.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands.<ref>Walker, R.

During the early 1980s, the founders onboarded [[Howard Schultz]] as their directer of retail operations and marketing. Schultz, after visiting [[Milan|Milan, Italy]], opened a specialty cafe that merged with Starbucks in the late-1980s. His first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[British Columbia]], the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into [[California]] in the early 1990s through a series of highly-publicized [[coffee wars]]. Schultz was succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]] who ran the company for five years who positioned Starbucks as a large player in [[fair trade]] coffee and grew sales to $5 billion. [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale [[earnings]] expansion. Schultz returned as CEO in the middle of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]]. Starbucks spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around [[corporate social responsibility]]. [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] took over from Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive.\n\nMany stores sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and [[Whiskey tumbler|tumblers]]; select \"Starbucks Evenings\" locations offer [[beer]], [[wine]], and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at [[grocery stores]]. In 2010, the company began its [[Starbucks Reserve]] program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. Starbucks operates six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. In November 2019, the world's largest Starbucks opened in [[Chicago]] on the [[Magnificent Mile]] as the sixth roastery location. Starbucks has received [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] about its business practices, corporate affairs, and role in society. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial [[brand loyalty]], market share, and [[Valuation (finance)|company value]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pike Place Market - Starbucks circa 1977A.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Pike Place Market]] location in 1977]]\n\n===Founding===\nThe first Starbucks was opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 31, 1971,<ref>Starbucks [http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/store-design/1st-and-pike \"1st and Pike\"], \"Starbucks\", 2016</ref> by three partners who met while they were students at the [[University of San Francisco]]:<ref name=\"TimeOutSF\">{{cite book|author=Time Out|title=Time Out Guide San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esY90CkrXbYC|accessdate=April 9, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Time Out Guides|isbn=978-1-84670-220-4}}</ref> English teacher [[Jerry Baldwin]], history teacher [[Zev Siegl]], and writer [[Gordon Bowker]] were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur [[Alfred Peet]] after he taught them his style of roasting beans.<ref name=Pren2523>Pendergrast, pp. 252\u201353</ref> Bowker recalls that Terry Heckler, with whom Bowker owned an advertising agency, thought words beginning with \"st\" were powerful.

He was the younger brother of [[Titus]] and the son of  [[Vespasian]], his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the [[Flavian dynasty]].  During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the [[Roman senate|Senate]], whose powers he drastically curtailed. \n\nDomitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]].  His 15-year reign was the longest since that of [[Tiberius]].<ref>cf. [[Roman Emperor (Principate)]] although several came within a year or two of 15-year reigns, the closest reigns to 15 years being [[Claudius]]' and [[Nero]]'s, and it was soon to be surpassed by [[Trajan]]'s</ref> As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] attempted to conquer [[Caledonia]] ([[Scotland]]), and in [[Dacia]], where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king [[Decebalus]]. Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics. Religious, military, and cultural [[propaganda]] fostered a [[cult of personality]], and by nominating himself perpetual [[Roman censor|censor]], he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army, but considered a tyrant by members of the [[Roman Senate]].\n\nDomitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor [[Nerva]]. After his death, Domitian's memory was [[damnatio memoriae|condemned to oblivion]] by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], and [[Suetonius]] propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.\n\n==Family and background==\n\n[[Image:Flavian family tree.png|thumb|450px|The [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian family]] tree, indicating the descendants of [[Titus Flavius Petro]] and Tertulla.]]\nDomitian was born in Rome on 24 October 51, the youngest son of [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]]\u2014commonly known as Vespasian\u2014and [[Domitilla the Elder|Flavia Domitilla Major]].<ref name=\"jones-domitian-1\">Jones (1992), p. 1</ref> He had an older sister, [[Domitilla the Younger]], and brother, also named [[Titus|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]].<ref>Townend (1961), p. 62</ref>\n\nDecades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during the early part of the 1st century.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-3\">Jones (1992), p. 3</ref> One such family, the Flavians, or ''gens [[Flavia (gens)|Flavia]]'', rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].

While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career. Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as [[proconsul]] of the [[Africa Province]] in 63, and accompanying the emperor Nero during an official tour of Greece in 66.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 9\u201311</ref>\n\nThat same year Jews from the [[Iudaea Province|Province of Judaea]] revolted against the Roman Empire, sparking what is now known as the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].

Titus had gained military renown during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]. After their father [[Vespasian]] became emperor in 69 following the [[civil war]] known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], Titus held a great many offices, while Domitian received honours, but no responsibilities.\n\nBy the time he was 16 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died,<ref>Waters (1964), pp. 52\u201353</ref> while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military, commanding armies in [[Germania]] and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish\u2013Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] of Rome; or possibly even [[Nerva|Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\">Jones (1992), p. 13</ref><ref>Murison (2003), p. 149</ref>\n\nHe received the education of a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]]. In his biography in the ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Suetonius]] attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as [[Homer]] or [[Virgil]] on appropriate occasions,<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#9 9]</ref><ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#12.3 12.3]</ref> and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation.<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#20 20]</ref> Among his first published works were [[poetry]], as well as writings on law and administration.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\"/>\n\nUnlike his brother Titus, Domitian was not educated at court.

His eyes were large, but his sight was somewhat dim. He was handsome and graceful too, especially when a young man, and indeed in his whole body with the exception of his feet, the toes of which were somewhat cramped. In later life he had the further disfigurement of baldness, a protruding belly, and spindling legs, though the latter had become thin from a long illness.<ref>\n[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', \"Life of Domitian\", 18</ref>}}\n\nDomitian was allegedly extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised in later life by wearing wigs.<ref>Morgan (1997), p. 214</ref> According to Suetonius, he even wrote a book on the subject of [[hair care]].<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-18\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#18 18]</ref> With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.<ref name=jones-198>Jones (1992), p. 198</ref>\n\nHistorian Brian Jones concludes in ''The Emperor Domitian'' that assessing the true nature of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources.<ref name=jones-198/> Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] sense of humour,<ref>Morgan (1997), p. 209</ref><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-21\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#21 21]</ref> and often communicated in cryptic ways.\n\nThis ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, and as he grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\"/> Indeed, by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the [[civil war]] of 69, which brought his family to power.<ref name=waters-54>Waters (1964), p. 54</ref>\n\n==Rise of the Flavian dynasty==\n\n===Year of the Four Emperors===\n[[Image:Roman Empire 69.svg|thumb|The Roman Empire during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69).

Green areas indicate provinces loyal to [[Vitellius]].]]\nOn 9 June 68, amid growing opposition of the Senate and the army, Nero committed [[suicide]] and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], during which the four most influential generals in the [[Roman Empire]]\u2014[[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vitellius]] and Vespasian\u2014successively vied for imperial power.<ref name=sullivan-69>Sullivan (1953), p. 69</ref>\n\nNews of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of [[Jerusalem]]. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] (modern northern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor.<ref name=sullivan-69/>\n\nBefore reaching Italy, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of [[Lusitania]] (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;44</ref>\n\nOtho and Vitellius realized the potential threat posed by the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him the advantage of being nearest to the vital [[History of Roman Egypt|province of Egypt]], which controlled the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply to Rome]]. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire [[Cohortes urbanae|city garrison]] of Rome.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-11\"/> Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;45</ref>\n\nWhen Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the [[First Battle of Bedriacum]], the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69.<ref name=sullivan-68>Sullivan (1953), p. 68</ref> Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with [[Mucianus|Gaius Licinius Mucianus]], the governor of Syria, against Vitellius.<ref name=sullivan-68/> A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to [[Alexandria]], leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;126</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pseudo-Vitellius Louvre MR684.jpg|thumb|A bust of Emperor [[Vitellius]] ([[Louvre]]).]]\nIn Rome, Domitian was placed under [[house arrest]] by Vitellius, as a safeguard against Flavian aggression.<ref name=waters-54/> Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69, the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian (under Marcus Antonius Primus) met at the [[Second Battle of Bedriacum#Second Battle of Bedriacum|Second Battle of Bedriacum]], which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#34|III.34]]</ref>\n\nIn despair, Vitellius attempted to negotiate a surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]]\u2014the imperial [[bodyguard]]\u2014considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty.<ref>Wellesley (2000), pp. 166, 189</ref> On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the [[Temple of Concord]] but at the last minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the [[Capitoline Hill]].<ref name=jones-14>Jones (1992), p. 14</ref>\n\nDuring the night, he was joined by his relatives, including Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of [[Isis]] and spent the night in safety with one of his father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.<ref name=jones-14/>\n\nBy the afternoon of 20 December, Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With nothing more to be feared, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house.<ref name=jones-14/> The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.<ref>Wellesley (1956), p. 213</ref>\n\n===Aftermath of the war===\n[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 047b.jpg|thumb|''[[The Conspiracy of Gaius Julius Civilis]]'' (detail), by [[Rembrandt]] (1661). During the [[Batavian rebellion]], Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory, but was denied command of a legion by superior officers.]]\n\nAlthough the war had officially ended, a state of [[anarchy]] and lawlessness pervaded in the first days following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year.<ref name=jones-14/> In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of ''Caesar'' and was appointed [[praetor]] with consular power.<ref name=jones-15>Jones (1992), p. 15</ref>\n\nThe ancient historian [[Tacitus]] describes Domitian's first speech in the Senate as brief and measured, at the same time noting his ability to elude awkward questions.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#40|IV.40]]</ref> Domitian's authority was merely [[wikt:Nominal|nominal]], however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function.<ref name=jones-15/> Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's [[wikt:Entourage|entourage]], promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and [[Antonius Primus]] and replacing them with more reliable men such as [[Marcus Arrecinus Clemens (prefect 70)|Arrecinus Clemens]].<ref name=jones-15/>\n\nEqually curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's military ambitions. The civil war of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings such as the [[Batavian rebellion|Batavian revolt]] in [[Gaul]]. [[Batavians|Batavian]] auxiliaries of the [[Rhine]] legions, led by [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], had rebelled with the aid of a faction of [[Treveri]] under the command of [[Julius Classicus]]. Seven legions were sent from Rome, led by Vespasian's brother-in-law [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]].<ref name=jones-16/>\n\nAlthough the revolt was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of disaster prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory and joined the other officers with the intention of commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#68|IV.68]]</ref>\n\nWhen news arrived of Cerialis' victory over Civilis, Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from pursuing further military endeavours.<ref name=jones-16/> Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally, suggesting he hand over command of his army but, once again, he was snubbed.<ref name=jones-16/> With the return of Vespasian in late September, his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature.<ref name=jones-17>Jones (1992), p. 17</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n\n[[Image:Domitia.JPG|thumb|A bust of [[Domitia Longina]], with Flavian [[hairstyle]], ([[Louvre]]).]]\nWhere his political and military career had ended in disappointment, Domitian's private affairs were more successful. In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus, [[Julia Flavia]],<ref name=jones-33>Jones (1992), p. 33</ref> but Domitian was adamant in his love for [[Domitia Longina]], going so far as to persuade her husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia, to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself.<ref name=jones-33/> Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families. Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia. Following the failed [[Pisonian conspiracy]] against Nero in 65, he had been forced to commit suicide. (Domitia Longina was also a granddaughter of [[Junia Lepida]], a descendant of Emperor Augustus) The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 34</ref>\n\nIn 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is not known what the boy's name was, but he died in childhood in 83.<ref name=jones-36>Jones (1993), p. 36</ref> Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' upon Domitia, while their son was [[apotheosis|deified]], appearing as such on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of coin types from this period.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly [[exile]]d Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia.<ref name=jones-39>Jones (1992), p. 39</ref> Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir.<ref name=jones-36/> By 84, Domitia had returned to the palace,<ref>Varner (1995), p. 200</ref> where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 34\u201335</ref> Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited.

As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian's sons, Titus shared [[tribune|tribunician power]] with his father, received seven consulships, the [[Roman censor|censorship]], and was given [[Praetorian prefect|command]] of the Praetorian Guard; powers that left no doubt he was the designated heir to the Empire.<ref name=jones-18>Jones (1992), p. 18</ref> As a second son, Domitian held honorary titles, such as ''Caesar'' or ''[[Princeps]] Iuventutis'', and several priesthoods, including those of ''[[augur]]'', ''[[pontifex]]'', ''[[Arval Brethren|frater arvalis]]'', ''magister frater arvalium'', and ''sacerdos collegiorum omnium'',<ref name=jones-19/> but no office with ''[[imperium]]''.\n\nHe held six consulships during Vespasian's reign but only one of these, in 73, was an ordinary consulship. The other five were less prestigious [[suffect consul]]ships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his father or brother in mid-January.<ref name=jones-18/> While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and may have contributed to his later reservations about its relevance.<ref name=jones-19>Jones (1992), p. 19</ref>\n\nUnder Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were virtually excluded from the important public offices. Mucianus himself all but disappeared from historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Crook | first = John A. | title = Titus and Berenice | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 162\u2013175 | year = 1951| doi = 10.2307/292544 | jstor=292544}}</ref> Real power was unmistakably concentrated in the hands of the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of [[democracy]].<ref name=jones-163>Jones (1992), p. 163</ref>\n\nBecause Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership in the government would soon be his, but neither tribunician power nor ''imperium'' of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.<ref name=\"jones-20\">Jones (1992), p. 20</ref>\n\nTwo major disasters struck during 79 and 80. On 24 August 79, [[79 eruption of Vesuvius|Mount Vesuvius erupted]],<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#22 LXVI.22]</ref> burying the surrounding cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] under metres of ash and lava; the following year, a fire broke out in Rome that lasted three days and that destroyed a number of important public buildings.<ref name=jones-80>Jones (1992), p. 80</ref> Consequently, Titus spent much of his reign coordinating relief efforts and restoring damaged property.

The following day, 14 September, the Senate confirmed Domitian's powers, granting tribunician power, the office of [[Pontifex Maximus]], and the titles of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' (\"venerable\"), and ''[[Pater Patriae]]'' (\"father of the country\").<ref name=jones-21>Jones (1992), p. 21</ref>\n\n==Emperor (81\u201396)==\n\n===Rule===\n{{Flavian dynasty\n|image=\n|caption=\n}}\nAs Emperor, Domitian quickly dispensed with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign.<ref name=jones-22>Jones (1992), p. 22</ref> By moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial [[royal court|court]], Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a [[Divine Right of Kings|divine monarchy]] with himself as the [[Enlightened absolutism|benevolent despot]] at its head.\n\nIn addition to exercising absolute political power, Domitian believed the emperor's role encompassed every aspect of daily life, guiding the Roman people as a cultural and [[moral authority]].<ref name=jones-99>Jones (1992), p. 99</ref> To usher in the new era, he embarked on ambitious economic, military and cultural programs with the intention of restoring the Empire to the splendour it had seen under the Emperor [[Augustus]].<ref name=jones-72>Jones (1992), p. 72</ref>\n\nDespite these grand designs Domitian was determined to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: [[edict]]s were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced.<ref name=jones-107>Jones (1992), p. 107</ref> According to Suetonius, the imperial [[bureaucracy]] never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among [[Roman governor|provincial governors]] and elected officials.<ref name=jones-109>Jones (1992), p. 109</ref>\n\nAlthough he made no pretence regarding the significance of the Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members, a policy that stood in contrast to the [[nepotism]] practiced by Vespasian and Titus.<ref name=jones-164>Jones (1992), p. 164</ref> Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.<ref name=jones-178>Jones (1992), pp. 178\u2013179</ref>\n\nThe reality of Domitian's autocracy was further highlighted by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of time away from the capital.<ref name=jones-150/> Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was.<ref name=jones-22/> Until the completion of the [[Flavian Palace]] on the [[Palatine Hill]], the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.<ref name=jones-26>Jones (1992), pp. 26\u201328</ref>\n\n====Palaces, villas and other major buildings====\n\nFor his personal use he was active in constructing many monumental buildings including the [[Villa of Domitian]], a vast and sumptuous palace situated 20&nbsp;km outside Rome in the Alban Hills.\n\nIn Rome itself he built the [[Palace of Domitian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]].\n\nSix other villas are linked with Domitian at [[Tusculum]], [[Antium]], Caieta, [[Monte Circeo|Circei]], Anxur<ref>Martial VI</ref> and [[Baiae]].<ref>Martial IV 30</ref> Only the one at Circei has been identified today, where its remains can be visited by the Lago di Paola.\n\nThe [[Stadium of Domitian]] was dedicated in 86 AD as a gift to the people of Rome as part of an Imperial building programme following the damage or destruction of most of the buildings on the Field of Mars by fire in 79 AD. It was Rome's first permanent venue for competitive athletics, and today occupied by the [[Piazza Navona]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[Image:Domitian denarius son.png|thumb|250px|Upon his accession, Domitian revalued the Roman currency by increasing the silver content of the [[denarius]] by 12%.

The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus at the time of his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign.<ref name=jones-73>Jones (1992), p. 73</ref> Upon his accession he revalued the [[Roman currency]] dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 90% to 98% \u2014 the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87&nbsp;grams to 3.26&nbsp;grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a [[devaluation]] of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04&nbsp;grams respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101003844/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm|archivedate=1 November 2008|title=Roman Currency of the Principate|date=1 November 2008|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=jones-75>Jones (1992), p. 75</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the new values were still higher than the levels that Vespasian and Titus had maintained during their reigns. Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years.<ref name=jones-75/> Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.<ref name=jones-75/>\n\nJones estimates Domitian's annual income at more than 1.2 billion [[sestertius|sestertii]], of which over one-third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army.<ref name=jones-73/> The other major expense was the extensive reconstruction of Rome. At the time of Domitian's accession the city was still suffering from the damage caused by the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64]], the civil war of 69 and the fire in 80.<ref name = jones-79/>\n\nMuch more than a renovation project, Domitian's building program was intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural [[renaissance]]. Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus.<ref name=jones-79>Jones (1992), p. 79</ref> Among the most important new structures were an [[Odeon of Domitian|odeon]], a [[Stadium of Domitian|stadium]], and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect [[Rabirius (architect)|Rabirius]].<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 84\u201388</ref>\n\nThe most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, said to have been covered with a [[gilding|gilded]] roof. Among those completed were the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]], the Arch of Titus and the [[Colosseum]], to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.<ref name=jones-93/>\n\nIn order to appease the people of Rome an estimated 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives, or ''[[congiarium|congiaria]]'', throughout Domitian's reign.<ref name=jones-74>Jones (1992), p. 74</ref> The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the [[Capitoline Games]], a quadrennial contest comprising [[Athletic sport|athletic displays]], [[chariot racing]], and competitions for [[Public speaking|oratory]], music and acting.<ref name=jones-103>Jones (1992), p. 103</ref>\n\nDomitian himself supported the travel of competitors from all corners of the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular [[gladiator]]ial games such as naval contests, nighttime battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Lastly, he added two new factions to the chariot races, Gold and Purple, to race against the existing White, Red, Green and Blue factions.<ref name=jones-105>Jones (1992), p. 105</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|250px|A rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, [[Azerbaijan]], mentioning Domitian and [[Legio XII Fulminata]].

XII FVL.]]\nThe military campaigns undertaken during Domitian's reign were generally defensive in nature, as the Emperor rejected the idea of expansionist warfare.<ref name = jones-127/> His most significant military contribution was the development of the [[Limes Germanicus]], which encompassed a vast network of roads, forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire.<ref name=jones-131>Jones (1992), p. 131</ref> Nevertheless, several important wars were fought in Gaul, against the [[Chatti]], and across the [[Danube]] frontier against the [[Suebi]], the [[Sarmatians]], and the [[Dacians]].<ref name = jones-130/>\n\nThe conquest of Britain continued under the command of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], who expanded the Roman Empire as far as [[Caledonia]], or modern day [[Scotland]]. Domitian also founded a new [[Roman legion|legion]] in 82, the [[Legio I Minervia]], to fight against the Chatti.<ref name = jones-130/> Domitian is also credited on the easternmost evidence of Roman military presence,<ref>{{cite book | last = Millar| first =Fergus| title =Rome, the Greek World, and the East: The Roman Republic and the Augustan revolution| publisher = UNC Press Books|year = 2002| page = 51| isbn = 978-0-8078-4990-3}}</ref> the rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, in present-day [[Azerbaijan]]. As judged by the carved titles of Caesar, Augustus and Germanicus, the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD.\n\nDomitian's administration of the Roman army was characterized by the same fastidious involvement he exhibited in other branches of the government. His competence as a military strategist was criticized by his contemporaries however.<ref name=jones-127>Jones (1992), p. 127</ref> Although he claimed several triumphs, these were largely propaganda manoeuvres. Tacitus derided Domitian's victory against the Chatti as a \"mock triumph\", and criticized his decision to retreat in Britain following the conquests of Agricola.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#39|39]]</ref><ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#2|I.2]]</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Domitian appears to have been very popular among the soldiers, spending an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns\u2014more than any emperor since Augustus\u2014and raising their pay by one-third.<ref name=jones-131/><ref>Syme (1930), p. 64</ref> While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned.<ref name=jones-144>Jones (1992), p. 144</ref>\n\n====Campaign against the Chatti====\nOnce Emperor, Domitian immediately sought to attain his long delayed military glory. As early as 82, or possibly 83, he went to Gaul, ostensibly to conduct a [[census]], and suddenly ordered an attack on the [[Chatti]].<ref name=jones-128>Jones (1992), p. 128</ref> For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75&nbsp;kilometres (46&nbsp;mi) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy's hiding places.<ref name=jones-130>Jones (1992), p. 130</ref>\n\nAlthough little information survives of the battles fought, enough early victories were apparently achieved for Domitian to be back in Rome by the end of 83, where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of ''Germanicus''.<ref name=jones-129>Jones (1992), p. 129</ref> Domitian's supposed victory was much scorned by ancient authors, who described the campaign as \"uncalled for\",<ref name=suetonius-domitian-6>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#6 6]</ref> and a \"mock triumph\".<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/> The evidence lends some credence to these claims, as the Chatti would later play a significant role during the revolt of Saturninus in 89.<ref name=jones-131/>\n\n====Conquest of Britain (77\u201384)====\n[[Image:Statue of Agricola at Bath cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] ([[Bath, Somerset|Bath]])]]\n{{Main|Roman conquest of Britain}}\nOne of the most detailed reports of military activity under the Flavian dynasty was written by Tacitus, whose biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84.<ref name=jones-131/> Agricola arrived c. 77 as governor of Roman Britain, immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia (modern Scotland).\n\nIn 82 Agricola crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-1>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#24|24]]</ref> He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].<ref name=jones-132>Jones (1992), p. 132</ref> He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest.

To aid the advance, a large legionary fortress was constructed at [[Inchtuthil]].<ref name=jones-132/> In the summer of 84, Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians, led by [[Calgacus]], at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]].<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-2>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#29|29]]</ref> Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, two-thirds of the Caledonian army escaped and hid in the Scottish marshes and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], ultimately preventing Agricola from bringing the entire British island under his control.<ref name=jones-132/>\n\nIn 85, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian, having served for more than six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era.<ref name=jones-132/> Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/> The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-3>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#42|42]]</ref>\n\nNot long after Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into war with the [[Dacia|Kingdom of Dacia]] in the East. Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a large-scale strategic [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of troops in the British province. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120&nbsp;kilometres (75&nbsp;mi) further south.<ref name=jones-133>Jones (1992), p. 133</ref> The army command may have resented Domitian's decision to retreat, but to him the Caledonian territories never represented anything more than a loss to the Roman treasury.<ref name=jones-131/>\n\n====Dacian wars (85\u201388)====\n{{details|Domitian's Dacian War}}\n\n[[Image:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|The Roman province of [[Dacia]] (purple area) after the conquest of Trajan in 106, with the [[Black Sea]] to the far right.]]\nThe most significant threat the Roman Empire faced during the reign of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King [[Decebalus]], crossed the Danube into the province of [[Moesia]], wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor [[Oppius Sabinus]].<ref name=jones-138>Jones (1992), p. 138</ref>\n\nDomitian quickly launched a [[counterattack|counteroffensive]], personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]]. Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians back across the border in mid-85, prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph.<ref name=jones-139>Jones (1992), p. 139</ref>\n\nThe victory proved short-lived, however: as early in 86 Fuscus embarked on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia. Fuscus was killed, and the [[Aquila (Roman)|battle standard]] of the Praetorian Guard was lost.<ref name=jones-138/> The loss of the battle standard, or ''aquila'', was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride.\n\nDomitian returned to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time under the command of [[Tettius Julianus]], and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished.<ref name=jones-142>Jones (1992), p. 142</ref> An attack on the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.<ref name=jones-150>Jones (1992), p. 150</ref>\n\nIn order to avert having to conduct a war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, negotiating free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces.<ref name=jones-150/> Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged.<ref name=jones-195>Jones (1992), p. 195</ref> For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful [[client state|client kingdom]], but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses.<ref name=Salmon/>\n\nDomitian probably wanted a new war against the Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. [[Trajan]] continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Knight | first = D.

In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]],<ref name=jones-99/> perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small [[chapel]] dedicated to ''Jupiter Conservator'' was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to ''Jupiter Custos''.<ref name=jones-88>Jones (1992), p. 88</ref>\n\nThe goddess he worshipped the most zealously, however, was [[Minerva]]. Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage\u2014in four different attested reverse types\u2014and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.<ref name=jones-100>Jones (1992), p. 100</ref>\n\nDomitian also revived the practice of the [[imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]], which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and [[Cassius Dio]] allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of ''Dominus et Deus'' (\"Lord and God\").<ref>Suetonius, ''Domitian'', 13:2</ref><ref>Dio, ''Roman History'', 67:4:7</ref> However, not only did he reject the title of ''Dominus'' during his reign,<ref name=jones-108>Jones (1992), p. 108</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Light From the Ancient East|last=contra Deissmann|first=Adolf|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|year=1995|isbn=978-1-56563-155-7|location=Peabody, Massachusetts|pages=357, n. 1|via=}}</ref> but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.<ref name=jones-109/>\n\nTo foster the worship of the imperial family, he erected a dynastic [[mausoleum]] on the site of Vespasian's former house on the [[Quirinal Hill|Quirinal]],<ref name=jones-87>Jones (1992), p. 87</ref> and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother.<ref name=jones-93/> To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed the Arch of Titus.\n\nConstruction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct.<ref name=jones-106>Jones (1992), p. 106</ref> Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the ''[[Lex Julia|Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis]]'', under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.<ref name=jones-107/>\n\nDomitian also heavily prosecuted corruption among public officials, removing jurors if they accepted bribes and rescinding legislation when a [[conflict of interest]] was suspected.<ref name=jones-107/> He ensured that [[libel]]lous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death.<ref name=jones-107/> Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for [[satire]] at the expense of the government.<ref>Grainger (2003), p. 54</ref> Consequently, he forbade [[mime]]s from appearing on stage in public.\n\nIn 87, [[Vestal Virgin]]s were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity. As the Vestals were regarded as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted [[incest]]. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be [[Premature burial|buried alive]].<ref name=jones-101>Jones (1992), p. 101</ref>\n\nForeign religions were tolerated insofar as they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of [[Commodus]].

The Principate allowed the existence of a ''de facto'' dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Waters | first = K.

Domitian was not so subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his [[autocracy]].<ref name=jones-161/> He disliked [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.<ref name=jones-169>Jones (1992), p. 169</ref>\n\nThe dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the senators of Rome rushed to the Senate house, where they immediately passed a motion [[Damnatio memoriae|condemning his memory]] to oblivion.<ref name=jones-160>Jones (1992), p. 160</ref> Under the rulers of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant.<ref name=jones-161/>\n\nNevertheless, the evidence suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely in the hands of the Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul.<ref name=jones-163-8>Jones (1992), pp. 163\u2013168</ref> Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.<ref name=jones-169/>\n\nBoth Tacitus and Suetonius speak of escalating persecutions toward the end of Domitian's reign, identifying a point of sharp increase around 93, or sometime after the failed revolt of Saturninus in 89.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-45>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#45|45]]</ref><ref name=suetonius-domitian-10>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#10 10]</ref> At least twenty senatorial opponents were executed,<ref>For a full list of senatorial victims, see Jones (1992), pp. 182\u2013188</ref> including Domitia Longina's former husband Lucius Aelius Lamia and three of Domitian's own family members, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 82)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] and Marcus Arrecinus Clemens.<ref>M. Arrecinus Clemens may have been exiled instead of executed, see Jones (1992), p. 187</ref> Some of these men were executed as early as 83 or 85, however, lending little credit to Tacitus' notion of a \"reign of terror\" late in Domitian's reign. According to Suetonius, some were convicted for corruption or treason, others on trivial charges, which Domitian justified through his suspicion:\n\n{{bquote|He used to say that the lot of Emperors was most unfortunate, since when they discovered a conspiracy, no one believed them unless they had been murdered.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', \"Life of Domitian\", 21</ref>}}\n\nJones compares the executions of Domitian to those under Emperor [[Claudius]] (41\u201354), noting that Claudius executed around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and regarded as one of the good Emperors of history.<ref name=jones-192>Jones (1992), p. 192</ref> Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments.

As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant to tell him what time it was. The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon.<ref name=grainger-1-3/> Apparently put at ease, the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees.  Stephanus, who had been feigning an injury to his arm for several days and wearing a bandage to allow him to carry a concealed dagger, suddenly appeared:\n\n{{bquote|...he pretended that he had discovered a plot, and was for that reason granted an audience: whereupon, as the amazed Domitian perused a document he had handed him, Stephanus stabbed him in the groin.

Later, she took the emperor's ashes to the Flavian Temple and mingled them with those of his niece, Julia.  He was 44 years old.  As had been foretold, his death came at midday.<ref name=jones-38>Jones (1992), p. 38</ref>\n\nCassius Dio, writing nearly a hundred years after the assassination, suggests that the assassination was improvised, while Suetonius implies it was a well-organized conspiracy,<ref name=grainger-5>Grainger (2003), p. 5</ref> citing Stephanus' feigned injury and claiming that the doors to the servants' quarters had been locked prior to the attack and that a sword Domitian kept concealed beneath his pillow as a last line of personal protection against a would-be assassin, had also been removed beforehand.<ref name=grainger-1-3>Grainger (2003), pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\nDio included Domitia Longina among the conspirators, but in light of her attested devotion to Domitian\u2014even years after her husband had died\u2014her involvement in the plot seems highly unlikely.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-37\" />  The precise involvement of the Praetorian Guard is unclear. One of the guard's commanders, [[Titus Petronius Secundus]], was almost certainly aware of the plot.  The other, Titus Flavius Norbanus, the former governor of [[Raetia]], was a member of Domitian's family.<ref>Werner Eck \u2013 Andreas Pangerl, Titus Flavius Norbanus, praefectus praetorio Domitians, als Statthalter R\u00e4tiens in einem neuen Milit\u00e4rdiplom, ZPE 163, 2007, 239-251</ref><ref name=\"Grainger 2003, p. 19\"/>\n\n===Succession and aftermath===\n[[Image:Nerva Tivoli Massimo.jpg|thumb|250px|Upon the death of Domitian, [[Nerva]] was proclaimed Emperor by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].]]\n\nThe ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]'', the Ostian Calendar, records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor.<ref name=\"murison-153\">Murison (2003), p. 153</ref> Despite his political experience, this was a remarkable choice.

The precise facts have been obscured by history,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Syme | first = Ronald | title = Domitian: The Last Years | journal = Chiron | volume = 13 | pages = 121\u2013146 | year = 1983 }}</ref> but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.<ref name=\"murison-153\"/> The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to have been involved in the conspiracy.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-196\">Jones (1992), p. 196</ref>\n\nThe Senate nonetheless rejoiced at the death of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed ''damnatio memoriae'' on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records.<ref name=grainger-49>Grainger (2003), p. 49</ref> Domitian and, over a century later, [[Publius Septimius Geta]] were the only emperors known to have officially received a ''damnatio memoriae'', though others may have received ''de facto'' ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the [[Cancelleria Reliefs]], were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Last | first = Hugh | title = On the Flavian Reliefs from the Palazzo della Cancelleria | journal = The Journal of Roman Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 9\u201314 | year = 1948 | jstor = 298163| doi = 10.2307/298163 }}</ref> Yet the order of the Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.<ref name=grainger-49/>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, the people of Rome met the news of Domitian's death with indifference, but the army was much grieved, calling for his deification immediately after the assassination, and in several provinces rioting.<ref>Grainger (2003), pp. 32\u201333</ref> As a compensation measure, the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus, and replaced him with a former commander, [[Casperius Aelianus]].<ref>Grainger (2003), p. 40</ref>\n\nDissatisfaction with this state of affairs continued to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid [[siege]] to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage.<ref name=grainger-94>Grainger (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians.<ref name=grainger-94/> Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed.

The work of Domitian's court poets [[Martial]] and [[Statius]] constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 32</ref>\n\nThe most extensive account of the life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor [[Hadrian]] (117\u2013138). His ''[[De Vita Caesarum]]'' is the source of much of what is known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror.<ref>Waters (1964), p. 51</ref> The biography is problematic, however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent [[libertine]].<ref name=jones-198/>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his interest in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of [[epigram]]matic expression, suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.<ref name=jones-198/>\n\n''De Vita Caesarum'' is also the source of several outrageous stories regarding Domitian's marriage life. According to Suetonius, Domitia Longina was exiled in 83 because of an affair with a famous actor named [[Paris (actor under Domitian)|Paris]]. When Domitian found out, he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife, with Suetonius further adding that once Domitia was exiled, Domitian took Julia as his mistress, who later died during a failed [[abortion]].<ref name=jones-35/><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-22\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#22 22]</ref>\n\nModern historians consider this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court.<ref>Levick (2002), p. 211</ref> Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.\n\nAlthough Tacitus is usually considered to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated by the fact that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor.<ref name=jones-58>Jones (1992), p. 58</ref> In his biographical work ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.<ref name=jones-58/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Dorey | first = T.

Unfortunately, the part of Tacitus' ''Histories'' dealing with the reign of the Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in ''Agricola'' in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.<ref name=\"tacitus-histories-i-1\">Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]</ref>\n\nOther influential 2nd century authors include [[Juvenal]] and Pliny the Younger, the latter of whom was a friend of Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous ''Panegyricus Traiani'' before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satires]]'', depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established by the end of the 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the [[Acts of John]].\n\n===Modern revisionism===\n[[File:Domiziano da latina, 81-96 dc..JPG|thumb|Bust of Domitian wearing the [[civic crown]], from the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Terme]], Rome]]\nOver the course of the 20th century, Domitian's military, administrative and economic policies were re-evaluated.  Hostile views of Domitian had been propagated until [[archeology|archeological]] and [[numismatics|numismatic]] advances brought renewed attention to his reign, and necessitated a revision of the literary tradition established by Tacitus and Pliny. It would be nearly a hundred years after [[St\u00e9phane Gsell]]'s 1894 ''Essai sur le r\u00e8gne de l'empereur Domitien'' however, before any new, book-length studies were published.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review/>\n\nThe first of these was Jones' 1992 ''The Emperor Domitian''.

Elaborate triumphs were celebrated in order to boost his image as a warrior-emperor, but many of these were either unearned or premature.<ref name=jones-127/> By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals.<ref name=jones-106/>\n\nHe became personally involved in all branches of the government and successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. The dark side of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate. He punished libel with exile or death and, due to his suspicious nature, increasingly accepted information from [[delatores|informers]] to bring false charges of treason if necessary.<ref name=jones-180>Jones (1992), p. 180</ref>\n\nDespite his vilification by contemporary historians, Domitian's administration provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from his.

81 to 96. He was the younger brother of [[Titus]] and the son of  [[Vespasian]], his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the [[Flavian dynasty]].  During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the [[Roman senate|Senate]], whose powers he drastically curtailed. \n\nDomitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]].  His 15-year reign was the longest since that of [[Tiberius]].<ref>cf. [[Roman Emperor (Principate)]] although several came within a year or two of 15-year reigns, the closest reigns to 15 years being [[Claudius]]' and [[Nero]]'s, and it was soon to be surpassed by [[Trajan]]'s</ref> As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] attempted to conquer [[Caledonia]] ([[Scotland]]), and in [[Dacia]], where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king [[Decebalus]]. Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics. Religious, military, and cultural [[propaganda]] fostered a [[cult of personality]], and by nominating himself perpetual [[Roman censor|censor]], he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army, but considered a tyrant by members of the [[Roman Senate]].\n\nDomitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor [[Nerva]]. After his death, Domitian's memory was [[damnatio memoriae|condemned to oblivion]] by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], and [[Suetonius]] propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.\n\n==Family and background==\n\n[[Image:Flavian family tree.png|thumb|450px|The [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian family]] tree, indicating the descendants of [[Titus Flavius Petro]] and Tertulla.]]\nDomitian was born in Rome on 24 October 51, the youngest son of [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]]\u2014commonly known as Vespasian\u2014and [[Domitilla the Elder|Flavia Domitilla Major]].<ref name=\"jones-domitian-1\">Jones (1992), p. 1</ref> He had an older sister, [[Domitilla the Younger]], and brother, also named [[Titus|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]].<ref>Townend (1961), p. 62</ref>\n\nDecades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during the early part of the 1st century.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-3\">Jones (1992), p. 3</ref> One such family, the Flavians, or ''gens [[Flavia (gens)|Flavia]]'', rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Domitian's great-grandfather, [[Titus Flavius Petro]], had served as a [[centurion]] under [[Pompey]] during [[Caesar's civil war]]. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-1\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upward mobility of Petro's son [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (father of Vespasian)|Titus Flavius Sabinus I]], Domitian's grandfather.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-2\">Jones (1992), p. 2</ref> Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] status through his services as [[tax collector]] in Asia and banker in [[Helvetia]] (modern Switzerland). By marrying [[Vespasia Polla]] he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious ''gens Vespasia'', ensuring the elevation of his sons [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus II]] and Vespasian to [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] rank.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-2\"/>\n\n[[File:Domitian Denarius.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[denarius]] of Domitian.

P. / IOVI VICTORI.]]\nThe [[cursus honorum|political career]] of Vespasian included the offices of [[quaestor]], [[aedile]], and [[praetor]], and culminated in a [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 51, the year of Domitian's birth. As a military commander, Vespasian gained early renown by participating in the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion of Britain]] in 43.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 8</ref> Nevertheless, ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian's upbringing,<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#1 1]</ref> even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors [[Caligula]] (37\u201341) and [[Nero]] (54\u201368).<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 4]\n</ref> Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a [[propaganda]] campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and to maximize achievements under Emperor [[Claudius]] (41\u201354) and his son [[Britannicus]].<ref>Jones (1992), p. 7</ref>\n\nBy all appearances, the Flavians enjoyed high imperial favour throughout the 40s and 60s. While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career. Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as [[proconsul]] of the [[Africa Province]] in 63, and accompanying the emperor Nero during an official tour of Greece in 66.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 9\u201311</ref>\n\nThat same year Jews from the [[Iudaea Province|Province of Judaea]] revolted against the Roman Empire, sparking what is now known as the [[First Jewish-Roman War]]. Vespasian was assigned to lead the [[Roman army]] against the insurgents, with Titus \u2014 who had completed his military education by this time \u2014 in charge of a legion.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-11\">Jones (1992), p. 11</ref>\n\n===Youth and character===\n[[Image:Vespasianus03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of [[Vespasian]] ([[Pushkin Museum]]).]]\nOf the three Flavian emperors, Domitian would rule the longest, despite the fact that his youth and early career were largely spent in the shadow of his older brother.  Titus had gained military renown during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]. After their father [[Vespasian]] became emperor in 69 following the [[civil war]] known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], Titus held a great many offices, while Domitian received honours, but no responsibilities.\n\nBy the time he was 16 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died,<ref>Waters (1964), pp. 52\u201353</ref> while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military, commanding armies in [[Germania]] and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish\u2013Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] of Rome; or possibly even [[Nerva|Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\">Jones (1992), p. 13</ref><ref>Murison (2003), p. 149</ref>\n\nHe received the education of a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]]. In his biography in the ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Suetonius]] attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as [[Homer]] or [[Virgil]] on appropriate occasions,<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#9 9]</ref><ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#12.3 12.3]</ref> and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation.<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#20 20]</ref> Among his first published works were [[poetry]], as well as writings on law and administration.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\"/>\n\nUnlike his brother Titus, Domitian was not educated at court. Whether he received formal military training is not recorded, but according to Suetonius, he displayed considerable marksmanship with the bow and arrow.<ref name=jones-16>Jones (1992), p. 16</ref><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-19\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#19 19]</ref> A detailed description of Domitian's appearance and character is provided by Suetonius, who devotes a substantial part of his biography to his personality:\n\n{{bquote|He was tall of stature, with a modest expression and a high colour. His eyes were large, but his sight was somewhat dim. He was handsome and graceful too, especially when a young man, and indeed in his whole body with the exception of his feet, the toes of which were somewhat cramped. In later life he had the further disfigurement of baldness, a protruding belly, and spindling legs, though the latter had become thin from a long illness.<ref>\n[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', \"Life of Domitian\", 18</ref>}}\n\nDomitian was allegedly extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised in later life by wearing wigs.<ref>Morgan (1997), p. 214</ref> According to Suetonius, he even wrote a book on the subject of [[hair care]].<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-18\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#18 18]</ref> With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.<ref name=jones-198>Jones (1992), p. 198</ref>\n\nHistorian Brian Jones concludes in ''The Emperor Domitian'' that assessing the true nature of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources.<ref name=jones-198/> Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] sense of humour,<ref>Morgan (1997), p. 209</ref><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-21\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#21 21]</ref> and often communicated in cryptic ways.\n\nThis ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, and as he grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\"/> Indeed, by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the [[civil war]] of 69, which brought his family to power.<ref name=waters-54>Waters (1964), p. 54</ref>\n\n==Rise of the Flavian dynasty==\n\n===Year of the Four Emperors===\n[[Image:Roman Empire 69.svg|thumb|The Roman Empire during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69). Blue areas indicate provinces loyal to Vespasian and [[Gaius Licinius Mucianus]]. Green areas indicate provinces loyal to [[Vitellius]].]]\nOn 9 June 68, amid growing opposition of the Senate and the army, Nero committed [[suicide]] and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], during which the four most influential generals in the [[Roman Empire]]\u2014[[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vitellius]] and Vespasian\u2014successively vied for imperial power.<ref name=sullivan-69>Sullivan (1953), p. 69</ref>\n\nNews of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of [[Jerusalem]]. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] (modern northern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor.<ref name=sullivan-69/>\n\nBefore reaching Italy, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of [[Lusitania]] (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;44</ref>\n\nOtho and Vitellius realized the potential threat posed by the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him the advantage of being nearest to the vital [[History of Roman Egypt|province of Egypt]], which controlled the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply to Rome]]. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire [[Cohortes urbanae|city garrison]] of Rome.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-11\"/> Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;45</ref>\n\nWhen Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the [[First Battle of Bedriacum]], the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69.<ref name=sullivan-68>Sullivan (1953), p. 68</ref> Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with [[Mucianus|Gaius Licinius Mucianus]], the governor of Syria, against Vitellius.<ref name=sullivan-68/> A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to [[Alexandria]], leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;126</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pseudo-Vitellius Louvre MR684.jpg|thumb|A bust of Emperor [[Vitellius]] ([[Louvre]]).]]\nIn Rome, Domitian was placed under [[house arrest]] by Vitellius, as a safeguard against Flavian aggression.<ref name=waters-54/> Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69, the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian (under Marcus Antonius Primus) met at the [[Second Battle of Bedriacum#Second Battle of Bedriacum|Second Battle of Bedriacum]], which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#34|III.34]]</ref>\n\nIn despair, Vitellius attempted to negotiate a surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]]\u2014the imperial [[bodyguard]]\u2014considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty.<ref>Wellesley (2000), pp. 166, 189</ref> On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the [[Temple of Concord]] but at the last minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the [[Capitoline Hill]].<ref name=jones-14>Jones (1992), p. 14</ref>\n\nDuring the night, he was joined by his relatives, including Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of [[Isis]] and spent the night in safety with one of his father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.<ref name=jones-14/>\n\nBy the afternoon of 20 December, Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With nothing more to be feared, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house.<ref name=jones-14/> The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.<ref>Wellesley (1956), p. 213</ref>\n\n===Aftermath of the war===\n[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 047b.jpg|thumb|''[[The Conspiracy of Gaius Julius Civilis]]'' (detail), by [[Rembrandt]] (1661). During the [[Batavian rebellion]], Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory, but was denied command of a legion by superior officers.]]\n\nAlthough the war had officially ended, a state of [[anarchy]] and lawlessness pervaded in the first days following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year.<ref name=jones-14/> In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of ''Caesar'' and was appointed [[praetor]] with consular power.<ref name=jones-15>Jones (1992), p. 15</ref>\n\nThe ancient historian [[Tacitus]] describes Domitian's first speech in the Senate as brief and measured, at the same time noting his ability to elude awkward questions.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#40|IV.40]]</ref> Domitian's authority was merely [[wikt:Nominal|nominal]], however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function.<ref name=jones-15/> Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's [[wikt:Entourage|entourage]], promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and [[Antonius Primus]] and replacing them with more reliable men such as [[Marcus Arrecinus Clemens (prefect 70)|Arrecinus Clemens]].<ref name=jones-15/>\n\nEqually curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's military ambitions. The civil war of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings such as the [[Batavian rebellion|Batavian revolt]] in [[Gaul]]. [[Batavians|Batavian]] auxiliaries of the [[Rhine]] legions, led by [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], had rebelled with the aid of a faction of [[Treveri]] under the command of [[Julius Classicus]]. Seven legions were sent from Rome, led by Vespasian's brother-in-law [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]].<ref name=jones-16/>\n\nAlthough the revolt was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of disaster prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory and joined the other officers with the intention of commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#68|IV.68]]</ref>\n\nWhen news arrived of Cerialis' victory over Civilis, Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from pursuing further military endeavours.<ref name=jones-16/> Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally, suggesting he hand over command of his army but, once again, he was snubbed.<ref name=jones-16/> With the return of Vespasian in late September, his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature.<ref name=jones-17>Jones (1992), p. 17</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n\n[[Image:Domitia.JPG|thumb|A bust of [[Domitia Longina]], with Flavian [[hairstyle]], ([[Louvre]]).]]\nWhere his political and military career had ended in disappointment, Domitian's private affairs were more successful. In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus, [[Julia Flavia]],<ref name=jones-33>Jones (1992), p. 33</ref> but Domitian was adamant in his love for [[Domitia Longina]], going so far as to persuade her husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia, to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself.<ref name=jones-33/> Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families. Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia. Following the failed [[Pisonian conspiracy]] against Nero in 65, he had been forced to commit suicide. (Domitia Longina was also a granddaughter of [[Junia Lepida]], a descendent of Emperor Augustus) The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 34</ref>\n\nIn 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is not known what the boy's name was, but he died in childhood in 83.<ref name=jones-36>Jones (1993), p. 36</ref> Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' upon Domitia, while their son was [[apotheosis|deified]], appearing as such on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of coin types from this period.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly [[exile]]d Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia.<ref name=jones-39>Jones (1992), p. 39</ref> Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir.<ref name=jones-36/> By 84, Domitia had returned to the palace,<ref>Varner (1995), p. 200</ref> where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 34\u201335</ref> Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited. From Suetonius, we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the [[amphitheatre]], while the Jewish writer [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]] speaks of benefits he received from her.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-37\">Jones (1992), p. 37</ref> It is not known whether Domitian had other children, but he did not marry again.

In June 71, Titus returned triumphant from the war in Judaea.

As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian's sons, Titus shared [[tribune|tribunician power]] with his father, received seven consulships, the [[Roman censor|censorship]], and was given [[Praetorian prefect|command]] of the Praetorian Guard; powers that left no doubt he was the designated heir to the Empire.<ref name=jones-18>Jones (1992), p. 18</ref> As a second son, Domitian held honorary titles, such as ''Caesar'' or ''[[Princeps]] Iuventutis'', and several priesthoods, including those of ''[[augur]]'', ''[[pontifex]]'', ''[[Arval Brethren|frater arvalis]]'', ''magister frater arvalium'', and ''sacerdos collegiorum omnium'',<ref name=jones-19/> but no office with ''[[imperium]]''.\n\nHe held six consulships during Vespasian's reign but only one of these, in 73, was an ordinary consulship. The other five were less prestigious [[suffect consul]]ships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his father or brother in mid-January.<ref name=jones-18/> While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and may have contributed to his later reservations about its relevance.<ref name=jones-19>Jones (1992), p. 19</ref>\n\nUnder Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were virtually excluded from the important public offices. Mucianus himself all but disappeared from historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Crook | first = John A. | title = Titus and Berenice | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 162\u2013175 | year = 1951| doi = 10.2307/292544 | jstor=292544}}</ref> Real power was unmistakably concentrated in the hands of the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of [[democracy]].<ref name=jones-163>Jones (1992), p. 163</ref>\n\nBecause Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership in the government would soon be his, but neither tribunician power nor ''imperium'' of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.<ref name=\"jones-20\">Jones (1992), p. 20</ref>\n\nTwo major disasters struck during 79 and 80. On 24 August 79, [[79 eruption of Vesuvius|Mount Vesuvius erupted]],<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#22 LXVI.22]</ref> burying the surrounding cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] under metres of ash and lava; the following year, a fire broke out in Rome that lasted three days and that destroyed a number of important public buildings.<ref name=jones-80>Jones (1992), p. 80</ref> Consequently, Titus spent much of his reign coordinating relief efforts and restoring damaged property. On 13 September 81, after barely two years in office, he unexpectedly died of fever during a trip to the [[Sabine]] territories.<ref name=jones-20/>\n\nAncient authors have implicated Domitian in the death of his brother, either by directly accusing him of murder,<ref>Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_31.html#%A732 6.32]</ref> or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead,<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-2\"/><ref name=\"dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#26 LXVI.26]</ref> even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother.<ref name=\"dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26\"/> It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known [[bias]] of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.<ref name=jones-20/>\n\nWhatever the nature of their relationship, Domitian seems to have displayed little sympathy when his brother lay dying, instead making for the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]] where he was proclaimed emperor. The following day, 14 September, the Senate confirmed Domitian's powers, granting tribunician power, the office of [[Pontifex Maximus]], and the titles of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' (\"venerable\"), and ''[[Pater Patriae]]'' (\"father of the country\").<ref name=jones-21>Jones (1992), p. 21</ref>\n\n==Emperor (81\u201396)==\n\n===Rule===\n{{Flavian dynasty\n|image=\n|caption=\n}}\nAs Emperor, Domitian quickly dispensed with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign.<ref name=jones-22>Jones (1992), p. 22</ref> By moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial [[royal court|court]], Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a [[Divine Right of Kings|divine monarchy]] with himself as the [[Enlightened absolutism|benevolent despot]] at its head.\n\nIn addition to exercising absolute political power, Domitian believed the emperor's role encompassed every aspect of daily life, guiding the Roman people as a cultural and [[moral authority]].<ref name=jones-99>Jones (1992), p. 99</ref> To usher in the new era, he embarked on ambitious economic, military and cultural programs with the intention of restoring the Empire to the splendour it had seen under the Emperor [[Augustus]].<ref name=jones-72>Jones (1992), p. 72</ref>\n\nDespite these grand designs Domitian was determined to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: [[edict]]s were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced.<ref name=jones-107>Jones (1992), p. 107</ref> According to Suetonius, the imperial [[bureaucracy]] never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among [[Roman governor|provincial governors]] and elected officials.<ref name=jones-109>Jones (1992), p. 109</ref>\n\nAlthough he made no pretence regarding the significance of the Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members, a policy that stood in contrast to the [[nepotism]] practiced by Vespasian and Titus.<ref name=jones-164>Jones (1992), p. 164</ref> Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.<ref name=jones-178>Jones (1992), pp. 178\u2013179</ref>\n\nThe reality of Domitian's autocracy was further highlighted by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of time away from the capital.<ref name=jones-150/> Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was.<ref name=jones-22/> Until the completion of the [[Flavian Palace]] on the [[Palatine Hill]], the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.<ref name=jones-26>Jones (1992), pp. 26\u201328</ref>\n\n====Palaces, villas and other major buildings====\n\nFor his personal use he was active in constructing many monumental buildings including the [[Villa of Domitian]], a vast and sumptuous palace situated 20&nbsp;km outside Rome in the Alban Hills.\n\nIn Rome itself he built the [[Palace of Domitian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]].\n\nSix other villas are linked with Domitian at [[Tusculum]], [[Antium]], Caieta, [[Monte Circeo|Circei]], Anxur<ref>Martial VI</ref> and [[Baiae]].<ref>Martial IV 30</ref> Only the one at Circei has been identified today, where its remains can be visited by the Lago di Paola.\n\nThe [[Stadium of Domitian]] was dedicated in 86 AD as a gift to the people of Rome as part of an Imperial building programme following the damage or destruction of most of the buildings on the Field of Mars by fire in 79 AD. It was Rome's first permanent venue for competitive athletics, and today occupied by the [[Piazza Navona]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[Image:Domitian denarius son.png|thumb|250px|Upon his accession, Domitian revalued the Roman currency by increasing the silver content of the [[denarius]] by 12%.

The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus at the time of his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign.<ref name=jones-73>Jones (1992), p. 73</ref> Upon his accession he revalued the [[Roman currency]] dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 90% to 98% \u2014 the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87&nbsp;grams to 3.26&nbsp;grams.

Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years.<ref name=jones-75/> Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.<ref name=jones-75/>\n\nJones estimates Domitian's annual income at more than 1.2 billion [[sestertius|sestertii]], of which over one-third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army.<ref name=jones-73/> The other major expense was the extensive reconstruction of Rome. At the time of Domitian's accession the city was still suffering from the damage caused by the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64]], the civil war of 69 and the fire in 80.<ref name = jones-79/>\n\nMuch more than a renovation project, Domitian's building program was intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural [[renaissance]]. Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus.<ref name=jones-79>Jones (1992), p. 79</ref> Among the most important new structures were an [[Odeon of Domitian|odeon]], a [[Stadium of Domitian|stadium]], and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect [[Rabirius (architect)|Rabirius]].<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 84\u201388</ref>\n\nThe most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, said to have been covered with a [[gilding|gilded]] roof. Among those completed were the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]], the Arch of Titus and the [[Colosseum]], to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.<ref name=jones-93/>\n\nIn order to appease the people of Rome an estimated 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives, or ''[[congiarium|congiaria]]'', throughout Domitian's reign.<ref name=jones-74>Jones (1992), p. 74</ref> The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the [[Capitoline Games]], a quadrennial contest comprising [[Athletic sport|athletic displays]], [[chariot racing]], and competitions for [[Public speaking|oratory]], music and acting.<ref name=jones-103>Jones (1992), p. 103</ref>\n\nDomitian himself supported the travel of competitors from all corners of the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular [[gladiator]]ial games such as naval contests, nighttime battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Lastly, he added two new factions to the chariot races, Gold and Purple, to race against the existing White, Red, Green and Blue factions.<ref name=jones-105>Jones (1992), p. 105</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|250px|A rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, [[Azerbaijan]], mentioning Domitian and [[Legio XII Fulminata]].

As judged by the carved titles of Caesar, Augustus and Germanicus, the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD.\n\nDomitian's administration of the Roman army was characterized by the same fastidious involvement he exhibited in other branches of the government. His competence as a military strategist was criticized by his contemporaries however.<ref name=jones-127>Jones (1992), p. 127</ref> Although he claimed several triumphs, these were largely propaganda manoeuvres. Tacitus derided Domitian's victory against the Chatti as a \"mock triumph\", and criticized his decision to retreat in Britain following the conquests of Agricola.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#39|39]]</ref><ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#2|I.2]]</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Domitian appears to have been very popular among the soldiers, spending an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns\u2014more than any emperor since Augustus\u2014and raising their pay by one-third.<ref name=jones-131/><ref>Syme (1930), p. 64</ref> While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned.<ref name=jones-144>Jones (1992), p. 144</ref>\n\n====Campaign against the Chatti====\nOnce Emperor, Domitian immediately sought to attain his long delayed military glory. As early as 82, or possibly 83, he went to Gaul, ostensibly to conduct a [[census]], and suddenly ordered an attack on the [[Chatti]].<ref name=jones-128>Jones (1992), p. 128</ref> For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75&nbsp;kilometres (46&nbsp;mi) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy's hiding places.<ref name=jones-130>Jones (1992), p. 130</ref>\n\nAlthough little information survives of the battles fought, enough early victories were apparently achieved for Domitian to be back in Rome by the end of 83, where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of ''Germanicus''.<ref name=jones-129>Jones (1992), p. 129</ref> Domitian's supposed victory was much scorned by ancient authors, who described the campaign as \"uncalled for\",<ref name=suetonius-domitian-6>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#6 6]</ref> and a \"mock triumph\".<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/> The evidence lends some credence to these claims, as the Chatti would later play a significant role during the revolt of Saturninus in 89.<ref name=jones-131/>\n\n====Conquest of Britain (77\u201384)====\n[[Image:Statue of Agricola at Bath cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] ([[Bath, Somerset|Bath]])]]\n{{Main|Roman conquest of Britain}}\nOne of the most detailed reports of military activity under the Flavian dynasty was written by Tacitus, whose biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84.<ref name=jones-131/> Agricola arrived c. 77 as governor of Roman Britain, immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia (modern Scotland).\n\nIn 82 Agricola crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-1>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#24|24]]</ref> He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].<ref name=jones-132>Jones (1992), p. 132</ref> He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest.

To aid the advance, a large legionary fortress was constructed at [[Inchtuthil]].<ref name=jones-132/> In the summer of 84, Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians, led by [[Calgacus]], at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]].<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-2>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#29|29]]</ref> Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, two-thirds of the Caledonian army escaped and hid in the Scottish marshes and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], ultimately preventing Agricola from bringing the entire British island under his control.<ref name=jones-132/>\n\nIn 85, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian, having served for more than six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era.<ref name=jones-132/> Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/> The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-3>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#42|42]]</ref>\n\nNot long after Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into war with the [[Dacia|Kingdom of Dacia]] in the East. Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a large-scale strategic [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of troops in the British province. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120&nbsp;kilometres (75&nbsp;mi) further south.<ref name=jones-133>Jones (1992), p. 133</ref> The army command may have resented Domitian's decision to retreat, but to him the Caledonian territories never represented anything more than a loss to the Roman treasury.<ref name=jones-131/>\n\n====Dacian wars (85\u201388)====\n{{details|Domitian's Dacian War}}\n\n[[Image:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|The Roman province of [[Dacia]] (purple area) after the conquest of Trajan in 106, with the [[Black Sea]] to the far right.]]\nThe most significant threat the Roman Empire faced during the reign of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King [[Decebalus]], crossed the Danube into the province of [[Moesia]], wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor [[Oppius Sabinus]].<ref name=jones-138>Jones (1992), p. 138</ref>\n\nDomitian quickly launched a [[counterattack|counteroffensive]], personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]]. Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians back across the border in mid-85, prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph.<ref name=jones-139>Jones (1992), p. 139</ref>\n\nThe victory proved short-lived, however: as early in 86 Fuscus embarked on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia. Fuscus was killed, and the [[Aquila (Roman)|battle standard]] of the Praetorian Guard was lost.<ref name=jones-138/> The loss of the battle standard, or ''aquila'', was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride.\n\nDomitian returned to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time under the command of [[Tettius Julianus]], and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished.<ref name=jones-142>Jones (1992), p. 142</ref> An attack on the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.<ref name=jones-150>Jones (1992), p. 150</ref>\n\nIn order to avert having to conduct a war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, negotiating free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces.<ref name=jones-150/> Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged.<ref name=jones-195>Jones (1992), p. 195</ref> For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful [[client state|client kingdom]], but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses.<ref name=Salmon/>\n\nDomitian probably wanted a new war against the Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. [[Trajan]] continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Knight | first = D.

In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]],<ref name=jones-99/> perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small [[chapel]] dedicated to ''Jupiter Conservator'' was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to ''Jupiter Custos''.<ref name=jones-88>Jones (1992), p. 88</ref>\n\nThe goddess he worshipped the most zealously, however, was [[Minerva]]. Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage\u2014in four different attested reverse types\u2014and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.<ref name=jones-100>Jones (1992), p. 100</ref>\n\nDomitian also revived the practice of the [[imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]], which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and [[Cassius Dio]] allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of ''Dominus et Deus'' (\"Lord and God\").<ref>Suetonius, ''Domitian'', 13:2</ref><ref>Dio, ''Roman History'', 67:4:7</ref> However, not only did he reject the title of ''Dominus'' during his reign,<ref name=jones-108>Jones (1992), p. 108</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Light From the Ancient East|last=contra Deissmann|first=Adolf|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|year=1995|isbn=978-1-56563-155-7|location=Peabody, Massachusetts|pages=357, n. 1|via=}}</ref> but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.<ref name=jones-109/>\n\nTo foster the worship of the imperial family, he erected a dynastic [[mausoleum]] on the site of Vespasian's former house on the [[Quirinal Hill|Quirinal]],<ref name=jones-87>Jones (1992), p. 87</ref> and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother.<ref name=jones-93/> To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed the Arch of Titus.\n\nConstruction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct.<ref name=jones-106>Jones (1992), p. 106</ref> Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the ''[[Lex Julia|Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis]]'', under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.<ref name=jones-107/>\n\nDomitian also heavily prosecuted corruption among public officials, removing jurors if they accepted bribes and rescinding legislation when a [[conflict of interest]] was suspected.<ref name=jones-107/> He ensured that [[libel]]lous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death.<ref name=jones-107/> Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for [[satire]] at the expense of the government.<ref>Grainger (2003), p. 54</ref> Consequently, he forbade [[mime]]s from appearing on stage in public.\n\nIn 87, [[Vestal Virgin]]s were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity. As the Vestals were regarded as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted [[incest]]. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be [[Premature burial|buried alive]].<ref name=jones-101>Jones (1992), p. 101</ref>\n\nForeign religions were tolerated insofar as they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of [[Commodus]]. Veneration of [[Serapis]] and Isis, who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent.<ref name=jones-100/>\n\n4th century writings by [[Eusebius]] maintain that Jews and [[Christianity|Christians]] were heavily [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#Under Domitian|persecuted]] toward the end of Domitian's reign.<ref>{{cite book | last = Eusebius of Caessarea | authorlink = Eusebius of Caesarea | title = Church History | year = 425 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smallwood | first = E.M. | title = 'Domitian's attitude towards the Jews and Judaism | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 51 | pages = 1\u201313 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1086/363978 }}</ref> The [[Book of Revelation]] is thought by some to have been written during this period.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Raymond E. | authorlink = Raymond E.

The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, as well as his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of [[appeasement]] towards Decebalus.<ref name=jones-145>Jones (1992), p. 145</ref>\n\nAt any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The [[Roman governors of Germania Inferior|governor of Germania Inferior]], [[Aulus Bucius Lappius Maximus]], moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of [[Rhaetia]], [[Titus Flavius Norbanus]]. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard.<ref name=jones-146>Jones (1992), p. 146</ref>\n\nBy a stroke of luck, a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus' aid.<ref name=jones-146/> Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.<ref name=jones-149>Jones (1992), p. 149</ref>\n\nLappius Maximus received the governorship of the province of Syria, a second consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with [[Titus Petronius Secundus]] as his colleague.<ref name=jones-148>Jones (1992), pp. 148\u2013149</ref> Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.<ref name=\"Grainger 2003, p. 30\">Grainger (2003), p. 30</ref>\n\nAlthough little is known about the life and career of Nerva before his accession as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors.<ref name=\"Grainger 2003, p. 30\"/> His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime.<ref>Murison (2003), p. 150</ref> The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.\n\n====Relationship with the Senate====\n[[File:Domitian Vaison-la-Romaine.jpg|thumb|Domitian in military garb, wearing the [[muscle cuirass]] with [[Roman sculpture|decorative reliefs]], from [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], France]]\nSince the fall of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the authority of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the [[Principate]].

Domitian was not so subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his [[autocracy]].<ref name=jones-161/> He disliked [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.<ref name=jones-169>Jones (1992), p. 169</ref>\n\nThe dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the senators of Rome rushed to the Senate house, where they immediately passed a motion [[Damnatio memoriae|condemning his memory]] to oblivion.<ref name=jones-160>Jones (1992), p. 160</ref> Under the rulers of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant.<ref name=jones-161/>\n\nNevertheless, the evidence suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely in the hands of the Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul.<ref name=jones-163-8>Jones (1992), pp. 163\u2013168</ref> Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.<ref name=jones-169/>\n\nBoth Tacitus and Suetonius speak of escalating persecutions toward the end of Domitian's reign, identifying a point of sharp increase around 93, or sometime after the failed revolt of Saturninus in 89.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-45>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#45|45]]</ref><ref name=suetonius-domitian-10>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#10 10]</ref> At least twenty senatorial opponents were executed,<ref>For a full list of senatorial victims, see Jones (1992), pp. 182\u2013188</ref> including Domitia Longina's former husband Lucius Aelius Lamia and three of Domitian's own family members, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 82)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] and Marcus Arrecinus Clemens.<ref>M.

As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant to tell him what time it was. The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon.<ref name=grainger-1-3/> Apparently put at ease, the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees.

To suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder would have been less than sensitive.<ref name=jones-194/>\n\nOn the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist, his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Syme | first = Ronald | title = Domitian: The Last Years | journal = Chiron | volume = 13 | pages = 121\u2013146 | year = 1983 }}</ref> but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.<ref name=\"murison-153\"/> The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to have been involved in the conspiracy.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-196\">Jones (1992), p. 196</ref>\n\nThe Senate nonetheless rejoiced at the death of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed ''damnatio memoriae'' on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records.<ref name=grainger-49>Grainger (2003), p. 49</ref> Domitian and, over a century later, [[Publius Septimius Geta]] were the only emperors known to have officially received a ''damnatio memoriae'', though others may have received ''de facto'' ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the [[Cancelleria Reliefs]], were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Last | first = Hugh | title = On the Flavian Reliefs from the Palazzo della Cancelleria | journal = The Journal of Roman Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 9\u201314 | year = 1948 | jstor = 298163| doi = 10.2307/298163 }}</ref> Yet the order of the Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.<ref name=grainger-49/>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, the people of Rome met the news of Domitian's death with indifference, but the army was much grieved, calling for his deification immediately after the assassination, and in several provinces rioting.<ref>Grainger (2003), pp. 32\u201333</ref> As a compensation measure, the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus, and replaced him with a former commander, [[Casperius Aelianus]].<ref>Grainger (2003), p. 40</ref>\n\nDissatisfaction with this state of affairs continued to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid [[siege]] to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage.<ref name=grainger-94>Grainger (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians.<ref name=grainger-94/> Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but [[abdication|abdicated]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Guard Prefects of Trajan and Hadrian | journal = The Journal of Roman Studies | volume = 70 | year = 1980| doi = 10.2307/299556 | jstor=299556 | pages = 64\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Ancient sources===\n[[Image:Domitian statue Vatican.png|thumb|Domitian as Emperor ([[Vatican Museums]]), possibly recut from a statue of Nero.]]\nThe classic view of Domitian is usually negative, since most of the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had notoriously difficult relations.<ref name=jones-160/> Furthermore, contemporary historians such as [[Pliny the Younger]], Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets [[Martial]] and [[Statius]] constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 32</ref>\n\nThe most extensive account of the life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor [[Hadrian]] (117\u2013138). His ''[[De Vita Caesarum]]'' is the source of much of what is known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror.<ref>Waters (1964), p. 51</ref> The biography is problematic, however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent [[libertine]].<ref name=jones-198/>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his interest in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of [[epigram]]matic expression, suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.<ref name=jones-198/>\n\n''De Vita Caesarum'' is also the source of several outrageous stories regarding Domitian's marriage life. According to Suetonius, Domitia Longina was exiled in 83 because of an affair with a famous actor named [[Paris (actor under Domitian)|Paris]]. When Domitian found out, he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife, with Suetonius further adding that once Domitia was exiled, Domitian took Julia as his mistress, who later died during a failed [[abortion]].<ref name=jones-35/><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-22\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#22 22]</ref>\n\nModern historians consider this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court.<ref>Levick (2002), p. 211</ref> Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.\n\nAlthough Tacitus is usually considered to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated by the fact that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor.<ref name=jones-58>Jones (1992), p. 58</ref> In his biographical work ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.<ref name=jones-58/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Dorey | first = T.

Unfortunately, the part of Tacitus' ''Histories'' dealing with the reign of the Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in ''Agricola'' in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.<ref name=\"tacitus-histories-i-1\">Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]</ref>\n\nOther influential 2nd century authors include [[Juvenal]] and Pliny the Younger, the latter of whom was a friend of Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous ''Panegyricus Traiani'' before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satires]]'', depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established by the end of the 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the [[Acts of John]].\n\n===Modern revisionism===\n[[File:Domiziano da latina, 81-96 dc..JPG|thumb|Bust of Domitian wearing the [[civic crown]], from the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Terme]], Rome]]\nOver the course of the 20th century, Domitian's military, administrative and economic policies were re-evaluated.  Hostile views of Domitian had been propagated until [[archeology|archeological]] and [[numismatics|numismatic]] advances brought renewed attention to his reign, and necessitated a revision of the literary tradition established by Tacitus and Pliny. It would be nearly a hundred years after [[St\u00e9phane Gsell]]'s 1894 ''Essai sur le r\u00e8gne de l'empereur Domitien'' however, before any new, book-length studies were published.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review/>\n\nThe first of these was Jones' 1992 ''The Emperor Domitian''.

His harshness was limited to a highly vocal minority, who exaggerated his despotism in favor of the [[Nervan-Antonian dynasty]] that followed.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review/>  His foreign policy was realistic, rejecting expansionist warfare and negotiating peace at a time when Roman military tradition dictated aggressive conquest. Persecution of religious minorities, such as Jews and Christians, was non-existent.<ref name=jones-114-119>Jones (1992), pp. 114\u2013119</ref>\n\nIn 1930, [[Ronald Syme]] argued for a complete reassessment of Domitian's financial policy, which had been largely viewed as a disaster.<ref>His article begins with \"The work of the spade and the use of common sense have done much to mitigate the influence of Tacitus and Pliny and redeem the memory of Domitian from infamy or oblivion. But much remains to be done.\" ''Imperial Finances'' p. 55</ref>  His economic program, which was rigorously efficient, maintained the Roman currency at a standard it would never again achieve.\n\nDomitian's government nonetheless exhibited [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] characteristics. As Emperor, he saw himself as the new Augustus, an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of Flavian renaissance.<ref name=jones-72/>  Using religious, military and cultural propaganda, he fostered a [[cult of personality]]. He deified three of his family members and erected massive structures to commemorate the Flavian achievements. Elaborate triumphs were celebrated in order to boost his image as a warrior-emperor, but many of these were either unearned or premature.<ref name=jones-127/> By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals.<ref name=jones-106/>\n\nHe became personally involved in all branches of the government and successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. The dark side of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate. He punished libel with exile or death and, due to his suspicious nature, increasingly accepted information from [[delatores|informers]] to bring false charges of treason if necessary.<ref name=jones-180>Jones (1992), p. 180</ref>\n\nDespite his vilification by contemporary historians, Domitian's administration provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from his. Much more than a \"gloomy coda to the...1st century\", the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign that [[Theodor Mommsen]] described as a somber but intelligent despotism.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review/><ref>Syme (1930), p. 67</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cultural depictions of Domitian]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book | last = Grainger | first = John D. | title = Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96\u201399 | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-415-28917-7 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Jones | first = Brian W. | title = The Emperor Domitian | publisher = Routledge | year = 1992 | location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-10195-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxeIAgAAQBAJ}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Levick | first = Barbara | authorlink = Barbara Levick | title = Corbulo's Daughter | journal = Greece & Rome | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | pages = 199\u2013211 | doi = 10.1093/gr/49.2.199 | jstor=826906}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Morgan | first = Llewelyn | title = Achilleae Comae: Hair and Heroism According to Domitian |journal=The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series |volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 209\u2013214 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1093/cq/47.1.209 | jstor=639608}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Murison | first = Charles Leslie | title = M.

Central ministries are at the same rank as provincial governments. Writes Lieberthal, \"One key rule of the Chinese system is that units of the same rank cannot issue binding orders to each other.   Operationally, this means that no ministry can issue a binding order to a province.\"  This means a province may challenge, overrule, or ignore decisions made by a ministry.

If ''P'' is normally distributed, then the [[standard score]] of the first quartile, ''z''<sub>1</sub>, is \u22120.67, and the standard score of the third quartile, ''z''<sub>3</sub>, is +0.67.

However, a normal distribution can be trivially perturbed to maintain its Q1 and Q2 std. scores at 0.67 and \u22120.67 and not be normally distributed (so the above test would produce a false positive).

(If there is no data point at 12, then the highest point less than 12.)\nThis means the 1.5*IQR whiskers can be uneven in lengths.\n\n==Distributions==\nThe interquartile range of a continuous distribution can be calculated by integrating the [[probability density function]] (which yields the [[cumulative distribution function]]\u2014any other means of calculating the CDF will also work). The lower quartile, ''Q''<sub>1</sub>, is a number such that integral of the PDF from -\u221e to ''Q''<sub>1</sub> equals 0.25, while the upper quartile, ''Q''<sub>3</sub>, is such a number that the integral from -\u221e to ''Q''<sub>3</sub> equals 0.75; in terms of the CDF, the quartiles can be defined as follows:\n\n:<math>Q_1 = \\text{CDF}^{-1}(0.25) ,</math>\n\n:<math>Q_3 = \\text{CDF}^{-1}(0.75) ,</math>\n\nwhere CDF<sup>\u22121</sup> is the [[quantile function]].\n\nThe interquartile range and median of some common distributions are shown below\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

If ''P'' is normally distributed, then the [[standard score]] of the first quartile, ''z''<sub>1</sub>, is \u22120.67, and the standard score of the third quartile, ''z''<sub>3</sub>, is +0.67. Given ''mean''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''X'' and ''standard&nbsp;deviation''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03c3 for ''P'', if ''P'' is normally distributed, the first quartile\n\n:<math>Q_1 = (\\sigma \\, z_1) + X</math>\n\nand the third quartile\n\n:<math>Q_3 = (\\sigma \\, z_3) + X</math>\n\nIf the actual values of the first or third quartiles differ substantially{{Clarify|date=December 2012}} from the calculated values, ''P'' is not normally distributed. However, a normal distribution can be trivially perturbed to maintain its Q1 and Q2 std. scores at 0.67 and \u22120.67 and not be normally distributed (so the above test would produce a false positive). A better test of normality, such as Q-Q plot would be indicated here.\n\n==Outliers==\n\n[[File:Box-Plot mit Interquartilsabstand.png|thumb|[[Box-and-whisker plot]] with four mild outliers and one extreme outlier. In this chart, outliers are defined as mild above Q3 + 1.5 IQR and extreme above Q3 + 3 IQR.]]\nThe interquartile range is often used to find [[outlier]]s in data. Outliers here are defined as observations that fall below Q1 \u2212 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR. In a boxplot, the highest and lowest occurring value within this limit are indicated by ''whiskers'' of the box (frequently with an additional bar at the end of the whisker) and any outliers as individual points.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Interdecile range]]\n* [[Midhinge]]\n* [[Robust measures of scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Upton>{{cite book |title=Understanding Statistics |first1=Graham|last1=Upton|first2=Ian|last2= Cook|year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-914391-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vXzWG09_SzAC&pg=PA55&dq=interquartile+range#v=onepage&q=interquartile%20range&f=false}}</ref>\n<ref name= ZK>Zwillinger, D., Kokoska, S.

The character is the older brother of [[Mia Toretto]] and love interest of [[Letty Ortiz]]. Throughout the series, Dominic's crew has perpetrated many high-speed semi hijackings, stealing millions of dollars in merchandise. He has spent most of his life running from the law.\n\n===''The Fast and the Furious''===\n{{main|The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)}}\nIn ''The Fast and the Furious'', Dominic runs his own automotive garage while Mia takes care of the family's grocery store in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]]. He also runs his own street race team, which consists of Letty, [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Vince|Vince]], [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Leon|Leon]], and [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Jesse|Jesse]]. Dominic has a feud with Vietnamese-American rival [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Johnny Tran|Johnny Tran]] due to a business deal that went sour and Tran catching Dominic sleeping with his sister. Unknown to the public, he and his team drive black [[Honda Civic (fifth generation)|Honda Civic coupes]] and stage daring semi hijackings on the freeways, taking home millions of dollars in electronic appliances. He forms a friendship with rookie racer [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Brian O'Conner|Brian Earl Spilner]], who saves him from arrest when the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] raid a street race gathering. During the Race Wars, Johnny Tran blames Dominic for a raid by SWAT forces. The SWAT team came into his house, causing disrespect to his family. Dominic then attacks him and is promptly led away by Vince who then tells him to \"chill out\".{{clarify|date=April 2015}} During a hijacking job gone wrong, Dominic discovers Brian's true identity as undercover LAPD officer named Brian O'Conner. Following a drag race that ends with Dominic's [[#Dominic's Charger|1970 Dodge Charger]] getting totalled, Brian hands him the keys to his [[Toyota Supra#Mark IV (1992\u20132002)|Toyota Supra]], as law enforcement have found out that Torretto has stolen millions in electronics with his crew.  Dominic ends up escaping  and fleeing to [[Mexico]].  Brian then is wanted for aiding in the escape of a wanted felon.  Brian flees the state himself.\n\n===''2 Fast 2 Furious''===\n{{main|2 Fast 2 Furious}}\nIn ''2 Fast 2 Furious'', Dominic appears in an archived footage when Brian tells [[Roman Pearce]] about him.\n\n===''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift''===\n{{main|The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift}}\nIn ''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift'', Dominic makes a cameo appearance at the end of the film by challenging [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Sean Boswell|Sean Boswell]] in a drift race with his gun metal silver 1970 [[Plymouth Road Runner]], which he won from his late friend Han. \nThis film takes place after the events of ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'' and before ''[[Furious 7]]''.\n\n===''Los Bandoleros''===\n{{main|Los Bandoleros (film)}}\nIn ''Los Bandoleros'', Dominic recruits [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Han|Han]], [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Rico Santos|Rico Santos]], and [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Tego Leo|Tego Leo]] to help him complete a job that is seen in the beginning of ''Fast & Furious''.\n\n===''Fast & Furious''===\n{{main|Fast & Furious (2009 film)}}\nIn ''Fast & Furious'', Dominic, Letty, and their gang lead a successful hijacking of a gasoline tanker in the [[Dominican Republic]], but he shortly abandons them to keep the authorities away from them. Dominic returns to [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] upon hearing of the death of Letty at the hands of Fenix Calderon. He and Brian once again team up to take down Mexican drug dealer [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Arturo Braga|Arturo Braga]], who had ordered Letty's execution following a drug run. He later finds out  Brian was the last person who had contact with Letty; this enrages him as he attacks Brian before the latter could explain to him that Letty came to him for help in clearing his name so Dominic could return to Los Angeles. After successfully extraditing Braga back to the U.S., Dominic turns himself in to the authorities and is [[Life imprisonment in the United States|sentenced to 25 years to life]] in prison without the possibility of early parole. However, the bus carrying Dominic is ambushed by Brian, Mia, Rico and Tego; once Dominic is sprung out of the bus wreckage, the group flees out of the U.S. as fugitives.\n\n===''Fast Five''===\n{{main|Fast Five}}\nIn ''Fast Five'', Dominic reunites with Brian, Mia and Vince in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. They get involved in a dangerous crossfire with drug lord [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Hernan Reyes|Hernan Reyes]], who has them framed for the murder of three [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents during a drug run on a train. As a means to get even on Reyes, Dominic and Brian form a team with [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Roman Pearce|Roman Pearce]], [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Tej Parker|Tej Parker]], Han, [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Gisele Yashar|Gisele Yashar]], Rico and Tego to stage a bank heist and steal Reyes' stash of US$100 million in cash. Elite [[bounty hunter]] and [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] federal agent [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Luke Hobbs|Luke Hobbs]] is sent to Brazil to hunt down and capture Dominic and his gang, but when he is ambushed by Reyes' men, he forms an unlikely alliance with Dominic and helps the gang execute their heist. After killing Reyes, Hobbs allows Dominic and his gang to leave Brazil with their stash by giving them a 24-hour window. Hobbs' partner [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Elena Neves|Elena Neves]] also leaves the force and becomes Dominic's new love interest.\n\n===''Fast & Furious 6''===\n{{main|Fast & Furious 6}}\nIn ''Fast & Furious 6'', Dominic once again encounters Hobbs, who offers him a job to help him hunt down mercenary [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Owen Shaw|Owen Shaw]] and his crime syndicate, revealing that Letty is alive meaning Fenix must have failed to kill her and is working for Shaw. Dominic and Brian reassemble their gang (minus Rico and Tego, both of whom are in Monaco) in [[London]] for this mission in exchange for a full pardon on all parties and Letty's safe return. During the chase, Dominic is shot by Letty, and later on discovers that she is suffering from amnesia as a result of the explosion that nearly killed her in ''Fast & Furious''. He saves her from falling to her death while the gang stops Shaw aboard a military tank on a bridge in [[Spain]]. Shaw, however, reveals his backup plan of kidnapping Mia and using her as leverage for his release and the handing of the top-secret microchip that was removed from the tank. Despite the death of Gisele, Dominic and his gang defeat Shaw and kill his men while saving Mia and the microchip in a daring chase at a NATO military airfield. Hobbs grants their pardons, and Dominic and his gang move back to his home in L.A. Seeing Dominic and Letty back together for good, Elena bids him farewell and returns to working with Hobbs. In a post credit scene, Owen Shaw's elder brother, Deckard Shaw, kills Han in Tokyo and calls Dom with a threatening message.\n\n===''Furious 7''===\n{{main|Furious 7}}\nIn ''[[Furious 7]]'', it was revealed that Owen Shaw is still alive, and his older brother Deckard Shaw went rogue and hunts Dominic's team, which resulted in Han's death (this explains why he died in ''Tokyo Drift'', bridging the story here) and his house being blown up. Determined to exact revenge on Shaw, Dominic decided to take him down alone, but was stopped by a Covert Ops leader and Hobbs' friend Mr. Nobody. Mr. Nobody offers Dominic a way to hunt Shaw by obtaining a software named \"God's Eye\" and save its creator named Ramsey from Mose Jakande and his men. Agreeing to the deal, Dominic, Brian, Letty, Tej and Roman led a daring rescue to Ramsey at the mountains of [[Azerbaijan]] and succeeds in doing so. Afterwards they figured out that the device was lend to a friend of Ramsey who lives in [[Abu Dhabi]] named Zafar. After a successful retrieval of the God's Eye (that also involved Dominic and Brian made a [[Lykan HyperSport|vehicle]] jump on [[Etihad Towers|three buildings]]), they found Shaw's hideout but also got into a surprise ambush that killed Nobody's men and him being injured. Afterwards, Dominic decided to take down the alliance of Shaw and Jakande on their home turf. This also led to Dominic and Shaw have an intense fight at the rooftop of a parking garage while Brian led the others to lure Jakande while Ramsey initiating a hack to shut down God's Eye for good. They succeeded in doing so but also paid with a huge destruction in the city and the death of Jakande when Dominic let his car crash on Jakande's chopper and hooking a bag of grenades on its skids before crashing his vehicle, thought that he died in the process. This prompts Letty's memories of her and Dominic restored (and also reveals that they were indeed married to each other somewhere in between the story of ''Los Bandoleros'' and ''Fast & Furious)'' and Dominic recovers from being unconscious. After this, Brian decides to retire from the crew in order to spend time with his family. Dominic leaves without saying goodbye, prompting Brian to catch up to him at an intersection and have one last drive before parting ways.\n\nThis also was done to give Brian's role a clean retirement and a send-off after the actor who portrays him, [[Paul Walker]], died in a single vehicle accident back in 2013.\n\n===''The Fate of the Furious''===\n{{main|The Fate of the Furious}}\nIn ''The Fate of the Furious'', Dom has betrayed his family and friends at the behest of a mysterious, [[seductive]] woman known as Cipher. After betraying his team to steal an EMP device they were assigned to recover, it is revealed that Cipher \u2014 the true mastermind behind both the attempted creation of the Nightshade device in ''Fast & Furious 6'' and also the near-theft of the God's Eye hacking device in ''Furious 7'' \u2014 has captured Elena and Dom's previously-unknown son, using them as blackmail tools to ensure Dom's cooperation. Despite Cipher's dismissal of Dom's views on family and her access to multiple surveillance systems, Dom manages to use his contacts to pass on a message to Magdalene Shaw, the mother of Deckard and Owen Shaw, allowing her to retrieve her sons and send them aboard Cipher's plane via a tracking device slipped into Dom's necklace. Once the Shaws retrieve his son \u2014 as Elena having been killed earlier for Cipher to make a point to Dom \u2014 Dom rejoins his team and destroys a Russian nuclear submarine Cipher was attempting to steal. Although Cipher escapes, Dom vows to protect his new son, naming the boy Brian after his brother-in-law and best friend.\n\n===''F9''===\n{{main|F9 (film)}}\n\nYou can't see me\n\n==Characterization==\nDominic has been described as \"a gruff but affectionate father to his loyal pack of renegades, providing them with [[barbecue]], protection, and a rough moral code to live by.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2292592/|title=''Fast Five'' reviewed: a tenderhearted family drama starring Vin Diesel.|magazine=[[Slate Magazine]]|last=Stevens|first=Dana|date=2011-04-29|accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref> Vin Diesel has described Dominic as \"a character who is strong, who is a caretaker.\"<ref name=krulik /> In contrast to Brian's estranged relationship with his father, Dominic is shown to \"put family first\" and be very protective of Mia. He is also implied to be religious, insisting that all members in a dinner table say grace and that the first person to take a bite must bless the meal.\n\nIn ''The Fast and the Furious'', Dominic's volatile temper stems from a painful incident during his teenage years, when his father, a stock car racer, was killed in a race after a driver named Kenny Linder accidentally sent him to the wall at 120&nbsp;mph. Distraught by his father's death, Dominic assaulted Linder a week later with a [[torque wrench]] and left him hospitalized with severe head injuries. Dominic served time in [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]] and was banned from racing for the attack. He nearly replicates the action while fighting Hobbs in ''Fast Five'', only to (purposely) miss Hobbs' head by an inch when Mia begs him to stop.\n\nIn ''Fast Five'', Dominic recalls the influence his father had on him. His father would help Mia with her homework everyday and sending her to bed, he would stay up late reading the next chapter, to make sure he could help her the next day. On Sundays, the family would attend church and host a barbecue for the neighborhood; those who did not attend church would not be allowed at the barbecue.\n\nHowever, Dominic is also obsessed with racing. In the first film, he says: \"I live my life a quarter mile at a time. Nothing else matters: not the mortgage, not the store, not my team and all their bullshit. For those ten seconds or less, I'm free.\" In ''The Fate of the Furious'', Cipher repeats a similar phrase to Dominic to question his loyalty to his family.<ref>[https://moviepilot.com/p/fast-and-furious-8-explained-ciphers-plot/4244256 ]</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\nDominic's main love interest is [[Letty Ortiz]] who he grew up with. During ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', she comes back with amnesia. Dominic was with [[Elena Neves]] during that time. However, they rekindled their relationship and it is revealed that they got married a few years ago, and also explaining the iconic necklace.\n\n==Cars==\n\n===Dominic's Charger===\n[[File:Dodge Charger - The Fast and the Furious.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Dominic's 1970 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger R/T]]'' picture car on display at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].]]\nIn four of the films, Dom drives his deceased father's black 1970 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]].<ref name=Palmer2006>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Kris|title=The Fast and the Furious: The Official Car Guide|year=2006|publisher=MotorBooks|isbn=978-0-7603-2568-1|pages=26, 14, 90, etc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_jj4j7IE1EC&pg=PA26}}</ref> In the first film, Dom tells Brian that he and his father built the 900 horsepower car, but that he had never driven it, because it \"scares the shit out of [him].\"<ref name=HuffmanDodge>{{cite web|last=Huffman|first=John|title=Driving the 1969 Dodge Charger From Fast Five:Behind the Wheel of Dominic Toretto's Menacing Coupe|url=http://www.insideline.com/dodge/charger/driving-the-1970-dodge-charger-from-fast-five.html|work=Home- Articles - Car Features|publisher=Edmunds insideline.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124065736/http://www.insideline.com/dodge/charger/driving-the-1970-dodge-charger-from-fast-five.html|archivedate=November 24, 2012|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> Dom uses it to help Brian by attacking one of Tran's henchmen. He later races Brian's Supra with it; however, he totals it when he collides with a truck.\n\nIn ''Fast & Furious'' he sees that Letty has rebuilt it for him, as she was hoping that he would return to the United States. Later in the film, Dom takes it to Mexico and shields Brian's car with it, but destroys it by running into a stack of [[propane]] canisters in the tunnels. In the final scene of the film, Brian is shown to have rebuilt it, and Dom recognizes the sound of the engine while riding in a prison bus. In ''Fast Five'', it is shown that Brian brakes in front of the bus, causing the bus to collide with it and flip. Dom uses it throughout the film to win cars to test for their vault heist. Meanwhile, Hobbs uses it to track the location of Dom's gang by having his men check camera feeds for a 1970 Charger. When Hobbs comes to arrest Dom, he crashes his [[Armet Armored Vehicles Gurkha|Gurkha F5]] into his Charger, cutting it in half, which triggers a fight between the pair.\n\nIn ''Furious 7'', near the end of the movie he goes to his home which was recently blown up by Deckard Shaw, and in the garage is his Charger covered up. He uncovers it revealing the slightly different new look. He takes the Charger to the top of a rooftop where he faces Shaw in a game of [[Chicken (game)|chicken]]. When the building is later collapsing due to missiles, Torretto ramps it off the building destroying it yet again.\n\nThe car goes through some changes. In the first film, it is chrome trimmed, while in the fourth film it is black trimmed, with an extra grill cover. In the fifth film it is matte black, with black wheels and the supercharger removed. In the seventh film, Torretto's Charger has the supercharger again. The car still has black trim but is no longer matte black but metallic black. Also a different set of rims. The car has been in a series of promotions: ''[[Car Town]]'' offered the versions from both the first and fifth films, while ''[[Mafia Wars]]'' offered the first.''\n\nIn ''Fast & Furious 6'', Dom gives his nephew Jack a diecast replica of his black Charger, hoping to keep him away from Brian's habits of favoring imports. Later in the film, Dom drives a maroon [[Dodge Charger Daytona]], which is acquired by Tej Parker at a car auction in London. While it is not the same car as his signature black Charger, it is a direct nod to The Charger.\n\nAt the very end of ''Furious 7'' Toretto is seen with the Project Maximus Ultra 1968 Dodge Charger.\n\nIn ''The Fate of the Furious'', Toretto drives an armoured version of his usual Charger in the film's final confrontation.\n\nThe car is seen hoodless in the Fast & Furious 9 trailer.\n\n===Car list===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n! width=\"230\" | Film\n! width=\"260\" | Car<ref name=\"Palmer2006\" /><ref name=Simona2006>{{cite

(arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise. He is portrayed by [[Vin Diesel]] and first appeared on film, alongside fellow protagonist [[Brian O'Conner]], in ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (2001). Dominic was created by screenwriter [[Gary Scott Thompson]], who was inspired by an article on [[street racing]] that was published in the May 1998 issue of [[Vibe (magazine)|''Vibe'']] magazine, while Diesel was heavily sought after to play the character.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8oxRdBRd3I|title=Vin Diesel: 7 Things You Don't Know About Me|magazine=Variety|accessdate=February 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs the patriarch of a group of street racers, Dominic acts as an influential voice, being forced into the role as primary caregiver following his father's untimely passing. As the leader, he initially worked as an auto mechanic, but eventually progressed to orchestrating carjackings, a multi-million dollar heist, and illicit jobs for government agencies. Dominic embodies many attributes associated with his position: he is gruff, strong, and preaches morality and loyalty. In many cases, he is also seen to be affectionate and religious, but also possesses a volatile temper, especially when his family is in danger. He is married to [[Letty Ortiz]], with whom he is raising a son.<ref name=krulik /> He is also implied to be the group's strongest racer, a title that is challenged persistently by Brian.\n\nDominic is one of the most popular characters in modern cinema and is widely considered among the primary reasons for the longevity of the film series. The role propelled Diesel to become a [[Bankable star|bankable]] [[Movie star|Hollywood star]]. He won the 2002 and 2014 [[MTV Movie Awards]] for Best On-Screen Team with [[Paul Walker]] for his performances.<ref name=krulik>{{cite book|first=Nancy|last=Krulik|authorlink=Nancy E.

The character is the older brother of [[Mia Toretto]] and love interest of [[Letty Ortiz]]. Throughout the series, Dominic's crew has perpetrated many high-speed semi hijackings, stealing millions of dollars in merchandise. He has spent most of his life running from the law.\n\n===''The Fast and the Furious''===\n{{main|The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)}}\nIn ''The Fast and the Furious'', Dominic runs his own automotive garage while Mia takes care of the family's grocery store in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]]. He also runs his own street race team, which consists of Letty, [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Vince|Vince]], [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Leon|Leon]], and [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Jesse|Jesse]]. Dominic has a feud with Vietnamese-American rival [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Johnny Tran|Johnny Tran]] due to a business deal that went sour and Tran catching Dominic sleeping with his sister. Unknown to the public, he and his team drive black [[Honda Civic (fifth generation)|Honda Civic coupes]] and stage daring semi hijackings on the freeways, taking home millions of dollars in electronic appliances. He forms a friendship with rookie racer [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Brian O'Conner|Brian Earl Spilner]], who saves him from arrest when the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] raid a street race gathering. During the Race Wars, Johnny Tran blames Dominic for a raid by SWAT forces. The SWAT team came into his house, causing disrespect to his family. Dominic then attacks him and is promptly led away by Vince who then tells him to \"chill out\".{{clarify|date=April 2015}} During a hijacking job gone wrong, Dominic discovers Brian's true identity as undercover LAPD officer named Brian O'Conner. Following a drag race that ends with Dominic's [[#Dominic's Charger|1970 Dodge Charger]] getting totalled, Brian hands him the keys to his [[Toyota Supra#Mark IV (1992\u20132002)|Toyota Supra]], as law enforcement have found out that Torretto has stolen millions in electronics with his crew.  Dominic ends up escaping  and fleeing to [[Mexico]].  Brian then is wanted for aiding in the escape of a wanted felon.  Brian flees the state himself.\n\n===''2 Fast 2 Furious''===\n{{main|2 Fast 2 Furious}}\nIn ''2 Fast 2 Furious'', Dominic appears in an archived footage when Brian tells [[Roman Pearce]] about him.\n\n===''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift''===\n{{main|The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift}}\nIn ''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift'', Dominic makes a cameo appearance at the end of the film by challenging [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Sean Boswell|Sean Boswell]] in a drift race with his gun metal silver 1970 [[Plymouth Road Runner]], which he won from his late friend Han. \nThis film takes place after the events of ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'' and before ''[[Furious 7]]''.\n\n===''Los Bandoleros''===\n{{main|Los Bandoleros (film)}}\nIn ''Los Bandoleros'', Dominic recruits [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Han|Han]], [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Rico Santos|Rico Santos]], and [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Tego Leo|Tego Leo]] to help him complete a job that is seen in the beginning of ''Fast & Furious''.\n\n===''Fast & Furious''===\n{{main|Fast & Furious (2009 film)}}\nIn ''Fast & Furious'', Dominic, Letty, and their gang lead a successful hijacking of a gasoline tanker in the [[Dominican Republic]], but he shortly abandons them to keep the authorities away from them. Dominic returns to [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] upon hearing of the death of Letty at the hands of Fenix Calderon. He and Brian once again team up to take down Mexican drug dealer [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Arturo Braga|Arturo Braga]], who had ordered Letty's execution following a drug run. He later finds out  Brian was the last person who had contact with Letty; this enrages him as he attacks Brian before the latter could explain to him that Letty came to him for help in clearing his name so Dominic could return to Los Angeles. After successfully extraditing Braga back to the U.S., Dominic turns himself in to the authorities and is [[Life imprisonment in the United States|sentenced to 25 years to life]] in prison without the possibility of early parole. However, the bus carrying Dominic is ambushed by Brian, Mia, Rico and Tego; once Dominic is sprung out of the bus wreckage, the group flees out of the U.S. as fugitives.\n\n===''Fast Five''===\n{{main|Fast Five}}\nIn ''Fast Five'', Dominic reunites with Brian, Mia and Vince in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. They get involved in a dangerous crossfire with drug lord [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Hernan Reyes|Hernan Reyes]], who has them framed for the murder of three [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents during a drug run on a train. As a means to get even on Reyes, Dominic and Brian form a team with [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Roman Pearce|Roman Pearce]], [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Tej Parker|Tej Parker]], Han, [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Gisele Yashar|Gisele Yashar]], Rico and Tego to stage a bank heist and steal Reyes' stash of US$100 million in cash. Elite [[bounty hunter]] and [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] federal agent [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Luke Hobbs|Luke Hobbs]] is sent to Brazil to hunt down and capture Dominic and his gang, but when he is ambushed by Reyes' men, he forms an unlikely alliance with Dominic and helps the gang execute their heist. After killing Reyes, Hobbs allows Dominic and his gang to leave Brazil with their stash by giving them a 24-hour window. Hobbs' partner [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Elena Neves|Elena Neves]] also leaves the force and becomes Dominic's new love interest.\n\n===''Fast & Furious 6''===\n{{main|Fast & Furious 6}}\nIn ''Fast & Furious 6'', Dominic once again encounters Hobbs, who offers him a job to help him hunt down mercenary [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Owen Shaw|Owen Shaw]] and his crime syndicate, revealing that Letty is alive meaning Fenix must have failed to kill her and is working for Shaw. Dominic and Brian reassemble their gang (minus Rico and Tego, both of whom are in Monaco) in [[London]] for this mission in exchange for a full pardon on all parties and Letty's safe return. During the chase, Dominic is shot by Letty, and later on discovers that she is suffering from amnesia as a result of the explosion that nearly killed her in ''Fast & Furious''. He saves her from falling to her death while the gang stops Shaw aboard a military tank on a bridge in [[Spain]]. Shaw, however, reveals his backup plan of kidnapping Mia and using her as leverage for his release and the handing of the top-secret microchip that was removed from the tank. Despite the death of Gisele, Dominic and his gang defeat Shaw and kill his men while saving Mia and the microchip in a daring chase at a NATO military airfield. Hobbs grants their pardons, and Dominic and his gang move back to his home in L.A. Seeing Dominic and Letty back together for good, Elena bids him farewell and returns to working with Hobbs. In a post credit scene, Owen Shaw's elder brother, Deckard Shaw, kills Han in Tokyo and calls Dom with a threatening message.\n\n===''Furious 7''===\n{{main|Furious 7}}\nIn ''[[Furious 7]]'', it was revealed that Owen Shaw is still alive, and his older brother Deckard Shaw went rogue and hunts Dominic's team, which resulted in Han's death (this explains why he died in ''Tokyo Drift'', bridging the story here) and his house being blown up. Determined to exact revenge on Shaw, Dominic decided to take him down alone, but was stopped by a Covert Ops leader and Hobbs' friend Mr. Nobody. Mr. Nobody offers Dominic a way to hunt Shaw by obtaining a software named \"God's Eye\" and save its creator named Ramsey from Mose Jakande and his men. Agreeing to the deal, Dominic, Brian, Letty, Tej and Roman led a daring rescue to Ramsey at the mountains of [[Azerbaijan]] and succeeds in doing so. Afterwards they figured out that the device was lend to a friend of Ramsey who lives in [[Abu Dhabi]] named Zafar. After a successful retrieval of the God's Eye (that also involved Dominic and Brian made a [[Lykan HyperSport|vehicle]] jump on [[Etihad Towers|three buildings]]), they found Shaw's hideout but also got into a surprise ambush that killed Nobody's men and him being injured. Afterwards, Dominic decided to take down the alliance of Shaw and Jakande on their home turf. This also led to Dominic and Shaw have an intense fight at the rooftop of a parking garage while Brian led the others to lure Jakande while Ramsey initiating a hack to shut down God's Eye for good. They succeeded in doing so but also paid with a huge destruction in the city and the death of Jakande when Dominic let his car crash on Jakande's chopper and hooking a bag of grenades on its skids before crashing his vehicle, thought that he died in the process. This prompts Letty's memories of her and Dominic restored (and also reveals that they were indeed married to each other somewhere in between the story of ''Los Bandoleros'' and ''Fast & Furious)'' and Dominic recovers from being unconscious. After this, Brian decides to retire from the crew in order to spend time with his family. Dominic leaves without saying goodbye, prompting Brian to catch up to him at an intersection and have one last drive before parting ways.\n\nThis also was done to give Brian's role a clean retirement and a send-off after the actor who portrays him, [[Paul Walker]], died in a single vehicle accident back in 2013.\n\n===''The Fate of the Furious''===\n{{main|The Fate of the Furious}}\nIn ''The Fate of the Furious'', Dom has betrayed his family and friends at the behest of a mysterious, [[seductive]] woman known as Cipher. After betraying his team to steal an EMP device they were assigned to recover, it is revealed that Cipher \u2014 the true mastermind behind both the attempted creation of the Nightshade device in ''Fast & Furious 6'' and also the near-theft of the God's Eye hacking device in ''Furious 7'' \u2014 has captured Elena and Dom's previously-unknown son, using them as blackmail tools to ensure Dom's cooperation. Despite Cipher's dismissal of Dom's views on family and her access to multiple surveillance systems, Dom manages to use his contacts to pass on a message to Magdalene Shaw, the mother of Deckard and Owen Shaw, allowing her to retrieve her sons and send them aboard Cipher's plane via a tracking device slipped into Dom's necklace. Once the Shaws retrieve his son \u2014 as Elena having been killed earlier for Cipher to make a point to Dom \u2014 Dom rejoins his team and destroys a Russian nuclear submarine Cipher was attempting to steal. Although Cipher escapes, Dom vows to protect his new son, naming the boy Brian after his brother-in-law and best friend.\n\n===''F9''===\n{{main|F9 (film)}}\n\n==Characterization==\nDominic has been described as \"a gruff but affectionate father to his loyal pack of renegades, providing them with [[barbecue]], protection, and a rough moral code to live by.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2292592/|title=''Fast Five'' reviewed: a tenderhearted family drama starring Vin Diesel.|magazine=[[Slate Magazine]]|last=Stevens|first=Dana|date=2011-04-29|accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref> Vin Diesel has described Dominic as \"a character who is strong, who is a caretaker.\"<ref name=krulik /> In contrast to Brian's estranged relationship with his father, Dominic is shown to \"put family first\" and be very protective of Mia. He is also implied to be religious, insisting that all members in a dinner table say grace and that the first person to take a bite must bless the meal.\n\nIn ''The Fast and the Furious'', Dominic's volatile temper stems from a painful incident during his teenage years, when his father, a stock car racer, was killed in a race after a driver named Kenny Linder accidentally sent him to the wall at 120&nbsp;mph. Distraught by his father's death, Dominic assaulted Linder a week later with a [[torque wrench]] and left him hospitalized with severe head injuries. Dominic served time in [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]] and was banned from racing for the attack. He nearly replicates the action while fighting Hobbs in ''Fast Five'', only to (purposely) miss Hobbs' head by an inch when Mia begs him to stop.\n\nIn ''Fast Five'', Dominic recalls the influence his father had on him. His father would help Mia with her homework everyday and sending her to bed, he would stay up late reading the next chapter, to make sure he could help her the next day. On Sundays, the family would attend church and host a barbecue for the neighborhood; those who did not attend church would not be allowed at the barbecue.\n\nHowever, Dominic is also obsessed with racing. In the first film, he says: \"I live my life a quarter mile at a time. Nothing else matters: not the mortgage, not the store, not my team and all their bullshit. For those ten seconds or less, I'm free.\" In ''The Fate of the Furious'', Cipher repeats a similar phrase to Dominic to question his loyalty to his family.<ref>[https://moviepilot.com/p/fast-and-furious-8-explained-ciphers-plot/4244256 ]</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\nDominic's main love interest is [[Letty Ortiz]] who he grew up with. During ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', she comes back with amnesia. Dominic was with [[Elena Neves]] during that time. However, they rekindled their relationship and it is revealed that they got married a few years ago, and also explaining the iconic necklace.\n\n==Cars==\n\n===Dominic's Charger===\n[[File:Dodge Charger - The Fast and the Furious.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Dominic's 1970 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger R/T]]'' picture car on display at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].]]\nIn four of the films, Dom drives his deceased father's black 1970 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]].<ref name=Palmer2006>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Kris|title=The Fast and the Furious: The Official Car Guide|year=2006|publisher=MotorBooks|isbn=978-0-7603-2568-1|pages=26, 14, 90, etc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_jj4j7IE1EC&pg=PA26}}</ref> In the first film, Dom tells Brian that he and his father built the 900 horsepower car, but that he had never driven it, because it \"scares the shit out of [him].\"<ref name=HuffmanDodge>{{cite web|last=Huffman|first=John|title=Driving the 1969 Dodge Charger From Fast Five:Behind the Wheel of Dominic Toretto's Menacing Coupe|url=http://www.insideline.com/dodge/charger/driving-the-1970-dodge-charger-from-fast-five.html|work=Home- Articles - Car Features|publisher=Edmunds insideline.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124065736/http://www.insideline.com/dodge/charger/driving-the-1970-dodge-charger-from-fast-five.html|archivedate=November 24, 2012|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> Dom uses it to help Brian by attacking one of Tran's henchmen. He later races Brian's Supra with it; however, he totals it when he collides with a truck.\n\nIn ''Fast & Furious'' he sees that Letty has rebuilt it for him, as she was hoping that he would return to the United States. Later in the film, Dom takes it to Mexico and shields Brian's car with it, but destroys it by running into a stack of [[propane]] canisters in the tunnels. In the final scene of the film, Brian is shown to have rebuilt it, and Dom recognizes the sound of the engine while riding in a prison bus. In ''Fast Five'', it is shown that Brian brakes in front of the bus, causing the bus to collide with it and flip. Dom uses it throughout the film to win cars to test for their vault heist. Meanwhile, Hobbs uses it to track the location of Dom's gang by having his men check camera feeds for a 1970 Charger. When Hobbs comes to arrest Dom, he crashes his [[Armet Armored Vehicles Gurkha|Gurkha F5]] into his Charger, cutting it in half, which triggers a fight between the pair.\n\nIn ''Furious 7'', near the end of the movie he goes to his home which was recently blown up by Deckard Shaw, and in the garage is his Charger covered up. He uncovers it revealing the slightly different new look. He takes the Charger to the top of a rooftop where he faces Shaw in a game of [[Chicken (game)|chicken]]. When the building is later collapsing due to missiles, Torretto ramps it off the building destroying it yet again.\n\nThe car goes through some changes. In the first film, it is chrome trimmed, while in the fourth film it is black trimmed, with an extra grill cover. In the fifth film it is matte black, with black wheels and the supercharger removed. In the seventh film, Torretto's Charger has the supercharger again. The car still has black trim but is no longer matte black but metallic black. Also a different set of rims. The car has been in a series of promotions: ''[[Car Town]]'' offered the versions from both the first and fifth films, while ''[[Mafia Wars]]'' offered the first.''\n\nIn ''Fast & Furious 6'', Dom gives his nephew Jack a diecast replica of his black Charger, hoping to keep him away from Brian's habits of favoring imports.

After attending [[Oxford University]] he served in the British army during the [[Seven Years' War]]. He took part in the [[Raid on Rochefort]] and the [[Battle of Minden]]. As a reward for his conduct at the [[Battle of Kloster Kampen]], Shelburne was appointed an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[George III of Great Britain|George III]]. He became involved in politics, becoming a member of parliament in 1760. After his father's death in 1761 he inherited his title and was elevated to the [[House of Lords]]. He took an active role in politics. He served as [[President of the Board of Trade]] in the [[Grenville Ministry]] but resigned this position after only a few months and began to associate with the opposition leader [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]].\n\nWhen Pitt was made Prime Minister in 1766, Shelburne was appointed as [[Southern Secretary]], a position which he held for two years. He departed office during the [[Corsican Crisis]] and joined the Opposition. Along with Pitt he was an advocate of a conciliatory policy towards Britain's [[British America|American Colonies]] and a long-term critic of the [[North Ministry|North Government]]'s measures in America. Following the fall of the North government, Shelburne joined its replacement under [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]]. Shelburne was made Prime Minister in 1782 following Rockingham's death, with the American War still being fought. Shelburne's government was brought down largely due to the terms of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] which brought the conflict to an end. Its terms were considered excessively generous, because they gave the new nation control of vast [[Appalachian Mountains|trans-Appalachian lands]]. Shelburne, however, had a vision of long-term benefit to Britain through trade with a large and increasingly prosperous United States, without the risk of warfare over the western territories.\n\nAfter he was forced from office in 1783 at age 45, he permanently lost his power and influence. Shelburne lamented that his career had been a failure, despite the many high offices he held over 17 years, and his undoubted abilities as a debater.  He blamed his poor education\u2014although it was as good as that of most peers\u2014and said the real problem was that \"it has been my fate through life to fall in with clever but unpopular connections.\"  Historians, however, point to a  nasty personality that alienated friend and enemy alike. His contemporaries distrusted him as too prone to trickery and duplicity. Biographer  John Cannon says \"His uneasiness prompted him to alternate flattery and hectoring, which most of his colleagues found unpleasant, and to suspiciousness...&nbsp;In debate he was frequently vituperative and sarcastic.\"  Success came too early, and produced jealousy, especially when he was tagged as an upstart Irishman.  He never understood the power of the House of Commons, or how to deal with its leaders.  He advocated numerous reforms,  especially free trade, religious toleration, and parliamentary reform.  He was ahead of his time, but was unable to build an adequate network of support from his colleagues who distrusted his motives.  In turn he distrusted others, and tried to do all the work himself so that it would be done right.<ref>John Cannon, \"Petty, William, second earl of Shelburne and first marquess of Lansdowne (1737\u20131805)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', (Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born '''William Fitzmaurice''' in [[Dublin]] in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], the first son of [[John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne|John Fitzmaurice]], who was the second surviving son of the [[Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry|1st Earl of Kerry]]. Lord Kerry had married Anne Petty, the daughter of Sir [[William Petty]], [[Surveyor General of Ireland]], whose elder son had been created Baron Shelburne in 1688 and (on the elder son's death) whose younger son had been created Baron Shelburne in 1699 and Earl of Shelburne in 1719. On the younger son's death the Petty estates passed to the aforementioned John Fitzmaurice, who changed his branch of the family's surname to \"Petty\" in place of \"Fitzmaurice\", and was created Viscount Fitzmaurice later in 1751 and Earl of Shelburne in 1753 (after which his elder son John was styled '''Viscount Fitzmaurice'''). His grandfather Lord Kerry died when he was four, but Fitzmaurice grew up with other people's grim memories of the old man as  a \"Tyrant\" whose family and servants lived in permanent fear of him.\n\nFitzmaurice  spent his  childhood \"in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland,\"<ref>Childhood in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland probably refers to the family estates in [[County Kerry]].  The Pettys owned the Lansdowne Estates in the [[Kenmare]] area in South Kerry and the Fitzmaurice estates were in the [[Lixnaw]] area in North Kerry.</ref> and, according to his own account, when he entered [[Christ Church, Oxford]], in 1755, he had \"both everything to learn and everything to unlearn\". From a [[tutor]] whom he describes as \"narrow-minded\" he received advantageous guidance in his studies, but he attributes his improvement in manners and in knowledge of the world chiefly to the fact that, as was his \"fate through life\", he fell in \"with clever but unpopular connexions\".\n\n==Military career and election to Parliament==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}\n[[File:Caton-Woodville Battle of Minden 1759.jpeg|thumb|Shelburne served with distinction during the Seven Years' War participating in engagements such as the [[Battle of Minden]] in 1759.]]\nShortly after leaving the university he served in [[20th Foot]] regiment commanded by [[James Wolfe]] during the [[Seven Years' War]].

He consulted with numerous English, Scottish, French and American economists and experts. He was on good terms with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[David Hume]]. He met in Paris with leading French economists and intellectuals.<ref>Ritcheson (1983) p 328-33</ref>  By the 1770s  Shelburne had become the most prominent British statesmen to advocate [[free trade]].<ref name=www.bowood.org.uk>Bowood House web page</ref> Shelburne said his conversion from mercantilism to free trade ultimately derived from long conversations in 1761 with [[Adam Smith]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=James Ashley|title=Before Hegemony: Adam Smith, American Independence, and the Origins of the First Era of Globalization|journal=International Organization|volume=66|issue=3|pages=395\u2013428|doi=10.1017/S0020818312000148|issn=1531-5088|date=July 2012|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2eab161220aea057405eda9fa0c405e2f68b00da}}</ref> In 1795 he described this to [[Dugald Stewart]]:\n\n:I owe to a journey I made with Mr Smith from Edinburgh to London, the difference between light and darkness through the best part of my life. The novelty of his principles, added to my youth and prejudices, made me unable to comprehend them at the time, but he urged them with so much benevolence, as well as eloquence, that they took a certain hold, which, though it did not develop itself so as to arrive at full conviction for some few years after, I can fairly say, has constituted, ever since, the happiness of my life, as well as any little consideration I may have enjoyed in it.<ref>Ian S. Ross (ed.), ''On The Wealth of Nations. Contemporary Responses to Adam Smith'' (Bristol: Theommes Press, 1998), p. 147.</ref>\n\nRitcheson is dubious on whether the journey with Smith actually happened, but provides no evidence to the contrary. There is proof that Shelburne did consult with Smith on at least one occasion, and Smith was close to Shelburne's father and his brother.<ref>Ritcheson (1983) p 326-28</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nShelburne's new military role close to the King brought him into communication with [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], who was the King's closest advisor and a senior minister in the government. In 1761 Shelburne was employed by Bute to negotiate for the support of [[Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland|Henry Fox]]. Fox held the lucrative but unimportant post of [[Paymaster of the Forces]], but commanded large support in the House of Commons and could boost Bute's powerbase. Shelburne was opposed to Pitt, who had resigned from the government in 1761. Under instructions from Shelburne, Barr\u00e9 made a vehement attack on Pitt in the House of Commons.\n\nDuring 1762 negotiations for a peace agreement went on in London and Paris. Eventually a deal was agreed but it was heavily criticised for the perceived leniency of its terms as it handed back a number of captured territories to France and Spain. Defending it in the House of Lords, Shelburne observed \"the security of the British colonies in North America was the first cause of the war\" asserting that security \"has been wisely attended to in the negotiations for peace\".<ref>Schweizer p.17</ref> Led by Fox, the government was able to push the peace treaty through parliament despite opposition led by Pitt. Shortly afterwards, Bute chose to resign as Prime Minister and retire from politics and was replaced by [[George Grenville]].\n\nShelburne joined the [[George Grenville|Grenville]] ministry in 1763 as [[President of the Board of Trade|First Lord of Trade]]. By this stage Shelburne had changed his opinion of Pitt and become an admirer of him. After failing to secure Pitt's inclusion in the Cabinet he resigned office after only a few months. Having moreover on account of his support of Pitt on the question of [[John Wilkes]]'s expulsion from the House of Commons incurred the displeasure of the King, he retired for a time to his estate.\n\n===Southern Secretary===\nAfter Pitt's return to power in 1766 he became [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]], but during Pitt's illness his conciliatory policy towards America was completely thwarted by his colleagues and the King, and in 1768 he was dismissed from office. During the [[Corsican Crisis]], sparked by the [[French Conquest of Corsica|French invasion of Corsica]], Shelburne was the major voice in the cabinet who favoured assisting the [[Corsican Republic]]. Although secret aid was given to the Corsicans it was decided not to intervene militarily and provoke a war with France, a decision made easier by the departure of the hard-line Shelburne from the cabinet.\n\nIn June 1768 the General Court incorporated the district of [[Shelburne, Massachusetts]] from the area formerly known as \"Deerfield Northeast\" and in 1786 the district became a town.  The town was named in honour<!--this article should be written in British English--> of Lord Shelburne, who, in return sent a [[church bell]], which never reached the town.\n\n===Opposition===\nShelburne went into Opposition where he continued to associate with [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]]. They were both critical of the policies of the [[North Ministry|North government]] in the years leading up to the outbreak of the [[American War of Independence]] in 1775. As the war progressed Shelburne co-operated with the [[Rockingham Whigs]] to attack the government of Lord North. After a British army was compelled to surrender at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, Shelburne joined other leaders of the Opposition to call for a total withdrawal of British troops.\n\n==Prime Minister==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of Lord Shelburne]], [[Premiership of William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]], [[Premiership of the Earl of Shelburne]], [[Prime ministership of Lord Shelburne]], [[Prime ministership of the Earl of Shelburne]] -->\n{{Further|Shelburne ministry}}\n[[File:Joshua Reynolds - William Petty.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Shelburne by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]].]]\nIn March 1782 following the downfall of the [[North Ministry|North Government]] Shelburne agreed to take office under [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] on condition that the King would recognise the United States. Following the sudden and unexpected death of Lord Rockingham on 1 July 1782 Shelburne succeeded him as Prime Minister. Shelburne's appointment by the King provoked [[Charles James Fox]] and his supporters, including [[Edmund Burke]], to resign their posts on 4 July 1782.<ref>Fleming p.179-180</ref> Burke scathingly compared Shelburne to his predecessor Rockingham. One of the figures brought in as a replacement was the 23-year-old [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], son of Shelburne's former political ally, who became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. That year, Shelburne was appointed to [[Order of the Garter]] as its 599th Knight.\n\n===Peace negotiations===\n{{further|Peace of Paris (1783)}}\nShelburne's government continued to negotiate for peace in Paris using [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]] as the chief negotiator. Shelburne entertained a French peace envoy [[Joseph Matthias G\u00e9rard de Rayneval]] at his country estate in Wiltshire, and they discreetly agreed on a number of points which formed a basis for peace. Shelburne's own envoys negotiated a separate peace with American commissioners which eventually led to an agreement on American independence and the borders of the newly created United States. Shelburne agreed to generous borders in the [[Illinois Country]], but rejected demands by [[Benjamin Franklin]] for the cession of Canada and other territories. Historians have often commented that the treaty was very generous to the United States in terms of greatly enlarged boundaries. Historians such as  Alvord, Harlow and Ritcheson  have emphasized that British generosity was based on Shelburne's statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States.  The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian areas was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and create lucrative markets for British merchants,  without any military or administrative costs to Britain.<ref>Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality.\" ''International History Review'' (1983) 5#3 pp: 322\u2013345.

In April 1783 the Opposition forced Shelburne's resignation. The major achievement of Shelburne's time in office was the agreement of peace terms which formed the basis of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] bringing the American War of Independence to an end.\n\nHis fall was perhaps hastened by his plans for the reform of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|public service]].

an [[Kingdom of Ireland|Irish]]-born [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] statesman who was the first [[Home Secretary]] in 1782 and then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1782\u201383 during the final months of the [[American War of Independence]]. He succeeded in securing peace with America and this feat remains his most notable legacy.<ref name=www.number10.gov.uk>{{cite web|last=|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk|title=Past British Prime Ministers|publisher=British Government|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> He was also well known as a collector of antiquities and works of art.<ref>{{cite book|first=I. |last=Bignamini|first2= C. |last2=Hornsby|title=Digging And Dealing in Eighteenth-Century Rome|year=2010|pages=321\u2013322}}</ref>\n\nLord Shelburne was born in [[Dublin]] in 1737 and spent his formative years in Ireland. After attending [[Oxford University]] he served in the British army during the [[Seven Years' War]]. He took part in the [[Raid on Rochefort]] and the [[Battle of Minden]]. As a reward for his conduct at the [[Battle of Kloster Kampen]], Shelburne was appointed an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[George III of Great Britain|George III]]. He became involved in politics, becoming a member of parliament in 1760. After his father's death in 1761 he inherited his title and was elevated to the [[House of Lords]]. He took an active role in politics. He served as [[President of the Board of Trade]] in the [[Grenville Ministry]] but resigned this position after only a few months and began to associate with the opposition leader [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]].\n\nWhen Pitt was made Prime Minister in 1766, Shelburne was appointed as [[Southern Secretary]], a position which he held for two years. He departed office during the [[Corsican Crisis]] and joined the Opposition. Along with Pitt he was an advocate of a conciliatory policy towards Britain's [[British America|American Colonies]] and a long-term critic of the [[North Ministry|North Government]]'s measures in America. Following the fall of the North government, Shelburne joined its replacement under [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]]. Shelburne was made Prime Minister in 1782 following Rockingham's death, with the American War still being fought. Shelburne's government was brought down largely due to the terms of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] which brought the conflict to an end. Its terms were considered excessively generous, because they gave the new nation control of vast [[Appalachian Mountains|trans-Appalachian lands]]. Shelburne, however, had a vision of long-term benefit to Britain through trade with a large and increasingly prosperous United States, without the risk of warfare over the western territories.\n\nAfter he was forced from office in 1783 at age 45, he permanently lost his power and influence. Shelburne lamented that his career had been a failure, despite the many high offices he held over 17 years, and his undoubted abilities as a debater.  He blamed his poor education\u2014although it was as good as that of most peers\u2014and said the real problem was that \"it has been my fate through life to fall in with clever but unpopular connections.\"  Historians, however, point to a  nasty personality that alienated friend and enemy alike. His contemporaries distrusted him as too prone to trickery and duplicity. Biographer  John Cannon says \"His uneasiness prompted him to alternate flattery and hectoring, which most of his colleagues found unpleasant, and to suspiciousness...&nbsp;In debate he was frequently vituperative and sarcastic.\"  Success came too early, and produced jealousy, especially when he was tagged as an upstart Irishman.  He never understood the power of the House of Commons, or how to deal with its leaders.  He advocated numerous reforms,  especially free trade, religious toleration, and parliamentary reform.  He was ahead of his time, but was unable to build an adequate network of support from his colleagues who distrusted his motives.  In turn he distrusted others, and tried to do all the work himself so that it would be done right.<ref>John Cannon, \"Petty, William, second earl of Shelburne and first marquess of Lansdowne (1737\u20131805)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', (Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born '''William Fitzmaurice''' in [[Dublin]] in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], the first son of [[John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne|John Fitzmaurice]], who was the second surviving son of the [[Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry|1st Earl of Kerry]]. Lord Kerry had married Anne Petty, the daughter of Sir [[William Petty]], [[Surveyor General of Ireland]], whose elder son had been created Baron Shelburne in 1688 and (on the elder son's death) whose younger son had been created Baron Shelburne in 1699 and Earl of Shelburne in 1719. On the younger son's death the Petty estates passed to the aforementioned John Fitzmaurice, who changed his branch of the family's surname to \"Petty\" in place of \"Fitzmaurice\", and was created Viscount Fitzmaurice later in 1751 and Earl of Shelburne in 1753 (after which his elder son John was styled '''Viscount Fitzmaurice'''). His grandfather Lord Kerry died when he was four, but Fitzmaurice grew up with other people's grim memories of the old man as  a \"Tyrant\" whose family and servants lived in permanent fear of him.\n\nFitzmaurice  spent his  childhood \"in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland,\"<ref>Childhood in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland probably refers to the family estates in [[County Kerry]].  The Pettys owned the Lansdowne Estates in the [[Kenmare]] area in South Kerry and the Fitzmaurice estates were in the [[Lixnaw]] area in North Kerry.</ref> and, according to his own account, when he entered [[Christ Church, Oxford]], in 1755, he had \"both everything to learn and everything to unlearn\". From a [[tutor]] whom he describes as \"narrow-minded\" he received advantageous guidance in his studies, but he attributes his improvement in manners and in knowledge of the world chiefly to the fact that, as was his \"fate through life\", he fell in \"with clever but unpopular connexions\".\n\n==Military career and election to Parliament==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}\n[[File:Caton-Woodville Battle of Minden 1759.jpeg|thumb|Shelburne served with distinction during the Seven Years' War participating in engagements such as the [[Battle of Minden]] in 1759.]]\nShortly after leaving the university he served in [[20th Foot]] regiment commanded by [[James Wolfe]] during the [[Seven Years' War]].

Contemporary Responses to Adam Smith'' (Bristol: Theommes Press, 1998), p. 147.</ref>\n\nRitcheson is dubious on whether the journey with Smith actually happened, but provides no evidence to the contrary. There is proof that Shelburne did consult with Smith on at least one occasion, and Smith was close to Shelburne's father and his brother.<ref>Ritcheson (1983) p 326-28</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nShelburne's new military role close to the King brought him into communication with [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], who was the King's closest advisor and a senior minister in the government. In 1761 Shelburne was employed by Bute to negotiate for the support of [[Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland|Henry Fox]]. Fox held the lucrative but unimportant post of [[Paymaster of the Forces]], but commanded large support in the House of Commons and could boost Bute's powerbase. Shelburne was opposed to Pitt, who had resigned from the government in 1761. Under instructions from Shelburne, Barr\u00e9 made a vehement attack on Pitt in the House of Commons.\n\nDuring 1762 negotiations for a peace agreement went on in London and Paris. Eventually a deal was agreed but it was heavily criticised for the perceived leniency of its terms as it handed back a number of captured territories to France and Spain. Defending it in the House of Lords, Shelburne observed \"the security of the British colonies in North America was the first cause of the war\" asserting that security \"has been wisely attended to in the negotiations for peace\".<ref>Schweizer p.17</ref> Led by Fox, the government was able to push the peace treaty through parliament despite opposition led by Pitt. Shortly afterwards, Bute chose to resign as Prime Minister and retire from politics and was replaced by [[George Grenville]].\n\nShelburne joined the [[George Grenville|Grenville]] ministry in 1763 as [[President of the Board of Trade|First Lord of Trade]]. By this stage Shelburne had changed his opinion of Pitt and become an admirer of him. After failing to secure Pitt's inclusion in the Cabinet he resigned office after only a few months. Having moreover on account of his support of Pitt on the question of [[John Wilkes]]'s expulsion from the House of Commons incurred the displeasure of the King, he retired for a time to his estate.\n\n===Southern Secretary===\nAfter Pitt's return to power in 1766 he became [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]], but during Pitt's illness his conciliatory policy towards America was completely thwarted by his colleagues and the King, and in 1768 he was dismissed from office. During the [[Corsican Crisis]], sparked by the [[French Conquest of Corsica|French invasion of Corsica]], Shelburne was the major voice in the cabinet who favoured assisting the [[Corsican Republic]]. Although secret aid was given to the Corsicans it was decided not to intervene militarily and provoke a war with France, a decision made easier by the departure of the hard-line Shelburne from the cabinet.\n\nIn June 1768 the General Court incorporated the district of [[Shelburne, Massachusetts]] from the area formerly known as \"Deerfield Northeast\" and in 1786 the district became a town.  The town was named in honour<!--this article should be written in British English--> of Lord Shelburne, who, in return sent a [[church bell]], which never reached the town.\n\n===Opposition===\nShelburne went into Opposition where he continued to associate with [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]]. They were both critical of the policies of the [[North Ministry|North government]] in the years leading up to the outbreak of the [[American War of Independence]] in 1775. As the war progressed Shelburne co-operated with the [[Rockingham Whigs]] to attack the government of Lord North. After a British army was compelled to surrender at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, Shelburne joined other leaders of the Opposition to call for a total withdrawal of British troops.\n\n==Prime Minister==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of Lord Shelburne]], [[Premiership of William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]], [[Premiership of the Earl of Shelburne]], [[Prime ministership of Lord Shelburne]], [[Prime ministership of the Earl of Shelburne]] -->\n{{Further|Shelburne ministry}}\n[[File:Joshua Reynolds - William Petty.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Shelburne by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]].]]\nIn March 1782 following the downfall of the [[North Ministry|North Government]] Shelburne agreed to take office under [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] on condition that the King would recognise the United States. Following the sudden and unexpected death of Lord Rockingham on 1 July 1782 Shelburne succeeded him as Prime Minister. Shelburne's appointment by the King provoked [[Charles James Fox]] and his supporters, including [[Edmund Burke]], to resign their posts on 4 July 1782.<ref>Fleming p.179-180</ref> Burke scathingly compared Shelburne to his predecessor Rockingham. One of the figures brought in as a replacement was the 23-year-old [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], son of Shelburne's former political ally, who became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. That year, Shelburne was appointed to [[Order of the Garter]] as its 599th Knight.\n\n===Peace negotiations===\n{{further|Peace of Paris (1783)}}\nShelburne's government continued to negotiate for peace in Paris using [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]] as the chief negotiator. Shelburne entertained a French peace envoy [[Joseph Matthias G\u00e9rard de Rayneval]] at his country estate in Wiltshire, and they discreetly agreed on a number of points which formed a basis for peace. Shelburne's own envoys negotiated a separate peace with American commissioners which eventually led to an agreement on American independence and the borders of the newly created United States. Shelburne agreed to generous borders in the [[Illinois Country]], but rejected demands by [[Benjamin Franklin]] for the cession of Canada and other territories. Historians have often commented that the treaty was very generous to the United States in terms of greatly enlarged boundaries. Historians such as  Alvord, Harlow and Ritcheson  have emphasized that British generosity was based on Shelburne's statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States.  The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian areas was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and create lucrative markets for British merchants,  without any military or administrative costs to Britain.<ref>Charles R.

As the French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] later put it, \"The English buy peace rather than make it\".<ref>Quote from Thomas Paterson, J. Garry Clifford and Shane J. Maddock, ''American foreign relations: A history, to 1920'' (2009) vol 1 p 20</ref>\n\n===Downfall===\n[[File:William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne (Lord Shelburne); Charles James Fox; Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|upright|Shelburne, [[Charles James Fox]] and [[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford]] by [[James Gillray]] (1783)]]\nFox's departure led to the unexpected creation of [[Fox-North Coalition|a coalition]] involving Fox and [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] which dominated the Opposition.  In April 1783 the Opposition forced Shelburne's resignation. The major achievement of Shelburne's time in office was the agreement of peace terms which formed the basis of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] bringing the American War of Independence to an end.\n\nHis fall was perhaps hastened by his plans for the reform of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|public service]]. He had also in contemplation a Bill to promote free trade between Britain and the United States.\n\n==Later life==\nWhen [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] became Prime Minister in 1784, Shelburne, instead of receiving a place in the Cabinet, was created '''Marquess of Lansdowne'''. Though giving a general support to the policy of Pitt, he from this time ceased to take an active part in public affairs. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1803.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nLord Lansdowne was twice married:\n\nFirst to Sophia Petty, Countess of Shelburne (26 August 1745 \u2013 5 January 1771), daughter of the [[John Carteret, 1st Earl Granville|1st Earl Granville]], through whom he obtained the Lansdowne estates near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. They had at least one child:\n*[[John Petty, 2nd Marquess of Lansdowne|John Henry Petty, 2nd Marquess of Lansdowne]] (6 December 1765 \u2013 15 November 1809), who sat in the House of Commons for twenty years as member for Chipping Wycombe before inheriting his father's marquessate. He married Mary Arabella Maddox (died 24 April 1833), the daughter of Rev. Hinton Maddox and the widow of Duke Gifford, on 27 May 1805; they had no sons.\n\nSecondly, to [[Louisa Petty, Marchioness of Lansdowne]] (1755 \u2013 7 August 1789), daughter of the [[John FitzPatrick, 1st Earl of Upper Ossory|1st Earl of Upper Ossory]]. They had at least two children:\n*[[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne]] (1780\u20131863), who succeeded his half-brother in the title.\n*Lady Louisa Fitzmaurice (born bef. 1789)\n \nLord Lansdowne's brother, [[Thomas Fitzmaurice (MP)|The Hon.
