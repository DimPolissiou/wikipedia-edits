It shoots [[arrow]]-like [[projectile]]s called [[crossbow bolt|bolt]]s or quarrels.  The medieval European crossbow was called by many other names including crossbow itself, most of which were derived from the word ''[[ballista]]'', an [[ancient Greek]] torsion [[siege engine]] similar in appearance.<ref>{{Citation |last=Payne-Gallwey |first=Ralph |authorlink=Sir Ralph Frankland-Payne-Gallwey, 3rd Baronet |title=The Crossbow |origyear=1903 |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |isbn=978-1-60239-010-2 |page=2 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough having the same launch principle, crossbows differ from bows in that a bow's [[bow draw|draw]] must be maintained manually by the archer pulling the [[bowstring]] with fingers, arm and back muscles and holding that same [[form (exercise)|form]] in order to aim (which demands significant physical strength and stamina), while a crossbow uses a locking mechanism to maintain the draw, limiting the shooter's exertion to only pulling the string into lock and then releasing the shot via depressing a lever/[[trigger (firearms)|trigger]].  This not only enables a crossbowman to handle stronger draw weight, but also hold for longer with significantly less physical strain, thus capable of better precision.\n\nHistorically, crossbows played a significant role in the warfare of [[East Asia]] and [[Medieval]] [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tom Ukinski|title=Drones: Mankind's Always Had Them|url=http://guardianlv.com/2013/05/drones-mankinds-always-had-them/|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=Guardian Liberty Voice|date=23 May 2013}}</ref> The earliest crossbows in the world were invented in [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]] and caused a major shift in the role of [[ranged weaponry|projectile weaponry]].  The traditional [[bow and arrow]] had long been a specialized [[weapon]] that required considerable training, physical strength and expertise to operate with any degree of practical efficiency.  In many cultures, [[archer]]s were considered a separate and superior warrior caste, despite usually being drawn from the [[commoner|common]] class, as their [[archery]] skill-set was essentially trained and strengthened from birth (similar to many [[cavalry|horseman]] cultures) and was impossible to reproduce outside a pre-established cultural tradition, which many nations lacked.  In contrast, the crossbow was the first ranged weapon to be simple, cheap and physically undemanding enough to be operated by large numbers of untrained [[conscript]] soldiers, thus enabling virtually any nation to field a potent force of crossbowmen with little expense beyond the cost of the weapons themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts and interesting information about Medieval Weapons, Armor and arms, specifically, the Crossbow|url=http://www.medieval-life-and-times.info/medieval-weapons/crossbow.htm|website=medieval-life-and-times.info|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Firearm]]s have largely supplanted crossbows for use against humans.  Crossbows are still widely used for competitive [[shooting sport]]s and hunting, or for relatively silent shooting.\n\n==Terminology==\nA crossbowman or crossbow-maker is sometimes called an ''arbalist'' or ''arbalest''.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n''Arrow'', ''bolt'' and ''quarrel'' are all suitable terms for crossbow projectiles.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''lath'', also called the ''prod'', is the bow of the crossbow. According to W.F. Peterson, the ''prod'' came into usage in the 19th century as a result of mistranslating ''rodd'' in a 16th-century list of crossbow effects.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''stock'' is the wooden body on which the bow is mounted, although the medieval ''tiller'' is also used.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''lock'' refers to the release mechanism, including the string, sears, trigger lever, and housing.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Han crossbow trigger mechanism.jpg|thumb|Han crossbow trigger pieces.]]\n[[File:Noix corde carreau arbalette.svg|thumb|Crossbow nut: {{ordered list| Nut.| String.| Quarrel.| Trigger.}}]]\n[[File:Nuss Armbrust.jpg|thumb|16th century crossbow nut excavated at [[Harburger Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe]], [[Hamburg Harburg]], [[Germany]]]]\nA crossbow is essentially a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] mounted on an elongated frame (called a '''tiller''' or '''stock''') with a built-in mechanism that holds the drawn [[bow string]], as well as a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] mechanism that allows the string to be released.\n\n===Chinese vertical trigger lock===\nThe Chinese trigger mechanism was a vertical lever composed of four bronze pieces secured together by two bronze rods.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n{{quotation|The ''nu'' [crossbow] is so called because it spreads abroad an aura of rage [nu]. Its stock is like the arm of a man, therefore it is called ''bi''.  That which hooks the bowstring is called ''ya'', for indeed it is like teeth. The part round about the teeth [i.e. the housing box] is called the \"outer wall\" [''guo''], since it surrounds the lug [''gui''] of the teeth [i.e. the nut].  Within [and below] there is the \"hanging knife\" [''xuan dao'', i.e. the trigger blade] so called because it looks like one. The whole assembly is called ''ji'', for it is just as ingenious as the [[loom]].{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=133}}|''[[Shiming]]''}}\n\n===European rolling nut lock===\nThe earliest European designs featured a transverse slot in the top surface of the frame, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up through a hole in the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out.  This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a ''tickler''. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a ''nut'' to retain the string.  This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal ''sear'' or trigger face, usually of metal.  These ''roller nuts'' were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or mounted on a metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally.  Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal.  Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little physical straining, allowing crossbowmen to aim better without fatiguing.<ref>Hanafi et al. 2011: 23</ref>\n\n===Bow===\nChinese crossbow bows were made of composite material from the start.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nEuropean crossbows from the 10th to 12th centuries used wood for the bow, also called the ''prod'' or ''lath'', which tended to be [[ash tree|ash]] or [[taxus|yew]].{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nComposite bows started appearing in Europe during the 13th century and could be made from layers of different material, often wood, horn, and sinew glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows made of several layers are much stronger and more efficient in releasing energy than simple wooden bows.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAs steel became more widely available in Europe around the 14th century, steel prods came into use.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nTraditionally, the prod was often lashed to the stock with rope, [[whipcord]], or other strong cording. This cording is called the ''[[bridle]]''.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n===Spanning mechanism===\nThe Chinese used [[winch]]es for large mounted crossbows. Winches may have been used for hand held crossbows during the [[Han dynasty]] but there is only one known depiction of it. The ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' mentions types of crossbows using winch mechanisms, but it's not known if these were handheld crossbows or mounted crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}}\n\nDuring the medieval period, both Chinese and European crossbows used [[stirrup]]s as well as [[belt hook]]s.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}} In the 13th century European crossbows started using winches, and from the 14th century an assortment of spanning mechanisms such as winch pulleys, cord pulleys, gaffles (such as gaffe levers, goat's foot levers, and rarer internal lever-action mechanisms), cranequins, and even screws.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ixax|first1=belle|title=Crossbow Reviews 2017|url=http://thetagtech.com/best-crossbow-reviews|website=Archer's Caf\u00e9|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Han winch.png|[[Han dynasty]] crossbowman using what may be a winch drawn crossbow\nFile:Northern song Cavalry.jpg|[[Song dynasty]] cavalry wielding crossbows with stirrups\nFile:The Martyrdom of St Sebastian (detail).jpg|Fifteenth century crossbowman using a stirrup along with a belt hook and pulley\nFile:05-043.png|Detailed illustration of a goat's foot lever mounted on a crossbow that is half-spanned\nFile:Armborst 2, Nordisk familjebok.png|Illustration of a gaffe lever mounted on a crossbow that is nearly at full-span.\nFile:CAH 0153r.png|Illustrations of Leonardo da Vinci's [[rapid fire crossbow]] in the 15th Century [[Codex Atlanticus]].

Others are simple long stocks with the crossbow mounted on them. These could be shot from under the arm. The next step in development was stocks of the shape that would later be used [[Stock (firearms)|for firearms]], which allowed better aiming. The [[arbalest]] was a heavy crossbow that required special systems for pulling the sinew via windlasses. For [[siege warfare]], the size of crossbows was further increased to hurl large projectiles, such as rocks, at fortifications.

These are usually much shorter than arrows, but can be several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common mail. Crossbow bolts can be fitted with a variety of heads, some with sickle-shaped heads to cut rope or rigging; but the most common today is a four-sided point called a [[Quarrel (projectile)|quarrel]]. A highly specialized type of bolt is employed to collect blubber biopsy samples used in biology research.\n\nEven relatively small differences in arrow weight can have a considerable impact on its drop and, conversely, its flight trajectory.<ref name=\"CrossbowArrowDrop\">{{cite web|url=https://thebowside.com|title=Crossbow Arrow Drop - Charted Test Results|access-date=12 July 2019|website=TheBowSide.com}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\n[[File:Crossbow telescopic sight reticle.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The reticle of a modern crossbow [[telescopic sight]] allows the shooter to adjust for different ranges]]\n\nThe [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] crossbow often included a metal (i.e. bronze or steel) grid serving as [[iron sights]].

The trigger nut also had a long vertical spine that could be used like a primitive [[iron sight|rear sight]] for [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] adjustment, which allowed precision shooting over longer distances.  The Qin/Han-era crossbow was also an early example of [[modular design]], as the bronze trigger components were also mass-produced with relative high precision so they are interchangeable between different crossbows.  The trigger mechanism from one crossbow can be installed into another simply by dropping into a tiller slot of the same specifications and secured with [[dowel pin]]s.\n\nIt is clear from surviving inventory lists in [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]] that the crossbow was greatly favored by the Han dynasty.  For example, in one batch of slips there are only two mentions of bows, but thirty mentions of crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=141}} Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, such as the use of a mulberry wood stock and brass; a crossbow in 1068 could pierce a tree at 140 paces.<ref name=\"peers 130 131\">Peers, 130\u2013131.</ref> Crossbows were used in numbers as large as 50,000 starting from the Qin dynasty and upwards of several hundred thousand during the Han.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=143}} According to one authority, the crossbow had become \"nothing less than the standard weapon of the Han armies\", by the second century BC.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=22}} Han soldiers were required to pull a crossbow with a draw weight equivalent of {{convert|76|kg|lb|abbr=in}} to qualify as a crossbowman.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAfter the Han dynasty, the crossbow lost favor until it experienced a mild resurgence during the Tang dynasty, under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=193}} [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]] and Li Quan prescribed 20 percent of the infantry to be armed with crossbows.{{sfn|Graff|2016|p=52}}\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], the crossbow received a huge upsurge in military usage. The crossbow overshadowed the bow 2 to 1. During this time period, a stirrup was added for ease of loading. The government attempted to restrict the spread of crossbows and sought ways to keep armour and crossbows out of civilian homes.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=145}}  Despite the ban on certain types of crossbows, the weapon experienced an upsurge in civilian usage as both a hunting weapon and pastime. The \"romantic young people from rich families, and others who had nothing particular to do\" formed crossbow shooting clubs as a way to pass time.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=146}}\n\nDuring the late [[Ming dynasty]], no crossbows were mentioned to have been produced in the three-year period from 1619 to 1622. With 21,188,366 taels, the Ming manufactured 25,134 cannons, 8,252 small guns, 6,425 muskets, 4,090 culverins, 98,547 polearms and swords, 26,214 great \"horse decapitator\" swords, 42,800 bows, 1,000 great axes, 2,284,000 arrows, 180,000 fire arrows, 64,000 bow strings, and hundreds of transport carts.{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=49}}\n\nMilitary crossbows were armed by treading, or basically placing the feet on the bow stave and drawing it using one's arms and back muscles. During the Song dynasty, stirrups were added for ease of drawing and to mitigate damage to the bow. Alternatively the bow could also be drawn by a belt claw attached to the waist, but this was done lying down, as was the case for all large crossbows. Winch-drawing was used for the large mounted crossbows as seen below, but evidence for its use in Chinese hand-crossbows is scant.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}}\n\nOther sorts of crossbows also existed, such as the [[repeating crossbow]], multi-shot crossbow, larger field artillery crossbows, and repeating multi-shot crossbow.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:Ref-chamballista.jpg|right|thumb|Wheelmounted and elephantmounted double-bow-arcuballistae of the [[Champa]] kingdom.]]\n\nIn [[Vietnam]]ese historical legend, general [[Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n]], who ruled over the ancient kingdom of [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] from 257 to 207&nbsp;BC, is said to have owed his power to a magic crossbow, capable of shooting thousands of bolts at once.\n\nThe native [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]]s of Vietnam's Central Highlands were also known to have used crossbows, as both a tool for hunting, and later, an effective weapon against the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite web|title=Montagnard Crossbow, Vietnam|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C364947|website=awm.gov.au|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref> Montagnard fighters armed with crossbows proved a highly valuable asset to the US Special Forces operating in Vietnam, and it was not uncommon for the Green Berets to integrate Montagnard crossbowmen into their strike teams.<ref>DK/Smithsonian, ''The Vietnam War: The Definitive Illustrated History'' (London: DK (formerly Dorling Kindersley), 2017), 64-69. {{ISBN|1465466010}}</ref>\n\nCrossbow technology for crossbows with more than one prod was transferred from the Chinese to [[Champa]], which Champa used in its invasion of the [[Khmer Empire]]'s [[Angkor]] in 1177.<ref name=\"Grant2005\">{{cite book|author=R.

The traditional [[bow and arrow]] had long been a specialized [[weapon]] that required considerable training, physical strength and expertise to operate with any degree of practical efficiency.  In many cultures, [[archer]]s were considered a separate and superior warrior caste, despite usually being drawn from the [[commoner|common]] class, as their [[archery]] skill-set was essentially trained and strengthened from birth (similar to many [[cavalry|horseman]] cultures) and was impossible to reproduce outside a pre-established cultural tradition, which many nations lacked.  In contrast, the crossbow was the first ranged weapon to be simple, cheap and physically undemanding enough to be operated by large numbers of untrained [[conscript]] soldiers, thus enabling virtually any nation to field a potent force of crossbowmen with little expense beyond the cost of the weapons themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts and interesting information about Medieval Weapons, Armor and arms, specifically, the Crossbow|url=http://www.medieval-life-and-times.info/medieval-weapons/crossbow.htm|website=medieval-life-and-times.info|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Firearm]]s have largely supplanted crossbows for use against humans.  Crossbows are still widely used for competitive [[shooting sport]]s and hunting, or for relatively silent shooting.\n\n==Terminology==\nA crossbowman or crossbow-maker is sometimes called an ''arbalist'' or ''arbalest''.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n''Arrow'', ''bolt'' and ''quarrel'' are all suitable terms for crossbow projectiles.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''lath'', also called the ''prod'', is the bow of the crossbow. According to W.F. Peterson, the ''prod'' came into usage in the 19th century as a result of mistranslating ''rodd'' in a 16th-century list of crossbow effects.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''stock'' is the wooden body on which the bow is mounted, although the medieval ''tiller'' is also used.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''lock'' refers to the release mechanism, including the string, sears, trigger lever, and housing.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Han crossbow trigger mechanism.jpg|thumb|Han crossbow trigger pieces.]]\n[[File:Noix corde carreau arbalette.svg|thumb|Crossbow nut: {{ordered list| Nut.| String.| Quarrel.| Trigger.}}]]\n[[File:Nuss Armbrust.jpg|thumb|16th century crossbow nut excavated at [[Harburger Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe]], [[Hamburg Harburg]], [[Germany]]]]\nA crossbow is essentially a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] mounted on an elongated frame (called a '''tiller''' or '''stock''') with a built-in mechanism that holds the drawn [[bow string]], as well as a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] mechanism that allows the string to be released.\n\n===Chinese vertical trigger lock===\nThe Chinese trigger mechanism was a vertical lever composed of four bronze pieces secured together by two bronze rods.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n{{quotation|The ''nu'' [crossbow] is so called because it spreads abroad an aura of rage [nu]. Its stock is like the arm of a man, therefore it is called ''bi''.  That which hooks the bowstring is called ''ya'', for indeed it is like teeth. The part round about the teeth [i.e. the housing box] is called the \"outer wall\" [''guo''], since it surrounds the lug [''gui''] of the teeth [i.e. the nut].  Within [and below] there is the \"hanging knife\" [''xuan dao'', i.e. the trigger blade] so called because it looks like one. The whole assembly is called ''ji'', for it is just as ingenious as the [[loom]].{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=133}}|''[[Shiming]]''}}\n\n===European rolling nut lock===\nThe earliest European designs featured a transverse slot in the top surface of the frame, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up through a hole in the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out.  This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a ''tickler''. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a ''nut'' to retain the string.  This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal ''sear'' or trigger face, usually of metal.  These ''roller nuts'' were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or mounted on a metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally.  Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal.  Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little physical straining, allowing crossbowmen to aim better without fatiguing.<ref>Hanafi et al. 2011: 23</ref>\n\n===Bow===\nChinese crossbow bows were made of composite material from the start.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nEuropean crossbows from the 10th to 12th centuries used wood for the bow, also called the ''prod'' or ''lath'', which tended to be [[ash tree|ash]] or [[taxus|yew]].{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nComposite bows started appearing in Europe during the 13th century and could be made from layers of different material, often wood, horn, and sinew glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows made of several layers are much stronger and more efficient in releasing energy than simple wooden bows.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAs steel became more widely available in Europe around the 14th century, steel prods came into use.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nTraditionally, the prod was often lashed to the stock with rope, [[whipcord]], or other strong cording. This cording is called the ''[[bridle]]''.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n===Spanning mechanism===\nThe Chinese used [[winch]]es for large mounted crossbows. Winches may have been used for hand held crossbows during the [[Han dynasty]] but there is only one known depiction of it. The ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' mentions types of crossbows using winch mechanisms, but it's not known if these were handheld crossbows or mounted crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}}\n\nDuring the medieval period, both Chinese and European crossbows used [[stirrup]]s as well as [[belt hook]]s.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}} In the 13th century European crossbows started using winches, and from the 14th century an assortment of spanning mechanisms such as winch pulleys, cord pulleys, gaffles (such as gaffe levers, goat's foot levers, and rarer internal lever-action mechanisms), cranequins, and even screws.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ixax|first1=belle|title=Crossbow Reviews 2017|url=http://thetagtech.com/best-crossbow-reviews|website=Archer's Caf\u00e9|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Han winch.png|[[Han dynasty]] crossbowman using what may be a winch drawn crossbow\nFile:Northern song Cavalry.jpg|[[Song dynasty]] cavalry wielding crossbows with stirrups\nFile:The Martyrdom of St Sebastian (detail).jpg|Fifteenth century crossbowman using a stirrup along with a belt hook and pulley\nFile:05-043.png|Detailed illustration of a goat's foot lever mounted on a crossbow that is half-spanned\nFile:Armborst 2, Nordisk familjebok.png|Illustration of a gaffe lever mounted on a crossbow that is nearly at full-span.\nFile:CAH 0153r.png|Illustrations of Leonardo da Vinci's [[rapid fire crossbow]] in the 15th Century [[Codex Atlanticus]].

Others are simple long stocks with the crossbow mounted on them. These could be shot from under the arm. The next step in development was stocks of the shape that would later be used [[Stock (firearms)|for firearms]], which allowed better aiming. The [[arbalest]] was a heavy crossbow that required special systems for pulling the sinew via windlasses. For [[siege warfare]], the size of crossbows was further increased to hurl large projectiles, such as rocks, at fortifications.

These are usually much shorter than arrows, but can be several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common mail. Crossbow bolts can be fitted with a variety of heads, some with sickle-shaped heads to cut rope or rigging; but the most common today is a four-sided point called a [[Quarrel (projectile)|quarrel]]. A highly specialized type of bolt is employed to collect blubber biopsy samples used in biology research.\n\nEven relatively small differences in arrow weight can have a considerable impact on its drop and, conversely, its flight trajectory.<ref name=\"CrossbowArrowDrop\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bestcrossbowsource.com/crossbow-arrow-drop-charted-test-results/|title=Crossbow Arrow Drop - Charted Test Results|access-date=12 July 2019|website=BestCrossbowSource.com}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\n[[File:Crossbow telescopic sight reticle.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The reticle of a modern crossbow [[telescopic sight]] allows the shooter to adjust for different ranges]]\n\nThe [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] crossbow often included a metal (i.e. bronze or steel) grid serving as [[iron sights]].

The trigger nut also had a long vertical spine that could be used like a primitive [[iron sight|rear sight]] for [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] adjustment, which allowed precision shooting over longer distances.  The Qin/Han-era crossbow was also an early example of [[modular design]], as the bronze trigger components were also mass-produced with relative high precision so they are interchangeable between different crossbows.  The trigger mechanism from one crossbow can be installed into another simply by dropping into a tiller slot of the same specifications and secured with [[dowel pin]]s.\n\nIt is clear from surviving inventory lists in [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]] that the crossbow was greatly favored by the Han dynasty.  For example, in one batch of slips there are only two mentions of bows, but thirty mentions of crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=141}} Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, such as the use of a mulberry wood stock and brass; a crossbow in 1068 could pierce a tree at 140 paces.<ref name=\"peers 130 131\">Peers, 130\u2013131.</ref> Crossbows were used in numbers as large as 50,000 starting from the Qin dynasty and upwards of several hundred thousand during the Han.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=143}} According to one authority, the crossbow had become \"nothing less than the standard weapon of the Han armies\", by the second century BC.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=22}} Han soldiers were required to pull a crossbow with a draw weight equivalent of {{convert|76|kg|lb|abbr=in}} to qualify as a crossbowman.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAfter the Han dynasty, the crossbow lost favor until it experienced a mild resurgence during the Tang dynasty, under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=193}} [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]] and Li Quan prescribed 20 percent of the infantry to be armed with crossbows.{{sfn|Graff|2016|p=52}}\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], the crossbow received a huge upsurge in military usage. The crossbow overshadowed the bow 2 to 1. During this time period, a stirrup was added for ease of loading. The government attempted to restrict the spread of crossbows and sought ways to keep armour and crossbows out of civilian homes.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=145}}  Despite the ban on certain types of crossbows, the weapon experienced an upsurge in civilian usage as both a hunting weapon and pastime. The \"romantic young people from rich families, and others who had nothing particular to do\" formed crossbow shooting clubs as a way to pass time.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=146}}\n\nDuring the late [[Ming dynasty]], no crossbows were mentioned to have been produced in the three-year period from 1619 to 1622.

During the Song dynasty, stirrups were added for ease of drawing and to mitigate damage to the bow. Alternatively the bow could also be drawn by a belt claw attached to the waist, but this was done lying down, as was the case for all large crossbows. Winch-drawing was used for the large mounted crossbows as seen below, but evidence for its use in Chinese hand-crossbows is scant.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}}\n\nOther sorts of crossbows also existed, such as the [[repeating crossbow]], multi-shot crossbow, larger field artillery crossbows, and repeating multi-shot crossbow.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:Ref-chamballista.jpg|right|thumb|Wheelmounted and elephantmounted double-bow-arcuballistae of the [[Champa]] kingdom.]]\n\nIn [[Vietnam]]ese historical legend, general [[Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n]], who ruled over the ancient kingdom of [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] from 257 to 207&nbsp;BC, is said to have owed his power to a magic crossbow, capable of shooting thousands of bolts at once.\n\nThe native [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]]s of Vietnam's Central Highlands were also known to have used crossbows, as both a tool for hunting, and later, an effective weapon against the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite web|title=Montagnard Crossbow, Vietnam|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C364947|website=awm.gov.au|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref> Montagnard fighters armed with crossbows proved a highly valuable asset to the US Special Forces operating in Vietnam, and it was not uncommon for the Green Berets to integrate Montagnard crossbowmen into their strike teams.<ref>DK/Smithsonian, ''The Vietnam War: The Definitive Illustrated History'' (London: DK (formerly Dorling Kindersley), 2017), 64-69. {{ISBN|1465466010}}</ref>\n\nCrossbow technology for crossbows with more than one prod was transferred from the Chinese to [[Champa]], which Champa used in its invasion of the [[Khmer Empire]]'s [[Angkor]] in 1177.<ref name=\"Grant2005\">{{cite book|author=R.
