Colloquially, the term also denotes the pedestrian, bicycle, and rollerblading pathway on the [[seawall]], one which has been extended far outside the boundaries of Stanley Park and which has become one of the most-used features of the park by both locals and tourists. James \"Jimmy\" Cunningham, a master mason, dedicated his life to the construction of the seawall from 1931 until his retirement. Even after he retired, Cunningham continued to return to monitor the wall's progress, until his death at 85. While the whole path is not built upon the seawall; the total distance from CRAB park, around [[Stanley Park]] and [[False Creek]] to [[Spanish Banks]] is about {{convert|30|km}}.\n\nDespite perennial conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, and inline skaters, park users consider the seawall to be the most important feature of Stanley Park and it is the most used feature within the park.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Belyea| first =Ross|author2=Marc St. Louis  | title = The Stanley Park Technical Report| publisher =Stanley Park Task Force, prepared by Belyea, Sorensen & Associates| date =21 January 1992| location =Vancouver| page =15}}</ref><ref name=\"Stanley Park Task Force 30\u201334\">{{Cite book| last =Stanley Park Task Force| title =Stanley Park Task Force Final Report| publisher =Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation| date =22 May 1992| location =Vancouver| pages =30\u201334}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe original idea for the seawall is attributed to park board superintendent, W.

It was argued that the waves created by ships passing through the First Narrows were eroding the area between Prospect Point and Brockton Point.

The proposal triggered an outcry from [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] groups, such as the Save Our Parkland Association.

The issue was not resolved until 1984 when the bicycle lane of the seawall was designated one-way in a counterclockwise direction around the park, which it remains today.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/> That resolution brought fewer accidents, but as late as 1993, proposals to ban cycling on the seawall continued to be put forth. The popularity of inline skating in the 1990s also contributed to the debate over seawall use, as well as skateboarders to a lesser extent, until users were divided into wheeled versus non-wheeled camps. It appears unlikely that a consensus will emerge over the most appropriate mode of travelling the seawall, but as long as accidents remain minimal, it is unlikely to re-emerge as a pressing park-use issue.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/><ref>{{Cite book| last =Steele| first =Mike| title =Vancouver's Famous Stanley Park: The Year-Round Playground| publisher =Heritage House| year =1993| location =Vancouver| isbn = 1-895811-00-7| page =6}}</ref> A survey conducted for a 1992 task force on the park found that 65% of park users supported bicycle traffic on the seawall compared with 20% who favoured banning cyclists so of course the task force's recommendation to phase out cycling went unheeded.<ref name=\"Stanley Park Task Force 30\u201334\"/>\n\nThe seawall route has continued to expand, so that a continuous, mostly seaside, path for pedestrians, cyclists, and inline skaters now extends for a total of {{convert|22|km}}.

Of the numerous Russian Orthodox congregations in Alaska, most are majority Alaska Native in ethnicity. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in [[North America]] was Saint [[Peter the Aleut]].\n\n====Recorded Uprising against the Russians====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nIn the 18th century, [[Russia]] ''[[promyshlenniki]]'' traders established settlements on the islands. There was high demand for the furs that the Aleut provided from hunting. In May 1784, local Aleuts revolted on Amchitka against the Russian traders. (The Russians had a small trading post there.) According to what Aleut people said, in an account recorded by Japanese castaways and published in 2004, otters were decreasing year by year. The Russians paid the Aleuts less and less in goods in return for the furs they made. The Japanese learned that the Aleuts felt the situation was at crisis. The leading Aleuts negotiated with the Russians, saying they had failed to deliver enough supplies in return for furs. Nezimov, leader of the Russians, ordered two of his men, Stephanov (\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30ce ''Suteppano'') and Kazhimov (\u30ab\u30b8\u30e2\u30d5 ''Kazimofu'') to kill his mistress Oniishin (\u30aa\u30cb\u30a4\u30b7\u30f3 ''Oniishin''), who was the Aleut chief's daughter, because he doubted that Oniishin had tried to dissuade her father and other leaders from pushing for more goods.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n\nAfter the four leaders had been killed, the Aleuts began to move from Amchitka to neighboring islands. Nezimov, leader of the Russian group, was jailed after the whole incident was reported to Russian officials.<ref name=\"kodayu\">Yamashita, Tsuneo. ''Daikokuya Kodayu''(Japanese), 2004.

The locally resident [[Nicole\u00f1o|Nicole\u00f1o nation]] sought a payment from the Aleut hunters for the large number of otters being killed in the area. Disagreement arose, turning violent; in the ensuing battle, the Aleut killed nearly all the Nicole\u00f1o men. Together with high fatalities from European diseases, the Nicole\u00f1os suffered so much from the loss of their men that by 1853, only one Nicole\u00f1an remained alive. (See [[Juana Maria]], ''The Lone Woman of San Nicolas'', also known as Karana)\n\n===Internment during World War II===\nIn June 1942, during [[World War II]], Japanese forces occupied [[Kiska]] and [[Attu Island|Attu]] Islands in the western Aleutians. They later transported captive Attu Islanders to [[Hokkaid\u014d]], where they were held as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in harsh conditions. Fearing a Japanese attack on other Aleutian Islands and mainland Alaska, the U.S. government evacuated hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs, placing them in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died of [[measles]], [[influenza]] and other infectious diseases which spread quickly in the overcrowded dormitories. In total, about 75 died in American internment and 19 as a result of Japanese occupation.<ref>Ryan Madden, \"'The Government's Industry': Alaska Natives and Pribilof Sealing during World War II.\" ''Pacific Northwest Quarterly'' 91.4 (2000): 202-209.

Foreign diseases, harsh treatment and disruption of aboriginal society soon reduced the population to less than one-tenth this number. The 1910 [[Census]] count showed 1,491 Aleuts. In the 2000 Census, 11,941 people identified as being Aleut; nearly 17,000 said Aleuts were among their ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |title=The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2000 Table 5 |url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-15.pdf |publisher=census.gov}}</ref> Alaskans generally recognize that [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] during the Russian occupation, while the colonists were limited in number, resulted in few full-blooded Aleuts remaining today. Full-blooded Aleuts still exist and are growing in number, and there are also people who may be part Russian or other descent but solely identify as Aleut.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n===Housing===\nThe Aleut constructed partially underground houses called ''[[barabara]]''.  According to [[Lillie McGarvey]], a 20th-century Aleut leader, ''barabaras'' keep \"occupants dry from the frequent rains, warm at all times, and snugly sheltered from the high winds common to the area\".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Aleuts traditionally built houses by digging an oblong square pit in the ground, usually {{convert|50|by|20|ft|m}} or smaller. The pit was then covered by a roof framed with driftwood, thatched with grass, then covered with earth for insulation.<ref>Cook 377</ref> Inside trenches were dug along the sides, with mats placed on top to keep them clean. The bedrooms were at the back of the lodge, opposite the entrance. Several families would stay in one house, with their own designated areas. Rather than fireplaces or bonfires in the middle, lanterns were hung in the house.\n\n===Subsistence===\nThe Aleut survived by hunting and gathering. They fished for salmon, crabs, shellfish, and cod, as well as hunting sea mammals such as seal, [[walrus]], and whales. They processed fish and sea mammals in a variety of ways: dried, smoked, or roasted. [[reindeer|Caribou]], [[muskox|muskoxen]], deer, [[moose]], whale, and other types of game were eaten roasted or preserved for later use. They dried berries. They were also processed as ''alutiqqutigaq'', a mixture of berries, fat, and fish. The boiled skin and blubber of a whale is a delicacy, as is that of walrus.\n\nToday, many Aleut continue to eat customary and locally sourced foods but also buy processed foods from [[Outside (Alaska)|Outside]], which is expensive in Alaska.\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nA full list of their ethnobotany can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/5/ (65 documented plant uses).\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n[[File:Hunting hat, Aleut - Ethol\u00e9n collection, Museum of Cultures (Helsinki) - DSC04917.JPG|thumb|Men's ''chagudax'', or bentwood hunting visor, Arvid Adolf Ethol\u00e9n collection, Museum of Cultures, Helsinki, Finland]]\n[[File:Basket and Lid, early 20th century, 36.498a-b.jpg|thumbnail|Unknown Aleut artist, [[sea-lyme grass]] basket and lid embellished with wool embroidery, early 20th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]] ]]\nCustomary arts of the Aleut include weapon-making, building of ''[[baidarka]]s'' (special hunting boats), [[weaving]], figurines, clothing, carving, and mask making. Men as well as women often carved ivory and wood. 19th-century craftsmen were famed for their ornate wooden hunting hats, which feature elaborate and colorful designs and may be trimmed with [[sea lion]] [[Vibrissae|whiskers]], feathers, and [[walrus ivory]]. [[Andrew Gronholdt]] of the Shumagin Islands has played a vital role in reviving the ancient art of building the ''[[Unangan hunting headgear|chagudax]]'' or bentwood hunting visors.<ref>Black, Lydia T. ''Aleut Art: Unangam Aguqaadangin''. Anchorage, Alaska: Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, 2005</ref>\n\nAleut women sewed finely stitched, waterproof [[Anorak|parkas]] from [[Seal (mammal)|seal]] gut and wove fine baskets from [[sea-lyme grass]] (''[[Elymus mollis]]''). Some Aleut women continue to weave ryegrass baskets. Aleut arts are practiced and taught throughout the state of Alaska. As many Aleut have moved out of the islands to other parts of the state, they have taken with them the knowledge of their arts. They have also adopted new materials and methods for their art, including [[serigraphy]], [[video art]], and [[installation art]].\n\nAleut carving, distinct in each region, has attracted traders for centuries, including early Europeans and other Alaska Natives. Historically, carving was a male art and leadership attribute whereas today it is done by both genders. Most commonly the carvings of walrus ivory and driftwood originated as part of making hunting weapons. Sculptural carvings depict local animals, such as seals and whales. Aleut sculptors also have carved human figures.<ref name=AAUA>{{cite book|last=Black|first=Lydia|title=Aleut Art Unangam Aguqaadangin|year=2003|publisher=Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association|location=Anchorage, AK}}</ref>\n\nThe Aleut also carve walrus ivory for other uses, such as jewelry and sewing needles. Jewelry is made with designs specific to the region of each people. Each [[clan]] would have a specific style to signify their origin. Jewelry ornaments were made for piercing lips (labrum), nose, and ears, as well as for necklaces. Each woman had her own sewing needles, which she made, and that often had detailed end of animal heads.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/>\n\nThe main Aleut method of [[basketry]] was false embroidery (overlay). Strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the basic weaving surface, to obtain a plastic effect. Basketry was an art reserved for women.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/> Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleut in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is ''qiigam aygaaxsii''. One Aleut leader recognized by the State of Alaska for her work in teaching and reviving Aleut basketry was [[Anfesia Shapsnikoff]]. Her life and accomplishments are portrayed in the book ''Moments Rightly Placed''(1998).<ref>Hudson, 1998</ref>\n\nMasks were created to portray figures of their myths and oral history. The [[Atka people]] believed that another people lived in their land before them. They portrayed such ancients in their masks, which show anthropomorphic creatures named in their language. Knut Bergsland says their word means \"like those found in caves.\" Masks were generally carved from wood and were decorated with paints made from berries or other natural products. Feathers were inserted into holes carved out for extra decoration. These masks were used in ceremonies ranging from dances to praises, each with its own meaning and purpose.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/>\n\n===Tattoos and piercings===\nThe tattoos and piercings of the Aleut people demonstrated accomplishments as well as their religious views. They believed their body art would please the spirits of the animals and make any evil go away. The body orifices were believed to be pathways for the entry of evil entities. By piercing their orifices: the nose, the mouth, and ears, they would stop evil entities, ''khoughkh'', from entering their bodies (Osborn, 52). Body art also enhanced their beauty, social status, and spiritual authority.\n\nBefore the 19th century, piercings and tattoos were very common among the Aleut people, especially among women. Piercings, such as the nose pin, were common among both men and women and were usually performed a few days after birth.  The ornament was made of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagle's feather shaft.  From time to time, adult women decorated the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings on it; the semi-precious objects dangled down to their chins.\n\nPiercing ears was also very common.  The Aleuts pierced holes around the rim of their ears with dentalium shells (tooth shells or tusk shells), bone, feathers, dried bird wings or skulls and/or amber. Materials associated with birds were important, as birds were considered to defend animals in the spirit world.  A male would wear sea lion whiskers in his ears as a trophy of his expertise as a hunter. Worn for decorative reasons, and sometimes to signify social standing, reputation, and the age of the wearer, Aleuts would pierce their lower lips with walrus ivory and wear beads or bones. The individual with the most piercings held the highest respect.\n\nTattooing for women began when they reached physical maturity, after menstruation, at about age 20. Historically, men received their first tattoo after killing their first animal, an important rite of passage. Sometimes tattoos signaled social class. For example, the daughter of a wealthy, famous ancestor or father would work hard at her tattoos to show the accomplishments of that ancestor or father. They would sew, or prick, different designs on the chin, the side of the face, or under the nose.\n\n===Aleut clothing===\n[[File:Aleut sax.jpg|thumb|Replica of the ''sax'', an Aleut coat made from bird skins and sea otter fur]]\n[[File:Parka (Kamleika) Aleutian Islands.JPG|thumb|A [[Kamleika]], or sea mammal intestine coat. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/kamleika/6AFzaJE5vq3JQA|title=Kamleika|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Aleut people developed in one of the harshest climates in the world, and learned to create and protect warmth. Both men and women wore parkas that extended below the knees. The women wore the skin of seal or sea-otter, and the men wore bird skin parkas, the feathers turned in or out depending on the weather. When the men were hunting on the water, they wore waterproof parkas made from seal or sea-lion guts, or the entrails of bear, walrus, or whales. Parkas had a hood that could be cinched, as could the wrist openings, so water could not get in. Men wore breeches made from the esophageal skin of seals.  Children wore parkas made of downy eagle skin with tanned bird skin caps.<ref>''Enthnohistory'': Gross & Khera pg. 33, 34</ref> They called these parkas ''kameikas,'' meaning raingear in the English language.(Aleut Corp. Web.).\n\nSea-lions, harbor seals, and the sea otters are the most abundant marine mammals.  The men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them.  The women undertook the sewing (''Enthnohistory:'' Gross & Khera pg. 32). Preparation of the gut for clothing involved several steps. The prepared intestines were turned inside out. A bone knife was used to remove the muscle tissue and fat from the walls of the intestine. The gut was cut and stretched, and fastened to stakes to dry. It was then cut and sewn to make waterproof parkas, bags, and other receptacles (Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 70). On some hunting trips, the men would take several women with them. They would catch birds and prepare the carcasses and feathers for future use.  They caught [[puffins]], Lunda Cirrhata, Fratercula Corniculata, Guillemots, and Cephus & Murres.<ref>Lucien M. Turner, pg. 70</ref>\n\nIt took 40 skins of tufted puffin and 60 skins of horned puffin to make one parka. A woman would need a year for all the labor to make one parka. Each lasted two years with proper care. All parkas were decorated with bird feathers, beard bristles of seal and sea-lion, beaks of sea parrots, bird claws, sea otter fur, dyed leather, and caribou hair sewn in the seams. (Gross & Khera, pg. 34).\n\nWomen made needles from the wingbones of seabirds. They made thread from the sinews of different animals and fish guts.<ref>Gross & Khera pg. 33</ref> A thin strip of seal intestine could also be used, twisted to form a thread. The women grew their thumbnail extra long and sharpened it. They could split threads to make them as fine as a hair.<ref>Turner, pg. 71.</ref> They used vermilion paint, hematite, the ink bag of the octopus, and the root of a kind of grass or vine to color the threads.<ref>Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 71</ref>\n\n===Gender===\nRussian travelers making early contact with the Aleut mention [[storytelling|traditional tales]] of [[two-spirit]]s or [[third gender|third]] and [[fourth gender]] people, known as ''ayagigux\u0302'' (male-bodied, <!--saying e.g. \"male-assigned\", the preferred terminology for similar cases, would raise the question of \"assigned by whom? Europeans\"-->  \"man transformed into a woman\") and ''tayagigux\u0302'' (female-bodied, \"woman transformed into a man\"), but it is unclear whether these tales are about historical individuals or spirits.<ref name=\"MurrayPH\">Stephen O. Murray, ''Pacific Homosexualities'' (2002) p.206</ref>\n\n===Hunting technologies===\n\n====Boats====\n{{Main|Aleutian kayak}}\n[[File:Choris, Saint Paul.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of an Aleut paddling a baidarka, with an anchored Russian ship in the background, near [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]], by Louis Choris, 1817]]\nThe interior regions of the rough, mountainous Aleutian Islands provided little in terms of natural resources for the Aleutian people. They collected stones for weapons, tools, stoves or lamps. They collected and dried grasses for their woven baskets. For everything else, the Aleuts had learned to use the fish and mammals they caught and processed to satisfy their needs.<ref name=AHC>{{cite book|last=Antonson|first=Joan|title=Alaska's Heritage|year=1984|publisher=The Alaska Historical Commission|location=Anchorage|pages=85\u201395}}</ref>\n\nIn order to hunt sea mammals and to travel between islands, the Aleuts became experts of sailing and navigation. While hunting, they used small watercraft called ''[[Aleutian kayak|baidarkas]].'' For regular travel, they used their large baidaras.<ref name=\"AHC\"/> \n[[File:Rowing Baidara St George Is line1700.jpg|thumb|Men rowing a baidara (large skin boat)]]\n\nThe baidara was a large, open, walrus-skin-covered boat. Aleut families used it when traveling among the islands. It was also used to transport goods for trade, and warriors took them to battle.<ref name=CCP>{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Bill|title=Canoes and Kayaks of Western America|year=1960|publisher=Copper Canoe Press|location=Seattle|pages=11\u201320}}</ref>\n\nThe baidarka (small skin boat) was a small boat covered in sea lion skin. It was developed and used for hunting because of its sturdiness and maneuverability.  The Aleut baidarka resembles that of a [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]] [[kayak]], but it is hydrodynamically sleeker and faster. They made the baidarka for one or two persons only. The deck was made with a sturdy chamber, the sides of the craft were nearly vertical and the bottom was rounded. Most one-man baidarkas were about {{convert|16|ft|m}} feet long and {{convert|20|in|cm}} wide, whereas a two-man was on average about {{convert|20|ft|m}} long and {{convert|24|in|cm}} wide. It was from the baidarka that Aleut men would stand on the water to hunt from the sea.<ref name=\"CCP\"/>\n\n====Weapons====\nThe Aleuts hunted small sea mammals with barbed darts and harpoons slung from throwing boards. These boards gave precision as well as some extra distance to these weapons.<ref name=AIA>{{cite book|last=Jochelson|first=Waldemar|title=Archaeological Investigations In The Aleutian Islands|year=1925|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City|page=145}}</ref>\n\nHarpoons were also called throwing-arrows when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the foreshaft and the head was able to detach from the harpoon when it penetrated an animal, and remain in the wound. There were three main kinds of harpoon that the Aleuts used: a simple harpoon, with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) harpoon in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe simple Aleut harpoon consisted of four main parts: the wooden shaft, the bone foreshaft, and the bonehead (tip) with barbs pointed backward. The barbed head was loosely fitted into the socket of the foreshaft so that when the animal was stabbed, it pulled the head away from the rest of the harpoon. The sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. The bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe compound harpoon was the most prevalent weapon of the Aleut people. Also known as the toggle-head spear, it was about the same size as the simple harpoon and used to hunt the same animals, however, this harpoon provided a more efficient and lethal weapon. This harpoon separated into four parts. The longest part was the shaft with the thicker stalk closer to the tip of the harpoon. The shaft was fitted into the socket of the fore shaft and a bone ring was then placed over the joint to hold the two pieces together, as well as, protecting the wooden shaft from splitting. Connected to the fore shaft of the harpoon is the toggle head spear tip. This tip was made of two sub shafts that break apart on impact with an animal. The upper sub shaft held the razor stone head and attached to the lower sub shaft with a small braided twine loop. Once the tip penetrates the animal the upper sub head broke off from the rest of the shaft, however, since it was still connected with the braided loop it rotated the head into a horizontal position inside the animal's body so that it could not get away from the hunter.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe throwing lance may be distinguished from a harpoon because of the fact that all its pieces are fixed and immovable. A lance was a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. The throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the compound head that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. The length of the compound head was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a man's chest to his back. The lance would penetrate the chest and pass through the chest cavity and exit from the back. The bone ring was designed to break after impact so that the shaft could be used again for another kill.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\n===Burial practices===\nThey buried their dead ancestors near the village.\n[[Archeologists]] have found many different types of burials, dating from a variety of periods, in the Aleutian Islands. The Aleut developed a style of burials that were accommodated to local conditions, and honored the dead. They have had four main types of burials: ''umqan'', cave, above-ground sarcophagi, and burials connected to communal houses.\n\nUmqan burials are the most widely known type of mortuary practice found in the Aleutian Islands. The people created burial mounds, that tend to be located on the edge of a bluff.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\">Veltre 2001</ref> They placed stone and earth over the mound to protect and mark it.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> Such mounds were first excavated by archeologists in 1972 on Southwestern Unmak Island, and dated to the early contact period.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> Researchers have found a prevalence of these umqan burials, and concluded it is a regional mortuary practice.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> It may be considered a pan-Aleutian mortuary practice.\n\nCave burials have been found throughout the Eastern Aleutian Islands. The human remains are buried in shallow graves at the rear of the cave.<ref>West et al. 2003</ref> These caves tend to be located next to [[middens]] and near villages.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\">Nelson and Barnett 1955</ref> Some [[grave goods]] have been found in the caves associated with such burials. For example, a deconstructed boat was found in a burial cave on Kanaga Island.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/> There were no other major finds of grave goods in the vicinity.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/>\n\nThroughout the Aleutian Islands, gravesites have been found that are above-ground [[sarcophagi]]. These sarcophagi are left exposed, with no attempt to bury the dead in the ground.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\">Corbett 2001</ref> These burials tend to be isolated and limited to the remains of adult males, which may indicate a specific ritual practice.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> In the Near Islands, isolated graves have also been found with the remains, and not just the sarcophagus, left exposed on the surface.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> This way of erecting sarcophagi above ground is not as common as umqan and cave burials, but it is still widespread.\n\nAnother type of practice has been to bury remains in areas next to the communal houses of the settlement.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> Human remains are abundant in such sites. They indicate a pattern of burying the dead within the main activity areas of the settlement. These burials consist of small pits adjacent to the houses and scattered around them.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> In these instances, mass graves are common for women and children.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> This type of mortuary practice has been mainly found in the Near Islands.\n\nIn addition to these four main types, other kinds of burials have been found in the Aleutian Islands. These more isolated examples include [[mummification]], private burial houses, abandoned houses, etc.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> To date, such examples are not considered to be part of a larger, unifying cultural practice. The findings discussed represent only the sites that have been excavated.\n\nThe variety of mortuary practices mostly did not included the ritual of including extensive grave goods, as has been found in other cultures. The remains so far have been mainly found with other human and faunal remains.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> The addition of objects to \"accompany\" the dead is rare.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/> Archaeologists have been trying to dissect the absence of grave goods, but their findings have been ambiguous and do not really help the academic community to understand these practices more.\n\nNot much information is known about the ritual parts of burying the dead. Archeologists and anthropologists have not found much evidence related to burial rituals.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> This lack of ritual evidence could hint at either no ritualized ceremony, or one that has not yet been revealed in the archaeological record. As a result, archaeologists cannot decipher the context to understand exactly why a certain type of burial was used in particular cases.\n\n==Notable Aleut==\n*[[John Hoover (artist)|John Hoover]] (1919\u20132011), sculptor\n* [[Carl E.

Of the numerous Russian Orthodox congregations in Alaska, most are majority Alaska Native in ethnicity. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in [[North America]] was Saint [[Peter the Aleut]].\n\n====Recorded Uprising against the Russians====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nIn the 18th century, [[Russia]] ''[[promyshlenniki]]'' traders established settlements on the islands. There was high demand for the furs that the Aleut provided from hunting. In May 1784, local Aleuts revolted on Amchitka against the Russian traders. (The Russians had a small trading post there.) According to what Aleut people said, in an account recorded by Japanese castaways and published in 2004, otters were decreasing year by year. The Russians paid the Aleuts less and less in goods in return for the furs they made. The Japanese learned that the Aleuts felt the situation was at crisis. The leading Aleuts negotiated with the Russians, saying they had failed to deliver enough supplies in return for furs. Nezimov, leader of the Russians, ordered two of his men, Stephanov (\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30ce ''Suteppano'') and Kazhimov (\u30ab\u30b8\u30e2\u30d5 ''Kazimofu'') to kill his mistress Oniishin (\u30aa\u30cb\u30a4\u30b7\u30f3 ''Oniishin''), who was the Aleut chief's daughter, because he doubted that Oniishin had tried to dissuade her father and other leaders from pushing for more goods.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n\nAfter the four leaders had been killed, the Aleuts began to move from Amchitka to neighboring islands. Nezimov, leader of the Russian group, was jailed after the whole incident was reported to Russian officials.<ref name=\"kodayu\">Yamashita, Tsuneo. ''Daikokuya Kodayu''(Japanese), 2004.

The locally resident [[Nicole\u00f1o|Nicole\u00f1o nation]] sought a payment from the Aleut hunters for the large number of otters being killed in the area. Disagreement arose, turning violent; in the ensuing battle, the Aleut killed nearly all the Nicole\u00f1o men. Together with high fatalities from European diseases, the Nicole\u00f1os suffered so much from the loss of their men that by 1853, only one Nicole\u00f1an remained alive. (See [[Juana Maria]], ''The Lone Woman of San Nicolas'', also known as Karana)\n\n===Internment during World War II===\nIn June 1942, during [[World War II]], Japanese forces occupied [[Kiska]] and [[Attu Island|Attu]] Islands in the western Aleutians. They later transported captive Attu Islanders to [[Hokkaid\u014d]], where they were held as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in harsh conditions. Fearing a Japanese attack on other Aleutian Islands and mainland Alaska, the U.S. government evacuated hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs, placing them in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died of [[measles]], [[influenza]] and other infectious diseases which spread quickly in the overcrowded dormitories. In total, about 75 died in American internment and 19 as a result of Japanese occupation.<ref>Ryan Madden, \"'The Government's Industry': Alaska Natives and Pribilof Sealing during World War II.\" ''Pacific Northwest Quarterly'' 91.4 (2000): 202-209.

Foreign diseases, harsh treatment and disruption of aboriginal society soon reduced the population to less than one-tenth this number. The 1910 [[Census]] count showed 1,491 Aleuts. In the 2000 Census, 11,941 people identified as being Aleut; nearly 17,000 said Aleuts were among their ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |title=The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2000 Table 5 |url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-15.pdf |publisher=census.gov}}</ref> Alaskans generally recognize that [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] during the Russian occupation, while the colonists were limited in number, resulted in few full-blooded Aleuts remaining today. Full-blooded Aleuts still exist and are growing in number, and there are also people who may be part Russian or other descent but solely identify as Aleut.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n===Housing===\nThe Aleut constructed partially underground houses called ''[[barabara]]''.  According to [[Lillie McGarvey]], a 20th-century Aleut leader, ''barabaras'' keep \"occupants dry from the frequent rains, warm at all times, and snugly sheltered from the high winds common to the area\".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Aleuts traditionally built houses by digging an oblong square pit in the ground, usually {{convert|50|by|20|ft|m}} or smaller. The pit was then covered by a roof framed with driftwood, thatched with grass, then covered with earth for insulation.<ref>Cook 377</ref> Inside trenches were dug along the sides, with mats placed on top to keep them clean. The bedrooms were at the back of the lodge, opposite the entrance. Several families would stay in one house, with their own designated areas. Rather than fireplaces or bonfires in the middle, lanterns were hung in the house.\n\n===Subsistence===\nThe Aleut survived by hunting and gathering. They fished for salmon, crabs, shellfish, and cod, as well as hunting sea mammals such as seal, [[walrus]], and whales. They processed fish and sea mammals in a variety of ways: dried, smoked, or roasted. [[reindeer|Caribou]], [[muskox|muskoxen]], deer, [[moose]], whale, and other types of game were eaten roasted or preserved for later use. They dried berries. They were also processed as ''alutiqqutigaq'', a mixture of berries, fat, and fish. The boiled skin and blubber of a whale is a delicacy, as is that of walrus.\n\nToday, many Aleut continue to eat customary and locally sourced foods but also buy processed foods from [[Outside (Alaska)|Outside]], which is expensive in Alaska.\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nA full list of their ethnobotany can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/5/ (65 documented plant uses).\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n[[File:Hunting hat, Aleut - Ethol\u00e9n collection, Museum of Cultures (Helsinki) - DSC04917.JPG|thumb|Men's ''chagudax'', or bentwood hunting visor, Arvid Adolf Ethol\u00e9n collection, Museum of Cultures, Helsinki, Finland]]\n[[File:Basket and Lid, early 20th century, 36.498a-b.jpg|thumbnail|Unknown Aleut artist, [[sea-lyme grass]] basket and lid embellished with wool embroidery, early 20th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]] ]]\nCustomary arts of the Aleut include weapon-making, building of ''[[baidarka]]s'' (special hunting boats), [[weaving]], figurines, clothing, carving, and mask making. Men as well as women often carved ivory and wood. 19th-century craftsmen were famed for their ornate wooden hunting hats, which feature elaborate and colorful designs and may be trimmed with [[sea lion]] [[Vibrissae|whiskers]], feathers, and [[walrus ivory]]. [[Andrew Gronholdt]] of the Shumagin Islands has played a vital role in reviving the ancient art of building the ''[[Unangan hunting headgear|chagudax]]'' or bentwood hunting visors.<ref>Black, Lydia T. ''Aleut Art: Unangam Aguqaadangin''. Anchorage, Alaska: Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, 2005</ref>\n\nAleut women sewed finely stitched, waterproof [[Anorak|parkas]] from [[Seal (mammal)|seal]] gut and wove fine baskets from [[sea-lyme grass]] (''[[Elymus mollis]]''). Some Aleut women continue to weave ryegrass baskets. Aleut arts are practiced and taught throughout the state of Alaska. As many Aleut have moved out of the islands to other parts of the state, they have taken with them the knowledge of their arts. They have also adopted new materials and methods for their art, including [[serigraphy]], [[video art]], and [[installation art]].\n\nAleut carving, distinct in each region, has attracted traders for centuries, including early Europeans and other Alaska Natives. Historically, carving was a male art and leadership attribute whereas today it is done by both genders. Most commonly the carvings of walrus ivory and driftwood originated as part of making hunting weapons. Sculptural carvings depict local animals, such as seals and whales. Aleut sculptors also have carved human figures.<ref name=AAUA>{{cite book|last=Black|first=Lydia|title=Aleut Art Unangam Aguqaadangin|year=2003|publisher=Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association|location=Anchorage, AK}}</ref>\n\nThe Aleut also carve walrus ivory for other uses, such as jewelry and sewing needles. Jewelry is made with designs specific to the region of each people. Each [[clan]] would have a specific style to signify their origin. Jewelry ornaments were made for piercing lips (labrum), nose, and ears, as well as for necklaces. Each woman had her own sewing needles, which she made, and that often had detailed end of animal heads.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/>\n\nThe main Aleut method of [[basketry]] was false embroidery (overlay). Strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the basic weaving surface, to obtain a plastic effect. Basketry was an art reserved for women.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/> Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleut in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is ''qiigam aygaaxsii''. One Aleut leader recognized by the State of Alaska for her work in teaching and reviving Aleut basketry was [[Anfesia Shapsnikoff]]. Her life and accomplishments are portrayed in the book ''Moments Rightly Placed''(1998).<ref>Hudson, 1998</ref>\n\nMasks were created to portray figures of their myths and oral history. The [[Atka people]] believed that another people lived in their land before them. They portrayed such ancients in their masks, which show anthropomorphic creatures named in their language. Knut Bergsland says their word means \"like those found in caves.\" Masks were generally carved from wood and were decorated with paints made from berries or other natural products. Feathers were inserted into holes carved out for extra decoration. These masks were used in ceremonies ranging from dances to praises, each with its own meaning and purpose.<ref name=\"AAUA\"/>\n\n===Tattoos and piercings===\nThe tattoos and piercings of the Aleut people demonstrated accomplishments as well as their religious views. They believed their body art would please the spirits of the animals and make any evil go away. The body orifices were believed to be pathways for the entry of evil entities. By piercing their orifices: the nose, the mouth, and ears, they would stop evil entities, ''khoughkh'', from entering their bodies (Osborn, 52). Body art also enhanced their beauty, social status, and spiritual authority.\n\nBefore the 19th century, piercings and tattoos were very common among the Aleut people, especially among women. Piercings, such as the nose pin, were common among both men and women and were usually performed a few days after birth.  The ornament was made of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagle's feather shaft.  From time to time, adult women decorated the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings on it; the semi-precious objects dangled down to their chins.\n\nPiercing ears was also very common.  The Aleuts pierced holes around the rim of their ears with dentalium shells (tooth shells or tusk shells), bone, feathers, dried bird wings or skulls and/or amber. Materials associated with birds were important, as birds were considered to defend animals in the spirit world.  A male would wear sea lion whiskers in his ears as a trophy of his expertise as a hunter. Worn for decorative reasons, and sometimes to signify social standing, reputation, and the age of the wearer, Aleuts would pierce their lower lips with walrus ivory and wear beads or bones. The individual with the most piercings held the highest respect.\n\nTattooing for women began when they reached physical maturity, after menstruation, at about age 20. Historically, men received their first tattoo after killing their first animal, an important rite of passage. Sometimes tattoos signaled social class. For example, the daughter of a wealthy, famous ancestor or father would work hard at her tattoos to show the accomplishments of that ancestor or father. They would sew, or prick, different designs on the chin, the side of the face, or under the nose.\n\n===Aleut clothing===\n[[File:Aleut sax.jpg|thumb|Replica of the ''sax'', an Aleut coat made from bird skins and sea otter fur]]\n[[File:Parka (Kamleika) Aleutian Islands.JPG|thumb|A [[Kamleika]], or sea mammal intestine coat. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/kamleika/6AFzaJE5vq3JQA|title=Kamleika|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Aleut people developed in one of the harshest climates in the world, and learned to create and protect warmth. Both men and women wore parkas that extended below the knees. The women wore the skin of seal or sea-otter, and the men wore bird skin parkas, the feathers turned in or out depending on the weather. When the men were hunting on the water, they wore waterproof parkas made from seal or sea-lion guts, or the entrails of bear, walrus, or whales. Parkas had a hood that could be cinched, as could the wrist openings, so water could not get in. Men wore breeches made from the esophageal skin of seals.  Children wore parkas made of downy eagle skin with tanned bird skin caps.<ref>''Enthnohistory'': Gross & Khera pg. 33, 34</ref> They called these parkas ''kameikas,'' meaning raingear in the English language.(Aleut Corp. Web.).\n\nSea-lions, harbor seals, and the sea otters are the most abundant marine mammals.  The men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them.  The women undertook the sewing (''Enthnohistory:'' Gross & Khera pg. 32). Preparation of the gut for clothing involved several steps. The prepared intestines were turned inside out. A bone knife was used to remove the muscle tissue and fat from the walls of the intestine. The gut was cut and stretched, and fastened to stakes to dry. It was then cut and sewn to make waterproof parkas, bags, and other receptacles (Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 70). On some hunting trips, the men would take several women with them. They would catch birds and prepare the carcasses and feathers for future use.  They caught [[puffins]], Lunda Cirrhata, Fratercula Corniculata, Guillemots, and Cephus & Murres.<ref>Lucien M. Turner, pg. 70</ref>\n\nIt took 40 skins of tufted puffin and 60 skins of horned puffin to make one parka. A woman would need a year for all the labor to make one parka. Each lasted two years with proper care. All parkas were decorated with bird feathers, beard bristles of seal and sea-lion, beaks of sea parrots, bird claws, sea otter fur, dyed leather, and caribou hair sewn in the seams. (Gross & Khera, pg. 34).\n\nWomen made needles from the wingbones of seabirds. They made thread from the sinews of different animals and fish guts.<ref>Gross & Khera pg. 33</ref> A thin strip of seal intestine could also be used, twisted to form a thread. The women grew their thumbnail extra long and sharpened it. They could split threads to make them as fine as a hair.<ref>Turner, pg. 71.</ref> They used vermilion paint, hematite, the ink bag of the octopus, and the root of a kind of grass or vine to color the threads.<ref>Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 71</ref>\n\n===Gender===\nRussian travelers making early contact with the Aleut mention [[storytelling|traditional tales]] of [[two-spirit]]s or [[third gender|third]] and [[fourth gender]] people, known as ''ayagigux\u0302'' (male-bodied, <!--saying e.g. \"male-assigned\", the preferred terminology for similar cases, would raise the question of \"assigned by whom? Europeans\"-->  \"man transformed into a woman\") and ''tayagigux\u0302'' (female-bodied, \"woman transformed into a man\"), but it is unclear whether these tales are about historical individuals or spirits.<ref name=\"MurrayPH\">Stephen O. Murray, ''Pacific Homosexualities'' (2002) p.206</ref>\n\n===Hunting technologies===\n\n====Boats====\n{{Main|Aleutian kayak}}\n[[File:Choris, Saint Paul.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of an Aleut paddling a baidarka, with an anchored Russian ship in the background, near [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]], by Louis Choris, 1817]]\nThe interior regions of the rough, mountainous Aleutian Islands provided little in terms of natural resources for the Aleutian people. They collected stones for weapons, tools, stoves or lamps. They collected and dried grasses for their woven baskets. For everything else, the Aleuts had learned to use the fish and mammals they caught and processed to satisfy their needs.<ref name=AHC>{{cite book|last=Antonson|first=Joan|title=Alaska's Heritage|year=1984|publisher=The Alaska Historical Commission|location=Anchorage|pages=85\u201395}}</ref>\n\nIn order to hunt sea mammals and to travel between islands, the Aleuts became experts of sailing and navigation. While hunting, they used small watercraft called ''[[Aleutian kayak|baidarkas]].'' For regular travel, they used their large baidaras.<ref name=\"AHC\"/> \n[[File:Rowing Baidara St George Is line1700.jpg|thumb|Men rowing a baidara (large skin boat)]]\n\nThe baidara was a large, open, walrus-skin-covered boat. Aleut families used it when traveling among the islands. It was also used to transport goods for trade, and warriors took them to battle.<ref name=CCP>{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Bill|title=Canoes and Kayaks of Western America|year=1960|publisher=Copper Canoe Press|location=Seattle|pages=11\u201320}}</ref>\n\nThe baidarka (small skin boat) was a small boat covered in sea lion skin. It was developed and used for hunting because of its sturdiness and maneuverability.  The Aleut baidarka resembles that of a [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]] [[kayak]], but it is hydrodynamically sleeker and faster. They made the baidarka for one or two persons only. The deck was made with a sturdy chamber, the sides of the craft were nearly vertical and the bottom was rounded. Most one-man baidarkas were about {{convert|16|ft|m}} feet long and {{convert|20|in|cm}} wide, whereas a two-man was on average about {{convert|20|ft|m}} long and {{convert|24|in|cm}} wide. It was from the baidarka that Aleut men would stand on the water to hunt from the sea.<ref name=\"CCP\"/>\n\n====Weapons====\nThe Aleuts hunted small sea mammals with barbed darts and harpoons slung from throwing boards. These boards gave precision as well as some extra distance to these weapons.<ref name=AIA>{{cite book|last=Jochelson|first=Waldemar|title=Archaeological Investigations In The Aleutian Islands|year=1925|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City|page=145}}</ref>\n\nHarpoons were also called throwing-arrows when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the foreshaft and the head was able to detach from the harpoon when it penetrated an animal, and remain in the wound. There were three main kinds of harpoon that the Aleuts used: a simple harpoon, with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) harpoon in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe simple Aleut harpoon consisted of four main parts: the wooden shaft, the bone foreshaft, and the bonehead (tip) with barbs pointed backward. The barbed head was loosely fitted into the socket of the foreshaft so that when the animal was stabbed, it pulled the head away from the rest of the harpoon. The sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. The bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe compound harpoon was the most prevalent weapon of the Aleut people. Also known as the toggle-head spear, it was about the same size as the simple harpoon and used to hunt the same animals, however, this harpoon provided a more efficient and lethal weapon. This harpoon separated into four parts. The longest part was the shaft with the thicker stalk closer to the tip of the harpoon. The shaft was fitted into the socket of the fore shaft and a bone ring was then placed over the joint to hold the two pieces together, as well as, protecting the wooden shaft from splitting. Connected to the fore shaft of the harpoon is the toggle head spear tip. This tip was made of two sub shafts that break apart on impact with an animal. The upper sub shaft held the razor stone head and attached to the lower sub shaft with a small braided twine loop. Once the tip penetrates the animal the upper sub head broke off from the rest of the shaft, however, since it was still connected with the braided loop it rotated the head into a horizontal position inside the animal's body so that it could not get away from the hunter.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\nThe throwing lance may be distinguished from a harpoon because of the fact that all its pieces are fixed and immovable. A lance was a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. The throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the compound head that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. The length of the compound head was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a man's chest to his back. The lance would penetrate the chest and pass through the chest cavity and exit from the back. The bone ring was designed to break after impact so that the shaft could be used again for another kill.<ref name=\"AIA\"/>\n\n===Burial practices===\nThey buried their dead ancestors near the village.\n[[Archeologists]] have found many different types of burials, dating from a variety of periods, in the Aleutian Islands. The Aleut developed a style of burials that were accommodated to local conditions, and honored the dead. They have had four main types of burials: ''umqan'', cave, above-ground sarcophagi, and burials connected to communal houses.\n\nUmqan burials are the most widely known type of mortuary practice found in the Aleutian Islands. The people created burial mounds, that tend to be located on the edge of a bluff.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\">Veltre 2001</ref> They placed stone and earth over the mound to protect and mark it.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> Such mounds were first excavated by archeologists in 1972 on Southwestern Unmak Island, and dated to the early contact period.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> Researchers have found a prevalence of these umqan burials, and concluded it is a regional mortuary practice.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> It may be considered a pan-Aleutian mortuary practice.\n\nCave burials have been found throughout the Eastern Aleutian Islands. The human remains are buried in shallow graves at the rear of the cave.<ref>West et al. 2003</ref> These caves tend to be located next to [[middens]] and near villages.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\">Nelson and Barnett 1955</ref> Some [[grave goods]] have been found in the caves associated with such burials. For example, a deconstructed boat was found in a burial cave on Kanaga Island.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/> There were no other major finds of grave goods in the vicinity.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/>\n\nThroughout the Aleutian Islands, gravesites have been found that are above-ground [[sarcophagi]]. These sarcophagi are left exposed, with no attempt to bury the dead in the ground.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\">Corbett 2001</ref> These burials tend to be isolated and limited to the remains of adult males, which may indicate a specific ritual practice.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> In the Near Islands, isolated graves have also been found with the remains, and not just the sarcophagus, left exposed on the surface.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> This way of erecting sarcophagi above ground is not as common as umqan and cave burials, but it is still widespread.\n\nAnother type of practice has been to bury remains in areas next to the communal houses of the settlement.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> Human remains are abundant in such sites. They indicate a pattern of burying the dead within the main activity areas of the settlement. These burials consist of small pits adjacent to the houses and scattered around them.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> In these instances, mass graves are common for women and children.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> This type of mortuary practice has been mainly found in the Near Islands.\n\nIn addition to these four main types, other kinds of burials have been found in the Aleutian Islands. These more isolated examples include [[mummification]], private burial houses, abandoned houses, etc.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> To date, such examples are not considered to be part of a larger, unifying cultural practice. The findings discussed represent only the sites that have been excavated.\n\nThe variety of mortuary practices mostly did not included the ritual of including extensive grave goods, as has been found in other cultures. The remains so far have been mainly found with other human and faunal remains.<ref name=\"Corbett 2001\"/> The addition of objects to \"accompany\" the dead is rare.<ref name=\"Nelson and Barnett 1955\"/> Archaeologists have been trying to dissect the absence of grave goods, but their findings have been ambiguous and do not really help the academic community to understand these practices more.\n\nNot much information is known about the ritual parts of burying the dead. Archeologists and anthropologists have not found much evidence related to burial rituals.<ref name=\"Veltre 2001\"/> This lack of ritual evidence could hint at either no ritualized ceremony, or one that has not yet been revealed in the archaeological record. As a result, archaeologists cannot decipher the context to understand exactly why a certain type of burial was used in particular cases.\n\n==Notable Aleut==\n*[[John Hoover (artist)|John Hoover]] (1919\u20132011), sculptor\n* [[Carl E.

The civil parish is made up of a number of settlements: Hermitage village, Little Hungerford and Wellhouse.\n\n==Location==\nThe village is [[nucleated village|focussed residentially]] on the B4009, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north east of Newbury in the heart of the [[North Wessex Downs]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. It is thus surrounded by protected woodlands and undulating fields providing a few elevated viewpoints.\n\n==Transport==\n===Roads===\nAccess to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] is within 5 miles (and it also passes through the edge of the parish), which links [[Wales]] to [[London]], and the [[A34 road (England)|A34]] passes through the edge of the parish, a main transport artery from the north to the south of the United Kingdom.\n\n===Public transport===\nFrom 1882 until the 1960s the village had [[Hermitage railway station|a minor halt station]]. The station was erected by the [[Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway]], also the name of its line.  As of 18 February 2013, Hermitage is served by buses 6 and 6A from [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newburyanddistrict.co.uk/pdf/jan13/connect-service-6-and-6A-%28effective-from-18-Feb-2013%29.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819070346/http://newburyanddistrict.co.uk/pdf/jan13/connect-service-6-and-6A-(effective-from-18-Feb-2013).pdf |archive-date=19 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Amenities==\nIt has a general store and [[post office]], a [[Church of England parish church|church]] (Holy Trinity) and two [[public house]]s (The Fox and The White Horse of Hermitage). There is a large garden centre with a cafe, bonsai shop, pool & spa concession and lawnmower centre. The village [[primary school]] feeds into the Downs School. The area is predominantly agricultural and the main local employers are the village school, village pre-school, the [[garden centre]] and a small light industrial unit housing several small businesses.\n\nThe [[Royal School of Military Survey]] at [[Denison Barracks]] houses a small garrison of troops and their families. However, though generally referred to as being in Hermitage, it is actually just across the border in the [[Curridge]] area of [[Chieveley]] parish.\n\n==History==\nOn Oare Common are two curvilinear ditched enclosures which are probably of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] date, although it has also been suggested that they may represent a [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]]. The [[hill fort]] of [[Grimsbury Castle]] is in Grimsbury Wood. A [[folly]] stands at its centre. A 2nd and 3rd century [[Roman villa]] of some pretensions was discovered at Wellhouse in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]]. Between 1917 and 1918 [[D. H. Lawrence]] lived in Hermitage at Chapel Farm Cottage, Chapel Lane.<ref>[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/online/online-exhibitions/exhib_dhl/b7.phtml Online exhibitions - The University of Nottingham].

As of 18 February 2013, Hermitage is served by buses 6 and 6A from [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newburyanddistrict.co.uk/pdf/jan13/connect-service-6-and-6A-%28effective-from-18-Feb-2013%29.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819070346/http://newburyanddistrict.co.uk/pdf/jan13/connect-service-6-and-6A-(effective-from-18-Feb-2013).pdf |archive-date=19 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Amenities==\nIt has a general store and [[post office]], a [[Church of England parish church|church]] (Holy Trinity) and two [[public house]]s (The Fox and The White Horse of Hermitage). There is a large garden centre with a cafe, bonsai shop, pool & spa concession and lawnmower centre. The village [[primary school]] feeds into the Downs School. The area is predominantly agricultural and the main local employers are the village school, village pre-school, the [[garden centre]] and a small light industrial unit housing several small businesses.\n\nThe [[Royal School of Military Survey]] at [[Denison Barracks]] houses a small garrison of troops and their families. However, though generally referred to as being in Hermitage, it is actually just across the border in the [[Curridge]] area of [[Chieveley]] parish.\n\n==History==\nOn Oare Common are two curvilinear ditched enclosures which are probably of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] date, although it has also been suggested that they may represent a [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]]. The [[hill fort]] of [[Grimsbury Castle]] is in Grimsbury Wood. A [[folly]] stands at its centre. A 2nd and 3rd century [[Roman villa]] of some pretensions was discovered at Wellhouse in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]]. Between 1917 and 1918 [[D. H. Lawrence]] lived in Hermitage.<ref>[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/online/online-exhibitions/exhib_dhl/b7.phtml Online exhibitions - The University of Nottingham]. Nottingham.ac.uk.
