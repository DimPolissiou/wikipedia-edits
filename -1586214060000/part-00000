Like their debut album, ''[[Chicago Transit Authority (album)|Chicago Transit Authority]]'', this was a double album.  It was their first album under the name Chicago (the band's prior name, Chicago Transit Authority, was changed due to a threatened lawsuit from the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]) and the first to use the now ubiquitous [[cursive writing|cursive]] Chicago logo on the cover. Released in January 1970 on [[Columbia Records]], ''Chicago'' was commercially successful. It was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in April of the same year of its release, and certified platinum in 1991. It reached No. 4 on the album charts in the United States and No. 6 on the album charts in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and produced three top ten singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album received three [[Grammy Award]] nominations - for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Contemporary Vocal Group]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Album Cover]]. It was voted best album of 1970 by readers of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' magazine, and the 1971 best small-combo [[LP record|LP]] by readers of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.\n\n==History==\nThe album was released in 1970 after the band had shortened its name from \"The Chicago Transit Authority\" following the release of their self-titled [[Chicago Transit Authority (album)|debut album]] the previous year, in order to avoid legal action being threatened by the [[Chicago Transit Authority|actual mass-transit company]]. The official title of the album is ''Chicago'', although it came to be known as '''''Chicago II''''', keeping it in line with the succession of Roman numeral-titled albums that officially began with ''[[Chicago III]]'' in 1971.\n\n''Chicago Transit Authority'' was a success, yet ''Chicago'' is considered by many to be the group's breakthrough album, yielding three singles that made it into the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, including \"[[Make Me Smile]]\" (number 9), \"[[Colour My World (Chicago song)|Colour My World]]\" (number 7), and \"[[25 or 6 to 4]]\" (number 4).<ref name=\"Chicago Hot 100\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/chicago/chart-history/hot-100|title=Chicago Chart History: Hot 100|work=Billboard|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> \n\n''Chicago'' was released in January 1970 on Columbia Records and was an instant hit, reaching number 4 on the Billboard 200 in the United States<ref name=\"Billboard 200\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/chicago/chart-history/billboard-200|title=Chicago Chart History: Billboard 200|work=Billboard|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> and number 6 in the UK.<ref name=\"UK album chart\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/chicago/|title=Chicago {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref> Columbia Records was very active in promoting its quadraphonic four-channel surround-sound format in the mid-1970s, and nine of Chicago's first ten albums were made available in quad.  The quad mix features elements not heard in the standard stereo mix, including additional guitar work from Kath in \"25 Or 6 To 4\" and a different vocal take from Lamm in \"Wake Up Sunshine,\" which reveals a different lyric in the song's last line.\n\nIn 2002, ''Chicago'' was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records with the single versions of \"Make Me Smile\" and \"25 or 6 to 4\" as bonus tracks. Rhino released a DVD-Audio version of the album in 2003, featuring both Advanced Resolution Stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes. In 2016, British producer and musician [[Steven Wilson]] remixed Chicago from the original multitrack tapes.

Like their debut album, ''[[Chicago Transit Authority (album)|Chicago Transit Authority]]'', this was a double album.  It was their first album under the name Chicago (the band's prior name, Chicago Transit Authority, was changed due to a threatened lawsuit from the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]) and the first to use the now ubiquitous [[cursive writing|cursive]] Chicago logo on the cover. Released in January 1970 on [[Columbia Records]], ''Chicago'' was commercially successful. It was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in April of the same year of its release, and certified platinum in 1991. It reached No. 4 on the album charts in the United States and No. 6 on the album charts in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and produced three top ten singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album received three [[Grammy Award]] nominations - for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Contemporary Vocal Group]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Album Cover]]. It was voted best album of 1970 by readers of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' magazine, and the 1971 best small-combo [[LP record|LP]] by readers of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.\n\n==History==\nThe album was released in 1970 after the band had shortened its name from \"The Chicago Transit Authority\" following the release of their self-titled [[Chicago Transit Authority (album)|debut album]] the previous year, in order to avoid legal action being threatened by the [[Chicago Transit Authority|actual mass-transit company]]. The official title of the album is ''Chicago'', although it came to be known as '''''Chicago II''''', keeping it in line with the succession of Roman numeral-titled albums that officially began with ''[[Chicago III]]'' in 1971.\n\n''Chicago Transit Authority'' was a success, yet ''Chicago'' is considered by many to be the group's breakthrough album, yielding three singles that made it into the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, including \"[[Make Me Smile]]\" (number 9), \"[[Colour My World (Chicago song)|Colour My World]]\" (number 7), and \"[[25 or 6 to 4]]\" (number 4).<ref name=\"Chicago Hot 100\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/chicago/chart-history/hot-100|title=Chicago Chart History: Hot 100|work=Billboard|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> \n\n''Chicago'' was released in January 1970 on Columbia Records and was an instant hit, reaching number 4 on the Billboard 200 in the United States<ref name=\"Billboard 200\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/chicago/chart-history/billboard-200|title=Chicago Chart History: Billboard 200|work=Billboard|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> and number 6 in the UK.<ref name=\"UK album chart\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/chicago/|title=Chicago {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref> Columbia Records was very active in promoting its quadraphonic four-channel surround-sound format in the mid-1970s, and nine of Chicago's first ten albums were made available in quad.  The quad mix features elements not heard in the standard stereo mix, including additional guitar work from Kath in \"25 Or 6 To 4\" and a different vocal take from Lamm in \"Wake Up Sunshine,\" which reveals a different lyric in the song's last line.\n\nIn 2002, ''Chicago'' was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records with the single versions of \"Make Me Smile\" and \"25 or 6 to 4\" as bonus tracks. Rhino released a DVD-Audio version of the album in 2003, featuring both Advanced Resolution Stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes. In 2016, British producer and musician [[Steven Wilson]] remixed Chicago from the original multitrack tapes. This version was released on January 27, 2017 by Rhino Records.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album/release|id=mr0004652426|tab= |label=Chicago II Steven Wilson Remix|last= |first= |accessdate={{date|2017-02-17|mdy}}}}</ref> A vinyl edition of the remix cut by Kevin Gray was released on August 11, 2017.
