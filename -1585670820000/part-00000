Car is a then-new 1940 [[Lincoln-Zephyr]]. ]]\n'''State Route 41''' ('''SR 41''') is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]], running from the [[Cabrillo Highway]] ([[California State Route 1|SR 1]]) in [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]] on the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] to  [[California State Route 140|SR 140]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], via [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. It has been constructed as an [[Limited-access road|expressway]] from near [[California State Route 198|SR 198]] in [[Lemoore, California|Lemoore]] north to the south part of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], where the '''Yosemite Freeway''' begins, passing along the east side of downtown and extending north into [[Madera County, California|Madera County]].\n\n==Route description==\nThe majority of Route 41 runs as either two-lane rural highway or four-lane divided highway. The southern end of the highway intersects [[California State Route 1|SR 1]] in [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]]. Between Morro Bay and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], the highway intersects [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] in [[Atascadero, California|Atascadero]], proceeds through the Coast Range and intersects [[SR 46 (CA)|SR 46]]. Actor [[James Dean]] died in an accident in 1955 at the intersection of [[California State Route 46|SR 46]] in [[Cholame, California|Cholame]]. Currently, there is a memorial located there. The interchange is now called the [[James Dean Memorial Junction]]. Between SR 46 and SR 33, SR 41 briefly travels through Kern County without any intersections in its entirety. After entering [[Kings County, California|Kings County]], it reaches [[California State Route 33|SR 33]]. SR 41 then intersects [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] south of [[Kettleman City, California|Kettleman City]]. A large hazardous waste and [[municipal solid waste]] disposal facility operated by [[Waste Management, Inc.]] is located 5.6&nbsp;km (3.5&nbsp;mi) SSW of [[Kettleman City]] on the west side of the highway. Just before reaching the intersection at [[California State Route 198|SR 198]] outside of the city of [[Lemoore, California|Lemoore]], SR 41 becomes a four-lane divided highway until just southeast of [[Riverdale, California|Riverdale]], where SR 41 reverts to one lane in each direction. The El Adobe de los Robles Rancho built by pioneer [[Daniel Rhoads]] can be found north of Lemoore.\n\nSoutheast of [[Caruthers, California|Caruthers]], SR 41 becomes a four-lane divided highway and eventually a freeway approaching the Fresno city limits. The route intersects [[California State Route 99|SR 99]] near Jensen Avenue. Complete access is not available between SR 41/SR 99. For example, there is no direct connector between the southbound SR 41 and northbound SR 99; drivers wanting to make this transition must exit at the SR 41/SR 180 interchange, head west on SR 180, and then transition onto SR 99 at the interchange between those two freeways. Likewise, there is no direct connector between the northbound SR 41 and the southbound SR 99. Drivers must exit at Jensen Avenue, head east on Jensen until its junction with SR 99 a half-mile east of SR 41, and then make the southbound transition onto SR 99.\n\nSR 41 continues north into downtown Fresno, then intersects [[California State Route 180|SR 180]] at a section of the latter route that links SR 41 to both SR 99 to the west, and to [[California State Route 168|SR 168]] to the east. North of Fresno, the route crosses the San Joaquin River, and enters [[Madera County, California|Madera County]] near [[Children's Hospital Central California|Children's Hospital of Central California]] before reverting to a two-lane highway. {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} further north, Route 41 intersects with [[California State Route 145|SR 145]], before entering California's [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra-Nevada]] mountain range. Route 41 continues through the towns of [[Coarsegold, California|Coarsegold]] and [[Oakhurst, California|Oakhurst]], where it intersects with [[California State Route 49|SR 49]]. Route 41 ends in [[Yosemite National Park]] to the north.\n\n[[File:Wawona Tunnel and SR-41.JPG|thumb|upright|East portal of Wawona Tunnel near eastern terminus of SR 41]]\n[[Tunnel View]] is a viewpoint located just outside the east end of the Wawona Tunnel in Yosemite National Park. It is located about 1.5 miles (2.4&nbsp;km) from the [[Yosemite Valley]]. This is the first view that most people have of Yosemite Valley. There is an END-41 sign just south of the southern entrance to [[Yosemite National Park]]. The state routes within the park are not signed (with the exception of [[California State Route 120|SR 120]]). Tunnel View is along Route 41's alignment, although state maintenance of the route ends at the south entrance of the park.\n\nExcept between [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]] in [[Atascadero, California|Atascadero]] and [[California State Route 46|SR 46]] near [[Shandon, California|Shandon]], SR 41 is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]],<ref name=\"cafes\">{{CAFESystem}}</ref> and north of SR 46 is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=fhwa-nhs>{{FHWA NHS map|region=californiasouth|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref> a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the [[Federal Highway Administration]].<ref name=NHS-FHWA>{{FHWA NHS}}</ref> Three segments{{spaced ndash}}from SR 1 to US 101, SR 46 to [[California State Route 33|SR 33]], and [[California State Route 49|SR 49]] at [[Oakhurst, California|Oakhurst]] to Yosemite (the Wawona Road){{spaced ndash}}are eligible for inclusion in the [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|State Scenic Highway System]],<ref name=\"scenic\">{{CA scenic}}</ref> but SR 41 is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the [[California Department of Transportation]].<ref name=\"caltransscenic\">{{Caltrans scenic|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref> SR 41 is known as the [[Edward Gardner Lewis|E.G.

As SR 41 had not been signed over the unpaved road west of Paso Robles, it was truncated to Cholame.<ref>[[H.M. Gousha Company]], [http://members.cox.net/mkpl2/hist/mp55-centralvly.jpg California] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231013137/http://members.cox.net/mkpl2/hist/mp55-centralvly.jpg |date=December 31, 2007 }}, 1955</ref> US 466 was eliminated in the [[1964 renumbering (California)|1964 renumbering]], becoming [[California State Route 46|SR 46]] east from Paso Robles. However, instead of going south and west to Morro Bay, SR 46 continued west to Cambria, and the road via Creston and Atascadero to Morro Bay (which had since been paved) became part of SR 41.<ref>[[H.M. Gousha Company]], California, 1963</ref><ref name=\"law-renumbering\">{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385|p=1175}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the urban stretch of 41 running through [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] was upgraded to freeway standards, intersecting [[California State Route 99|SR 99]] to the south. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the freeway portion was extended several miles beyond Fresno in both directions.\n\nAlso in the late 1990s and early 2000s in Atascadero, the old SR 41 alignment used to cut through downtown by going north on El Camino Real and turning right onto West Mall. Then it continued past the Atascadero Colony Building and crossed the 1921 Atascadero Creek Bridge before turning left onto Capistrano Avenue. It then went under a low clearance railroad crossing and a dangerous narrow bridge crossing the Salinas River before rejoining its existing alignment. Then Caltrans built a bypass of this dangerous route with a long wider bridge crossing the railroad, Sycamore Drive, and the river before joining the original 1950s SR 41. SR 41 is now currently signed on this bypass. Since then, the old bridge was demolished but the railroad undercrossing still remains. There's an old sign on Capistrano Avenue that still marks it as \"Hwy 41\" and signs on El Camino Real that mark West Mall with covered up \"41\" shields.\n\n==Future==\nThe Kings County Association of Governments has plans to improve the state highways within the county. Developers are interested in building distribution warehouses in Kings County because of its strategic location midway between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, but they are currently turned off by the lack of freeway access. For SR 41, the plan is to upgrade it so the highway is a continuous freeway from I-5 north to Fresno County. However, Kings County voters have shown little interest in passing any transportation taxes to fund these projects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hanfordsentinel.com/news/local/road-map-for-the-future/article_f1222a8e-17e1-11e3-9878-001a4bcf887a.html | title=Road map for the future? | first=Seth | last=Nidever | work=The Sentinel | date=September 7, 2013 | accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{CAinttop|exit|post_ref=<br><ref name=trucklist /><ref name=bridgelog>{{Caltrans bridgelog|date=July 2007}}</ref><ref>[[California Department of Transportation]], [http://traffic-counts.dot.ca.gov/ All Traffic Volumes on CSHS], 2005 and 2006</ref>|exit_ref=<br><ref>[[California Department of Transportation]], [[California Numbered Exit Uniform System]], [http://www.dot.ca.gov/trafficops/exit/docs/41.pdf State Route 41 Freeway Interchanges], Retrieved on February 5, 2009.</ref>|San Gabriel Road=|postsmile=14|CAint=}}\n{{CAint|exit\n|county=San Luis Obispo\n|cspan=8\n|location=Morro Bay\n|lspan=2\n|county_note=SLO 0.00-50.43\n|postmile=0.00\n|road=Atascadero Road\n|notes=Continuation beyond SR 1\n}}\n{{CAint|exit\n|postmile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|1|city1=Cayucos|city2=Cambria|location3=[[Hearst Castle]]}}\n|notes=Interchange;

Car is a then-new 1940 [[Lincoln-Zephyr]]. ]]\n'''State Route 41''' ('''SR 41''') is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]], running from the [[Cabrillo Highway]] ([[California State Route 1|SR 1]]) in [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]] on the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] to  [[California State Route 140|SR 140]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], via [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. It has been constructed as an [[Limited-access road|expressway]] from near [[California State Route 198|SR 198]] in [[Lemoore, California|Lemoore]] north to the south part of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], where the '''Yosemite Freeway''' begins, passing along the east side of downtown and extending north into [[Madera County, California|Madera County]].\n\n==Route description==\nThe majority of Route 41 runs as either two-lane rural highway or four-lane divided highway. The southern end of the highway intersects [[California State Route 1|SR 1]] in [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]]. Between Morro Bay and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], the highway intersects [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] in [[Atascadero, California|Atascadero]], proceeds through the Coast Range and intersects [[SR 46 (CA)|SR 46]]. Actor [[James Dean]] died in an accident in 1955 at the intersection of [[California State Route 46|SR 46]] in [[Cholame, California|Cholame]]. Currently, there is a memorial located there. The interchange is now called the [[James Dean Memorial Junction]]. Between SR 46 and SR 33, SR 41 briefly travels through Kern County without any intersections in its entirety. After entering [[Kings County, California|Kings County]], it reaches [[California State Route 33|SR 33]]. SR 41 then intersects [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] south of [[Kettleman City, California|Kettleman City]]. A large hazardous waste and [[municipal solid waste]] disposal facility operated by [[Waste Management, Inc.]] is located 5.6&nbsp;km (3.5&nbsp;mi) SSW of [[Kettleman City]] on the west side of the highway. Just before reaching the intersection at [[California State Route 198|SR 198]] outside of the city of [[Lemoore, California|Lemoore]], SR 41 becomes a four-lane divided highway until just southeast of [[Riverdale, California|Riverdale]], where SR 41 reverts to one lane in each direction. The El Adobe de los Robles Rancho built by pioneer [[Daniel Rhoads]] can be found north of Lemoore.\n\nSoutheast of [[Caruthers, California|Caruthers]], SR 41 becomes a four-lane divided highway and eventually a freeway approaching the Fresno city limits. The route intersects [[California State Route 99|SR 99]] near Jensen Avenue. Complete access is not available between SR 41/SR 99. For example, there is no direct connector between the southbound SR 41 and northbound SR 99; drivers wanting to make this transition must exit at the SR 41/SR 180 interchange, head west on SR 180, and then transition onto SR 99 at the interchange between those two freeways. Likewise, there is no direct connector between the northbound SR 41 and the southbound SR 99. Drivers must exit at Jensen Avenue, head east on Jensen until its junction with SR 99 a half-mile east of SR 41, and then make the southbound transition onto SR 99.\n\nSR 41 continues north into downtown Fresno, then intersects [[California State Route 180|SR 180]] at a section of the latter route that links SR 41 to both SR 99 to the west, and to [[California State Route 168|SR 168]] to the east. North of Fresno, the route crosses the San Joaquin River, and enters [[Madera County, California|Madera County]] near [[Children's Hospital Central California|Children's Hospital of Central California]] before reverting to a two-lane highway. {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} further north, Route 41 intersects with [[California State Route 145|SR 145]], before entering California's [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra-Nevada]] mountain range. Route 41 continues through the towns of [[Coarsegold, California|Coarsegold]] and [[Oakhurst, California|Oakhurst]], where it intersects with [[California State Route 49|SR 49]]. Route 41 ends in [[Yosemite National Park]] to the north.\n\n[[File:Wawona Tunnel and SR-41.JPG|thumb|upright|East portal of Wawona Tunnel near eastern terminus of SR 41]]\n[[Tunnel View]] is a viewpoint located just outside the east end of the Wawona Tunnel in Yosemite National Park. It is located about 1.5 miles (2.4&nbsp;km) from the [[Yosemite Valley]]. This is the first view that most people have of Yosemite Valley. There is an END-41 sign just south of the southern entrance to [[Yosemite National Park]]. The state routes within the park are not signed (with the exception of [[California State Route 120|SR 120]]). Tunnel View is along Route 41's alignment, although state maintenance of the route ends at the south entrance of the park.\n\nExcept between [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]] in [[Atascadero, California|Atascadero]] and [[California State Route 46|SR 46]] near [[Shandon, California|Shandon]], SR 41 is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]],<ref name=\"cafes\">{{CAFESystem}}</ref> and north of SR 46 is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=fhwa-nhs>{{FHWA NHS map|region=californiasouth|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref> a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the [[Federal Highway Administration]].<ref name=NHS-FHWA>{{FHWA NHS}}</ref> Three segments{{spaced ndash}}from SR 1 to US 101, SR 46 to [[California State Route 33|SR 33]], and [[California State Route 49|SR 49]] at [[Oakhurst, California|Oakhurst]] to Yosemite (the Wawona Road){{spaced ndash}}are eligible for inclusion in the [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|State Scenic Highway System]],<ref name=\"scenic\">{{CA scenic}}</ref> but SR 41 is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the [[California Department of Transportation]].<ref name=\"caltransscenic\">{{Caltrans scenic|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref> SR 41 is known as the [[Edward Gardner Lewis|E.G.

However, instead of going south and west to Morro Bay, SR 46 continued west to Cambria, and the road via Creston and Atascadero to Morro Bay (which had since been paved) became part of SR 41.<ref>[[H.M. Gousha Company]], California, 1963</ref><ref name=\"law-renumbering\">{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385|p=1175}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the urban stretch of 41 running through [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] was upgraded to freeway standards, intersecting [[California State Route 99|SR 99]] to the south. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the freeway portion was extended several miles beyond Fresno in both directions.\n\nAlso in the late 1990's and early 2000's in Atascadero, the old SR 41 alignment used to cut through downtown by going north on El Camino Real and turning right onto West Mall. Then it continued past the Atascadero Colony Building and crossed the 1921 Atascadero Creek Bridge before turning left onto Capistrano Avenue. It then went under a low clearance railroad crossing and a dangerous narrow bridge crossing the Salinas River before rejoining its existing alignment. Then Caltrans built a bypass of this dangerous route with a long wider bridge crossing the railroad, Sycamore Drive, and the river before joining the original 1950's SR 41. SR 41 is now currently signed on this bypass. Since then, the old bridge was demolished but the railroad undercrossing still remains. There's an old sign on Capistrano Avenue that still marks it as \"Hwy 41\" and signs on El Camino Real that mark West Mall with covered up \"41\" shields.\n\n==Future==\nThe Kings County Association of Governments has plans to improve the state highways within the county. Developers are interested in building distribution warehouses in Kings County because of its strategic location midway between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, but they are currently turned off by the lack of freeway access. For SR 41, the plan is to upgrade it so the highway is a continuous freeway from I-5 north to Fresno County. However, Kings County voters have shown little interest in passing any transportation taxes to fund these projects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hanfordsentinel.com/news/local/road-map-for-the-future/article_f1222a8e-17e1-11e3-9878-001a4bcf887a.html | title=Road map for the future? | first=Seth | last=Nidever | work=The Sentinel | date=September 7, 2013 | accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{CAinttop|exit|post_ref=<br><ref name=trucklist /><ref name=bridgelog>{{Caltrans bridgelog|date=July 2007}}</ref><ref>[[California Department of Transportation]], [http://traffic-counts.dot.ca.gov/ All Traffic Volumes on CSHS], 2005 and 2006</ref>|exit_ref=<br><ref>[[California Department of Transportation]], [[California Numbered Exit Uniform System]], [http://www.dot.ca.gov/trafficops/exit/docs/41.pdf State Route 41 Freeway Interchanges], Retrieved on February 5, 2009.</ref>|San Gabriel Road=|postsmile=14|CAint=}}\n{{CAint|exit\n|county=San Luis Obispo\n|cspan=8\n|location=Morro Bay\n|lspan=2\n|county_note=SLO 0.00-50.43\n|postmile=0.00\n|road=Atascadero Road\n|notes=Continuation beyond SR 1\n}}\n{{CAint|exit\n|postmile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|1|city1=Cayucos|city2=Cambria|location3=[[Hearst Castle]]}}\n|notes=Interchange;

Each has advantages and disadvantages but all are useful. The methods can be divided into membrane-based (e.g., [[reverse osmosis]]) and thermal-based (e.g., [[Multi-stage flash distillation|multistage flash distillation]]) methods.<ref name=\":0\" /> The traditional process of desalination is [[distillation]], i.e. boiling and re-[[condensation]] of [[seawater]] to leave salt and impurities behind.<ref>[http://www.oas.org/usde/publications/unit/oea59e/ch21.htm Desalination by distillation article on the OAS website]</ref>\n\n===Solar distillation===\nSolar distillation mimics the natural water cycle, in which the sun heats the sea water enough for evaporation to occur.<ref name=Khawaji /> After evaporation, the water vapor is condensed onto a cool surface.<ref name=Khawaji /> There are two types of solar desalination. The former one is using photovoltaic cells which converts solar energy to electrical energy to power the desalination process. The latter one utilises the solar energy in the heat form itself and is known as solar thermal powered desalination.\n\n===Vacuum distillation===\nIn [[vacuum distillation]] atmospheric pressure is reduced, thus lowering the temperature required to evaporate the water. Liquids boil when the [[vapor pressure]] equals the ambient pressure and vapor pressure increases with temperature. Effectively, liquids boil at a lower temperature, when the ambient atmospheric pressure is less than usual atmospheric pressure. Thus, because of the reduced pressure, low-temperature \"waste\" heat from electrical power generation or industrial processes can be employed.\n\n===Multi-stage flash distillation===\nWater is evaporated and separated from sea water through [[multi-stage flash distillation]], which is a series of [[flash evaporation]]s.<ref name=Khawaji>{{cite journal|last1=Khawaji|first1=Akili D.|last2=Kutubkhanah|first2=Ibrahim K.|last3=Wie|first3=Jong-Mihn|title=Advances in seawater desalination technologies|journal=Desalination|volume=221|issue=1\u20133|pages=47\u201369|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.01.067|date=March 2008}}</ref> Each subsequent flash process utilizes energy released from the condensation of the water vapor from the previous step.<ref name=Khawaji />\n\n===Multiple-effect distillation===\n[[Multiple-effect distillation]] (MED) works through a series of steps called \"effects\".<ref name=Khawaji /> Incoming water is sprayed onto pipes which are then heated to generate steam.

Various factors interfere with efficiency: ionic contamination (calcium, magnesium etc.); [[Dissolved organic carbon|DOC]]; bacteria; viruses; [[colloid]]s and insoluble particulates; [[biofouling]] and [[Fouling|scaling]]. In extreme cases, the RO membranes are destroyed. To mitigate damage, various pretreatment stages are introduced.  Anti-scaling inhibitors include acids and other agents such as the organic polymers [[polyacrylamide]] and [[polymaleic acid]], [[phosphonate]]s and [[polyphosphate]]s. Inhibitors for fouling are [[biocide]]s (as oxidants against bacteria and viruses), such as chlorine, ozone, sodium or calcium hypochlorite. At regular intervals, depending on the membrane contamination; fluctuating seawater conditions; or when prompted by monitoring processes, the membranes need to be cleaned, known as emergency or shock-flushing. Flushing is done with inhibitors in a fresh water solution and the system must go offline. This procedure is environmentally risky, since contaminated water is diverted into the ocean without treatment.

Cogeneration can provide usable heat for desalination in an integrated, or \"dual-purpose\", facility where a power plant provides the energy for desalination. Alternatively, the facility's energy production may be dedicated to the production of potable water (a stand-alone facility), or excess energy may be produced and incorporated into the energy grid. Cogeneration takes various forms, and theoretically any form of energy production could be used. However, the majority of current and planned cogeneration desalination plants use either [[fossil fuels]] or [[nuclear power]] as their source of energy. Most plants are located in the [[Middle East]] or [[North Africa]], which use their petroleum resources to offset limited water resources. The advantage of dual-purpose facilities is they can be more efficient in energy consumption, thus making desalination more viable.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.desal.2005.03.095| title = Overview of hybrid desalination systems \u2013 current status and future prospects| journal = Desalination| volume = 186| issue = 1\u20133| page = 207| year = 2005| last1 = Hamed | first1 = O.

With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is to mix it via a diffuser in a mixing zone. For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length. Mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution.\n\nBrine is denser than seawater and therefore sinks to the ocean bottom and can damage the ecosystem.

This solution can be easily squeezed out from the gel by means of sieve or microfiltration membrane. The compression of the gel in closed system lead to change in salt concentration, whereas the compression in open system, while the gel is exchanging ions with bulk, lead to the change in the number of ions. The consequence of the compression and swelling in open and closed system conditions mimics the reverse Carnot Cycle of refrigerator machine. The only difference is that instead of heat this cycle transfers salt ions from the bulk of low salinity to a bulk of high salinity. Similarly to the Carnot cycle this cycle is fully reversible, so can in principle work with an ideal thermodynamic efficiency. Because the method is free from the use of osmotic membranes it can compete with reverse osmosis method. In addition, unlike the reverse osmosis, the approach is not sensitive to the quality of feed water and its seasonal changes, and allows the production of water of any desired concentration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== Small-scale solar ====\nThe United States, France and the United Arab Emirates are working to develop practical [[solar desalination]].<ref>[http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/25/uae-france-announce-partnership-jointly-fund-renewable-energy-projects/ UAE & France Announce Partnership To Jointly Fund Renewable Energy Projects], Clean Technica, January 25, 2015</ref> AquaDania's WaterStillar has been installed at Dahab, Egypt, and in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.

The pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor. The compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced pressure in the evaporation chamber. The compressor [[centrifuge]]s the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister (removing residual impurities) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber. The compression of the vapor increases its temperature. The heat is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes, vaporizing the water in the tubes. Water vapor condenses on the outside of the tubes as product water. By combining several physical processes, Passarell enables most of the system's energy to be recycled through its evaporation, demisting, vapor compression, condensation, and water movement processes.<ref>[http://www.waterdesalination.com/theory.htm The \"Passarell\" Process].

The former one is using photovoltaic cells which converts solar energy to electrical energy to power the desalination process. The latter one utilises the solar energy in the heat form itself and is known as solar thermal powered desalination.\n\n===Vacuum distillation===\nIn [[vacuum distillation]] atmospheric pressure is reduced, thus lowering the temperature required to evaporate the water. Liquids boil when the [[vapor pressure]] equals the ambient pressure and vapor pressure increases with temperature. Effectively, liquids boil at a lower temperature, when the ambient atmospheric pressure is less than usual atmospheric pressure.

Various factors interfere with efficiency: ionic contamination (calcium, magnesium etc.); [[Dissolved organic carbon|DOC]]; bacteria; viruses; [[colloid]]s and insoluble particulates; [[biofouling]] and [[Fouling|scaling]]. In extreme cases, the RO membranes are destroyed. To mitigate damage, various pretreatment stages are introduced.  Anti-scaling inhibitors include acids and other agents such as the organic polymers [[polyacrylamide]] and [[polymaleic acid]], [[phosphonate]]s and [[polyphosphate]]s. Inhibitors for fouling are [[biocide]]s (as oxidants against bacteria and viruses), such as chlorine, ozone, sodium or calcium hypochlorite. At regular intervals, depending on the membrane contamination; fluctuating seawater conditions; or when prompted by monitoring processes, the membranes need to be cleaned, known as emergency or shock-flushing.

Cogeneration can provide usable heat for desalination in an integrated, or \"dual-purpose\", facility where a power plant provides the energy for desalination.

Cogeneration takes various forms, and theoretically any form of energy production could be used. However, the majority of current and planned cogeneration desalination plants use either [[fossil fuels]] or [[nuclear power]] as their source of energy. Most plants are located in the [[Middle East]] or [[North Africa]], which use their petroleum resources to offset limited water resources. The advantage of dual-purpose facilities is they can be more efficient in energy consumption, thus making desalination more viable.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.desal.2005.03.095| title = Overview of hybrid desalination systems \u2013 current status and future prospects| journal = Desalination| volume = 186| issue = 1\u20133| page = 207| year = 2005| last1 = Hamed | first1 = O.

Desalinated water is also expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high, such as [[Riyadh]] and [[Harare]].

With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is to mix it via a diffuser in a mixing zone. For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length.

This solution can be easily squeezed out from the gel by means of sieve or microfiltration membrane. The compression of the gel in closed system lead to change in salt concentration, whereas the compression in open system, while the gel is exchanging ions with bulk, lead to the change in the number of ions. The consequence of the compression and swelling in open and closed system conditions mimics the reverse Carnot Cycle of refrigerator machine. The only difference is that instead of heat this cycle transfers salt ions from the bulk of low salinity to a bulk of high salinity. Similarly to the Carnot cycle this cycle is fully reversible, so can in principle work with an ideal thermodynamic efficiency. Because the method is free from the use of osmotic membranes it can compete with reverse osmosis method. In addition, unlike the reverse osmosis, the approach is not sensitive to the quality of feed water and its seasonal changes, and allows the production of water of any desired concentration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== Small-scale solar ====\nThe United States, France and the United Arab Emirates are working to develop practical [[solar desalination]].<ref>[http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/25/uae-france-announce-partnership-jointly-fund-renewable-energy-projects/ UAE & France Announce Partnership To Jointly Fund Renewable Energy Projects], Clean Technica, January 25, 2015</ref> AquaDania's WaterStillar has been installed at Dahab, Egypt, and in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.

The pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor. The compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced pressure in the evaporation chamber. The compressor [[centrifuge]]s the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister (removing residual impurities) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber. The compression of the vapor increases its temperature. The heat is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes, vaporizing the water in the tubes. Water vapor condenses on the outside of the tubes as product water. By combining several physical processes, Passarell enables most of the system's energy to be recycled through its evaporation, demisting, vapor compression, condensation, and water movement processes.<ref>[http://www.waterdesalination.com/theory.htm The \"Passarell\" Process].

As freshwater is not usually available in their environments, some seabirds, such as [[pelican]]s, [[petrel]]s, [[albatross]]es, [[gull]]s and [[tern]]s, possess this gland, which allows them to drink the salty water from their environments while they are far from land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Proctor|first=Noble S.|last2=Lynch|first2=Patrick J.|title=Manual of Ornithology|isbn=978-0300076196|year=1993|publisher=Yale University Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ritchison|first=Gary|title=Avian osmoregulation|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/bird_excretion.htm|accessdate=April 16, 2011}} including images of the gland and its function</ref>\n\n[[Mangrove]] trees grow in seawater; they secrete salt by trapping it in parts of the root, which are then eaten by animals (usually crabs). Additional salt is removed by storing it in leaves that fall off. Some types of mangroves have glands on their leaves, which work in a similar way to the seabird desalination gland. Salt is extracted to the leaf exterior as small [[crystal]]s, which then fall off the leaf.\n\n[[Willow]] trees and [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] absorb salt and other contaminants, effectively desalinating the water.

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a \"Complete and Uncut\" edition. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to ten years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The Complete and Uncut edition of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It received a number of literary award nominations, including the [[Balrog Award]], the [[Locus Award]] and the [[World Fantasy Award]], and was included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The Complete and Uncut edition includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abigail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abigail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abigail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"The Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"The Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abigail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abigail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abigail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"The Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The Complete and Uncut Edition includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption = The Complete and Uncut Edition cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as \"The Complete and Uncut Edition\".

During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a \"Complete and Uncut\" edition. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to ten years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The Complete and Uncut edition of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It received a number of literary award nominations, including the [[Balrog Award]], the [[Locus Award]] and the [[World Fantasy Award]], and was included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The Complete and Uncut edition includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abigail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abigail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abigail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"The Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"The Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abigail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abigail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abigail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"The Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The Complete and Uncut Edition includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption = The Complete and Uncut Edition cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as \"The Complete and Uncut Edition\". Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}</ref> As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deleted pages (as selected by King), as well as updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s. This new edition features a new preface by King, and illustrations by [[Bernie Wrightson]]. Additionally, Doubleday published a deluxe edition of ''The Stand: The Complete & Uncut Edition'', limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies.

During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

Constructed in 1891 for Carlo Bossi, a prominent pioneer developer and landowner, it is important to the city's heritage because it is representative of the development patterns of the late nineteenth century, which saw the expansion of the City away from the commercial core and the waterfront. Designed as a hotel with commercial spaces at street level, it is significant that it has retained an element of its original function through a major 1944 renovation which converted it to war-time housing, and through to its present-day use as a backpacker's hostel.\n\n[[File:Allied_Hotel.jpg]]\n\nSince 1891, it has been variously known as Osborne House, Pandora Hotel, Allies Hotel, Alexander Apartments, Solomon Apartments and Ocean Island Inn Backpackers Suites. It was called the Alexander Apartments during the 1980s and was purchased by Howie Siegel (through his construction company, Perma Construction) around 1990 and renamed the Solomon Apartments. Howie's team were responsible for commissioning the \"Honeymooners\" mural that graces the south side of the building. Subsequently, it became, and remains today, the Ocean Island Inn Backpackers Suites.\n\nThis building is on a corner lot and has entrances on both Blanshard St (Blanchard St prior to 1906) and Pandora Avenue.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticize Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticize the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

[[Tariq Jameel]] are featured on an extensive range of Internet videos and often appear on TV.\n\n==History==\nThe emergence of Tablighi Jamaat represented the intensification of individual reformation aspects of the original Deobandi movement. It was also a continuation of the broader trend of Islamic revival in India in the wake of the collapse of [[Mughal Empire|Muslim political hegemony]] to the [[Maratha Empire]] and the subsequent consolidation of the [[British raj]].\n\nThe emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu proselytizing movements such as ''[[Shuddhi]]'' (purification) and ''Sanghatan'' (consolidation) which launched massive efforts in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.<ref name=\"Ballard 1994 64\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ballard|1994|p=64}}</ref>\n\n===Origin===\nThe practices and teachings in the Prophet's Mosque in Medina and asabus [[Suffah]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hudhaifahgoga.co.za/follow-sunnah/|title=Ashabus Suffa Tabligh from Madina Munawwarah \u2013 Hazrat Imaam \u2013 HRH Hudhaifah Goga \u2013 (Roman Hashimite Emperor) Royalty Emperor |website=hudhaifahgoga.co.za |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318183231/https://hudhaifahgoga.co.za/follow-sunnah/|archive-date=18 March 2018|url-status=dead |access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref> Muhammad Ilyas, the founder of Tablighi Jamaat, wanted to create a movement that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the [[Quran]] decreed,<ref name=\"Quran\">{{cite quran|3|104 |s=ns}}</ref><ref name=p65/> as his teacher [[Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi]] dreamed of doing.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=xiii}}</ref> The inspiration for this came during his second [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] in 1926.<ref name='Agwani'>{{Cite book |last=Agwani |first=Mohammad Shafi |year=1986 |title=Islamic Fundamentalism in India |publisher=Twenty First Century Indian Society |page=41 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal.<ref name=AMFO1994:513>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.513</ref> He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the [[Mewati]] Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices.

The initial expansion within South Asia happened immediately after the partition of India in 1947, when the Pakistan Chapter was established in the hinterlands of [[Raiwind]] town near [[Lahore]], Pakistan. The Pakistan Chapter remained the largest until Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971. Today, the largest Chapter is Bangladesh followed by the second largest in Pakistan.

This was different from the other Islamic movements which were mainly [[ulama]]-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote ''dawah'' as a mechanism of self-reform.<ref name=AMFO1994:515>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.515</ref>\n\nLike Salafists, Tabligh seek a \"separation in their daily life from the `impious` society that surrounded them\".

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticize Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticize the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements.
