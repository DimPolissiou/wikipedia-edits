[[Theodore Roosevelt]] delivered an address at Throop Institute on March 21, 1911, and he declared:\n\n<blockquote>I want to see institutions like Throop turn out perhaps ninety-nine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them; I want to see those men do the kind of work that is now being done on the [[Panama Canal]] and on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this country\u2014and the one-hundredth man I want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop a man like your great astronomer, George Ellery Hale.<ref name=\"Caltech Catalog\">{{cite web |url = http://catalog.caltech.edu/pdf/catalog_10_11.pdf |title=Caltech Catalog |publisher=Caltech |access-date=May 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110409051312/http://catalog.caltech.edu/pdf/catalog_10_11.pdf |archive-date=April 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the same year, a bill was introduced in the [[California Legislature]] calling for the establishment of a publicly funded \"California Institute of Technology\", with an initial budget of a million dollars, ten times the budget of Throop at the time. The board of trustees offered to turn Throop over to the state, but the presidents of [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of California]] successfully lobbied to defeat the bill, which allowed Throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern California, public or private, until the onset of the World War II necessitated the broader development of research-based science education.<ref name=\"The Dream Endures\">{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s|url=https://archive.org/details/dreamendurescali00star|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=1997|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dreamendurescali00star/page/74 74\u201377]|chapter=Unto the Stars Themselves, Astronomy and the Pasadena Perspective|isbn=0-19-515797-4|access-date=November 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203202552/https://archive.org/details/dreamendurescali00star|archive-date=December 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The promise of Throop attracted [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[Arthur Amos Noyes]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology.\n\nWith the onset of [[World War I]], Hale organized the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems. While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation. President Scherer, hearing of the formation of the council, immediately offered to take part in its work, and with this object, he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars.<ref name=\"NRC\">{{cite book|last=Goodstein|first=Judith R.|title=Millikan's School: A History of the California Institute of Technology|publisher=[[W.

On November 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the Institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time \"to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research\".<ref name=\"Caltech Catalog\"/> In 1923, Millikan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. In 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired [[William Bennett Munro]], then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at [[Harvard University]], to create a division of [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s at Caltech. In 1928, a division of [[biology]] was established under the leadership of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the [[chromosome]] in heredity. In 1930, [[Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor George MacGinitie. In 1926, a graduate school of [[aeronautics]] was created, which eventually attracted [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]]. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the world's centers for [[rocket|rocket science]].

Each group of seniors designs a \"stack\" to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.\n\nAnother long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's \"[[Ride of the Valkyries]]\" at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available.

A group of [[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT hackers]] responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read \"The Only Institute of Technology.\" Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and \"...{{nbsp}}because not everyone can go to Caltech\" along with an image of a palm tree on the back.\n\nMIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe & Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.\n\nOn April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from ''The California Tech'', Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of ''The Tech'', MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included \"MIT Invents the Interweb\", \"Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate'\", and \"[[Infinite Corridor]] Not Actually Infinite\".\n\nIn December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A \"sold\" banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a \"Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities\" banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and T-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the \"curriculum change.\"<ref>[http://east.caltech.edu/ Caltech Opens Humanities School at MIT Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202233541/http://east.caltech.edu/ |date=December 2, 2009 }}, December 6, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 Citybeats: Future Tournament of Roses chief vows even better parades] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212234513/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 |date=December 12, 2009 }}, ''Pasadena Star-News'', December 6, 2009</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a [[TARDIS]], the time machine from the BBC's ''[[Doctor Who]]'', onto a roof.

When heated, the mugs turn orange, display a palm tree, and read \"Caltech The Hotter Institute of Technology.\" Identical mugs continue to be sold at the Caltech campus store.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bookstore.caltech.edu/catalogs/CatalogProductItems?Title=Drinkware&Sku=1*100985&Delc=Merchandise|title=CatalogProductITems \u2013 Caltech Bookstore|publisher=|accessdate=July 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930081159/https://bookstore.caltech.edu/catalogs/CatalogProductItems?Title=Drinkware&Sku=1*100985&Delc=Merchandise|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Honor code ====\nLife in the Caltech community is governed by the [[honor code]], which simply states: \"No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.\" This is enforced by a Board of Control, which consists of undergraduate students,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://donut.caltech.edu/about/boc/ug_handbook.php |title=The Honor System Handbook from the Board of Control at Caltech.edu |publisher=Donut.caltech.edu |accessdate=October 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106150251/http://donut.caltech.edu/about/boc/ug_handbook.php |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> and by a similar body at the graduate level, called the Graduate Honor Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/hc |title=Graduate Studies Office \u2013 The Honor Code |publisher=www.gradoffice.caltech.edu |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408100956/http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/hc |archive-date=April 8, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere. For example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy, and alcohol policy. Although both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Rodriguez\n  | first =Juan\n  | title =Ricketts Pres.

The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his Nobel-winning work in [[quantum electrodynamics]] was already very established in the scientific community. [[Murray Gell-Mann]], a Nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of [[hadrons]] and went on to postulate the existence of [[quark]]s, which is currently accepted as part of the [[Standard Model]]. Long-time Caltech President [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] was the first to calculate the charge of the [[electron]] with his well-known [[oil-drop experiment]], while [[Richard Chace Tolman]] is remembered for his contributions to [[cosmology]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] winner [[H. David Politzer]] is a current professor at Caltech, as is astrophysicist and author [[Kip Thorne]] and eminent mathematician [[Barry Simon]]. [[Linus Pauling]] pioneered [[quantum chemistry]] and [[molecular biology]], and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. Seismologist [[Charles Richter]], also an alumnus, developed the magnitude scale that bears his name, the [[Richter magnitude scale]] for measuring the power of earthquakes. One of the founders of the geochemistry department, [[Clair Patterson]] was the first to accurately determine the age of the Earth via lead:uranium ratio in meteorites. In engineering, [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] made many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] airflow characterization. A repeating pattern of swirling [[vortices]] is named after him, the [[von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]. Participants in von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT project included [[Frank Malina]], who helped develop the [[WAC Corporal]] which was the first U.S. rocket to reach the edge of space, [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]], a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable composite-based rocket motor, and [[Qian Xuesen]], who was dubbed the \"Father of Chinese Rocketry\". More recently, [[Michael E.

While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation.

On November 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the Institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time \"to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research\".<ref name=\"Caltech Catalog\"/> In 1923, Millikan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. In 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired [[William Bennett Munro]], then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at [[Harvard University]], to create a division of [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s at Caltech. In 1928, a division of [[biology]] was established under the leadership of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the [[chromosome]] in heredity. In 1930, [[Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor George MacGinitie. In 1926, a graduate school of [[aeronautics]] was created, which eventually attracted [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]].

According to tradition, a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a [[triboluminescence|triboluminescent]] spark. This yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark. The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous [[oil-drop experiment|Millikan oil-drop experiment]] which measured ''e'', the [[elementary charge|elemental unit of electrical charge]].\n\nOn Ditch Day, the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. Each group of seniors designs a \"stack\" to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.\n\nAnother long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's \"[[Ride of the Valkyries]]\" at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time (except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of ''[[The Ring Cycle]]''), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. \n{{clear}}\n\n==== Pranks ====\n[[File:Fleming cannon firing.jpg|thumb|The Fleming cannon]]\n\nCaltech students have been known for the many [[Student prank|prank]]s (also known as \"RFs\").<ref name=\"Caltech1\">{{cite news|last=Hiszpanski|first=Anna|title=Fleming Cannon Gone|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2014|newspaper=The California Tech|date=April 3, 2006|volume=107|number=21|page=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014754/http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf|archive-date=April 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two most famous in recent history are the changing of the [[Hollywood Sign]] to read \"Caltech\", by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the scoreboard to read Caltech 38, MIT 9 during the [[1984 Rose Bowl|1984 Rose Bowl Game]].

These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the main building fa\u00e7ade with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology\". A group of [[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT hackers]] responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read \"The Only Institute of Technology.\" Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and \"...{{nbsp}}because not everyone can go to Caltech\" along with an image of a palm tree on the back.\n\nMIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe & Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.\n\nOn April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from ''The California Tech'', Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of ''The Tech'', MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included \"MIT Invents the Interweb\", \"Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate'\", and \"[[Infinite Corridor]] Not Actually Infinite\".\n\nIn December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A \"sold\" banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a \"Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities\" banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and T-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the \"curriculum change.\"<ref>[http://east.caltech.edu/ Caltech Opens Humanities School at MIT Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202233541/http://east.caltech.edu/ |date=December 2, 2009 }}, December 6, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 Citybeats: Future Tournament of Roses chief vows even better parades] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212234513/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 |date=December 12, 2009 }}, ''Pasadena Star-News'', December 6, 2009</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a [[TARDIS]], the time machine from the BBC's ''[[Doctor Who]]'', onto a roof.

For example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy, and alcohol policy. Although both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Rodriguez\n  | first =Juan\n  | title =Ricketts Pres.

Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today. Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response. Broken homes, childhood trauma, lack of parenting and many other factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dietrich|first1=Cindy|title=Decision Making: Factors that Influence Decision Making, Heuristics Used, and Decision Outcomes|url=https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|website=Inquiries Journal|publisher=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse LLC|accessdate=6 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124530/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Hoffman]] is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy.

Definitions vary, contributing to the challenge of defining empathy. Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them. Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an [[empathic concern]], a feeling of concern for another, in which some scholars include the wish to see them better off or happier.<ref name=\"Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3\">Batson, C.D.

If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate<ref name=\"Baird, James D., and Laurie Nadel, 2010\">Happiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60163-105-3}}</ref> and may be achieved unconsciously.

The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate.

Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.<ref>How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard</ref><ref>Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses \"other-oriented\" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures \"self-oriented\" feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H | year = 1983 | title = Measuring Individual Differences in Empathy: Evidence for a Multidimensional Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113\u201326 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}</ref>\n\nBehavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness (the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile) are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and [[temporoparietal junction]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=BW|last2=Brook|first2=M|last3=Remillard|first3=L|last4=Ishak|first4=A|last5=Anderson|first5=IW|last6=Filkowski|first6=MM|title=I know how you feel: the warm-altruistic personality profile and the empathic brain.|journal=PLOS One|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120639|pmid=25769028|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120639|pmc=4359130|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1020639H}}</ref>\n\n=== Sex differences ===\nThe literature commonly indicates that females tend to have more cognitive empathy than males.

Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.\n\nA study done by Caroline Tisot looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.\n\nThis study found that a few parenting practices \u2013 as opposed to parenting style as a whole \u2013 contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. However, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.<ref>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Tisot|first=Caroline Monforte|date=2003|title=Environmental contributions to empathy development in young children|publisher=[[Temple University]]|oclc=56772472}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke.

This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior.<ref name=\"springerlink.com\"/>\n\n== Influence on helping behavior ==\nEmotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.<ref name=\"Bartlett, M. 2006\" /> Thus, empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions, it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others. Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.\n\nResearch investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims.

Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation.<ref name=Dovidio1990/> But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.<ref name=Dovidio1990>{{cite journal |author1=Dovidio J.F. |author2=Allen J.L. |author3=Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249\u2013260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\n===General===\nResearch suggests that empathy is also partly genetically determined.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H. | last2 = Luce | first2 = Carol | last3 = Kraus | first3 = Stephen J. | title = The heritability of characteristics associated with dispositional empathy | journal = [[Journal of Personality]] | volume= 62 | issue= 3 | pages = 369&ndash;391 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00302.x | pmid = 7965564 | date = September 1994 | ref = harv }}</ref> For instance, carriers of the deletion variant of [[ADRA2B]] show more activation of the amygdala when viewing emotionally arousing images.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = Rebecca M. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Adam K. | title = The neurogenetics of remembering emotions past | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] | volume= 106 | issue= 45 | pages = 18881&ndash;18882 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0910755106 | pmid = 19889977 | pmc = 2776429 | date = November 2009 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2009PNAS..10618881T }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = Rebecca M. |display-authors=etal| title = Neurogenetic variations in norepinephrine availability enhance perceptual vividness | journal = [[The Journal of Neuroscience]] | volume= 35 | issue= 16 | pages = 6506&ndash;6516 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4489-14.2015 | pmid = 25904801 | pmc = 6605217 | date = 22 April 2015 | ref = harv }}</ref> The gene [[5-HTTLPR]] seems to determine sensitivity to negative emotional information and is also attenuated by the deletion variant of ADRA2b.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Naudts | first1 = Kris H. | last2 = Azevedo | first2 = Ruben T. | last3 = David | first3 = Anthony S. | last4 = van Heeringen | first4 = Kees | last5 = Gibbs | first5 = Ayana A. | title = Epistasis between 5-HTTLPR and ADRA2B polymorphisms influences attentional bias for emotional information in healthy volunteers | journal = [[International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology]] | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1027&ndash;1036 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145711001295 | pmid = 21854681 | date = 1 September 2012 | ref = harv | doi-access = free }} [http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/7218/1/IJNP_proof.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023232342/http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/7218/1/IJNP_proof.pdf |date=October 23, 2017 }}</ref> Carriers of the double G variant of the [[Oxytocin receptor|OXTR]] gene were found to have better social skills and higher self-esteem.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Saphire-Bernstein | first1 = Shimon | last2 = Way | first2 = Baldwin M. | last3 = Kim | first3 = Heejung S. | last4 = Sherman | first4 = David K. | last5 = Taylor | first5 = Shelley E. | title = Oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) is related to psychological resources | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] | volume= 108 | issue= 37 | pages = 15118&ndash;15122 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1113137108 | pmid = 21896752 | date = September 2011 | ref = harv | pmc = 3174632 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10815118S }}</ref> A gene located near LRRN1 on chromosome 3 then again controls the human ability to read, understand and respond to emotions in others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Warrier | first1 = Varun |display-authors=etal| title = Genome-wide meta-analysis of cognitive empathy: heritability, and correlates with sex, neuropsychiatric conditions and cognition | journal = [[Molecular Psychiatry]] | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 1402\u20131409 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2017.122 | pmid = 28584286 | pmc = 5656177 | date = 6 June 2017 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===\nContemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion.

Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy [[mirror neuron]] systems in their brains.<ref>Gazzola, V., Aziz-Zadeh, L., & Keysers, C. (2006). Empathy and the somatotopic auditory mirror system in humans. Current biology, 16(18), 1824-1829.</ref> Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.<ref name=\"Keen Suzanne 2006 207\u201336\"/> Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress.\n\nIn empathy, people feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.<ref name=\"Pijnenborg2012\"/> In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.<ref name=\"Bartlett, M. 2006\">{{cite journal |author1=Bartlett M.

Therefore, individuals who have high scores on psychopathy and do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mullins-Nelson | first1 = Jana L. | last2 = Salekin | first2 = Randall T. | last3 = Anne-Marie | first3 = R.

Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy\u2014affective (emotional) empathy\u2014which includes the ability to ''feel'' the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as [[emotional contagion]]), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims.

The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences (e.g. non-shared environment having more influence than family environment). It is suggested that psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.<ref>\u201cHow Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain\u201d 2017 Lisa Feldman Barrett</ref><ref>\"The Role of Culture in Empathy: The Consequences and Explanations of Cultural Differences in Empathy at the Affective and Cognitive Levels\" 2014 David Atkins</ref>\n\n==== Other conditions ====\nResearch indicates atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.\n\n[[Borderline personality disorder]] is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction.<ref name=\"Minzenberg et al., 2006\">{{cite journal|last=Minzenberg|first=M.J.|first2=M.|last2=Fisher-Irving|first3=J.H.|last3=Poole|first4=S.|last4=Vinogradov|year=2006|title=Reduced self-referential source memory performance is associated with interpersonal dysfunction in borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|volume=20|issue=1|pages=42\u201354|url=http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516001713/http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|archivedate=May 16, 2013|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1521/pedi.2006.20.1.42|pmid=16563078}}</ref> Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior has been shown to play a crucial role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react.<ref name=Harari/> While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions too much, several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states (impaired [[cognitive empathy]]), as well as an impaired [[theory of mind]].<ref name=Harari/> People with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people's faces, suggesting increased empathic capacities.<ref name=\"Wagner and Linehan, 1999\">{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=A.W.|author2=M.M Linehan|year=1999|title=Facial expression recognition ability among women with borderline personality disorder: implications for emotion regulation?|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|volume=13|issue=4|pages=329\u2013344|doi=10.1521/pedi.1999.13.4.329|pmid=10633314}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=T.R.|first2=M.Z. |last2=Rosenthal |first3=D.S. |last3=Kosson |first4=J.S. |last4=Cheavens |first5=C.W. |last5=Lejuez |first6=R.J. |last6=Blair|year=2006|title=Heightened sensitivity to facial expressions of emotion in borderline personality disorder.|journal=Emotion|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.647 |pmid=17144755|volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=647\u2013655}}</ref> It is, therefore, possible that impaired cognitive empathy (the capacity for understanding another person's experience and perspective) may account for borderline personality disorder individuals' tendency for interpersonal dysfunction, while \"hyper-emotional empathy\"{{Verify source|date=August 2013}} may account for the emotional over-reactivity observed in these individuals.<ref name=Harari/> One primary study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy, yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy.<ref name=Harari>{{cite journal|last=Harari|first=Hagai|author2=Simone G.

This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.<ref name=\"Tettegah, S. 2007\"/>\n\nAn important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.<ref>Cornelius-White, J. H.

One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.<ref>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Keillor|first=Robin Michelle|date=1999|title=Empathy and intergroup relations: a study in cross-cultural relationship building|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|oclc=44999879}}</ref> The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires. Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn't seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that \"relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication\".\n\nUS researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen et al. state that developing intercultural empathy enables the interpretation of experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview.<ref>William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, & Richard Brislin (1979). A Manual of Structured Experiences for Cultural Learning. La Grange P ark, IL: Intercultural Network.</ref> Intercultural empathy can also improve self-awareness and critical awareness of one's own interaction style as conditioned by one's cultural views<ref>Divine World College (2016), Bachelor of Arts in Intercultural Studies program, Epworth, IA.</ref> and promote a view of self-as-process.<ref>Sue Brown and Joyce Osland (2016), Developing Cultural Diversity Competency. University of Portland.</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nThe empathy-altruism relationship also has broad and practical implications. Knowledge of the power of the empathic feeling to evoke altruistic motivation may lead to strategies for learning to suppress or avoid these feelings; such numbing or loss of the capacity to feel empathy for clients has been suggested as a factor in the experience of burnout among case workers in helping professions. Awareness of this impending futile effort\u2014 nurses caring for terminal patients or pedestrians walking by the homeless\u2014may make individuals try to avoid feelings of empathy in order to avoid the resulting altruistic motivation. Promoting an understanding about the mechanisms by which altruistic behavior is driven, whether it is from minimizing sadness or the arousal of mirror neurons allows people to better cognitively control their actions. However, empathy-induced altruism may not always produce pro-social effects. It could lead one to increase the welfare of those for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Batson C.

Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.<ref>Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed.

First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint<ref>''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}</ref> \u2013 including that it is \"partly self-standing\", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.<ref name=\"King2008-74\">{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&lpg=PA227&dq=empathy%20iain%20king&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q=empathy%20iain%20king&f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&nbsp;...

His second argument is more practical: he argues, \"Empathy for others really is the route to value in life\", and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one. By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics, King is able to reconcile ethics based on [[Consequentialism|consequences]] with [[Virtue ethics|virtue-ethics]] and [[Deontological ethics|act-based]] accounts of right and wrong.<ref name=\"King2008-227\">{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&lpg=PA227|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=227}}</ref> His empathy-based system has been taken up by some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]],<ref>\nA Buddhist account of Iain King's ideas is set out in [http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics this] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235032/http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics |date=October 20, 2012 }}  Global Oneness article.\n</ref> and is used to address some practical problems, such as when to tell [[Lie#Ethics|lies]],<ref>\n[[Publishers Weekly]] state that \"King is even able to formulate a credible rule that tells us when to lie\" [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 here.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030514/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 |date=November 17, 2015 }} \n</ref> and how to develop culturally-neutral [[Romance (love)#In philosophy|rules for romance]].\n\nIn the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.<ref>''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007</ref>\n\n==== Phenomenology ====\nIn [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[Other (philosophy)|other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of \"my body over there\". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not \"my\" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.<ref>''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nSome postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize.<ref>Jenkins, K. (1991) ''Re-thinking History'' London: Routledge</ref>\n\nIt is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present. If we watch from a fictitious past, can tell the present with the future tense, as it happens with the trick of the false prophecy. There is no way of telling the present with the means of the past.<ref>Pozzi, G. (1976) Prefazione 6. L'elemento storico e politico -sociale, in G.B. Marino, ''L'Adone'' Milano</ref>\n\n=== Psychotherapy ===\n[[Heinz Kohut]] is the main introducer of the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality.\n\nIn evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the \"ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them\" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.<ref>{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-13-238245-8}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Business and management ===\nIn the 2009 book ''Wired to Care'', strategy consultant [[Dev Patnaik]] argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[IBM]] as examples of \"Open Empathy Organizations\". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210095811/http://www.wiredtocare.com/|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant [[Marie Miyashiro]] similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success\n| last=Miyashiro |first=Marie R. |year=2011 |publisher=Puddledancer Press|isbn=978-1-892005-25-0|page=256}}</ref> In studies by the Management Research Group, empathy was found to be the strongest predictor of ethical leadership behavior out of 22 competencies in its management model, and empathy was one of the three strongest predictors of senior executive effectiveness.<ref name=FinancialPost20130621>{{cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/21/forget-ethics-training-focus-on-empathy/ |title=Forget ethics training: Focus on empathy |last=Dowden |first=Craig |date=June 21, 2013 |website=The National Post |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ILr5ZAXa?url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/21/forget-ethics-training-focus-on-empathy/ |archivedate=July 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n== Measurement ==\nResearch into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.\n\nResearchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.\n\nBehavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax.<ref>Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact. A Study of Psychotherapy with Schizophrenics. Eds. C. R. Rogers, E. T. Gendlin, D. J. Kiesler and C. B. Truax.

Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced.<ref name=egLevensonRuef1992Leslieetal2004>e.g. {{cite journal |author1=Levenson R.

Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of \"emotional contagion\" or mirroring.<ref name=egLevensonRuef1992Leslieetal2004/> These reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking (\"if I were him I would feel&nbsp;...\").\n\nPaper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy;<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Geher|Warner|Brown|2001}}</ref> scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form.<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Mehrabian|Epstein|1972}}</ref> Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates.<ref>e.g. {{cite journal | author = Davis M.

These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geher|first1=G. |last2=Warner|first2=R.

It was found that the bonobos sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.\n\nEmpathic-like responding has been observed in [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110\u201312115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|pmid=20547864|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R |pmc=2901437}}</ref> The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.\n\nIt is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537\u2013544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005}}</ref> The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads. Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.\n\n[[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851\u2013859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|pages=851\u2013859|pmid=22644113|url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/7074/2/Custance_and_Mayer_draft_prior_to_publication.pdf}}</ref> When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.\n\nWhen witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223\u2013229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004}}</ref> found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.\n\nAt the same time, humans can empathize with other species. A study by Miralles et al. (2019) showed that human empathic perceptions (and compassionate reactions) toward an extended sampling of organisms are strongly negatively correlated with the divergence time separating them from us.

Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today. Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response. Broken homes, childhood trauma, lack of parenting and many other factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dietrich|first1=Cindy|title=Decision Making: Factors that Influence Decision Making, Heuristics Used, and Decision Outcomes|url=https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|website=Inquiries Journal|publisher=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse LLC|accessdate=6 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124530/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Hoffman]] is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy.

Definitions vary, contributing to the challenge of defining empathy. Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them.

If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate<ref name=\"Baird, James D., and Laurie Nadel, 2010\">Happiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60163-105-3}}</ref> and may be achieved unconsciously.

The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate. Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2002 | title = From passivity to competence: A conceptualization of knowledge, skill, tolerance, and empathy | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 338\u2013345 | doi=10.1521/psyc.65.4.338.20239| pmid = 12530337 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2013 | title = The parameters of empathy: Core considerations for psychotherapy and supervision | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.2393689 | journal = Advances in Descriptive Psychology | volume = 10}}</ref>\n\nThe human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Meltzoff A.N. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2003 | title = What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 358 | issue = 1431| pages = 491\u2013500 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 | pmid=12689375 | pmc=1351349}}</ref> Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling.\n\nIn the field of positive psychology, empathy has also been compared with [[altruism]] and egotism. Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person, while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain. Sometimes, when someone is feeling empathetic towards another person, acts of altruism occur. However, many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains.

For University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety, [empathy] is not specific to humans. He argues that there is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social [[attachment theory|attachment]], and [[parental care]].<ref name=\"Decety, J\">{{cite journal | author = Decety J | year = 2011 | title = The neuroevolution of empathy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1231 | issue = 1| pages = 35\u201345 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06027.x | pmid=21651564|bibcode = 2011NYASA1231...35D }}</ref> Core neural circuits that are involved in empathy and caring include the [[brainstem]], the [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Svetlova M. | year = 2012 | title = Putting together phylogenetic and ontogenetic perspectives on empathy | url = | journal = Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201324 | doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.05.003 | pmid = 22682726 |pmc=6987713 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nSince all definitions of empathy involves an element of for others, all distinctions between egoism and empathy fail at least for beings lacking self-awareness. Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.<ref>How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard</ref><ref>Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses \"other-oriented\" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures \"self-oriented\" feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H | year = 1983 | title = Measuring Individual Differences in Empathy: Evidence for a Multidimensional Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113\u201326 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}</ref>\n\nBehavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness (the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile) are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and [[temporoparietal junction]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=BW|last2=Brook|first2=M|last3=Remillard|first3=L|last4=Ishak|first4=A|last5=Anderson|first5=IW|last6=Filkowski|first6=MM|title=I know how you feel: the warm-altruistic personality profile and the empathic brain.|journal=PLOS One|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120639|pmid=25769028|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120639|pmc=4359130|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1020639H}}</ref>\n\n=== Sex differences ===\nThe literature commonly indicates that females tend to have more cognitive empathy than males.

Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.\n\nA study done by Caroline Tisot looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.\n\nThis study found that a few parenting practices \u2013 as opposed to parenting style as a whole \u2013 contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. However, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.<ref>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Tisot|first=Caroline Monforte|date=2003|title=Environmental contributions to empathy development in young children|publisher=[[Temple University]]|oclc=56772472}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke.

This is again suggestive of the fact that understanding one's own emotions is key in being able to identify with another individual's emotional state.\n\n== Empathic anger and distress ==\n=== Anger ===\nEmpathic anger is an [[emotion]], a form of empathic distress.<ref name=\"springerlink.com\">{{cite journal|title= Empathy and justice motivation|doi=10.1007/BF00991641 |year=1990|last1=Hoffman|first1=Martin L.|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=2|pages=151\u2013172}}</ref> Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing.

Empathic concern did not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress was associated with increased anger.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Mohr P. |author2=Howells K. |author3=Gerace A. |author4=Day A. |author5=Wharton M. | year = 2007 | title = The role of perspective taking in anger arousal | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 507\u2013517 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 |hdl=2328/36189 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Day A. |author2=Mohr P. |author3=Howells K. |author4=Gerace A. |author5=Lim L. | year = 2012 | title = The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students | url =https://dspace.flinders.edu.au/xmlui/bitstream/2328/35889/1/Gerace_Role_AM2011.pdf | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 56 | issue = 4|pages = 599\u2013613 | doi = 10.1177/0306624X11431061 |pmid=22158909 |hdl=2328/35889 }}</ref>\n\n=== Distress ===\nEmpathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior.<ref name=\"springerlink.com\"/>\n\n== Influence on helping behavior ==\nEmotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.<ref name=\"Bartlett, M. 2006\" /> Thus, empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions, it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others. Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.\n\nResearch investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marjanovic|first=Zdravko|author2=Struthers, Greenglass |title=Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims?

For example, one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects\u2019 sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight. Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation.<ref name=Dovidio1990/> But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.<ref name=Dovidio1990>{{cite journal |author1=Dovidio J.F. |author2=Allen J.L. |author3=Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249\u2013260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\n===General===\nResearch suggests that empathy is also partly genetically determined.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H. | last2 = Luce | first2 = Carol | last3 = Kraus | first3 = Stephen J. | title = The heritability of characteristics associated with dispositional empathy | journal = [[Journal of Personality]] | volume= 62 | issue= 3 | pages = 369&ndash;391 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00302.x | pmid = 7965564 | date = September 1994 | ref = harv }}</ref> For instance, carriers of the deletion variant of [[ADRA2B]] show more activation of the amygdala when viewing emotionally arousing images.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = Rebecca M. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Adam K. | title = The neurogenetics of remembering emotions past | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] | volume= 106 | issue= 45 | pages = 18881&ndash;18882 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0910755106 | pmid = 19889977 | pmc = 2776429 | date = November 2009 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2009PNAS..10618881T }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Todd | first1 = Rebecca M. |display-authors=etal| title = Neurogenetic variations in norepinephrine availability enhance perceptual vividness | journal = [[The Journal of Neuroscience]] | volume= 35 | issue= 16 | pages = 6506&ndash;6516 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4489-14.2015 | pmid = 25904801 | pmc = 6605217 | date = 22 April 2015 | ref = harv }}</ref> The gene [[5-HTTLPR]] seems to determine sensitivity to negative emotional information and is also attenuated by the deletion variant of ADRA2b.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Naudts | first1 = Kris H. | last2 = Azevedo | first2 = Ruben T. | last3 = David | first3 = Anthony S. | last4 = van Heeringen | first4 = Kees | last5 = Gibbs | first5 = Ayana A. | title = Epistasis between 5-HTTLPR and ADRA2B polymorphisms influences attentional bias for emotional information in healthy volunteers | journal = [[International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology]] | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1027&ndash;1036 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145711001295 | pmid = 21854681 | date = 1 September 2012 | ref = harv | doi-access = free }} [http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/7218/1/IJNP_proof.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023232342/http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/7218/1/IJNP_proof.pdf |date=October 23, 2017 }}</ref> Carriers of the double G variant of the [[Oxytocin receptor|OXTR]] gene were found to have better social skills and higher self-esteem.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Saphire-Bernstein | first1 = Shimon | last2 = Way | first2 = Baldwin M. | last3 = Kim | first3 = Heejung S. | last4 = Sherman | first4 = David K. | last5 = Taylor | first5 = Shelley E. | title = Oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) is related to psychological resources | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] | volume= 108 | issue= 37 | pages = 15118&ndash;15122 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1113137108 | pmid = 21896752 | date = September 2011 | ref = harv | pmc = 3174632 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10815118S }}</ref> A gene located near LRRN1 on chromosome 3 then again controls the human ability to read, understand and respond to emotions in others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Warrier | first1 = Varun |display-authors=etal| title = Genome-wide meta-analysis of cognitive empathy: heritability, and correlates with sex, neuropsychiatric conditions and cognition | journal = [[Molecular Psychiatry]] | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 1402\u20131409 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2017.122 | pmid = 28584286 | pmc = 5656177 | date = 6 June 2017 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===\nContemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion.

(2006). Empathy and the somatotopic auditory mirror system in humans. Current biology, 16(18), 1824-1829.</ref> Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.<ref name=\"Keen Suzanne 2006 207\u201336\"/> Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress.\n\nIn empathy, people feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.<ref name=\"Pijnenborg2012\"/> In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions.

Nor could it explain the similar effect on diagnosed autism for some European migrants America in the 1940s that was reviewed in the 2010s as a shortage of vitamin D was never a problem for these light-skinned immigrants to America. The decrease of diagnosed autism with the number of years the parents had lived in their new country also cannot be explained by the theory that the cause is genetic no matter if it is said to be caused by actual ethnic differences in autism gene prevalence or a selective migration of individuals predisposed for autism since such genes, if present, would not go away over time. It have therefore been suggested that autism is not caused by an innate deficit in a specific social circuitry in the brain, also citing other research suggesting that specificalized social brain mechanisms may not exist even in neurotypic people, but that particular features of appearance and/or minor details in behavior are met with exclusion from socialization that shows up as apparently reduced social ability.<ref>\"Immigrant Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Relationship between the Perspective of the Professionals and the Parents\u2019 Point of View\" 2013 Milena Pereira Pond\u00e9 PhD, C\u00e9cile Rousseau</ref><ref>\"Prevalence of autism according to maternal immigrant status and ethnic origin\" 2011 Marie-Jose Dealberto</ref>\n\n==== Psychopathy ====\nPsychopathy is a personality disorder partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of [[remorse]] and empathy.<ref name=\"Cleckly, 1941\">{{cite journal|last=Cleckly|first=H.

Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their \"empathy switch\". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.<ref name=\"empathy switch\">{{cite news |title=Psychopathic criminals have empathy switch |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727080108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>Lewis, Tanya. \"Cold-hearted Psychopaths Feel Empathy Too\".

This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.<ref name=\"Tettegah, S. 2007\"/>\n\nAn important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.<ref>Cornelius-White, J. H.

One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.<ref>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Keillor|first=Robin Michelle|date=1999|title=Empathy and intergroup relations: a study in cross-cultural relationship building|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|oclc=44999879}}</ref> The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires. Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn't seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that \"relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication\".\n\nUS researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen et al. state that developing intercultural empathy enables the interpretation of experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview.<ref>William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, & Richard Brislin (1979). A Manual of Structured Experiences for Cultural Learning. La Grange P ark, IL: Intercultural Network.</ref> Intercultural empathy can also improve self-awareness and critical awareness of one's own interaction style as conditioned by one's cultural views<ref>Divine World College (2016), Bachelor of Arts in Intercultural Studies program, Epworth, IA.</ref> and promote a view of self-as-process.<ref>Sue Brown and Joyce Osland (2016), Developing Cultural Diversity Competency. University of Portland.</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nThe empathy-altruism relationship also has broad and practical implications. Knowledge of the power of the empathic feeling to evoke altruistic motivation may lead to strategies for learning to suppress or avoid these feelings; such numbing or loss of the capacity to feel empathy for clients has been suggested as a factor in the experience of burnout among case workers in helping professions. Awareness of this impending futile effort\u2014 nurses caring for terminal patients or pedestrians walking by the homeless\u2014may make individuals try to avoid feelings of empathy in order to avoid the resulting altruistic motivation. Promoting an understanding about the mechanisms by which altruistic behavior is driven, whether it is from minimizing sadness or the arousal of mirror neurons allows people to better cognitively control their actions. However, empathy-induced altruism may not always produce pro-social effects. It could lead one to increase the welfare of those for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Batson C.

Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.<ref>Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed.

Apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning. Two general methods have been identified here. An individual may simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs, desires, character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings it provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then access the environment for a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment.<ref name=\"DeWaal\">{{cite journal | author = de Waal F.

First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint<ref>''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}</ref> \u2013 including that it is \"partly self-standing\", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.<ref name=\"King2008-74\">{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&lpg=PA227&dq=empathy%20iain%20king&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q=empathy%20iain%20king&f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&nbsp;...

His second argument is more practical: he argues, \"Empathy for others really is the route to value in life\", and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one. By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics, King is able to reconcile ethics based on [[Consequentialism|consequences]] with [[Virtue ethics|virtue-ethics]] and [[Deontological ethics|act-based]] accounts of right and wrong.<ref name=\"King2008-227\">{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&lpg=PA227|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=227}}</ref> His empathy-based system has been taken up by some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]],<ref>\nA Buddhist account of Iain King's ideas is set out in [http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics this] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235032/http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics |date=October 20, 2012 }}  Global Oneness article.\n</ref> and is used to address some practical problems, such as when to tell [[Lie#Ethics|lies]],<ref>\n[[Publishers Weekly]] state that \"King is even able to formulate a credible rule that tells us when to lie\" [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 here.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030514/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 |date=November 17, 2015 }} \n</ref> and how to develop culturally-neutral [[Romance (love)#In philosophy|rules for romance]].\n\nIn the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.<ref>''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007</ref>\n\n==== Phenomenology ====\nIn [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[Other (philosophy)|other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of \"my body over there\". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not \"my\" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.<ref>''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nSome postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize.<ref>Jenkins, K.

His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality.\n\nIn evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the \"ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them\" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.<ref>{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-13-238245-8}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Business and management ===\nIn the 2009 book ''Wired to Care'', strategy consultant [[Dev Patnaik]] argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[IBM]] as examples of \"Open Empathy Organizations\". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210095811/http://www.wiredtocare.com/|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant [[Marie Miyashiro]] similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success\n| last=Miyashiro |first=Marie R. |year=2011 |publisher=Puddledancer Press|isbn=978-1-892005-25-0|page=256}}</ref> In studies by the Management Research Group, empathy was found to be the strongest predictor of ethical leadership behavior out of 22 competencies in its management model, and empathy was one of the three strongest predictors of senior executive effectiveness.<ref name=FinancialPost20130621>{{cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/21/forget-ethics-training-focus-on-empathy/ |title=Forget ethics training: Focus on empathy |last=Dowden |first=Craig |date=June 21, 2013 |website=The National Post |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ILr5ZAXa?url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/21/forget-ethics-training-focus-on-empathy/ |archivedate=July 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n== Measurement ==\nResearch into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.\n\nResearchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.\n\nBehavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax.<ref>Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact.

Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced.<ref name=egLevensonRuef1992Leslieetal2004>e.g. {{cite journal |author1=Levenson R.

Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of \"emotional contagion\" or mirroring.<ref name=egLevensonRuef1992Leslieetal2004/> These reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking (\"if I were him I would feel&nbsp;...\").\n\nPaper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy;<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Geher|Warner|Brown|2001}}</ref> scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form.<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Mehrabian|Epstein|1972}}</ref> Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates.<ref>e.g. {{cite journal | author = Davis M.

These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geher|first1=G. |last2=Warner|first2=R.

He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another, researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things. He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon \"empathy\"; a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Duan C. |author2=Hill C.

It was found that the bonobos sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.\n\nEmpathic-like responding has been observed in [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110\u201312115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|pmid=20547864|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R |pmc=2901437}}</ref> The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.\n\nIt is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537\u2013544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005}}</ref> The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads. Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.\n\n[[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851\u2013859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|pages=851\u2013859|pmid=22644113|url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/7074/2/Custance_and_Mayer_draft_prior_to_publication.pdf}}</ref> When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.\n\nWhen witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223\u2013229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004}}</ref> found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.\n\nAt the same time, humans can empathize with other species. A study by Miralles et al. (2019) showed that human empathic perceptions (and compassionate reactions) toward an extended sampling of organisms are strongly negatively correlated with the divergence time separating them from us. In other words, the more phylogenetically close a species is to us, the more likely we are to feel empathy and compasion towards it.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miralles |first1=Aur\u00e9lien |last2=Raymond |first2=Michel |last3=Lecointre |first3=Guillaume |title=Empathy and compassion toward other species decrease with evolutionary divergence time |journal=Scientific Reports |date=20 December 2019 |volume=9 |issue=19555 |pages=19555 |doi=10.1038/s41598-019-56006-9|pmid=31862944 |pmc=6925286 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Artificial empathy]]\n* [[Attribution (psychology)]]\n* [[Digital empathy]]\n* [[Emotional contagion]]\n* [[Emotional intelligence]]\n* [[Emotional literacy]]\n* [[Empathic concern]]\n* [[Empathizing\u2013systemizing theory]]\n* [[Ethnocultural empathy]]\n* [[Fake empathy]]\n* [[Grounding in communication]]\n* [[Highly sensitive person]]\n* [[Humanistic coefficient]]\n* [[Identification (psychology)]]\n* [[Life skills]]\n* [[Mimpathy]]\n* [[Moral emotions]]\n* [[Nonviolent Communication]]\n* [[Oxytocin]]\n* [[People skills]]\n* [[Philip K.

He is a laureate of multiple literary awards including the [[Russian Little Booker Prize]] (1993) and the Russian National Bestseller (2004). His books are multi-layered [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] texts fusing elements of [[Popular culture|pop culture]] and [[Esotericism|esoteric philosophies]] while carrying conventions of the [[science fiction]] genre. Some critics relate his prose to the [[New Sincerity]] literary movement.<ref>[http://thisislike.com/victor-pelevin-writer/similar/ Victor Pelevin on This Is Like]</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nVictor Olegovich Pelevin was born in Moscow on 22 November 1962 to Zinaida Semenovna Efremova, an English teacher, and Oleg Anatolyevich Pelevin, a teacher at the military department of [[Bauman MSTU|Bauman University]]. He lived on [[Tverskoy Boulevard]] in Moscow, later moving to Chertanovo. In 1979 Pelevin graduated from an elite high school with a special English program located on Stanislavskogo Street in the centre of Moscow, now Kaptsov Gymnasium #1520.\n\nHe then attended the [[Moscow Power Engineering Institute]] (MPEI) graduating with a degree in electromechanical engineering in 1985. In April of that year MPEI Department of Electrical Transport hired him as engineer.  Pelevin served in the [[Russian Air Force]]. From 1987 to 1989 Pelevin attended the MPEI graduate school.\n\nPelevin is often in the east. He has been to Nepal, South Korea, China and Japan. While he does not call himself a Buddhist, he is engaged in Buddhist practices. Pelevin has repeatedly said that despite the fact that his characters use drugs, he is not an addict even though he has experimented with mind-expanding substances in his youth. Pelevin is not married. As of the beginning of the 2000s, he lived in Australia .\n\n==Literary career==\nIn 1989 Pelevin attended Mikhail Lobanov's creative writing seminar at [[Maxim Gorky Literary Institute]]. While studying at the Institute Pelevin met the young novelist Albert Egazarov and the poet Victor Kulle, later a literary critic. Pelevin was expelled from the Institute in 1991. Egazarov and Kulle went on to found a publishing house, first called ''The Day'', then ''The Raven'' and ''Myth'', for which Pelevin has edited three volumes of [[Carlos Castaneda]]'s work.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1990 Pelevin worked as a staff reporter of the magazine Face to Face. In 1989 he also began to work in the journal ''Nauka i Religiya'' (Science and Religion), where he edited a series of articles on eastern [[mysticism]]. In 1989 ''Nauka i Religiya'' published Pelevin's first short story \"Ignat the Sorcerer and the People\".\n\nIn 1992 Pelevin published his first collection of stories ''The Blue Lantern''. A year later it received the Russian Little Booker Prize. In 1994 it received InterPressCon and the Bronze Snail awards. In March 1992 Pelevin published his first novel ''[[Omon Ra]]'' in the literary journal ''[[Znamya]]''. The novel attracted the attention of literary critics and was nominated for the Booker Prize. In April 1993, the same journal published Pelevin's next novel ''The Life of Insects''. In 1993 Pelevin published an essay \"John Fowles and the tragedy of Russian liberalism\" in [[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]]. The essay was the writer's answer to some negative critics reaction to his work.

He lived on [[Tverskoy Boulevard]] in Moscow, later moving to Chertanovo. In 1979 Pelevin graduated from an elite high school with a special English program located on Stanislavskogo Street in the centre of Moscow, now Kaptsov Gymnasium #1520.\n\nHe then attended the [[Moscow Power Engineering Institute]] (MPEI) graduating with a degree in electromechanical engineering in 1985. In April of that year MPEI Department of Electrical Transport hired him as engineer.  Pelevin served in the [[Russian Air Force]]. From 1987 to 1989 Pelevin attended the MPEI graduate school.\n\nPelevin is often in the east. He has been to Nepal, South Korea, China and Japan. While he does not call himself a Buddhist, he is engaged in Buddhist practices. Pelevin has repeatedly said that despite the fact that his characters use drugs, he is not an addict even though he has experimented with mind-expanding substances in his youth. Pelevin is not married. As of the beginning of the 2000s, he lived in Australia .\n\n==Literary career==\nIn 1989 Pelevin attended Mikhail Lobanov's creative writing seminar at [[Maxim Gorky Literary Institute]]. While studying at the Institute Pelevin met the young novelist Albert Egazarov and the poet Victor Kulle, later a literary critic. Pelevin was expelled from the Institute in 1991. Egazarov and Kulle went on to found a publishing house, first called ''The Day'', then ''The Raven'' and ''Myth'', for which Pelevin has edited three volumes of [[Carlos Castaneda]]'s work.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1990 Pelevin worked as a staff reporter of the magazine Face to Face. In 1989 he also began to work in the journal ''Nauka i Religiya'' (Science and Religion), where he edited a series of articles on eastern [[mysticism]]. In 1989 ''Nauka i Religiya'' published Pelevin's first short story \"Ignat the Sorcerer and the People\".\n\nIn 1992 Pelevin published his first collection of stories ''The Blue Lantern''. A year later it received the Russian Little Booker Prize. In 1994 it received InterPressCon and the Bronze Snail awards. In March 1992 Pelevin published his first novel ''[[Omon Ra]]'' in the literary journal ''[[Znamya]]''. The novel attracted the attention of literary critics and was nominated for the Booker Prize. In April 1993, the same journal published Pelevin's next novel ''The Life of Insects''. In 1993 Pelevin published an essay \"John Fowles and the tragedy of Russian liberalism\" in [[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]]. The essay was the writer's answer to some negative critics reaction to his work. In the same year Pelevin was admitted to the Russian Union of Journalists.\n\nIn 1996, Pelevin participated in the [[International Writing Program]] residency at the University of Iowa.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/writers/viktor-olegovich-pelevin |website=International Writing Program |accessdate=12 June 2019}}</ref> That same year, Znamya published Pelevin's novel ''Chapayev and Void''. Critics called it \"the first [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] novel in Russian\". The writer himself called it \"the first novel which takes place in an absolute vacuum\". In 1997 the novel won Russia's Strannik Award for science fiction, and in 2001 it was shortlisted for the [[International Dublin Literary Award]].\n\nIn 1999, Pelevin's novel ''Generation P'' was published. Over 3.5 million copies have been sold worldwide. The book received a number of awards including Germany's Richard Schoenfeld prize.\n\nIn 2003 Pelevin published the novel ''The Dialectics of Transition Period from Out Of Nowhere to Nowhere'' or ''DTP (NN)'', receiving the [[Apollon Grigoryev]] Prize in 2003 and the National Bestseller award in 2004. DTP (NN) was also shortlisted for the [[Andrei Bely Prize]] in 2003.\n\nIn 2006 [[Eksmo]] published Pelevin's novel ''Empire V''. The novel was shortlisted for the Russian [[Big Book (award)|Big Book]] award. The text of ''Empire V'' appeared on the Internet even before the publication of the novel. Representatives of Eksmo claimed that it was a result of a theft, but some speculated that it was a marketing ploy.\n\nIn October 2009 the novel ''t'' was published. The author received the third award of the fifth season of the Big Book award (2009-2010) and won the reader choice vote.\n\nIn December 2011, Eksmo released Pelevin's novel ''[[S.N.U.F.F.]]'' which received the E-book award for \"Prose of the Year\" in February 2012.\n\nLiterary critics have noted Pelevin's [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] and [[absurdism|absurdist]] styles, which incorporate Buddhist motifs, esoteric traditions, and satirical science fiction. Pelevin's books have been translated into many languages including Japanese and Chinese. According to a French magazine, Pelevin is among the 1,000 most significant people in the contemporary culture. A 2009 OpenSpace.ru survey voted Pelevin as the most influential intellectual in Russia.\n\nPelevin is known for not being a part of the literary crowd, rarely appearing in public or giving interviews and preferring to communicate on the internet. When he gives interviews he talks more about the nature of mind rather than his writings. This has given grounds to various rumors. For instance, it has been suggested that the writer does not exist and Pelevin is actually a code name for a group of authors or even a computer. The journalist [[Alexander Gordon (journalist)|Alexander Gordon]] is one of the people who has questioned the very existence of the writer Pelevin. In May 2011 it was reported that Pelevin would personally attend the award ceremony SuperNatsBest, which would have been the writer's first appearance in public. However, he did not come.\n\nPelevin has permitted all of his texts in Russian predating 2009 (except ''P5'') to be published on the Internet for non-commercial use. Some novels are also available as audio files in Russian.\n\n==Literary style==\nPelevin's prose is usually devoid of dialogue between the author and the reader, whether through [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[fictional character|character]] development, literary form or narrative language. This corresponds to his philosophy (both stated{{Where|date=July 2011}} and unstated) that, for the most part, it is the reader who infuses the text with meaning. Typical of Pelevin's ironic style, the novel ''Babylon'' (\"Generation \u041f\" or \"Generation P\" is the Russian title) bears on its cover the inscription, \"Any thought that occurs in the process of reading this book is subject to copyright.
