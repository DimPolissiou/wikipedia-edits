They are generally a dark brown when viewed from above, with a creamy white-brown underside. Individual coloration may vary, with some bugs being various shades of red, grey, light brown, copper, or black. The term \"marmorated\" means variegated or veined, like [[marble]],<ref>{{Cite OED|marmorate|date=2000}}</ref> which refers to the markings unique to this species, includes alternating light-colored bands on the antennae and alternating dark bands on the thin outer edge of the abdomen. The legs are brown with faint white mottling or banding.<ref name=\"Rice2014\"/> \n\nThe nymph stages are black or very dark brown, with red [[integument]] between the [[sclerites]]. First instar nymphs have no white markings, but second through fifth instar nymphs have black antennae with a single white band. The legs of nymphs are black with varying amounts of white banding.<ref name=\"Rice2014\"/> Freshly [[Ecdysis|molted]] individuals of all stages are pale white with red markings. Eggs are normally laid on the underside of leaves in masses of 28 eggs, and are light green when laid, gradually turning white.<ref name=\"Rice2014\"/> \n\nLike all stink bugs, the glands the produce the defensive chemicals (the \"stink\") are located on the underside of the thorax, between the first and second pair of legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgic.umd.edu/content/documents/BrownMarmoratedStinkBug.pdf|title=Entomological Notes: Brown Marmorated Stink Bug|last=Jacobs|first=Steven B.|date=May 2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Department of Agriculture|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007061426/http://www.hgic.umd.edu/content/documents/BrownMarmoratedStinkBug.pdf|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=July 1, 2011|df=mdy}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Insights-into-the-Saliva-of-the-Brown-Marmorated-Stink-Bug-Halyomorpha-halys-(Hemiptera-pone.0088483.s005.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=24|A brown marmorated stink bug on a [[tomato]] fruit]]The odor from the stink bug is due to trans-2-decenal and trans-2-octenal.<ref name=\"Henderson\">{{Cite conference|first1= Will  |last1= Henderson|first2= Ahmad |last2= Khalilian|first3= Young |last3= Han|title = Detecting Stink Bugs/Damage in Cotton Utilizing a Portable Electronic Nose|booktitle =|pages =|publisher = [[Clemson University]]|date = July 9\u201312, 2006|location = Oregon Convention Center; Portland, Oregon|url = http://www.clemson.edu/precisionag/Stink%20Bug.pdf|doi =\n|id =|accessdate = March 24, 2010}}</ref> The smell has been characterized as a \"pungent odor that smells like [[cilantro]].\"<ref name=\"newshour2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/fighting-the-stink-bug|title=Stink Bug Invasion: Is a Wasp the Solution to Save Valued Crops?|date=May 24, 2011|publisher=[[PBS NewsHour]]|accessdate=May 25, 2011}}</ref> The stink bug's ability to emit an odor through holes in its abdomen is a defense mechanism meant to prevent it from being eaten by birds and lizards. However, simply handling the bug, injuring it, or attempting to move it can trigger it to release the odor.\n\nDuring courtship, the male emits [[pheromone]]s and [[Seismic communication|vibrational signals]] to communicate with a female, which replies with her own vibrational signals, as in all stink bugs. The insects use the signals to recognize and locate each other. Vibrational signals of this species are noted for their low [[frequency]], and one male signal type is much longer than any other previously described signals in stink bugs, although the significance of this is not yet clear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Polajnar, Jernej |display-authors=etal |year=2016 |title=Vibrational communication of the brown marmorated stink bug (''Halyomorpha halys'') |journal=Physiological Entomology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=249\u2013259 |doi=10.1111/phen.12150}}</ref>\n\nThe brown marmorated stink bug is a sucking insect (like all [[Hemiptera]] or \"true bugs\") that uses its proboscis to pierce the host plant to feed. This feeding results, in part, in the formation of [[Cat-facing|dimpled]] or necrotic areas on the outer surface of fruits, [[leaf]] stippling, [[seed]] loss, and possible transmission of plant [[pathogen]]s. It is an [[agricultural pest]] that can cause widespread damage to fruit and vegetable crops. In Japan, it is a pest to [[soybean]] and fruit crops. In the U.S., the brown marmorated stink bug feeds, beginning in late May or early June, on a wide range of fruits, vegetables, and other host plants including [[peach]]es, [[apple]]s, [[green bean]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[cherries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[pear]]s.\n\n==In North America==\n[[File:Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (Halyomorpha halys) US Distribution.gif|thumb|Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (''Halyomorpha halys'') US Distribution]]\nThe brown marmorated stink bug was accidentally introduced into the United States from China or Japan.

They feed on a wide array of plants including apples, apricots, Asian pears, cherries, corn, grapes, lima beans, peaches, peppers, tomatoes, and soybeans.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Brown Marmorated Stink Bug|url = http://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/brown-marmorated-stink-bug |website= www.epa.gov |accessdate = December 8, 2015|authors =US EPA, OCSPP, OPP, FEAD}}</ref> This makes them extremely versatile, as they do not require a specific plant on which to feed. To obtain their food, stink bugs use their stylets to pierce the plant tissue to extract the plant fluids.<ref name=\":1\">McPherson, J. E., and R. M. McPherson. 2000. Stink Bugs of Economic Importance in America\nNorth of Mexico, Boca Raton, FL. 253 pp.</ref> In doing so, the plant loses necessary fluids, which can lead to deformation of seeds, destruction of seeds, destruction of fruiting structures, delayed plant maturation, and increased vulnerability to harmful pathogens.<ref name=\":1\" /> While harvesting the plant's juices, the stink bug injects saliva into the plant, creating a dimpling of the fruit's surface and rotting of the material underneath.\n\nThe most common signs of stink bug damage are pitting and scarring of the fruit, leaf destruction, and a mealy texture to the harvested fruits and vegetables. In most cases, the signs of stink bug damage makes the plant unsuitable for sale in the market, as the insides are usually rotten. In field crops such as corn and soybeans, the damage may not be as evident as the damage seen in fruit plants. When stink bugs feed on corn, they go through the husk before eating the kernels, hiding the damage until the husks are removed during harvesting. The same damage is seen in soybeans, as the stink bug goes through the seed pods to acquire the juices of the seeds. One visual cue of stink-bug damage to soybean crops is the \"stay green\" effect, where damaged soybean plants stay green late into season, while other plants in the field die off normally. One can usually tell that a field of crops is infected because stink bugs are known for the \"edge effect\", in which they tend to infest crops 30\u201340&nbsp;ft from the edge of the field. Farmers who suspect having stink bugs in their crops should contact their respective departments of agriculture for information on how to manage the infestation and possible ways to prevent future incidences.\n\n=== Control ===\nControl of stink bugs is a priority of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], which has developed an artificial pheromone which can be used to bait traps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/11/07/shedding-new-light-stink-bug-invasion|title=Shedding New Light on Stink Bug Invasion {{!}} USDA|last=Durham|first=Sharon|date=2017-11-07|website=www.usda.gov|publisher=[[Agricultural Research Service]]|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720222626/https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/11/07/shedding-new-light-stink-bug-invasion|archive-date=2018-07-20|url-status=|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2014/usda-researchers-identify-stink-bug-attractant/|title=USDA Researchers Identify Stink Bug Attractant|last=O'Brien|first=Dennis|date=2019-07-16|website=www.ars.usda.gov|publisher=[[Agricultural Research Service]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206221004/https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2014/usda-researchers-identify-stink-bug-attractant/|archive-date=2017-02-06|url-status=|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> Because the bugs insert their probosces below the surface of fruit and then feed, some insecticides are ineffective; in addition, the bugs are mobile, and a new population may fly in after the resident population has been killed, making permanent removal nearly impossible. In the case of soybean infestations, spraying only the perimeter of a field may be the most effective method of preventing stinkbugs from damaging the crops. However, even this method is limited, as new populations move back into the area, or the existing population simply moves to unaffected areas. Evidence also shows that stink bugs are developing a resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, a common chemical used to combat infestations.<ref name=\":2\" /> Other insecticides currently in field trials that are showing promising results are oxamyl (96% mortality rate) and moribund (67% mortality rate).<ref name=\":2\" /> Many other commonly used insecticides are merely used to keep the insects out of fields, rather than actually killing them.

It is an [[agricultural pest]] that can cause widespread damage to fruit and vegetable crops. In Japan, it is a pest to [[soybean]] and fruit crops. In the U.S., the brown marmorated stink bug feeds, beginning in late May or early June, on a wide range of fruits, vegetables, and other host plants including [[peach]]es, [[apple]]s, [[green bean]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[cherries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[pear]]s.\n\n==In North America==\n[[File:Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (Halyomorpha halys) US Distribution.gif|thumb|Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (''Halyomorpha halys'') US Distribution]]\nThe brown marmorated stink bug was accidentally introduced into the United States from China or Japan.

They feed on a wide array of plants including apples, apricots, Asian pears, cherries, corn, grapes, lima beans, peaches, peppers, tomatoes, and soybeans.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Brown Marmorated Stink Bug|url = http://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/brown-marmorated-stink-bug |website= www.epa.gov |accessdate = December 8, 2015|authors =US EPA, OCSPP, OPP, FEAD}}</ref> This makes them extremely versatile, as they do not require a specific plant on which to feed. To obtain their food, stink bugs use their stylets to pierce the plant tissue to extract the plant fluids.<ref name=\":1\">McPherson, J. E., and R. M. McPherson. 2000. Stink Bugs of Economic Importance in America\nNorth of Mexico, Boca Raton, FL. 253 pp.</ref> In doing so, the plant loses necessary fluids, which can lead to deformation of seeds, destruction of seeds, destruction of fruiting structures, delayed plant maturation, and increased vulnerability to harmful pathogens.<ref name=\":1\" /> While harvesting the plant's juices, the stink bug injects saliva into the plant, creating a dimpling of the fruit's surface and rotting of the material underneath.\n\nThe most common signs of stink bug damage are pitting and scarring of the fruit, leaf destruction, and a mealy texture to the harvested fruits and vegetables. In most cases, the signs of stink bug damage makes the plant unsuitable for sale in the market, as the insides are usually rotten. In field crops such as corn and soybeans, the damage may not be as evident as the damage seen in fruit plants. When stink bugs feed on corn, they go through the husk before eating the kernels, hiding the damage until the husks are removed during harvesting. The same damage is seen in soybeans, as the stink bug goes through the seed pods to acquire the juices of the seeds. One visual cue of stink-bug damage to soybean crops is the \"stay green\" effect, where damaged soybean plants stay green late into season, while other plants in the field die off normally. One can usually tell that a field of crops is infected because stink bugs are known for the \"edge effect\", in which they tend to infest crops 30\u201340&nbsp;ft from the edge of the field. Farmers who suspect having stink bugs in their crops should contact their respective departments of agriculture for information on how to manage the infestation and possible ways to prevent future incidences.\n\n===Control===\n\nControl of stink bugs is a priority of the U.S. [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], which has developed an artificial pheromone which can be used to bait traps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/11/07/shedding-new-light-stink-bug-invasion|title=Shedding New Light on Stink Bug Invasion {{!}} USDA|last=Durham|first=Sharon|date=2017-11-07|website=www.usda.gov|publisher=[[Agricultural Research Service]]|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720222626/https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/11/07/shedding-new-light-stink-bug-invasion|archive-date=2018-07-20|url-status=|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2014/usda-researchers-identify-stink-bug-attractant/|title=USDA Researchers Identify Stink Bug Attractant|last=O'Brien|first=Dennis|date=2019-07-16|website=www.ars.usda.gov|publisher=[[Agricultural Research Service]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206221004/https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2014/usda-researchers-identify-stink-bug-attractant/|archive-date=2017-02-06|url-status=|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> Because the bugs insert their probosces below the surface of fruit and then feed, some insecticides are ineffective; in addition, the bugs are mobile, and a new population may fly in after the resident population has been killed, making permanent removal nearly impossible. In the case of soybean infestations, spraying only the perimeter of a field may be the most effective method of preventing stinkbugs from damaging the crops. However, even this method is limited, as new populations move back into the area, or the existing population simply moves to unaffected areas. Evidence also shows that stink bugs are developing a resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, a common chemical used to combat infestations.<ref name=\":2\"/> Other insecticides currently in field trials that are showing promising results are oxamyl (96% mortality rate) and moribund (67% mortality rate).<ref name=\":2\"/> Many other commonly used insecticides are merely used to keep the insects out of fields, rather than actually killing them.

In December of 1941 she became a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[hospital ship]]. The [[Empire of Japan]] shortly after her conversion stole the ship and renamed her the '''HMHS ''Tenno Maru'''''.

They was for day passenger a [[Tweendeck]] and a [[cafeteria]].\n\n==World war 2==\nWith the outbreak of [[World war 2]] the SS ''Op Ten Noort'' was taken over by the Royal Dutch Navy in December of 1941 as she docked in Jakarta. There she was refit into a hospital ship. She was painted all white ship, with huge red crosses. The Dutch Government officially reported the [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] at the [[Swedish embassy]] in [[Tokyo]] of the change to SS ''Op Ten Noort''. She was now an operational hospital ship, as thus would not be part of the war effort, that is would not transport any weapons or active troops.

After repairs, on 28 February 1942 she was commandeered by the [[Japanese destroyer Amatsukaze (1939)|Japanese destroyer Amatsukaze]] near [[Bawean Island]], stopping her rescue work again.

Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

This [[functional group]] consists of a [[carbonyl]] group flanked by two [[alkoxy]] groups. The general structure of these carbonates is R<sub>1</sub>O(C=O)OR<sub>2</sub> and they are related to [[ester]]s R<sub>1</sub>O(C=O)R, [[ether]]s R<sub>1</sub>OR<sub>2</sub> and also to the [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[carbonate]]s.\n\nMonomers of [[polycarbonate]] (e.g. Lexan) are linked by carbonate groups.

The unique O=C bond is short (1.173 \u00c5 in the depicted example), while the C-O bonds are more ether-like (the bond distances of 1.326 \u00c5 for the example depicted).<ref name=Perez>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ma00167a014|title=Crystalline features of 4,4'-isopropylidenediphenylbis(phenyl carbonate) and conformational analysis of the polycarbonate of 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane|journal=Macromolecules|volume=20|issue=1|pages=68\u201377|year=1987|last1=Perez|first1=Serge|last2=Scaringe|first2=Raymond P.|bibcode=1987MaMol..20...68P}}</ref>\n\nCarbonate esters can be divided into three structural classes: acyclic, cyclic, and polymeric. The first and general case is the acyclic carbonate group.  Organic substituents can be identical or not.  Both aliphatic or aromatic substituents are known, they are called dialkyl or diaryl carbonates, respectively. The simplest members of these classes are [[dimethyl carbonate]] and [[diphenyl carbonate]].\n\nAlternatively, the carbonate groups can be linked by a 2- or 3-carbon bridge, forming cyclic compounds such as [[ethylene carbonate]] and [[trimethylene carbonate]]. The bridging compound can also have substituents, e.g. CH<sub>3</sub> for [[propylene carbonate]]. Instead of terminal alkyl or aryl groups, two carbonate groups can be linked by an aliphatic or aromatic bifunctional group.\n\nA third family of carbonates are the polymers, such as [[poly(propylene carbonate)]] and [[poly(bisphenol A carbonate)]] (Lexan).\n\n==Preparation==\nOrganic carbonates are not prepared from inorganic carbonate salts.  \nTwo main routes to carbonate esters are practiced: the reaction of an alcohol (or phenol) with [[phosgene]] (phosgenation), and the reaction of an alcohol with [[carbon monoxide]] and an oxidizer ([[oxidative carbonylation]]).  Other carbonate esters may subsequently be prepared by [[transesterification]].<ref name=\"Shaikh1996\">{{cite journal|last=Shaikh|first=Abbas-Alli G.|author2=Swaminathan Sivaram|year=1996|title=Organic Carbonates|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=96|issue=3|pages=951\u2013976|doi=10.1021/cr950067i|pmid=11848777}}</ref><ref name = ullmann>{{Ullmann| doi = 10.1002/14356007.a05_197 | isbn = 3527306730 | title= Carbonic Esters |  year = 2012 | last1 = Buysch | first1 = Hans-Josef }}</ref>\n\nIn principle carbonate esters can be prepared by direct [[condensation]] of [[methanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]].

The unique O=C bond is short (1.173 \u00c5 in the depicted example), while the C-O bonds are more ether-like (the bond distances of 1.326 \u00c5 for the example depicted).<ref name=Perez>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ma00167a014|title=Crystalline features of 4,4'-isopropylidenediphenylbis(phenyl carbonate) and conformational analysis of the polycarbonate of 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane|journal=Macromolecules|volume=20|issue=1|pages=68\u201377|year=1987|last1=Perez|first1=Serge|last2=Scaringe|first2=Raymond P.|bibcode=1987MaMol..20...68P}}</ref>\n\nCarbonate esters can be divided into three structural classes: acyclic, cyclic, and polymeric. The first and general case is the acyclic carbonate group.  Organic substituents can be identical or not.  Both aliphatic or aromatic substituents are known, they are called dialkyl or diaryl carbonates, respectively. The simplest members of these classes are [[dimethyl carbonate]] and [[diphenyl carbonate]]. \n\nAlternatively, the carbonate groups can be linked by a 2- or 3-carbon bridge, forming cyclic compounds such as [[ethylene carbonate]] and [[trimethylene carbonate]]. The bridging compound can also have substituents, e.g. CH<sub>3</sub> for [[propylene carbonate]]. Instead of terminal alkyl or aryl groups, two carbonate groups can be linked by an aliphatic or aromatic bifunctional group.\n\nA third family of carbonates are the polymers, such as [[poly(propylene carbonate)]] and [[poly(bisphenol A carbonate)]] (Lexan).\n\n==Preparation==\nOrganic carbonates are not prepared from inorganic carbonate salts.  \nTwo main routes to carbonate esters are practiced: the reaction of an alcohol (or phenol) with [[phosgene]] (phosgenation), and the reaction of an alcohol with [[carbon monoxide]] and an oxidizer ([[oxidative carbonylation]]).  Other carbonate esters may subsequently be prepared by [[transesterification]].<ref name=\"Shaikh1996\">{{cite journal|last=Shaikh|first=Abbas-Alli G.|author2=Swaminathan Sivaram|year=1996|title=Organic Carbonates|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=96|issue=3|pages=951\u2013976|doi=10.1021/cr950067i|pmid=11848777}}</ref><ref name = ullmann>{{Ullmann| doi = 10.1002/14356007.a05_197 | isbn = 3527306730 | title= Carbonic Esters |  year = 2012 | last1 = Buysch | first1 = Hans-Josef }}</ref>\n\nIn principle carbonate esters can be prepared by direct [[condensation]] of [[methanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]].

The Clark is known as the \"Baby Nobel\" in economics because around a third of the medalists have gone on to win the Nobel, the average age of whose laureates approaches 70 when they were awarded the prize. Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the ''[[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]]'' (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Nakahara Prize]]'' (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Gossen Prize]]'' (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the ''[[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]]'' (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the ''[[Assar Lindbeck Medal]]'' (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/><ref name=shanghairanking2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey-2017/awards.html|title=ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref name=shanghairanking2017/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

The recipient must be a member of one of the two societies. In 1967, these two prizes were established at the same time. The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting. Now they are usually awarded at joint mathematics meetings.\n}}</small>\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli Prize|Kavli Prize <small>in Astrophysics</small>]] (2008)<ref name=kavli1>{{cite web|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/chancellor-fall.html|title=Fall Quarter greetings|website=ucsc.edu|date=27 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=kavli2>{{cite web|author=Ham Chau|url=https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/special-reports/128401/internationally-famous-vietnamese-scientists.html |title=Internationally famous Vietnamese scientists|website=English.vietnamnet.vn|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=ambartsumian>{{cite journal |date=1 December 2009 |title=New international prize commemorates Viktor Ambartsumian|url=https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/50/6/6.6/192554|journal=Astronomy & Geophysics|volume=50|issue=6|pages=6.6 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4004.2009.50604_10.x|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Gruber Prize in Cosmology|Gruber Prize <small>in Cosmology</small>]] (2000)<ref name=ambartsumian/><ref name=gruber1>{{cite web|url=https://science.tamu.edu/news/2007/07/texas-am-physicist-shares-in-500000-gruber-cosmology-prize/|title=Texas A&M Physicist Shares in $500,000 Gruber Cosmology Prize|website=tamu.edu|date=17 July 2007}}</ref>\n* [[Crafoord Prize|Crafoord Prize <small>in Astronomy</small>]] (1985)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/story/prof-eugene-parker-wins-prestigious-crafoord-prize-astronomy|title=Prof. Eugene Parker wins prestigious Crafoord Prize in Astronomy|website=uchicago.edu|author=Louise Lerner|date=30 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=55209|title=Crafoord Prize in Astronomy to Solar Wind Discoverer Eugene Parker|website=spaceref.com|date=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Shaw Prize|Shaw Prize <small>in Astronomy</small>]] (2004)<ref name=shaw1>{{cite web|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2006/06/21/berkeley-labs-saul-perlmutter-wins-shaw-prize-in-astronomy/|title=Berkeley Lab's Saul Perlmutter Wins Shaw Prize in Astronomy|date=21 June 2006|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=shaw2>{{cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/solana-beach/article_3b3d1a4d-261f-5ed0-9277-6d84554b28d9.html|title=Solana Beach: Astronomy researcher gets $1 million Shaw Prize|date=17 June 2009|work=[[North County Times]]|accessdate=20 November 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117150938/http://nctimes.com/news/local/solana-beach/article_3b3d1a4d-261f-5ed0-9277-6d84554b28d9.html|archivedate=17 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=shaw3>{{cite web|url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/astronomer-john-hawley-wins-2013-shaw-prize-astronomy|title=ASTRONOMER JOHN HAWLEY WINS 2013 SHAW PRIZE IN ASTRONOMY|date=29 May 2013|website=virginia.edu|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=shaw4>{{cite web|url=https://www.asianscientist.com/2014/05/topnews/scientists-honored-2014-shaw-prize-2014/|title=Six Scientists Honored With 2014 Shaw Prize|date=29 May 2014|website=asianscientist.com|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n''See also [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] (1824), [[Bruce Medal]] (1898), [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics]] (1980), [[Viktor Ambartsumian#Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize|Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize]] (2010).''\n}}</small>\n\n====Automation/control/cybernetics====\n* [[IEEE Control Systems Award]] (1982)<ref name=shanghairanking2018>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/Methodology-for-ShanghaiRanking-Global-Ranking-of-Academic-Subjects-2018.html|title=Methodology for ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2018|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>  \n* Giorgio Quazza Medal (1981)<ref name=controlhistory>{{cite web|url=https://portal.research.lu.se/ws/files/49560469/TFRT_7561.pdf|title=Projects in History of Automatic Control|website=lu.se|author=Karl Henrik Johansson, Karl Johan \u00c5str\u00f6m|date=June 1997\n}}</ref>  \n* Hendrik W.

Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the ''[[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]]'' (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Nakahara Prize]]'' (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Gossen Prize]]'' (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the ''[[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]]'' (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the ''[[Assar Lindbeck Medal]]'' (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/><ref name=shanghairanking2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey-2017/awards.html|title=ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref name=shanghairanking2017/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

They are harassed by a cruel, [[Drug dealer|drug-dealer]] [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.\n\nSaeed comes across a strange young woman in a [[chador]] at night. She seduces Saeed to take her back to his apartment. While there, she grows long [[fang]]s and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his [[Lock and key|car keys]] along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a [[costume party]] at a [[Nightclub|night club]] dressed up as [[Count Dracula|Dracula]], where he is seduced by Shaydah into taking one of the [[MDMA|ecstasy]] pills he is selling. Under the influence, he is rejected by her, and ends up lost at night on the street.\n\nThe woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, [[skateboarding]], or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and \u2013 at her request \u2013 pierces her ears with a [[safety pin]], but she eventually leaves.\n\nAtti, a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.\n\nSuffering from [[heroin withdrawal]], Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.\n\nThe following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and undecided about what to do. He eventually gets back in the car and the two continue their trip onwards.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sheila Vand]] as The Girl\n* Arash Marandi as Arash\n* [[Marshall Manesh]] as Hossein\n* [[Dominic Rains]] as Saeed\n* [[Mozhan Marn\u00f2]] as Atti\n* Rome Shadanloo as Shaydah  \n* Masuka as the cat<ref>{{cite web|title=Credits at end of film, and cast list on IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2326554}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nAn early short film with the same title from Amirpour screened at festivals and won Best Short Film at the [[Noor Iranian Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noorfilmfestival.com/index.php/2012-festival-awards|title=2012 NIFF Award Winners|publisher=Noor Iranian Film Festival (NIFF) official website|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Indiegogo]] campaign was launched in July 2012 to fund the feature-length version of the film.

They are harassed by a cruel, [[Drug dealer|drug-dealer]] [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.\n\nSaeed comes across a strange young woman in a [[chador]] at night. She seduces Saeed to take her back to his apartment. While there, she grows long [[fang]]s and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his [[Lock and key|car keys]] along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a [[costume party]] at a [[Nightclub|night club]] dressed up as [[Count Dracula|Dracula]], where he is seduced by Shaydah into taking one of the [[MDMA|ecstasy]] pills he is selling. Under the influence, he is rejected by her, and ends up lost at night on the street.\n\nThe woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, [[skateboarding]], or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and \u2013 at her request \u2013 pierces her ears with a [[safety pin]], but she eventually leaves.\n\nAtti, a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.\n\nSuffering from [[heroin withdrawal]], Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.\n\nThe following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and undecided about what to do. He eventually gets back in the car and the two continue their trip onwards.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sheila Vand]] as The Girl\n* Arash Marandi as Arash\n* [[Marshall Manesh]] as Hossein\n* [[Dominic Rains]] as Saeed\n* [[Mozhan Marn\u00f2]] as Atti\n* Rome Shadanloo as Shaydah  \n* Masuka as the cat<ref>{{cite web|title=Credits at end of film, and cast list on IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2326554}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nAn early short film with the same title from Amirpour screened at festivals and won Best Short Film at the [[Noor Iranian Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noorfilmfestival.com/index.php/2012-festival-awards|title=2012 NIFF Award Winners|publisher=Noor Iranian Film Festival (NIFF) official website|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Indiegogo]] campaign was launched in July 2012 to fund the feature-length version of the film.
