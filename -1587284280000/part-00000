The term ''[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]'' is often used to make this distinction. \"Vanilla ''[[Battlefield 1942]]''\", for example, refers to the original, unmodified game.\n\nAs early as the 1980s, video game mods have also been used for the sole purpose of creating art, as opposed to an actual game. This can include recording in-game actions as a film, as well as attempting to reproduce real-life areas inside a game with no regard for game play value. This has led to the rise of [[Video game art|artistic video game modification]], as well as [[machinima]] and the [[demoscene]].\n\nPopular games can have tens of thousands of mods created for them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dey |first1=Tapajit |last2=Massengill |first2=Jacob Logan |last3=Mockus |first3=Audris |title=Analysis of Popularity of Game Mods: A Case Study |journal=Proceedings of the 2016 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play |date=16 October 2016 |pages=133\u2013139 |doi=10.1145/2968120.2987724 |isbn=9781450344586 }}</ref>  Popular websites dedicated to modding include [[Nexus Mods]], [[GameBanana]], [[Mod DB]], and [[Steam Workshop]].\n\n==Development==\nMany mods are not publicly released to the gaming community by their creators.<ref name=Poor/> Some are very limited and just include some gameplay changes or even a different loading screen, while others are total conversions and can modify content and [[gameplay]] extensively.

Early commercial mod-making tools were the ''[[Boulder Dash|Boulder Dash Construction Kit]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Bard's Tale Construction Set]]'' (1991), which allowed users to create game designs in those series. Much more successful among early mod-making tools was the 1992 ''[[Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures]]'' from [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.]], which allowed users to construct games based on the game world that was launched with the ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'' game.\n\nBy the mid 1990s, modding tools were commonly offered with PC games,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burger-Helmchen |first1=Thierry|last2=Cohendet|first2=Patrick|title=User Communities and Social Software in the Video Game Industry |journal=Long Range Planning|date=October 2011|volume=44|issue=5\u20136|pages=317\u2013343|doi=10.1016/j.lrp.2011.09.003}}</ref> and by the early 2000s, a game that launched with no modding tools was considered more worthy of note in a review than one that did.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=Sarah |last2=Dyer-Witheford |first2=Nick |title=Playing on the digital commons: collectivities, capital and contestation in videogame culture |journal=[[Media, Culture & Society]] |date=2007 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=934\u2013953 |doi=10.1177/0163443707081700}}</ref> [[Maxis]] released the modding tools for ''[[The Sims]]'' (2000) before the game itself, resulting in a suite of fan-created mods being available at launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/65431/951-44-6448-6.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |page=68}}</ref>  The advertising campaign for ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' (2002) focused on the included [[Aurora toolset]].<ref name=\"auto7\"/> The [[Warcraft III World Editor|World Editor]] for ''[[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos|Warcraft III]]'' (2002) allowed a variety of custom scenarios or maps to be created for the game, such as a number of [[tower defense]] and [[multiplayer online battle arena]] maps, the most notable of which was ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fanbyte.com/features/modding-made-warcraft-immortal/|title=How Modding Made Warcraft III Immortal|date=2019-03-25|website=Fanbyte|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> The provision of tools is still seen as the most practical way that a company can signal to fans that its game is open for modding.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Poretski |first1=Lev |last2=Arazy |first2=Ofer |title=Placing Value on Community Co-creations: A Study of a Video Game 'Modding' Community |date=25 February 2017 |pages=480\u2013491 |doi=10.1145/2998181.2998301 |publisher=ACM|chapter=Placing Value on Community Co-creations |isbn=9781450343350 }}</ref>  Fans may also use and create [[open-source software]] tools for modding games.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite book |last1=Scacchi |first1=Walt |title=Modding as an Open Source Approach to Extending Computer Game Systems |journal=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology |volume=365 |date=2011 |pages=62\u201374 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24418-6_5 |language=en|isbn=978-3-642-24417-9 }}</ref>\n\nThere are also free content delivery tools available that make playing mods easier.

One such example is ''[[Homeworld 2]]'', which requires the program [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to build new in-game objects. However, there are free versions of Maya and other advanced modeling software available. There are also free and even [[open-source software|open-source]] modeling programs (such as [[Blender (software)|Blender]]) that can be used as well.\n\nFor advanced mods such as ''[[Desert Combat]]'' that are total conversions, complicated modeling and texturing software is required to make original content. Advanced mods can rival the complexity and work of making the original game content (short of the engine itself), rendering the differences in ease of modding small in comparison to the total amount of work required. Having an engine that is for example easy to import models to, is of little help when doing research, modeling, and making a photorealistic texture for a game item. As a result, other game characteristics such as its popularity and capabilities have a dominating effect on the number of mods created for the game by users.\n\nA game that allows modding is said to be \"moddable\". ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' as well as its predecessors, ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', are examples of highly moddable games, with an official editor available for download from the developer. ''[[Daggerfall]]'' was much less moddable, but some people released their own modifications nevertheless. Some modifications such as ''Gunslingers Academy'' have deliberately made the game more moddable by adding in scripting support or externalizing underlying code. ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' set out to be the 'most customisable game ever' and as such included a mod manager which allowed for modular modding, having several mods on at once.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nThe games industry is currently facing the question of how much it should embrace the players' contribution in creating new material for the game or mod-communities as part of their structure within the game. Some software companies openly accept and even encourage such communities. Others though have chosen to enclose their games in heavily policed copyright or Intellectual Property regimes(IPR) and close down sites that they see as infringing their ownership of a game.<ref>Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) \"Games: Technology, Industry, Culture\" in Terry Flew, New Media: an introduction (second edition), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101-114.</ref>\n\n===Portability issues===\nFor cross-platform games, mods written for the Windows version have not always been compatible with the Mac OS X and/or [[Linux]] ports of the game. In large part, this is due to the publisher's concern with prioritizing the porting of the primary game itself, when allocating resources for fixing the porting of mod-specific functions may not be cost-effective for the smaller market share of alternate platforms. For example, ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'', ported by [[Aspyr]] for Mac OS X, had file access issues specific to mods until the 1.61D patch. ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' does not have a working community mods menu for the Mac OS X version and, until the 3369 patch, had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such as ''Red Orchestra'' and ''Metaball''.\n\nAlso, mods compiled into platform-specific libraries, such as those of ''[[Doom 3]]'', are often only built for the Windows platform, leading to a lack of cross-platform compatibility even when the underlying game is highly portable. In the same line of reasoning, mod development tools are often available only on the Windows platform. [[id Software]]'s Doom 3 Radiant tool and [[Epic Games]]' [[UnrealEd]] are examples of this.\n\nMod teams that lack either the resources or know-how to develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code and art assets to individuals or groups who are able to port the mod.\n\nThe mod specialist site for Macs, [[Macologist]], has created GUI launchers and installers for many UT2004 mods, as well as solving cross-platform conversion issues for mods for other games.\n\n===Unforeseen consequences or benefits of modding===\nIn January 2005, it was reported that in ''[[The Sims 2]]'' (2004) modifications that changed item and game behavior were unexpectedly being transferred to other players through the official website's ''exchange'' feature, leading to changed game behavior without advance warning.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050305070257/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6857 Supernatural powers become contagious in PC game] by Will Knight, NewScientist, 7 January 2005</ref>\n\nAfter the Hot Coffee mod incident, there were calls from the industry to better control modders.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  There is concern about mods which show nudity, and Bestheda does not allow mods with nudity to be uploaded on its website.  Nexus allows for mods which allow nudity if breasts are not visible in the preview image.

This can also include adding revised dialog and music.\n\nExamples of overhaul mods include ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]: Revision'', which was given permission from publisher [[Square Enix]] to release on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] alongside the original game,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/13/9521011/deus-ex-revision-mod-release-steam|title=A massive overhaul for the original Deus Ex is now available on Steam|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2015-10-13|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V|GTA 5]] Redux'', which not only improves the original game's textures, but also adds a new weather system, visual effects, and adjusts the wanted system, weapons, and vehicle handling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/that-gorgeous-gta-5-graphics-overhaul-mod-is-final/1100-6443721/|title=That Gorgeous GTA 5 Graphics Overhaul Mod Is Finally Available|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2016-09-20|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref>\n\n===Randomizer===\nRandomizers are a type of user mod, typically atop games of the 8-bit and 16-bit generations, that keep the fundamental gameplay but randomize elements of the game to make it more of a challenge. Randomizers came out of the [[speedrunning]] community which had exhausted the challenge of racing through the game with one of the earliest being for ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' around 2015. In the ''Zelda'' randomizer, the mod moved the location of the dungeons, the layout of these dungeons, and the location of enemies in a random but procedurely generated manner (similar to [[roguelikes]]) based on a numerical seed, so that speedrunners would have to overcome these new changes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/what-happens-when-you-randomize-the-legend-of-zelda-1758777271 | title = What Happens When You Randomize The Legend Of Zelda | first=  John  |last =Harris | date= February 2, 2016 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> Their popularity grew as randomizer playthroughs were popular with streaming media.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/ | title = How \"randomizers\" are breathing new life into old games | first = Scott | last = White | date = December 3, 2019 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\n===Add-on===\nAn ''add-on'' or ''addon'' is a typically small mod which adds to the original content of a specific game. In most cases, an add-on will add one particular element to a game, such as a new weapon in a shooting game, a new unit or map in a strategy game, a new vehicle or track in a racing game, items in a game like ''[[Minecraft]]'' or ''[[Terraria]]'', or additional contents in simulation games (such as new pilotable airplanes (e.g., the [[Airbus A330]] or [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]). This can be accomplished without changing any of the original game's existing content. Many games are flexible and allow this, however that is not always the case. Some add-ons occasionally have to replace in-game content, due to the nature of a peculiar game engine. It may be the case, for example, that in a game which does not give a player the option to choose their character, modders wishing to add another player model will simply have to overwrite the old one. A famous example of this type of mod can be found for the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] wherein modders may use downloadable tools to replace content (such as models) in the game's directory. The ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' series can also be modded with individual add-ons which are stored in a .VPK format, so that a player may choose to activate a given mod or not.\n\n===Unofficial patch===\nAn ''[[unofficial patch]]'' can be a mod of an existing game that fixes [[Software bug|bugs]] not fixed by an official patch or that unlocks content present in the released game's files but is inaccessible in official gameplay. Such patches are usually created by members of the game's fan base when the original developer is unwilling or unable to supply the functionality officially. ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit 2]]'' has an unofficial patch which adds and fixes many of its features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/showthread.php?t=19489|accessdate=15 March 2014 |title=JJ2+ (last updated October 30, 2013) |date=2013-11-01}}</ref>  One downside of this type of mod is that leaked content can be revealed.

Art mods are most frequently associated with [[video game art]]. However, modified games that retain their playability and are subject to more extensive mods (i.e. closer to total conversions) may also be classified as [[art game]]s.<ref name=cannon>Cannon, Rebecca. \"Meltdown\" from ''Videogames and Art'' (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.40-42. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84150-142-0}}</ref> Art mods are usually designed to subvert the original game experience. One example is the ''Velvet-Strike'' mod for ''Counter Strike'' in which the players spray-paint anti-violence messages in multiplayer games as a form of [[performance art]]. Another example is Robert Nideffer's ''Tomb Raider I and II'' patches which were designed to subvert the unofficial ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)#Nude Raider|Nude Raider]]'' patch of the late 1990s by altering Lara Croft's sexual orientation.<ref name=stalker>Stalker, Phillipa Jane.

The term ''[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]'' is often used to make this distinction. \"Vanilla ''[[Battlefield 1942]]''\", for example, refers to the original, unmodified game.\n\nAs early as the 1980s, video game mods have also been used for the sole purpose of creating art, as opposed to an actual game. This can include recording in-game actions as a film, as well as attempting to reproduce real-life areas inside a game with no regard for game play value.

One such example is ''[[Homeworld 2]]'', which requires the program [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to build new in-game objects. However, there are free versions of Maya and other advanced modeling software available. There are also free and even [[open-source software|open-source]] modeling programs (such as [[Blender (software)|Blender]]) that can be used as well.\n\nFor advanced mods such as ''[[Desert Combat]]'' that are total conversions, complicated modeling and texturing software is required to make original content. Advanced mods can rival the complexity and work of making the original game content (short of the engine itself), rendering the differences in ease of modding small in comparison to the total amount of work required. Having an engine that is for example easy to import models to, is of little help when doing research, modeling, and making a photorealistic texture for a game item. As a result, other game characteristics such as its popularity and capabilities have a dominating effect on the number of mods created for the game by users.\n\nA game that allows modding is said to be \"moddable\". ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' as well as its predecessors, ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', are examples of highly moddable games, with an official editor available for download from the developer. ''[[Daggerfall]]'' was much less moddable, but some people released their own modifications nevertheless. Some modifications such as ''Gunslingers Academy'' have deliberately made the game more moddable by adding in scripting support or externalizing underlying code. ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' set out to be the 'most customisable game ever' and as such included a mod manager which allowed for modular modding, having several mods on at once.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nThe games industry is currently facing the question of how much it should embrace the players' contribution in creating new material for the game or mod-communities as part of their structure within the game. Some software companies openly accept and even encourage such communities. Others though have chosen to enclose their games in heavily policed copyright or Intellectual Property regimes(IPR) and close down sites that they see as infringing their ownership of a game.<ref>Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) \"Games: Technology, Industry, Culture\" in Terry Flew, New Media: an introduction (second edition), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101-114.</ref>\n\n===Portability issues===\nFor cross-platform games, mods written for the Windows version have not always been compatible with the Mac OS X and/or [[Linux]] ports of the game. In large part, this is due to the publisher's concern with prioritizing the porting of the primary game itself, when allocating resources for fixing the porting of mod-specific functions may not be cost-effective for the smaller market share of alternate platforms. For example, ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'', ported by [[Aspyr]] for Mac OS X, had file access issues specific to mods until the 1.61D patch. ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' does not have a working community mods menu for the Mac OS X version and, until the 3369 patch, had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such as ''Red Orchestra'' and ''Metaball''.\n\nAlso, mods compiled into platform-specific libraries, such as those of ''[[Doom 3]]'', are often only built for the Windows platform, leading to a lack of cross-platform compatibility even when the underlying game is highly portable. In the same line of reasoning, mod development tools are often available only on the Windows platform. [[id Software]]'s Doom 3 Radiant tool and [[Epic Games]]' [[UnrealEd]] are examples of this.\n\nMod teams that lack either the resources or know-how to develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code and art assets to individuals or groups who are able to port the mod.\n\nThe mod specialist site for Macs, [[Macologist]], has created GUI launchers and installers for many UT2004 mods, as well as solving cross-platform conversion issues for mods for other games.\n\n===Unforeseen consequences or benefits of modding===\nIn January 2005, it was reported that in ''[[The Sims 2]]'' (2004) modifications that changed item and game behavior were unexpectedly being transferred to other players through the official website's ''exchange'' feature, leading to changed game behavior without advance warning.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050305070257/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6857 Supernatural powers become contagious in PC game] by Will Knight, NewScientist, 7 January 2005</ref>\n\nAfter the Hot Coffee mod incident, there were calls from the industry to better control modders.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  There is concern about mods which show nudity, and Bestheda does not allow mods with nudity to be uploaded on its website.  Nexus allows for mods which allow nudity if breasts are not visible in the preview image.

Randomizers came out of the [[speedrunning]] community which had exhausted the challenge of racing through the game with one of the earliest being for ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' around 2015. In the ''Zelda'' randomizer, the mod moved the location of the dungeons, the layout of these dungeons, and the location of enemies in a random but procedurely generated manner (similar to [[roguelikes]]) based on a numerical seed, so that speedrunners would have to overcome these new changes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/what-happens-when-you-randomize-the-legend-of-zelda-1758777271 | title = What Happens When You Randomize The Legend Of Zelda | first=  John  |last =Harris | date= February 2, 2016 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> Their popularity grew as randomizer playthroughs were popular with streaming media.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/ | title = How \"randomizers\" are breathing new life into old games | first = Scott | last = White | date = December 3, 2019 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\n===Add-on===\nAn ''add-on'' or ''addon'' is a typically small mod which adds to the original content of a specific game. In most cases, an add-on will add one particular element to a game, such as a new weapon in a shooting game, a new unit or map in a strategy game, a new vehicle or track in a racing game, items in a game like ''[[Minecraft]]'' or ''[[Terraria]]'', or additional contents in simulation games (such as new pilotable airplanes (e.g., the [[Airbus A330]] or [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]). This can be accomplished without changing any of the original game's existing content. Many games are flexible and allow this, however that is not always the case. Some add-ons occasionally have to replace in-game content, due to the nature of a peculiar game engine. It may be the case, for example, that in a game which does not give a player the option to choose their character, modders wishing to add another player model will simply have to overwrite the old one. A famous example of this type of mod can be found for the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] wherein modders may use downloadable tools to replace content (such as models) in the game's directory. The ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' series can also be modded with individual add-ons which are stored in a .VPK format, so that a player may choose to activate a given mod or not.\n\n===Unofficial patch===\nAn ''[[unofficial patch]]'' can be a mod of an existing game that fixes [[Software bug|bugs]] not fixed by an official patch or that unlocks content present in the released game's files but is inaccessible in official gameplay. Such patches are usually created by members of the game's fan base when the original developer is unwilling or unable to supply the functionality officially. ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit 2]]'' has an unofficial patch which adds and fixes many of its features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/showthread.php?t=19489|accessdate=15 March 2014 |title=JJ2+ (last updated October 30, 2013) |date=2013-11-01}}</ref>  One downside of this type of mod is that leaked content can be revealed.

Art mods are most frequently associated with [[video game art]]. However, modified games that retain their playability and are subject to more extensive mods (i.e. closer to total conversions) may also be classified as [[art game]]s.<ref name=cannon>Cannon, Rebecca. \"Meltdown\" from ''Videogames and Art'' (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.40-42. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84150-142-0}}</ref> Art mods are usually designed to subvert the original game experience. One example is the ''Velvet-Strike'' mod for ''Counter Strike'' in which the players spray-paint anti-violence messages in multiplayer games as a form of [[performance art]]. Another example is Robert Nideffer's ''Tomb Raider I and II'' patches which were designed to subvert the unofficial ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)#Nude Raider|Nude Raider]]'' patch of the late 1990s by altering Lara Croft's sexual orientation.<ref name=stalker>Stalker, Phillipa Jane.

Richard's father [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], died in 1376, leaving Richard as [[heir apparent]] to his grandfather, [[King Edward III]]. Upon the death of Edward III, the 10-year-old Richard succeeded to the throne.\n\nDuring Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of [[regency]] councils, influenced by Richard's uncles [[John of Gaunt]] and [[Thomas of Woodstock]]. [[Kingdom of England|England]] then faced various problems, most notably the [[Hundred Years' War]]. A major challenge of the reign was the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years' War. A firm believer in the [[royal prerogative]], Richard restrained the power of the aristocracy and relied on a private [[retinue]] for military protection instead. In contrast to his grandfather, Richard cultivated a refined atmosphere at court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.\n\nThe king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the [[Lords Appellant]]. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents. In 1397, he took his revenge on the Appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's \"tyranny\". In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, [[Henry Bolingbroke]], who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, he deposed Richard and had himself crowned king. Richard is thought to have been starved to death in captivity, although questions remain regarding his final fate.\n\nRichard's posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by [[William Shakespeare]], whose play ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition as responsible for the 15th-century [[Wars of the Roses]]. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had a [[personality disorder]], particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign.

Edward, eldest son of [[Edward III]] and [[heir apparent]] to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the [[Hundred Years' War]], particularly in the [[Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted [[dysentery]] in Spain in 1370.

This resulted in the 10-year-old Richard succeeding to the throne. He was [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] on 16 July 1377 at Westminster Abbey.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 24.</ref> Again, fears of John of Gaunt's ambitions influenced political decisions, and a regency led by the king's uncles was avoided.<ref>McKisack (1959), pp. 399\u2013400.</ref> Instead, the king was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of \"continual councils\", from which Gaunt was excluded.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Gaunt, together with his younger brother [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham]], still held great informal influence over the business of government, but the king's councillors and friends, particularly Sir [[Simon de Burley]] and [[Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford]], increasingly gained control of royal affairs. In a matter of three years, these councillors earned the mistrust of the Commons to the point that the councils were discontinued in 1380.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of [[Taxation in medieval England|taxation]] levied through three [[poll tax]]es between 1377 and 1381 that were spent on unsuccessful military expeditions on the continent.<ref>Harriss (2005), pp. 445\u20136.</ref> By 1381, there was a deep-felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of English society.<ref>Harriss (2005), pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\n== Peasants' Revolt ==\n\n[[File:Death of Wat Tyler Froissart.jpg|thumb|right|Richard II watches [[Wat Tyler]]'s death and addresses the peasants in the background: taken from the [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Gruuthuse manuscript]] of [[Froissart]]'s ''Chroniques'' (c.&nbsp;1475)]]\n\nWhereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] and [[Second plague pandemic|subsequent outbreaks]] of the plague.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> The rebellion started in [[Kent]] and [[Essex]] in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] near London under the leaders [[Wat Tyler]], [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]], and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. John of Gaunt's [[Savoy Palace]] was burnt down. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Simon Sudbury]], who was also [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[Lord High Treasurer]] [[Robert Hales]] were both killed by the rebels,<ref>Harriss (2006), pp. 230\u20131.</ref> who were demanding the complete abolition of [[serfdom]].<ref name=\"H231\">Harriss (2006), p. 231.</ref> The king, sheltered within the [[Tower of London]] with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 67.</ref>\n\nIt is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> The king set out by the [[River Thames]] on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at [[Greenwich]] made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower.<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 409.</ref> The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at [[Mile End]].<ref>Saul (1997), p. 68.</ref> He agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 68\u201370.</ref> Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and [[William Walworth]], the [[mayor of London]], pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 70\u20131.</ref> The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \"I am your captain, follow me!\", he led the mob away from the scene.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.<ref>McKisack (1959), pp. 413\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at [[Billericay]], he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt.<ref name=\"H231\"/> Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion.

A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] possessed by the English Crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay [[homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King of France{{spaced ndash}}a condition that proved unacceptable to the English public.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 215\u201325.</ref> Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 227.</ref> As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]], daughter of [[Charles VI of France]], when she came of age.

McKisack (1959), p. 476.</ref>\n\nAlthough Richard sought peace with France, he took a different approach to the situation in Ireland.

Arundel's brother [[Thomas Arundel]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, was exiled for life.<ref>Tuck (1985), p. 210.</ref> Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities.

A new form of address developed; where the king previously had been addressed simply as \"[[highness]]\", now \"royal [[majesty]]\", or \"high majesty\" were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 340\u20132.</ref> The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that his father had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 344\u201354.</ref>\n\nRichard's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the [[royal prerogative]], the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant.<ref>Harris (2005), pp. 489\u201390.</ref> Richard rejected the approach his grandfather Edward III had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains.<ref>Harris (2005), pp. 490\u20131.</ref> In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France.<ref name=\"S439\">Saul (1997), p. 439.</ref> At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them [[livery]] [[heraldic badge|badges]] with his [[White Hart]].<ref>Harris (2005), p. 28.</ref> He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 332, 346.</ref>\n\n== Patronage and the arts ==\nAs part of Richard's programme of asserting his authority, he also tried to cultivate the royal image.

until he was [[deposed]] in 1399. Richard's father [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], died in 1376, leaving Richard as [[heir apparent]] to his grandfather, [[King Edward III]]. Upon the death of Edward III, the 10-year-old Richard succeeded to the throne.\n\nDuring Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of [[regency]] councils, influenced by Richard's uncles [[John of Gaunt]] and [[Thomas of Woodstock]]. [[Kingdom of England|England]] then faced various problems, most notably the [[Hundred Years' War]]. A major challenge of the reign was the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years' War. A firm believer in the [[royal prerogative]], Richard restrained the power of the aristocracy and relied on a private [[retinue]] for military protection instead. In contrast to his grandfather, Richard cultivated a refined atmosphere at court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.\n\nThe king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the [[Lords Appellant]]. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents. In 1397, he took his revenge on the Appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's \"tyranny\". In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, [[Henry Bolingbroke]], who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, he deposed Richard and had himself crowned king. Richard is thought to have been starved to death in captivity, although questions remain regarding his final fate.\n\nRichard's posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by [[William Shakespeare]], whose play ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition as responsible for the 15th-century [[Wars of the Roses]]. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had a [[personality disorder]], particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that his policies were not unrealistic or even entirely unprecedented, but that the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, leading to his downfall.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Edward III Black Prince 14thc.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Black Prince kneeling before his father, King Edward III]]\n\nRichard of Bordeaux was the younger son of [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Joan, Countess of Kent]]. Edward, eldest son of [[Edward III]] and [[heir apparent]] to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the [[Hundred Years' War]], particularly in the [[Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted [[dysentery]] in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barber|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Barber|title=Edward, prince of Wales and of Aquitaine (1330\u20131376)|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/8523}}</ref>\n\nRichard was born at the Archbishop's Palace, [[Bordeaux]], in the English principality of [[Duchy of Aquitaine#Hundred Years' War|Aquitaine]], on 6 January 1367. According to contemporary sources, three kings{{spaced ndash}}\"the King of [[Crown of Castile|Castille]], the King of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and the King of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]\"{{spaced ndash}}were present at his birth.<ref name=\"Tuck\">Tuck (2004).</ref> This anecdote, and the fact that his birth fell on the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], was later used in the religious imagery of the [[Wilton Diptych]], where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the [[Virgin and Child]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nLbAoxCCt8YC&pg=PA266&dq=Wilton+Diptych+Epiphany&sig=ACfU3U3LS79tMWmk13QHWga0pDPkxuoCkQ Gillespie and Goodman (1998), p. 266].</ref> His elder brother, [[Edward of Angoul\u00eame]], died near his sixth birthday in 1371.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 12.</ref> The Prince of Wales finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The [[House of Commons of England|Commons]] in the [[English Parliament]] genuinely feared that Richard's uncle, [[John of Gaunt]], would [[usurp]] the throne.{{Ref label|A|a|none}} For this reason, Richard was quickly invested with the [[princedom of Wales]] and his father's other titles.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 17.</ref>\n\n[[File:Coronation Richard2 England 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Coronation of Richard II aged ten in 1377, from the ''Recueil des croniques'' of [[Jean de Wavrin]]. [[British Library]], London.]]\n\nOn 21 June the next year, Richard's grandfather King Edward III, who was for some years frail and decrepit, died after a 50-year reign. This resulted in the 10-year-old Richard succeeding to the throne. He was [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] on 16 July 1377 at Westminster Abbey.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 24.</ref> Again, fears of John of Gaunt's ambitions influenced political decisions, and a regency led by the king's uncles was avoided.<ref>McKisack (1959), pp. 399\u2013400.</ref> Instead, the king was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of \"continual councils\", from which Gaunt was excluded.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Gaunt, together with his younger brother [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham]], still held great informal influence over the business of government, but the king's councillors and friends, particularly Sir [[Simon de Burley]] and [[Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford]], increasingly gained control of royal affairs. In a matter of three years, these councillors earned the mistrust of the Commons to the point that the councils were discontinued in 1380.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of [[Taxation in medieval England|taxation]] levied through three [[poll tax]]es between 1377 and 1381 that were spent on unsuccessful military expeditions on the continent.<ref>Harriss (2005), pp. 445\u20136.</ref> By 1381, there was a deep-felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of English society.<ref>Harriss (2005), pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\n== Peasants' Revolt ==\n\n[[File:Death of Wat Tyler Froissart.jpg|thumb|right|Richard II watches [[Wat Tyler]]'s death and addresses the peasants in the background: taken from the [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Gruuthuse manuscript]] of [[Froissart]]'s ''Chroniques'' (c.&nbsp;1475)]]\n\nWhereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] and [[Second plague pandemic|subsequent outbreaks]] of the plague.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> The rebellion started in [[Kent]] and [[Essex]] in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] near London under the leaders [[Wat Tyler]], [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]], and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. John of Gaunt's [[Savoy Palace]] was burnt down. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Simon Sudbury]], who was also [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[Lord High Treasurer]] [[Robert Hales]] were both killed by the rebels,<ref>Harriss (2006), pp. 230\u20131.</ref> who were demanding the complete abolition of [[serfdom]].<ref name=\"H231\">Harriss (2006), p. 231.</ref> The king, sheltered within the [[Tower of London]] with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 67.</ref>\n\nIt is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> The king set out by the [[River Thames]] on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at [[Greenwich]] made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower.<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 409.</ref> The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at [[Mile End]].<ref>Saul (1997), p. 68.</ref> He agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 68\u201370.</ref> Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and [[William Walworth]], the [[mayor of London]], pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 70\u20131.</ref> The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \"I am your captain, follow me!\", he led the mob away from the scene.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.<ref>McKisack (1959), pp. 413\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at [[Billericay]], he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt.<ref name=\"H231\"/> Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/>\n\n== Coming of age ==\n[[File:Richard2 Anna.jpg|thumb|upright|Anne and Richard's coronation in the ''[[Liber Regalis]]'' of [[Westminster Abbey]]]]\n\nIt is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the [[chronicle|annals]].<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 424.</ref> One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry [[Anne of Bohemia]], daughter of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], on 20 January 1382.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 90. The marriage had been agreed upon as of 2 May 1381; Saul (1997), p. 87.</ref> It had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the [[Western Schism]], Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] in the ongoing Hundred Years' War.{{Ref label|C|c|none}} Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 94\u20135.</ref> Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 225.</ref>\n\n[[Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Michael de la Pole]] had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations;<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 117\u201320.</ref> De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family.<ref>A complaint in parliament claimed that he had been \"raised from low estate to the rank of earl\"; Saul (1997), p. 118.</ref> When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him [[Earl of Suffolk]] two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 117.</ref> Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's [[favourite]].<ref>Harriss (2005), p. 98.</ref> Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of [[Duke of Ireland]] in 1386.<ref>McKisack (1959), pp. 425, 442\u20133.</ref> The chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 437.</ref>\n\nTensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Instead, a so-called [[crusade]] led by [[Henry le Despenser]], [[Bishop of Norwich]], was dispatched, which failed miserably.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. In 1385, the king himself led a [[English invasion of Scotland (1385)|punitive expedition to the north]],<ref>Muster of the 1385 army [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVFIAAAAYAAJ&dq=archaeologia+1829&source=gbs_navlinks_s Ellis, Nicolas, Nicolas Harris, 'Richard II's army for Scotland, 1385', in ''Archaeologia'', vol. 22, (1829), 13\u201319]</ref> but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 142\u20135.</ref> Meanwhile, only an uprising in [[Ghent]] prevented a French invasion of southern England.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 145\u20136.</ref> The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckingham{{spaced ndash}}who had by now been created Duke of Gloucester{{spaced ndash}}and [[Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel]].<ref name=\"Tuck\"/>\n\n== First crisis of 1386\u201388 ==\n[[File:Robert de Vere fleeing Radcot Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland|Robert de Vere]] fleeing the [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]], from the ''Chroniques'' of [[Jean Froissart]]]]\n\nThe threat of a French invasion did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/> At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Pole{{spaced ndash}}in his capacity of chancellor{{spaced ndash}}requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 157.</ref> Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed.<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 443.</ref> The parliament (later known as the [[Wonderful Parliament]]) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/><ref>Saul (1997), p. 160.</ref> The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a [[scullery maid|scullion]] from his kitchen at parliament's request.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 157\u20138.</ref> Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 158.</ref> A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.<ref>Harriss (2005), p. 459.</ref>\n\nRichard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a \"gyration\" (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause.<ref>Tuck (1985), p. 189.</ref> By installing de Vere as [[Justice of Chester]], he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in [[Cheshire]].<ref>Goodman (1971), p. 22.</ref> He also secured a legal ruling from [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]] [[Robert Tresilian]] that parliament's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chrimes|first=S.

She was six; he was twenty-nine.]]\n\nWith national stability secured, Richard began negotiating a permanent peace with France. A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] possessed by the English Crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay [[homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King of France{{spaced ndash}}a condition that proved unacceptable to the English public.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 215\u201325.</ref> Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 227.</ref> As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]], daughter of [[Charles VI of France]], when she came of age. There were some misgivings about the betrothal, in particular because the princess was then only six years old, and thus would not be able to produce an heir to the throne of England for many years.<ref>(As it turned out, she never did produce an heir: just four years later, Richard was dead.) McKisack (1959), p. 476.</ref>\n\nAlthough Richard sought peace with France, he took a different approach to the situation in Ireland. The English [[Lordship of Ireland|lordships in Ireland]] were in danger of being overrun, and the [[Normans in Ireland|Anglo-Irish]] lords were pleading for the king to intervene.<ref>Tuck (1985), p. 204.</ref> In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages.<ref>Harriss (2005), p. 511.</ref> The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 279\u201381.</ref> It was one of the most successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened his support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.<ref name=\"Tuck\"/>\n\n== Second crisis of 1397\u201399 ==\nThe period that historians refer to as the \"tyranny\" of Richard II began towards the end of the 1390s.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 203.</ref> The king had Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397. The timing of these arrests and Richard's motivation are not entirely clear. Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the king, there is no evidence that this was the case.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 371\u20135.</ref> It is more likely that Richard had simply come to feel strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386\u201388 and eliminate them as threats to his power.<ref>Harriss (2005), p. 479.</ref> Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial, at the parliament of September 1397. After a heated quarrel with the king, he was condemned and executed.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 378.</ref> Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial. As the time for the trial drew near, Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead. It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 378\u20139.</ref> Warwick was also condemned to death, but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment.

[[National Gallery]], London.]]\nIn the last years of Richard's reign, and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the king enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 331\u20132.</ref> In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the king previously had been addressed simply as \"[[highness]]\", now \"royal [[majesty]]\", or \"high majesty\" were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king.<ref>Saul (1997), p. 340\u20132.</ref> The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that his father had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 344\u201354.</ref>\n\nRichard's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the [[royal prerogative]], the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant.<ref>Harris (2005), pp. 489\u201390.</ref> Richard rejected the approach his grandfather Edward III had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains.<ref>Harris (2005), pp. 490\u20131.</ref> In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France.<ref name=\"S439\">Saul (1997), p. 439.</ref> At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them [[livery]] [[heraldic badge|badges]] with his [[White Hart]].<ref>Harris (2005), p. 28.</ref> He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.<ref>Saul (1997), pp. 332, 346.</ref>\n\n== Patronage and the arts ==\nAs part of Richard's programme of asserting his authority, he also tried to cultivate the royal image.
