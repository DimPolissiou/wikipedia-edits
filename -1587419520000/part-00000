In his [[memoir]] he recalled:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others\u2014I think it marked my life\u2014was watching [[Triscuit]]s and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn't that crazy?

Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the [[cocktail party]] craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a [[catering]] company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: ''Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'', a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast [[Julia Child]], this book put him on the culinary map.<ref name=\"childsvi\">Beard, ''James Beard Beard on Food'', pg. vi</ref> [[World War II]] rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted ''[[I Love to Eat]]'', a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority. According to Child, \"Through the years he gradually became not only the leading culinary figure in the country, but 'The Dean of American Cuisine'.\"<ref name=\"childsvi\"/>\n\nIn 1952, when [[Helen Evans Brown]] published her ''Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book'', Beard wrote her a letter igniting a friendship that spanned until Brown's death.

David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, ''The United States of Arugula'') noted that Beard's was the first cooking show on TV.<ref>Kamp, pg. 55</ref> He compares [[Dione Lucas]]' cooking show and school with Beard's, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally  and internationally known food culture.<ref>Kamp, pg. 57</ref> Kamp wrote, \"It was in this decade [the 1950s] that Beard made his name as ''James Beard'', the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy.\"<ref>Kamp, pg. 58</ref> He noted that Beard met [[Alice B.

According to Kamp, Beard later felt himself a \"gastronomic whore\" for doing so.

The family vacationed on the Pacific coast in [[Gearhart, Oregon]], where Beard was exposed to [[Pacific Northwest cuisine]].\n \nCommon ingredients of this cuisine are [[salmon]], [[shellfish]], and other fresh [[seafood]]; [[Game (food)|game]] meats such as [[moose]], [[elk]], or [[venison]]; [[mushroom]]s, [[Berry|berries]], small [[fruit]]s, [[potato]]es, [[kale]], and wild plants such as [[fiddleheads]] or young pushki (''[[Heracleum maximum]]'', or cow parsnip).\n\nBeard's earliest memory of food was at the 1905 [[Lewis and Clark Exposition]], when he was two years old. In his [[memoir]] he recalled:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others\u2014I think it marked my life\u2014was watching [[Triscuit]]s and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn't that crazy? At two years old that memory was made. It intrigued the hell out of me.<ref>Beard, ''A James Beard Memoir'', pg. 25</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt age three Beard was bedridden with [[malaria]], and the illness gave him time to focus on the food prepared by his mother and their [[Chinese people|Chinese]] helper.<ref>Kamp, pg. 19</ref> According to Beard he was raised by Thema and Jue-Let, who instilled in him a passion for [[Chinese culture]].<ref>Beard, ''A James Beard Memoir'', pg. 20</ref> Beard reportedly \"attributes much of his upbringing to Jue-Let,\" whom he refers to as his Chinese godfather.<ref name=\"Saveur\">[http://www.saveur.com/james-beard-chinese-jue-let/ Dao, Dan Q. \"Who was Jue-Let, the Unknown Chinese Chef Who Raised James Beard?

Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the [[cocktail party]] craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a [[catering]] company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: ''Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'', a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast [[Julia Child]], this book put him on the culinary map.<ref name=\"childsvi\">Beard, ''James Beard Beard on Food'', pg. vi</ref> [[World War II]] rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted ''[[I Love to Eat]]'', a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority. According to Child, \"Through the years he gradually became not only the leading culinary figure in the country, but 'The Dean of American Cuisine'.\"<ref name=\"childsvi\"/>\n\nIn 1952, when [[Helen Evans Brown]] published her ''Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book'', Beard wrote her a letter igniting a friendship that spanned until Brown's death. The two, along with her husband Phillip, developed a friendship which was both professional and personal. Beard and Brown became like siblings, admonishing and encouraging each other, as well as collaborating.<ref name=\"Ferrone (1995)\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Ferrone|first1=John|chapter=Introduction|editor-last1=Beard|editor-first1=James|title=Love and Kisses and a Halo of Truffles: Letters from Helen Evans Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32nR9wP2wpoC&pg=PR8|edition=1|year=1995|publisher=Arcade Publishing|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-55970-318-5|pp=vii-xiv}}</ref>\nAccording to the James Beard Foundation website, \"In 1955, he established The James Beard Cooking School. He continued to teach cooking to men and women for the next thirty years, both at his own schools (in New York City and Seaside, Oregon), and around the country at women's clubs, other cooking schools, and civic groups. He was a tireless traveler, bringing his message of good food, honestly prepared with fresh, wholesome, American ingredients, to a country just becoming aware of its own culinary heritage.\"<ref>\"[http://www.jamesbeard.org/ James Beard Foundation Website]\". James Beard Foundation. Retrieved on July 19, 2010.</ref>\nBeard brought French cooking to the American middle and upper classes during the 1950s, appearing on TV as a cooking personality. David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, ''The United States of Arugula'') noted that Beard's was the first cooking show on TV.<ref>Kamp, pg. 55</ref> He compares [[Dione Lucas]]' cooking show and school with Beard's, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally  and internationally known food culture.<ref>Kamp, pg. 57</ref> Kamp wrote, \"It was in this decade [the 1950s] that Beard made his name as ''James Beard'', the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy.\"<ref>Kamp, pg. 58</ref> He noted that Beard met [[Alice B. Toklas]] on a trip to Paris,<ref>Kamp, pg. 60</ref> indicative of the network of fellow food celebrities who would follow him during his life and carry on his legacy after his death.\n\nBeard made endorsement deals to promote products that he might not have otherwise used or suggested in his own cuisine, including [[Omaha Steaks]], [[French's]] Mustard, [[Green Giant]] Corn Niblets, [[Old Crow]] bourbon, [[Planters|Planters Peanuts]], [[Shasta (soft drink)|Shasta]] soft drinks, [[DuPont]] chemicals, and [[Lawry's and Adolph's|Adolph's Meat Tenderizer]]. According to Kamp, Beard later felt himself a \"gastronomic whore\" for doing so. Although he felt that mass-produced food that was neither fresh, local nor seasonal was a betrayal of his gastronomic beliefs, he needed the money for his cooking schools.<ref>Kamp, pg. 62</ref> According to Thomas McNamee, \"Beard, a man of stupendous appetites\u2014for food, sex, money, you name it\u2014stunned his subtler colleagues.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=McNamee|first=Thomas|title=The Man Who Changed the Way We Eat|url=https://archive.org/details/manwhochangedway0000mcna|url-access=registration|year=2012|publisher=Free Press, Div of Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4391-9150-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/manwhochangedway0000mcna/page/339 339]}}</ref> In 1981 Beard and friend [[Gael Greene]] founded [[Citymeals-on-Wheels]], which continues to help feed the homebound elderly in New York City.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Julia Child]] summed up Beard's personal life:\n<blockquote>Beard was the quintessential American cook. Well-educated and well-traveled during his eighty-two years, he was familiar with many cuisines but he remained fundamentally American. He was a big man, over six feet tall, with a big belly, and huge hands. An endearing and always lively teacher, he loved people, loved his work, loved gossip, loved to eat, loved a good time.<ref name=\"childsvi\"/></blockquote>\nBeard was [[gay]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/opinion/sunday/food-sex-and-silence.html Food, sex and silence]</ref> According to Beard's memoir, \"By the time I was seven, I knew that I was gay.

[[Peter Kump]], a former student of Beard's and the founder of the [[Institute of Culinary Education]] (formerly Peter Kump's New York Cooking School), spearheaded efforts to purchase the house and create the [[James Beard Foundation]].\nBeard's renovated [[brownstone]] at 167 West 12th Street in [[Greenwich Village]], is [[North America]]'s only historic culinary center. It is preserved as a gathering place where the press and general public could appreciate the talents of emerging and established chefs.\n\nIn 1986, the [[James Beard Foundation]] was established in Beard's honor to provide scholarships to aspiring food professionals and champion the American culinary tradition which Beard helped create.<ref name=\"Kamp 294\">Kamp, pg. 294</ref> \"Since its inception in 1991, the James Beard Foundation Scholarship Program has awarded over $4.6&nbsp;million in financial aid to a variety of students\u2014from recent high school graduates, to working culinary professionals, to career changers.

Held on the first Monday in May, the awards ceremony honors American chefs, restaurants, journalists, cookbook authors, restaurant designers and electronic-media professionals. It culminates in a reception featuring tastings of signature dishes of more than 30 of the foundation's chefs. A quarterly magazine, ''Beard House'', is a compendium of culinary journalism. The foundation also publishes the ''James Beard Foundation Restaurant Directory'', a directory of all chefs who have presented a meal at the Beard House or participated in one of the foundation's outside fundraising events.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe foundation was affected by scandals; in 2004 its head, Leonard Pickell, resigned and was imprisoned for grand [[larceny]] and in 2005 the board of trustees resigned.

Both Heath's radio and his navigation system become disabled, with no way to correctly determine their altitude. At the same time, a [[Douglas DC-7]] airliner, piloted by veteran Dick Barnett ([[Dana Andrews]]), is carrying a full passenger complement, each with their own worries and problems with which they must deal. \n\nBoth Barnett and Heath have their personal crises, including Heath's unhappy marriage to an unfaithful wife (Rhonda Fleming) and Barnett's long-time conflict with his co-pilot, Mike Rule ([[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]]). Rule has his own personal demons, including no meaningful relationship with his catatonic father, and an affair with head [[stewardess]] Kitty Foster ([[Anne Francis]]).\n\nBoth aircraft, through various errors with their flight paths, are now on a direct collision course that air traffic controllers are unable to avert. When the crash inevitably occurs, Heath sacrifices himself and his passenger, making amends for a past air tragedy that he had caused. The airliner is badly damaged, and Louis Capelli ([[Joe Mantell]]), the flight engineer, is blown out of the aircraft, falling to his death, while the rest of the passengers and crew fight for their lives. Even with one engine destroyed and a wing on fire, Barnett brings the airliner down safely, but accepts responsibility for the collision during the accident investigation. In the aftermath of the crash, Mike and Kitty are not only survivors but are now planning a future life together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Dick Barnett\n* [[Rhonda Fleming]] as Cheryl Heath\n* [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] as Dale Heath\n* [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] as Mike Rule\n* [[Anne Francis]] as Kitty Foster\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Nick Hyland\n* [[Troy Donahue]] as McVey\n* [[Joe Mantell]] as Louis Capelli\n* [[Patsy Kelly]] as Gertrude Ross\n* [[Donald May]] as Norm Coster\n* [[Louis Quinn]] as Sidney Schreiber\n* [[Ed Kemmer]] as Caesar (as Edward Kemmer)\n* [[Tom Gilson]] as Rob Fermi\n* Hollis Irving as Beatrice Wiley\n* [[Paul Genge]] as Samuel N.

In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals.

In the Scottish Cup, Kilmarnock were involved in a controversial first round tie. Kilmarnock initially defeated [[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]] 6\u20131 at Drumbiehill Park but a protest over a breach of registration rules was upheld and the result was declared void. The match was replayed and this time Hurlford won 3\u20131, however a similar protest by Kilmarnock was also upheld and Hurlford were disqualified from the competition. In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals. On 31 January 1885, Kilmarnock thumped [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]] 5\u20132 at [[Rugby Park]] to reach the final for the second consecutive season. They retained the cup after defeating Hurlford 2\u20130 in the final at Holm Quarry.\n\nThe two charity cups saw similar fates for Kilmarnock.

His theater company is currently producing a play that stars his wife Nicole, a former teen film actress. The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a mediator, who suggests that they each write down what they like about one another, but Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud and they decide to forgo the counseling.\n\nNicole is offered a starring role in a television pilot in [[Los Angeles]], and she decides to leave the theater company and temporarily live with her mother in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], taking the couple's young son Henry with her. Charlie decides to stay in New York, as the play is in the process of moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Despite the couple agreeing to split amicably and forgo lawyers, Nicole hires Nora Fanshaw, a family lawyer. Nicole tells Nora the full story of her relationship with Charlie and how she gradually felt neglected by him and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole also reveals that she thinks Charlie slept with the stage manager of the theater company. Charlie flies out to Los Angeles to visit his family, revealing that he has won a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] grant, but Nicole serves him divorce papers. Charlie meets with Jay Marotta, a brash and expensive lawyer who urges Charlie to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring him. He receives a call from Nora, who urges him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry. Charlie returns to Los Angeles and hires Bert Spitz, an empathetic and retired family lawyer who favors a civil and conciliatory approach.\n\nOn Bert's counsel, Charlie rents an apartment in Los Angeles to be closer to his family and strengthen his custody case. Charlie wishes to avoid going to court, so Bert arranges a meeting with Nora and Nicole. Nora argues that Charlie refused to respect Nicole's wishes to move back to Los Angeles and that Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than fly back and forth between coasts. Bert privately advises Charlie to drop his New York residency altogether, but a frustrated Charlie refuses and decides to fire him.\n\nUsing the first payout of his MacArthur Fellowship grant, Charlie hires Jay on retainer. The case moves to court, where Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients and attempt to paint the other party in a negative light. Nora highlights Charlie's past infidelity and emotional distance, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits as alcoholism and threatens criminal action for hacking into Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Charlie and Nicole remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed with the back and forth.\n\nDisillusioned with the legal process, the couple decides to meet in private away from the lawyers. A friendly discussion in Charlie's apartment devolves into a bitter argument; Nicole claims that Charlie has now fully merged with his own selfishness, and Charlie punches a hole in a wall and says he wishes that she would die. He then breaks down in shame and apologizes; Nicole comforts him. An appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry, during which Charlie accidentally cuts himself. Soon after, the couple agrees to relax their demands and reach an equal agreement to finalize the divorce, although Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole, against Nicole's wishes.\n\nA year later, Charlie's play has a successful Broadway run, while Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for directing an episode of her show. Charlie informs Nicole that he has taken a residency at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and will be living in Los Angeles full-time to be closer to Henry. Later, he discovers Henry reading Nicole's list of things she likes about Charlie she wrote down during counseling. Henry asks Charlie to read it aloud to him, and Charlie does so, becoming emotional as Nicole watches from afar. That evening, after attending a Halloween party together, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home even though it is her night. As Charlie walks out to his car carrying a sleeping Henry, Nicole stops Charlie to tie his shoe for him. He thanks her, and they part ways once more.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Nicole Barber, Charlie's wife\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Charlie Barber, Nicole's husband\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Nora Fanshaw, Nicole's lawyer\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Bert Spitz, Charlie's second lawyer\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Jay Marotta, Charlie's first lawyer\n* Azhy Robertson as Henry Barber, Nicole and Charlie's son\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Sandra, Nicole's mother\n* [[Merritt Wever]] as Cassie, Nicole's sister\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Frank\n* [[Martha Kelly]] as Nancy Katz\n* [[Mark O'Brien (actor)|Mark O'Brien]] as Carter Mitchum\n* [[Matthew Shear]] as Terry\n* [[Brooke Bloom]] as Mary Ann\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Ted\n* [[Mickey Sumner]] as Beth\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as Mediator\n* [[Rich Fulcher]] as Judge Neil Tilden\n* [[Lucas Neff]] as Pablo\n* [[Tunde Adebimpe]] as Sam\n}}\n\n[[Jasmine Cephas Jones]], [[Mary Wiseman (actress)|Mary Wiseman]], [[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]], [[Gideon Glick]], and [[Becca Blackwell]] appear as members of Nicole and Charlie's theater group.\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for the film first came to Baumbach in 2016, while in post-production on ''[[The Meyerowitz Stories]]''.

His theater company is currently producing a play that stars his wife Nicole, a former teen film actress. The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a mediator, who suggests that they each write down what they like about one another, but Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud and they decide to forgo the counseling.\n\nNicole is offered a starring role in a television pilot in [[Los Angeles]], and she decides to leave the theater company and temporarily live with her mother in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], taking the couple's young son Henry with her. Charlie decides to stay in New York, as the play is in the process of moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Despite the couple agreeing to split amicably and forgo lawyers, Nicole hires Nora Fanshaw, a family lawyer. Nicole tells Nora the full story of her relationship with Charlie and how she gradually felt neglected by him and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole also reveals that she thinks Charlie slept with the stage manager of the theater company. Charlie flies out to Los Angeles to visit his family, revealing that he has won a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] grant, but Nicole serves him divorce papers. Charlie meets with Jay Marotta, a brash and expensive lawyer who urges Charlie to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring him. He receives a call from Nora, who urges him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry. Charlie returns to Los Angeles and hires Bert Spitz, an empathetic and retired family lawyer who favors a civil and conciliatory approach.\n\nOn Bert's counsel, Charlie rents an apartment in Los Angeles to be closer to his family and strengthen his custody case. Charlie wishes to avoid going to court, so Bert arranges a meeting with Nora and Nicole. Nora argues that Charlie refused to respect Nicole's wishes to move back to Los Angeles and that Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than fly back and forth between coasts. Bert privately advises Charlie to drop his New York residency altogether, but a frustrated Charlie refuses and decides to fire him.\n\nUsing the first payout of his MacArthur Fellowship grant, Charlie hires Jay on retainer. The case moves to court, where Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients and attempt to paint the other party in a negative light. Nora highlights Charlie's past infidelity and emotional distance, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits as alcoholism and threatens criminal action for hacking into Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Charlie and Nicole remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed with the back and forth.\n\nDisillusioned with the legal process, the couple decides to meet in private away from the lawyers. A friendly discussion in Charlie's apartment devolves into a bitter argument; Nicole claims that Charlie has now fully merged with his own selfishness, and Charlie punches a hole in a wall and says he wishes that she would die. He then breaks down in shame and apologizes; Nicole comforts him. An appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry, during which Charlie accidentally cuts himself. Soon after, the couple agrees to relax their demands and reach an equal agreement to finalize the divorce, although Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole, against Nicole's wishes.\n\nA year later, Charlie's play has a successful Broadway run, while Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for directing an episode of her show. Charlie informs Nicole that he has taken a residency at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and will be living in Los Angeles full-time to be closer to Henry. Later, he discovers Henry reading Nicole's list of things she likes about Charlie she wrote down during counseling. Henry asks Charlie to read it aloud to him, and Charlie does so, becoming emotional as Nicole watches from afar. That evening, after attending a Halloween party together, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home even though it is her night. As Charlie walks out to his car carrying a sleeping Henry, Nicole stops Charlie to tie his shoe for him. He thanks her, and they part ways once more.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Nicole Barber, Charlie's wife\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Charlie Barber, Nicole's husband\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Nora Fanshaw, Nicole's lawyer\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Bert Spitz, Charlie's second lawyer\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Jay Marotta, Charlie's first lawyer\n* Azhy Robertson as Henry Barber, Nicole and Charlie's son\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Sandra, Nicole's mother\n* [[Merritt Wever]] as Cassie, Nicole's sister\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Frank\n* [[Martha Kelly]] as Nancy Katz\n* [[Mark O'Brien (actor)|Mark O'Brien]] as Carter Mitchum\n* [[Matthew Shear]] as Terry\n* [[Brooke Bloom]] as Mary Ann\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Ted\n* [[Mickey Sumner]] as Beth\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as Mediator\n* [[Rich Fulcher]] as Judge Neil Tilden\n* [[Lucas Neff]] as Pablo\n* [[Tunde Adebimpe]] as Sam\n}}\n\n[[Jasmine Cephas Jones]], [[Mary Wiseman (actress)|Mary Wiseman]], [[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]], [[Gideon Glick]], and [[Becca Blackwell]] appear as members of Nicole and Charlie's theater group.\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for the film first came to Baumbach in 2016, while in post-production on ''[[The Meyerowitz Stories]]''.

Brayton]].<ref name=\"RK-Brayton-Berkeley\"/> Richard Rudell later published the variant Espresso-MV in 1986 under the title \"Multiple-Valued Logic Minimization for PLA Synthesis\".<ref name=\"Rudell_1986\"/> Espresso has inspired many derivatives.\n\n== Introduction ==\nElectronic devices are composed of numerous blocks of digital circuits, the combination of which performs the required task. The efficient implementation of [[logic function]]s in the form of [[logic gate]] circuits (such that no more logic gates are used than are necessary) is necessary to minimize production costs, and/or maximize a device's performance.\n\n=== Designing digital logic circuits ===\nAll digital systems are composed of two elementary functions: [[Flip-flop_(electronics)|memory elements]] for storing information, and [[combinational logic|combinational circuit]]s that transform that information. [[State machine]]s, like counters, are a combination of memory elements and [[combinational logic]] circuits. Since memory elements are standard logic circuits they are selected out of a limited set of alternative circuits; so designing digital functions comes down to designing the combinational gate circuits and interconnecting them.\n\nIn general the instantiation of logic circuits from high-level abstraction is referred to as [[logic synthesis]], which can be carried out by hand, but usually some formal method by computer is applied. In this article the design methods for combinational logic circuits are briefly summarized.\n\nThe starting point for the design of a digital logic circuit is its desired functionality, having derived from the analysis of the system as a whole, the logic circuit is to make part of. The description can be stated in some algorithmic form or by logic equations, but may be summarized in the form of a table as well. The below example shows a part of such a table for a [[7-segment display]] driver that translates the binary code for the values of a decimal digit into the signals that cause the respective segments of the display to light up.\n\n<pre>\n  Digit  Code        Segments\n                   A B C D E F G\n    0    0000      1 1 1 1 1 1 0          -A-\n    1    0001      0 1 1 0 0 0 0         |   |\n    2    0010      1 1 0 1 1 0 1         F   B\n    3    0011      1 1 1 1 0 0 1         |   |\n    4    0100      0 1 1 0 0 1 1          -G-\n    5    0101      1 0 1 1 0 1 1         |   |\n    6    0110      1 0 1 1 1 1 1         E   C\n    7    0111      1 1 1 0 0 0 0         |   |\n    8    1000      1 1 1 1 1 1 1          -D-\n    9    1001      1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n</pre>\n\nThe implementation process starts with a ''logic minimization'' phase, to be described below, in order to simplify the function table by combining the separate terms into larger ones containing fewer variables.\n\nNext, the minimized result may be split up in smaller parts by a factorization procedure and is eventually mapped onto the available basic logic cells of the target technology. This operation is commonly referred to as [[logic optimization]].<ref name=\"Micheli_1994\"/>\n\n=== Classical minimization methods ===\nMinimizing [[Boolean function]]s by hand using the classical [[Karnaugh maps]] is a laborious, tedious and error prone process. It isn't suited for more than six input variables and practical only for up to four variables, while product term sharing for multiple output functions is even harder to carry out.<ref name=\"Lewin_1985\"/> Moreover, this method doesn't lend itself to be automated in the form of a computer program. However, since modern logic functions are generally not constrained to such a small number of variables, while the cost as well as the risk of making errors is prohibitive for manual implementation of logic functions, the use of computers became indispensable.\n\nThe first alternative method to become popular was the tabular method developed by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard Quine]] and [[Edward J. McCluskey|Edward McCluskey]]. Starting with the [[truth table]] for a set of logic functions, by combining the [[minterm]]s for which the functions are active (the [[ON-cover]]) or for which the function value is irrelevant (the [[Don't-care (logic)|Don't-Care]]-cover or [[DC-cover]]) a set of [[prime implicant]]s is composed. Finally, a systematic procedure is followed to find the smallest set of prime implicants the output functions can be realised with.<ref name=\"Katz_1994\"/><ref name=\"Lala_1996\"/>\n\nAlthough this [[Quine&ndash;McCluskey algorithm]] is very well suited to be implemented in a computer program, the result is still far from efficient in terms of processing time and memory usage. Adding a variable to the function will roughly double both of them, because the truth table length increases [[exponential function|exponential]]ly with the number of variables. A similar problem occurs when increasing the number of output functions of a [[combinational function]] block. As a result the Quine&ndash;McCluskey method is practical only for functions with a limited number of input variables and output functions.\n\n=== Espresso algorithm ===\nA radically different approach to this issue is followed in the Espresso algorithm, developed by Brayton et al. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"Brayton_1984\"/><ref name=\"RK-Brayton-Berkeley\"/> Rather than expanding a logic function into minterms, the program manipulates \"cubes\", representing the product terms in the ON-, DC- and [[OFF-cover]]s iteratively. Although the minimization result is not guaranteed to be the [[global minimum]], in practice this is very closely approximated, while the solution is always free from [[Logic redundancy|redundancy]]. Compared to the other methods, this one is essentially more efficient, reducing memory usage and computation time by several orders of magnitude. Its name reflects the way of instantly making a cup of fresh coffee. There is hardly any restriction to the number of variables, output functions and product terms of a combinational function block. In general, e.g. tens of variables with tens of output functions are readily dealt with.\n\nThe input for Espresso is a function table of the desired functionality; the result is a minimized table, describing either the ON-cover or the OFF-cover of the function, depending on the selected options. By default, the product terms will be shared as much as possible by the several output functions, but the program can be instructed to handle each of the output functions separately. This allows for efficient implementation in [[two-level logic]] arrays such as a [[Programmable Logic Array|PLA]] (Programmable Logic Array) or a [[Programmable Array Logic|PAL]] (Programmable Array Logic).\n\nThe Espresso algorithm proved so successful that it has been incorporated as a standard logic function minimization step into virtually any contemporary [[logic synthesis]] tool. For implementing a function in [[multi-level logic]], the minimization result is optimized by factorization and mapped onto the available basic logic cells in the target technology, whether this concerns an [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) or an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC).\n\n== Software ==\n\n=== Espresso ===\nThe original ''Espresso'' program is available as [[C (programming language)|C]] source code from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] website.  The last release was version 2.3 dated 1988.<ref name=\"Espresso\"/>  The ''Espresso-ab'' and ''eqntott'' (equation to truth table) program, an updated version of Espresso for modern [[POSIX]] systems, is available in [[Debian]] [[Linux distribution]] (.deb) file format as well the C source code.  The last release was version 9.0 dated 2008.<ref name=\"Espresso-eb\"/>\n\n=== Logic Friday ===\n<!-- Note: section title used in redirects -->\n''Logic Friday'' is a free [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] program that provides a graphical interface to Espresso, as well as to misII, another module in the Berkeley Octtools package. With Logic Friday users can enter a logic function as a truth table, equation, or gate diagram, minimize the function, and then view the results in both of the other two representations.  The last release was version 1.1.4 dated 2012.<ref name=\"Logic_Friday\"/>\n\n=== Minilog ===\n''Minilog'' is a free Windows program that provides logic minimization exploiting this Espresso algorithm.
