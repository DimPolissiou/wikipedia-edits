DPIs are commonly used to treat [[respiratory disease]]s such as [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]], [[emphysema]] and [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] although DPIs (such as [[Inhalable insulin]]) have also been used in the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021868mg.pdf |title=Exubera Prescribing Information |accessdate=2009-02-27 |website=FDA.gov |publisher=Pfizer |date=April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118010209/https://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021868mg.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDPIs are an alternative to the aerosol-based inhalers commonly called [[metered-dose inhaler]] (or MDI). The DPIs may require some procedure to allow a measured dose of powder to be ready for the patient to take. The medication is commonly held either in a capsule for manual loading or a proprietary from inside the inhaler. Once loaded or actuated, the operator puts the mouthpiece of the inhaler into their mouth and takes a sharp, deep inhalation (ensuring that the medication reaches the lower parts of the lungs), holding their breath for 5\u201310 seconds. There are a variety of such devices. The dose that can be delivered is typically less than a few tens of milligrams in a single breath since larger powder doses may lead to provocation of [[cough]].\n\nMost DPIs rely on the force of patient inhalation to entrain powder from the device and subsequently break-up the powder into particles that are small enough to reach the lungs.<ref name=\"isbn0-12-256971-7\">{{cite book |author=Finlay, Warren H. |title=The mechanics of inhaled pharmaceutical aerosols: an introduction |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=978-0-12-256971-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> For this reason, insufficient patient inhalation flow rates may lead to reduced dose delivery and incomplete deaggregation of the powder, leading to unsatisfactory device performance. Thus, most DPIs have a minimum inspiratory effort that is needed for proper use and it is for this reason that such DPIs are normally used only in older children and adults.\n\n== Inhaler Technique and Use ==\nWhile DPIs are commonly used in the treatment of lung-based disorders, their use requires dexterity to complete the required sequential steps to achieve application of these devices. Incorrect completion of one or more steps in the use of a DPI can substantially reduce the delivery of the administrated medication and consequently its effectiveness and safety. Numerous studies have demonstrated that between 50-100% of patients do not use their inhaler devices correctly, with patients often unaware that they are using their inhaled medication incorrectly.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Inhaler Misuse in an Older Adult Population|last=Vanderman|first=Adam J.|last2=Moss|first2=Jason M.|date=February 2015|journal=The Consultant Pharmacist|volume=30|issue=2|pages=92\u2013100|doi=10.4140/tcp.n.2015.92|pmid=25695415|last3=Bailey|first3=Janine C.|last4=Melnyk|first4=S.

DPIs are commonly used to treat [[respiratory disease]]s such as [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]], [[emphysema]] and [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] although DPIs (such as [[Inhalable insulin|inhalable insulin Afrezza]]) have also been used in the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021868mg.pdf |title=Exubera Prescribing Information |accessdate=2009-02-27 |website=FDA.gov |publisher=Pfizer |date=April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118010209/https://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021868mg.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDPIs are an alternative to the aerosol-based inhalers commonly called [[metered-dose inhaler]] (or MDI). The DPIs may require some procedure to allow a measured dose of powder to be ready for the patient to take. The medication is commonly held either in a capsule for manual loading or a proprietary from inside the inhaler. Once loaded or actuated, the operator puts the mouthpiece of the inhaler into their mouth and takes a sharp, deep inhalation (ensuring that the medication reaches the lower parts of the lungs), holding their breath for 5\u201310 seconds. There are a variety of such devices. The dose that can be delivered is typically less than a few tens of milligrams in a single breath since larger powder doses may lead to provocation of [[cough]].\n\nMost DPIs rely on the force of patient inhalation to entrain powder from the device and subsequently break-up the powder into particles that are small enough to reach the lungs.<ref name=\"isbn0-12-256971-7\">{{cite book |author=Finlay, Warren H. |title=The mechanics of inhaled pharmaceutical aerosols: an introduction |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=978-0-12-256971-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> For this reason, insufficient patient inhalation flow rates may lead to reduced dose delivery and incomplete deaggregation of the powder, leading to unsatisfactory device performance. Thus, most DPIs have a minimum inspiratory effort that is needed for proper use and it is for this reason that such DPIs are normally used only in older children and adults.\n\n== Inhaler Technique and Use ==\nWhile DPIs are commonly used in the treatment of lung-based disorders, their use requires dexterity to complete the required sequential steps to achieve application of these devices. Incorrect completion of one or more steps in the use of a DPI can substantially reduce the delivery of the administrated medication and consequently its effectiveness and safety. Numerous studies have demonstrated that between 50-100% of patients do not use their inhaler devices correctly, with patients often unaware that they are using their inhaled medication incorrectly.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Inhaler Misuse in an Older Adult Population|last=Vanderman|first=Adam J.|last2=Moss|first2=Jason M.|date=February 2015|journal=The Consultant Pharmacist|volume=30|issue=2|pages=92\u2013100|doi=10.4140/tcp.n.2015.92|pmid=25695415|last3=Bailey|first3=Janine C.|last4=Melnyk|first4=S.

{"title_page": "James VI and I and religious issues", "text_new": "[[File:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|200px|James VI and I was baptised [[Roman Catholic]], but brought up [[Presbyterian]] and leaned [[Anglican]] during his rule. He was a lifelong [[Protestant]], but had to cope with issues surrounding the many religious views of his era, including [[Anglicanism]], [[Presbyterianism]], [[Roman Catholicism]] and differing opinions of multiple [[English Separatists]].]]\n'''[[James VI and I]]''' (James Stuart) (June 19, 1566 \u2013 March 27, 1625), [[List of monarchs of Scotland|King of Scots]], [[List of English monarchs|King of England]], and [[king of Ireland]], faced many complicated religious challenges during his reigns in [[Scotland]] and [[England]].\n\nIn Scotland, he inherited a developing [[Scottish Reformation|reformed church]], [[Church of Scotland|the Kirk]], which was attempting to rid the country of [[bishop]]s, [[diocese]]s, and [[parish]]es and establish a fully [[Presbyterian]] system, run by [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]s and [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]. However, James saw the bishops as the natural allies of the monarchy and frequently came into conflict with the Kirk in his sustained effort to reintroduce an [[episcopal polity]] to Scotland.\n\nOn his succession to the English throne, James was impressed by the church system he found there, which still adhered to an episcopate and supported the monarch's position as the head of the church. On the other hand, there were many more [[Roman Catholics]] in England than in Scotland, and James inherited a set of penal laws which he was constantly exhorted to enforce against them. Before ascending the English throne, James had assured the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] that he would not persecute \"any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law,\" but he soon reinforced strict penalties against Catholics. Partly triggered by Catholics' disillusionment with the new king, the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 led to a new wave of anti-Catholicism and even harsher legislation. In 1606, an oath of allegiance was introduced, though its enforcement later slackened.<ref>Krugler, p. 20\u201324.</ref> His policy of seeking a [[Spanish Match]] for his son, [[Charles I of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]], produced widespread opposition, particularly in the Commons, where members feared a revival of Catholic power in the country and a threat to the [[Protestant]] monarchy and state.\n\n==Puritans and other Dissenters==\nOn James's arrival in London, the [[Puritan]] clergy presented him with the [[Millenary Petition]], allegedly signed by a thousand English clergy, requesting reforms in the church, particularly the abolition of [[confirmation]], [[wedding ring]]s, and the term \"priest\", and that the wearing of cap and [[surplice]], which they regarded as  \"outward badges of Popish errours\", be made optional.<ref>Croft, p 156; Willson, p. 201.</ref> James, however, equated English Puritans with Scottish [[Presbyterians]] and, after banning religious petitions, told the [[Hampton Court Conference]] of 1604 that he preferred the status quo,<ref>When Puritans spoke against ceremonies because they had been used when England was Catholic, James said shoes had been worn when England was Catholic, so why didn\u2019t Puritans go barefoot? Willson, p 200. When an unmarried Puritan speaker objected to the phrase \"With my body I thee worship\" from the marriage service, James replied: \"Many a man speaks of [[Robin Hood]] who never shot his bow\".

He was a lifelong [[Protestant]], but had to cope with issues surrounding the many religious views of his era, including [[Anglicanism]], [[Presbyterianism]], [[Roman Catholicism]] and differing opinions of multiple [[English Separatists]].]]\n'''[[James VI and I]]''' (James Stuart) (June 19, 1566 \u2013 March 27, 1625), [[List of monarchs of Scotland|King of Scots]], [[List of English monarchs|King of England]], and [[king of Ireland]], faced many complicated religious challenges during his reigns in [[Scotland]] and [[England]].\n\nIn Scotland, he inherited a developing [[Scottish Reformation|reformed church]], [[Church of Scotland|the Kirk]], which was attempting to rid the country of [[bishop]]s, [[diocese]]s, and [[parish]]es and establish a fully [[Presbyterian]] system, run by [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]s and [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]. However, James saw the bishops as the natural allies of the monarchy and frequently came into conflict with the Kirk in his sustained effort to reintroduce an [[episcopal polity]] to Scotland.\n\nOn his succession to the English throne, James was impressed by the church system he found there, which still adhered to an episcopate and supported the monarch's position as the head of the church. On the other hand, there were many more [[Roman Catholics]] in England than in Scotland, and James inherited a set of penal laws which he was constantly exhorted to enforce against them. Before ascending the English throne, James had assured the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] that he would not persecute \"any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law,\" but he soon reinforced strict penalties against Catholics. Partly triggered by Catholics' disillusionment with the new king, the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 led to a new wave of anti-Catholicism and even harsher legislation. In 1606, an oath of allegiance was introduced, though its enforcement later slackened.<ref>Krugler, p. 20\u201324.</ref> His policy of seeking a [[Spanish Match]] for his son, [[Charles I of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]], produced widespread opposition, particularly in the Commons, where members feared a revival of Catholic power in the country and a threat to the [[Protestant]] monarchy and state.\n\n==Puritans and other Dissenters==\nOn James's arrival in London, the [[Puritan]] clergy presented him with the [[Millenary Petition]], allegedly signed by a thousand English clergy, requesting reforms in the church, particularly the abolition of [[confirmation]], [[wedding ring]]s, and the term \"priest\", and that the wearing of cap and [[surplice]], which they regarded as  \"outward badges of Popish errours\", be made optional.<ref>Croft, p 156; Willson, p. 201.</ref> James, however, equated English Puritans with Scottish [[Presbyterians]] and, after banning religious petitions, told the [[Hampton Court Conference]] of 1604 that he preferred the status quo,<ref>When Puritans spoke against ceremonies because they had been used when England was Catholic, James said shoes had been worn when England was Catholic, so why didn\u2019t Puritans go barefoot? Willson, p 200. When an unmarried Puritan speaker objected to the phrase \"With my body I thee worship\" from the marriage service, James replied: \"Many a man speaks of [[Robin Hood]] who never shot his bow\".

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.\n\nThere is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources. Those requiring metrics associated with OER are often those with economic investment in the technologies needed to access or provide electronic OER, those with economic interests potentially threatened by OER,<ref>{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (Policy implications and recommendations)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=15|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}</ref> or those requiring justification for the costs of implementing and maintaining the infrastructure or access to the freely available OER.

Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).

Currently, more than 60 students are listed as its members.\n\n== Open Educational Practices ==\nOER have been used in educational contexts in a variety of ways, and researchers and practitioners have proposed different names for such practices. According to Wiley & Hilton (2018),<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> the two popular terms used are \"open pedagogy\" and \"open educational practices\". What these two terms refer to is closely related to each other, often indistinguishable. For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies.

There are many questions to be dealt with in this area; for universities, academic management and teaching staff. Teachers in all educational sectors require support and guidance to be able to use OER pedagogically and with quality in focus. To realize the full potential of OER for students' learning it is not enough to make patchwork use of OER{{snd}} resources have to be put into context. Valuable teacher time should be used for contextual work and not simply for the creation of content. The aim of the project OER for learning OERSweden is to stimulate an open discussion about collaboration in infrastructural questions regarding open online knowledge sharing. A network of ten universities led by Karlstad University will arrange a series of open webinars during the project period focusing on the use and production of open educational resources. A virtual platform for Swedish OER initiatives and resources will also be developed. The project intends to focus in particular on how OER affects teacher trainers and decision makers. The objectives of the project are: To increase the level of national collaboration between universities and educational organisations in the use and production of OER, To find effective online methods to support teachers and students, in terms of quality, technology and retrievability of OER, To raise awareness for the potential of webinars as a tool for open online learning, To increase the level of collaboration between universities' support functions and foster national resource sharing, with a base in modern library and educational technology units, and To contribute to the creation of a national university structure for tagging, distribution and storage of OER.\n\nFounded in 2007, the [[CK-12 Foundation]] is a California-based [[non-profit]] organization whose stated mission is to reduce the cost of, and increase access to, K-12 education in the United States and worldwide.<ref name=\"svbj\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/print-edition/2014/03/28/the-reinvention-of-neeru-khosla.html?ana=sm_sjo_ucp27&b=1395941537^14150321 |title=The reinvention of Neeru Khosla |newspaper=Silicon Valley Business Journal |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref>  CK-12 provides free and fully customizable [[K-12]] open educational resources aligned to state curriculum standards and tailored to meet student and teacher needs.

This initiative encourages and supports local professors and authors to contribute with individual sections or chapters that could be assembled into customized books by the whole community. The created books are freely available to the students in an electronic format or could be legally printed at low cost because there is no license or fees to be paid for their distribution, since all they are released as OER with a Creative Commons [[CC-BY-SA]] license. This solution also contributes to the creation of customized textbooks where each professor could select the sections appropriate for their courses or could freely adapt existing sections to their needs. Also, the local professors will be the sink and source of the knowledge, contextualized to the Latin American Higher Education system.\n\nIn 2014, the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]] started funding the establishment of an OER World Map that documents OER initiatives around the world.

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.\n\nThere is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources. Those requiring metrics associated with OER are often those with economic investment in the technologies needed to access or provide electronic OER, those with economic interests potentially threatened by OER,<ref>{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (Policy implications and recommendations)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=15|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}</ref> or those requiring justification for the costs of implementing and maintaining the infrastructure or access to the freely available OER.

Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).

Currently, more than 60 students are listed as its members.\n\n== Open Educational Practices ==\nOER have been used in educational contexts in a variety of ways, and researchers and practitioners have proposed different names for such practices. According to Wiley & Hilton (2018),<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> the two popular terms used are \"open pedagogy\" and \"open educational practices\". What these two terms refer to is closely related to each other, often indistinguishable. For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies.

During the planning phase, the team was careful to select core, high-enrollment courses that could impact as many students as possible, regardless of specific course of study. At the same time, the team looked beyond individual courses to create depth and quality around full pathways for students to earn an entire degree.

There are many questions to be dealt with in this area; for universities, academic management and teaching staff. Teachers in all educational sectors require support and guidance to be able to use OER pedagogically and with quality in focus. To realize the full potential of OER for students' learning it is not enough to make patchwork use of OER{{snd}} resources have to be put into context. Valuable teacher time should be used for contextual work and not simply for the creation of content. The aim of the project OER for learning OERSweden is to stimulate an open discussion about collaboration in infrastructural questions regarding open online knowledge sharing. A network of ten universities led by Karlstad University will arrange a series of open webinars during the project period focusing on the use and production of open educational resources. A virtual platform for Swedish OER initiatives and resources will also be developed. The project intends to focus in particular on how OER affects teacher trainers and decision makers. The objectives of the project are: To increase the level of national collaboration between universities and educational organisations in the use and production of OER, To find effective online methods to support teachers and students, in terms of quality, technology and retrievability of OER, To raise awareness for the potential of webinars as a tool for open online learning, To increase the level of collaboration between universities' support functions and foster national resource sharing, with a base in modern library and educational technology units, and To contribute to the creation of a national university structure for tagging, distribution and storage of OER.\n\nFounded in 2007, the [[CK-12 Foundation]] is a California-based [[non-profit]] organization whose stated mission is to reduce the cost of, and increase access to, K-12 education in the United States and worldwide.<ref name=\"svbj\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/print-edition/2014/03/28/the-reinvention-of-neeru-khosla.html?ana=sm_sjo_ucp27&b=1395941537^14150321 |title=The reinvention of Neeru Khosla |newspaper=Silicon Valley Business Journal |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref>  CK-12 provides free and fully customizable [[K-12]] open educational resources aligned to state curriculum standards and tailored to meet student and teacher needs.
