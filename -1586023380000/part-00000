Gear drive with a Torque Amplifier as an option. 4wd option utilising ZF side drive front axle. 685 could be specified with Hydro transmission.\nIndustrial models kept the 248/258/268/278/288 model numbers but had \"H pattern gearshift\".\n\nIH Doncaster supplied transmissions to the USA (initially Louisville) which were built into tractors with the same model designations as the Doncaster produced tractors. Also some were specifically for US only models (240/250/260/270?). Some had torque converter transmissions.\nThey also supplied transmissions to Kimco in Japan (joint venture IH/Komatsu) who built them into tractors and designed their own four wheel drive axle. This axle was later imported and fitted mainly to 84 series tractors by Doncaster. Designed for traction in paddy field use it proved not to be robust enough to carry the weight when front loaders were fitted.\nIH Doncaster also supplied transmissions for the Volvo BM T500, 2200, 2204, 2250 and 2254 tractors.\nBalers were assembled in Liverpool, but this was transferred to Carr Hill Works in Doncaster models were: B46/B47/430/440/435/445.\nCarr Hill also assembled Lodestar trucks in the mid/late 1960s.\nThe Wheatley Hall Road factory also produced agricultural crawler tractors BTD5/BTD6/BTD8/BTD20 in red as well as yellow CE bulldozer and loader versions.

Also some were specifically for US only models (240/250/260/270?). Some had torque converter transmissions.\nThey also supplied transmissions to Kimco in Japan (joint venture IH/Komatsu) who built them into tractors and designed their own four wheel drive axle. This axle was later imported and fitted mainly to 84 series tractors by Doncaster. Designed for traction in paddy field use it proved not to be robust enough to carry the weight when front loaders were fitted.\nIH Doncaster also supplied transmissions for the Volvo BM T500, 2200, 2204, 2250 and 2254 tractors.\nBalers were assembled in Liverpool, but this was transferred to Carr Hill Works in Doncaster models were: B46/B47/430/440/435/445.\nCarr Hill also assembled Lodestar trucks in the mid/late 1960s.\nThe Wheatley Hall Road factory also produced agricultural crawler tractors BTD5/BTD6/BTD8/BTD20 in red as well as yellow CE bulldozer and loader versions.

The official designation of '''SH 45''' is such to form a complete loop around Austin, a distance of roughly {{convert|80|mi|km}}.\n\nOne segment is in southwest Austin and runs roughly southeast from [[Ranch to Market Road 1826]] to [[Farm to Market Road 1626]] and intersects the southern terminus of [[State Highway Loop 1 (Texas)|Loop 1 (Mopac Expressway)]]. Between RM 1826 and Loop 1, the roadway is a divided, four-lane facility with a wide median intended to accommodate a future freeway, after which the current lanes would serve as [[frontage road|frontage roads]]. Between Loop 1 and FM 1626, the roadway becomes a freeway.\n\nThe other segment is a [[toll road]] that forms a backwards C-shape along the boundary of Travis and Williamson County before bending down along the eastern edge of the Austin metropolitan area where it shares its route with [[Texas State Highway 130|SH-130]].\n\n==Route description==\nBefore the 2002 [[Central Texas Turnpike Project|Central Texas Turnpike Project (CTTP)]], SH 45 existed only as a short section of four-lane, divided highway in southwest Austin. The CTTP added a [[toll road]] that runs east from [[U.S. Highway 183 (Texas)|US 183]] near [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]], crosses [[Interstate 35 (Texas)|I-35]], bi-secting the [[La Frontera (Round Rock, Texas)|La Frontera]] development, and meets [[State Highway 130 (Texas)|SH 130]] near [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]]. South of this interchange, SH 45 is co-signed with SH 130 to US 183 just south of [[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]]. SH 45 then loops westward rejoining I-35 north of [[Buda, Texas|Buda]].\n\n===SH 45 North===\n'''SH 45 North''' is an approximately {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=on}} segment in the north Austin metropolitan area. The freeway's western terminus is at US 183 northwest of Austin in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. For a distance, RM 620 travels concurrently with the frontage roads also designated as State Highway 45 (non-tolled). Heading east, the freeway intercepts [[State Highway Loop 1 (Texas)|Loop 1]]'s northern terminus, bisects [[La Frontera (Round Rock, Texas)|La Frontera]] and crosses I-35. This particular segment ends at SH 130 near Pflugerville, but the SH 45 designation continues southward along SH 130.\n\n[[Image:Texas45.jpg|thumb|left|State Highway 45 interchange with Interstate 35 under construction.]]\n\nThe [[TxDOT|Texas Department of Transportation]] had originally planned to complete construction of the entire 2002 CTTP in September 2007 but opened some sections of SH 45 North as early as October 31, 2006.\n\n===SH 45 Southeast===\n'''SH 45 Southeast''' is a {{convert|7.4|mi|km|adj=on}}, tolled segment southeast of Austin, near [[Creedmoor, Texas]]. Roughly paralleling [[Farm to Market Road 1327]], it is a four-lane, controlled-access facility that links SH 130 and US 183 to Interstate 35 north of [[Buda, Texas]]. It completes the SH 45 eastern bypass loop around the Austin metropolitan area.\n\nOriginally planned as part of the 2002 CTTP, SH 45 Southeast became the subject of controversy, delaying development and necessitating it as a separate project. In 2006, an environmental advocacy group filed a lawsuit in an effort to move the alignment further south. By the summer of the same year, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] approved a new environmental impact study affirming the existing alignment, and a federal judge dismissed the case, clearing the way for construction, which began in Summer 2007. SH 45 Southeast was opened to traffic on May 7, 2009.\n\n===SH 45 Southwest===\n'''SH 45 Southwest''' is a {{convert|3.6|mi|km|adj=on}} tollway link between the southern terminus of [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Loop 1]] in the west and [[Farm to Market Road 1626]] to the east. It is a four-lane, controlled-access facility and has a toll rate of $1. Construction on the SH 45 Southwest link officially began in November 2016, after decades of delays due to environmental and legislative concerns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nearly 30 years in the making, construction on SH 45 SW Toll starts|url=http://kxan.com/2016/11/08/nearly-30-years-in-the-making-construction-on-sh-45sw-toll-starts/|publisher=KXAN News|date=Nov 9, 2016|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>  SH 45 Southwest was opened to traffic on June 1, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=SH45 opens June 1 |url=https://haysfreepress.com/2019/05/29/sh45-opens-june-1/ |accessdate=June 1, 2019 |agency=Hays Free Press |publisher=Hays Free Press |date=May 29, 2019}}</ref> The highway will still require a segment between FM 1626 and I-35 to connect to the other tolled segments of SH 45.

Opponents claimed the proximity of the southwestern and southeastern sections would create more pressure to connect the two and that, if built, the link would encourage development on or near environmentally sensitive land.\n\nPlanning for the western portions of SH 45 to form a complete loop is still very early, although a proposal for possible route has already been offered by the [[Lakeway, Texas|City of Lakeway]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Cassie|last=McKee|url=http://www.fourpointsnews.com/2014/10/03/campo-held-public-meeting-extending-hwy-45-lakeway-proposed-toll-road-goes-four-points/|title=CAMPO held public meeting on extending Hwy. 45, Lakeway proposed toll road goes through Four Points|publisher=Four Points News|date=October 3, 2014|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beecavebee.com/news/local-news/455-sh-45-w-proposal-garners-campo-support|title=SH 45 W. proposal garners CAMPO support|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=November 23, 2016|publisher=Bee Cave Bee}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Old Texas 45.svg|50px|left]] State Highway 45 was originally designated on August 18, 1919 as a route from [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]] to [[Louisiana]] border.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003676807.pdf | title = Minutes of the Twenty-Seventh Adjourned Regular Monthly Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = August 18, 1919 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> On September 17, 1923, the section west of [[Roans Prairie, Texas|Roans Prairie]] was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003676879.pdf | title = Minutes of the Seventy-Second and First Adjourned Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = September 17, 1923 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> On August 11, 1925, SH 45 was rerouted through Point Blank, Coldspring and Shepherd.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003676912.pdf | title = Minutes of the Eightieth Regular Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = August 10, 1925 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> On March 19, 1929, a branch of SH 45 on a more direct route from Point Blank to Livingston was designated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003673781.pdf | title = Minutes of the One Hundred and Thirty-Second Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = March 18, 1929 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> As of March 19, 1930, large portions of the highway were still under construction along the proposed route. The section of the branch from Point Blank to Coldspring was renumbered as [[Texas State Highway 156|SH 156]] and the section of the branch from Coldspring to Shepherd was renumbered as part of SH 150, so that SH 45 went on the most direct route between Point Blank and Livingston. By 1938, the road was complete, with small portions remaining as a dirt road. On September 26, 1939, the highway from [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]] to Jasper had been transferred to [[U.S. Highway 190 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 190]], the stretch from Jasper to the Louisiana border transferred to [[State Highway 63 (Texas)|SH 63]], and the section from Roan's Prairie to Huntsville redirected north to [[Crockett, Texas|Crockett]]. on August 24, 1960, the stretch from Huntsville to Crockett was transferred to [[State Highway 19 (Texas)|SH 19]]. On December 15, 1960, the rest of SH 45 was canceled and transferred to [[State Highway 30 (Texas)|SH 30]]. The current route was designated, but not constructed, on May 22, 1985 as a proposed Austin Loop, along with [[State Highway 130 (Texas)|SH 130]] (north of US 183 only).\nSH 45A was a spur designated on September 14, 1926 from Coldspring west to New Waverly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003676948.pdf | title = Minutes of the Ninety-Eighth Regular Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = September 13, 1926 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> On March 19, 1930, this spur was renumbered as [[Texas State Highway 150|SH 150]].\n\n==Exit list==\n<!--should it be clockwise or south to north?-->\n{{jcttop}}\n{{TXint\n|county=Williamson|cspan=13\n|location=Austin|lspan=5\n|road={{jct|state=TX|RM|620|name1=SH 45 west<!--not signed from Toll 45, but there's reassurance after Pecan Park-->|road=Pecan Park Boulevard}}\n}}\n{{TXint\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=TX|US|183|Toll|183A|dir2=north}}\n|notes=Counterclockwise exit and clockwise entrance\n}}\n{{TXint\n|type=incomplete\n|road=Lake Creek Parkway\n|notes=Counterclockwise exit and clockwise entrance\n}}\n{{TXint\n|place=toll plaza\n}}\n{{TXint\n|road={{jct|state=TX|FM|734|name1=Parmer Lane}}\n}}\n{{TXint\n|location=none\n|road={{jct|state=TX|RM|620|extra=hospital}}\n|notes=Access to Round Rock Medical Center\n}}\n{{TXint\n|location=none\n|road=O'Connor Drive / McNeil Road<!--eastbound only-->\n}}\n{{TXint\n|location=none\n|road={{jct|state=TX|Toll|1|dir1=south}}\n}}\n{{TXint\n|location=Round Rock|lspan=5\n|road={{jct|state=TX|FM|1325|name1=La Frontera Boulevard|road=County Road 172}}\n}}\n{{TXint\n|road={{jct|state=TX|I|35|city1=Waco}}\n|notes=I-35 exit 250B; no direct exits to I-35 south (signed eastbound at FM 1325 and westbound at A.W.

The official designation of '''SH 45''' is such to form a complete loop around Austin, a distance of roughly {{convert|80|mi|km}}.\n\nOne segment is in southwest Austin and runs roughly southeast from [[Ranch to Market Road 1826]] to [[Farm to Market Road 1626]] and intersects the southern terminus of [[State Highway Loop 1 (Texas)|Loop 1 (Mopac Expressway)]]. Between RM 1826 and Loop 1, the roadway is a divided, four-lane facility with a wide median intended to accommodate a future freeway, after which the current lanes would serve as [[frontage road|frontage roads]]. Between Loop 1 and FM 1626, the roadway becomes a freeway.\n\nThe other segment is a [[toll road]] that forms a backwards C-shape along the boundary of Travis and Williamson County before bending down along the eastern edge of the Austin metropolitan area where it shares its route with [[Texas State Highway 130|SH-130]].\n\n==Route description==\nBefore the 2002 [[Central Texas Turnpike Project|Central Texas Turnpike Project (CTTP)]], SH 45 existed only as a short section of four-lane, divided highway in southwest Austin. The CTTP added a [[toll road]] that runs east from [[U.S. Highway 183 (Texas)|US 183]] near [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]], crosses [[Interstate 35 (Texas)|I-35]], bi-secting the [[La Frontera (Round Rock, Texas)|La Frontera]] development, and meets [[State Highway 130 (Texas)|SH 130]] near [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]]. South of this interchange, SH 45 is co-signed with SH 130 to US 183 just south of [[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]]. SH 45 then loops westward rejoining I-35 north of [[Buda, Texas|Buda]].\n\n===SH 45 North===\n'''SH 45 North''' is an approximately {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=on}} segment in the north Austin metropolitan area. The freeway's western terminus is at US 183 northwest of Austin in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. For a distance, RM 620 travels concurrently with the frontage roads also designated as State Highway 45 (non-tolled). Heading east, the freeway intercepts [[State Highway Loop 1 (Texas)|Loop 1]]'s northern terminus, bisects [[La Frontera (Round Rock, Texas)|La Frontera]] and crosses I-35. This particular segment ends at SH 130 near Pflugerville, but the SH 45 designation continues southward along SH 130.\n\n[[Image:Texas45.jpg|thumb|left|State Highway 45 interchange with Interstate 35 under construction.]]\n\nThe [[TxDOT|Texas Department of Transportation]] had originally planned to complete construction of the entire 2002 CTTP in September 2007 but opened some sections of SH 45 North as early as October 31, 2006.\n\n===SH 45 Southeast===\n'''SH 45 Southeast''' is a {{convert|7.4|mi|km|adj=on}}, tolled segment southeast of Austin, near [[Creedmoor, Texas]]. Roughly paralleling [[Farm to Market Road 1327]], it is a four-lane, controlled-access facility that links SH 130 and US 183 to Interstate 35 north of [[Buda, Texas]]. It completes the SH 45 eastern bypass loop around the Austin metropolitan area.\n\nOriginally planned as part of the 2002 CTTP, SH 45 Southeast became the subject of controversy, delaying development and necessitating it as a separate project. In 2006, an environmental advocacy group filed a lawsuit in an effort to move the alignment further south. By the summer of the same year, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] approved a new environmental impact study affirming the existing alignment, and a federal judge dismissed the case, clearing the way for construction, which began in Summer 2007. SH 45 Southeast was opened to traffic on May 7, 2009.\n\n===SH 45 Southwest===\n'''SH 45 Southwest''' is a {{convert|3.6|mi|km|adj=on}} tollway link between the southern terminus of [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Loop 1]] in the west and [[Farm to Market Road 1626]] to the east. It is a four-lane, controlled-access facility and has a toll rate of $1. Construction on the SH 45 Southwest link officially began in November 2016, after decades of delays due to environmental and legislative concerns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nearly 30 years in the making, construction on SH 45 SW Toll starts|url=http://kxan.com/2016/11/08/nearly-30-years-in-the-making-construction-on-sh-45sw-toll-starts/|publisher=KXAN News|date=Nov 9, 2016|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>  SH 45 Southwest was opened to traffic on June 1, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=SH45 opens June 1 |url=https://haysfreepress.com/2019/05/29/sh45-opens-june-1/ |accessdate=June 1, 2019 |agency=Hays Free Press |publisher=Hays Free Press |date=May 29, 2019}}</ref> The highway will still require a segment between FM 1626 and I-35 to connect to the other tolled segments of SH 45.

Opponents claimed the proximity of the southwestern and southeastern sections would create more pressure to connect the two and that, if built, the link would encourage development on or near environmentally sensitive land.\n\nPlanning for the western portions of SH 45 to form a complete loop is still very early, although a proposal for possible route has already been offered by the [[Lakeway, Texas|City of Lakeway]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Cassie|last=McKee|url=http://www.fourpointsnews.com/2014/10/03/campo-held-public-meeting-extending-hwy-45-lakeway-proposed-toll-road-goes-four-points/|title=CAMPO held public meeting on extending Hwy. 45, Lakeway proposed toll road goes through Four Points|publisher=Four Points News|date=October 3, 2014|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beecavebee.com/news/local-news/455-sh-45-w-proposal-garners-campo-support|title=SH 45 W. proposal garners CAMPO support|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=November 23, 2016|publisher=Bee Cave Bee}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Old Texas 45.svg|50px|left]] State Highway 45 was originally designated on August 18, 1919 as a route from [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]] to [[Louisiana]] border.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003676807.pdf | title = Minutes of the Twenty-Seventh Adjourned Regular Monthly Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = August 18, 1919 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> On September 17, 1923, the section west of [[Roans Prairie, Texas|Roans Prairie]] was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003676879.pdf | title = Minutes of the Seventy-Second and First Adjourned Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = September 17, 1923 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> On August 11, 1925, SH 45 was rerouted through Point Blank, Coldspring and Shepherd.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003676912.pdf | title = Minutes of the Eightieth Regular Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = August 10, 1925 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> On March 19, 1929, a branch of SH 45 on a more direct route from Point Blank to Livingston was designated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003673781.pdf | title = Minutes of the One Hundred and Thirty-Second Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = March 18, 1929 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> As of March 19, 1930, large portions of the highway were still under construction along the proposed route. The section of the branch from Point Blank to Coldspring was renumbered as [[Texas State Highway 156|SH 156]] and the section of the branch from Coldspring to Shepherd was renumbered as part of SH 150, so that SH 45 went on the most direct route between Point Blank and Livingston. By 1938, the road was complete, with small portions remaining as a dirt road. On September 26, 1939, the highway from [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]] to Jasper had been transferred to [[U.S. Highway 190 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 190]], the stretch from Jasper to the Louisiana border transferred to [[State Highway 63 (Texas)|SH 63]], and the section from Roan's Prairie to Huntsville redirected north to [[Crockett, Texas|Crockett]]. on August 24, 1960, the stretch from Huntsville to Crockett was transferred to [[State Highway 19 (Texas)|SH 19]]. On December 15, 1960, the rest of SH 45 was canceled and transferred to [[State Highway 30 (Texas)|SH 30]]. The current route was designated, but not constructed, on May 22, 1985 as a proposed Austin Loop, along with [[State Highway 130 (Texas)|SH 130]] (north of US 183 only).\nSH 45A was a spur designated on September 14, 1926 from Coldspring west to New Waverly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003676948.pdf | title = Minutes of the Ninety-Eighth Regular Meeting of the State Highway Commission | date = September 13, 1926 | publisher = Texas Department of Transportation}}</ref> On March 19, 1930, this spur was renumbered as [[Texas State Highway 150|SH 150]].\n\n==Exit list==\n<!--should it be clockwise or south to north?-->\n{{jcttop}}\n{{TXint\n|county=Williamson|cspan=13\n|location=Austin|lspan=5\n|road={{jct|state=TX|RM|620|name1=SH 45 west<!--not signed from Toll 45, but there's reassurance after Pecan Park-->|road=Pecan Park Boulevard}}\n}}\n{{TXint\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=TX|US|183|Toll|183A|dir2=north}}\n|notes=Counterclockwise exit and clockwise entrance\n}}\n{{TXint\n|type=incomplete\n|road=Lake Creek Parkway\n|notes=Counterclockwise exit and clockwise entrance\n}}\n{{TXint\n|place=toll plaza\n}}\n{{TXint\n|road={{jct|state=TX|FM|734|name1=Parmer Lane}}\n}}\n{{TXint\n|location=none\n|road={{jct|state=TX|RM|620|extra=hospital}}\n|notes=Access to Round Rock Medical Center\n}}\n{{TXint\n|location=none\n|road=O'Connor Drive / McNeil Road<!--eastbound only-->\n}}\n{{TXint\n|location=none\n|road={{jct|state=TX|Toll|1|dir1=south}}\n}}\n{{TXint\n|location=Round Rock|lspan=5\n|road={{jct|state=TX|FM|1325|name1=La Frontera Boulevard|road=County Road 172}}\n}}\n{{TXint\n|road={{jct|state=TX|I|35|city1=Waco}}\n|notes=I-35 exit 250B; no direct exits to I-35 south (signed eastbound at FM 1325 and westbound at A.W.

(Princeton University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|978-0-691-16575-2}})</ref> Descartes is also widely regarded as one of the founders of [[modern philosophy]].\n\nMany elements of Descartes' philosophy have precedents in late [[Aristotelianism]], the [[Neostoicism|revived Stoicism]] of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In his [[natural philosophy]], he differed from the [[Scholasticism|schools]] on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of [[Matter|corporeal substance]] into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to [[Teleology|final ends]], divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson: Allyn & Bacon |year=2001 |location=Needham Heights, Massachusetts |page=8 |url= |id= |isbn=978-0-205-30840-8 }}</ref> In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of [[Creationism|God's act of creation]]. Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', an [[Early modern period|early modern]] treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic \"as if no one had written on these matters before\". His best known philosophical statement is \"[[Cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]\" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}; {{lang-la|link=no| cogito, ergo sum}}), found in ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637; written in French and Latin) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644; written in Latin).<ref>This idea had already been proposed by the Spanish philosopher [[G\u00f3mez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: \"I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist\" (''nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''). See: G\u00f3mez Pereira, ''Antoniana Margarita'': \"De Immortalitate Animae\", 1749 [1554], p. 277; Santos L\u00f3pez, Modesto (1986). \"G\u00f3mez Pereira, m\u00e9dico y fil\u00f3sofo medinense\".

Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most notably, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: \"I think, therefore I am\"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence.  \"The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}</ref> These two first principles\u2014I think and I exist\u2014were later confirmed by Descartes' clear and distinct perception (delineated in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation III: Concerning God.2C That He Exists|Third Meditation]]): that I clearly and distinctly perceive these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.\n\nDescartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines \"thought\" (''cogitatio'') as \"what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it\". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ren\u00e9 |last=Descartes |year=1644 |title=The Principles of Philosophy (IX)}}</ref> He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been \"hijacked\" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{quote|And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.<ref>Bardt, C., ''Material and Mind'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2019), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yk2rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA109 p. 109].</ref>{{rp|109}}}}\n\nIn this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and, instead, admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\n===Dualism===\n{{Further|Mind-body problem|Mind-body dualism}}\n[[File:L'homme V00083 00000004.tif|thumb|''L'homme'' (1664)]]\n\nDescartes, influenced by the [[automaton]]s on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate the connection between the mind and body, and how the two interact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/339/Descartes.pdf |title='A Brute to the Brutes?': Descartes' Treatment of Animals |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |access-date=24 February 2018 |work=Whitman People }}</ref> His main influences for [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] were [[theology]] and [[physics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=20013943|title=What Moves the Mind: An Excursion in Cartesian Dualism |last=Watson |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Watson (philosopher) |date=January 1982 |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=73\u201381 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}</ref> The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes' signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced.

While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of ''modes'', which are the ways in which substances exist. In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Descartes explained, \"we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance\". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,<ref name=\"David Cunning 2014 278\">{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=278}}</ref> which Descartes explained as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.<ref name=\"David Cunning 2014 278\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Descartes, two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other.

Everything that happened, be it the motion of the [[star]]s or the growth of a [[tree]], was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the \"final cause,\" and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes' theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and \"final causes\" in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes' dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or ''res extensa'') in favor of the mind (or ''res cogitans''). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern [[physics]], it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the [[soul]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=87}}</ref>\n\nDescartes' dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings.

It was this theory of innate knowledge that later led philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704) to combat the theory of [[empiricism]], which held that all knowledge is acquired through experience.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=27532614 |title=John Locke's Contributions to Education |last=Baldwin |first=Bird T. |date=April 1913 |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |journal=[[The Sewanee Review]] |access-date=|volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=177\u2013187}}</ref>\n\n===Physiology and psychology===\nIn ''The Passions of the Soul'', written between 1645 and 1646, Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles, and served as a metaphor for feelings, like being in high or bad spirit. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the [[pineal gland]] as connector.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=86}}</ref> Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 87\">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=87}}</ref>\n\nDescartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century [[reflex]] theory. He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. Heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 87\"/> Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 88\"/>\n\nAbove all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was [[Divinity|divine]], thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on [[emotion]]s and how [[Cognition|cognitive]] evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind. In the 20th century [[Alan Turing]] advanced [[computer science]] based on [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced [[Physiology|physiological theories]] more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] was a great admirer of Descartes.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=88}}</ref>\n\n===Moral philosophy===\nFor Descartes, [[ethics]] was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.<ref name=\"Preface\"/> In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind-body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good [[choices]], and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.<ref name=\"Blom\">Blom, John J., Descartes.

For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.<ref name=\"Blom\"/> The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|\"Provisional Morals\"]].\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|Ren\u00e9 Descartes at work]]\nIn the third and fifth ''Meditation'', Descartes offers an [[Ontological argument|ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the ontological argument and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, Descartes can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, nevertheless, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\nIn his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the \"idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite,\" and suggests that \"of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct.\"<ref>Descartes, Rene \"Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress</ref> Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic,<ref name=\"books.google.be\" /><ref name=\"KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207\" /><ref name=\"Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107\" /> and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God,\" while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.<ref name=\"Descartes, Ren\u00e9 2009\"/><ref>Edward C. Mendler, ''False Truths: The Error of Relying on Authority, p. 16</ref>{{check quotation}} Descartes also wrote a response to [[Philosophical skepticism|external world skepticism]]. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory [[perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the \"propensity\" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true \u201csubstance\u201d. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nDescartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, for example, he replied that he 'does not take it upon himself to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descartes - An Intellectual Biography|last=GAUKROGER|first=STEPHEN|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-823994-9|location=Oxford University Press Inc., New York|pages=355\u2013356}}</ref>\n\n===Natural science===\nDescartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural science]]s.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Grosholz |first=Emily |title=Cartesian method and the problem of reduction |authorlink=Emily Grosholz |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&pg=PA1 |isbn=978-0-19-824250-5 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=But contemporary debate has tended to...understand [Cartesian method] merely as the 'method of doubt'...I want to define Descartes' method in broader terms...to trace its impact on the domains of mathematics and [[physics]] as well as [[metaphysics]].}}</ref> For him the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, as he related in a letter to a French translator:<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite web |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |translator-last=Veitch |translator-first=John |url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm |title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface |accessdate= 6 December 2011}}</ref>\n{{quote|Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics.

To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as [[Cartesian doubt|methodological skepticism]]: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rebecca |last=Copenhaver |title=Forms of skepticism |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108095032/http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archivedate=8 January 2005 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref> Descartes built his ideas from scratch.

European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a<sup>2</sup>'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians, such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te|Vieta]], who argued that it could represent only area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or \"universal mathematics,\" as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1972).

Decartes' influence extended not directly from his original French edition of [[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie|La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]], however, but rather from [[Frans van Schooten|Frans van Schooten]]'s expanded second Latin edition of the work.<ref>[[Richard S.

The most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables.<ref>''Contemporary Newtonian Research'', edited by Z. Bechler, pp. 109\u2013129, ''Newton the Mathematician'', by Daniel T. Whiteside, Springer, 1982.</ref>\n\n===Contemporary reception===\nIn commercial terms, ''Discourse'' appeared during Descartes' lifetime in a single edition of 500 copies, 200 of which were set aside for the author. Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of ''Meditations'', which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartes' death. A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was, however, eagerly sought out by Europe's scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes.<ref>Maclean, I., introduction to Descartes, R., ''A Discourse on the Method of Correctly Conducting One's Reason and Seeking Truth in the Sciences'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=f9B3zzrPOY4C&pg=PR43 pp. xliii\u2013xliv].</ref>{{rp|xliii\u2013xliv}}\n\nAlthough Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial.

Published by Descartes' literary executor [[Claude Clerselier]]. The third edition, in 1667, was the most complete; Clerselier omitted, however, much of the material pertaining to mathematics.\n\nIn January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through [[Google Search|Google]]. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by [[Haverford College]] in [[Haverford, Pennsylvania]]. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published.

A native of the Kingdom of France, he spent about 20 years (1629\u20131649) of his life in the [[Dutch Republic]] after serving for a while in the [[Dutch States Army]] of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], [[Prince of Orange]] and the [[Stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].

(Princeton University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|978-0-691-16575-2}})</ref> Descartes is also widely regarded as one of the founders of [[modern philosophy]].\n\nMany elements of Descartes' philosophy have precedents in late [[Aristotelianism]], the [[Neostoicism|revived Stoicism]] of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In his [[natural philosophy]], he differed from the [[Scholasticism|schools]] on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of [[Matter|corporeal substance]] into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to [[Teleology|final ends]], divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson: Allyn & Bacon |year=2001 |location=Needham Heights, Massachusetts |page=8 |url= |id= |isbn=978-0-205-30840-8 }}</ref> In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of [[Creationism|God's act of creation]]. Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', an [[Early modern period|early modern]] treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic \"as if no one had written on these matters before\". His best known philosophical statement is \"[[Cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]\" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}; {{lang-la|link=no| cogito, ergo sum}}), found in ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637; written in French and Latin) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644; written in Latin).<ref>This idea had already been proposed by the Spanish philosopher [[G\u00f3mez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: \"I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist\" (''nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''). See: G\u00f3mez Pereira, ''Antoniana Margarita'': \"De Immortalitate Animae\", 1749 [1554], p. 277; Santos L\u00f3pez, Modesto (1986). \"G\u00f3mez Pereira, m\u00e9dico y fil\u00f3sofo medinense\".

Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most notably, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: \"I think, therefore I am\"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence.  \"The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}</ref> These two first principles\u2014I think and I exist\u2014were later confirmed by Descartes' clear and distinct perception (delineated in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation III: Concerning God.2C That He Exists|Third Meditation]]): that I clearly and distinctly perceive these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.\n\nDescartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines \"thought\" (''cogitatio'') as \"what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it\". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ren\u00e9 |last=Descartes |year=1644 |title=The Principles of Philosophy (IX)}}</ref> He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been \"hijacked\" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{quote|And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.<ref>Bardt, C., ''Material and Mind'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2019), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yk2rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA109 p. 109].</ref>{{rp|109}}}}\n\nIn this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and, instead, admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\n===Dualism===\n{{Further|Mind-body problem|Mind-body dualism}}\n[[File:L'homme V00083 00000004.tif|thumb|''L'homme'' (1664)]]\n\nDescartes, influenced by the [[automaton]]s on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate the connection between the mind and body, and how the two interact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/339/Descartes.pdf |title='A Brute to the Brutes?': Descartes' Treatment of Animals |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |access-date=24 February 2018 |work=Whitman People }}</ref> His main influences for [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] were [[theology]] and [[physics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=20013943|title=What Moves the Mind: An Excursion in Cartesian Dualism |last=Watson |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Watson (philosopher) |date=January 1982 |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=73\u201381 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}</ref> The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes' signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced.

While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of ''modes'', which are the ways in which substances exist. In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Descartes explained, \"we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance\". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,<ref name=\"David Cunning 2014 278\">{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=278}}</ref> which Descartes explained as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.<ref name=\"David Cunning 2014 278\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Descartes, two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans, and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another.<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=279}}</ref> He argued that the great differences between body (an extended thing) and mind (an un-extended, immaterial thing) make the two ontologically distinct. But that the mind was utterly indivisible: because \"when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=280}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Meditations'' Descartes invokes his [[causal adequacy principle]]<ref>[[Georges Dicker|Dicker, G.]], ''Descartes: An Analytical and Historical Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UohoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT138#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 118ff].</ref> to support his [[trademark argument]] for the existence of God, quoting Lucretius in defence: \"Ex nihilo nihil fit\", meaning \"[[Nothing comes from nothing]]\" ([[Lucretius]]).<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Carus\n  | first = Lucretius\n  | authorlink = Lucretius\n  | title = De Rerum Natura\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | date = 1947\n  | pages = 146\u2013482}}</ref> Granted, neither Descartes nor Lucretius originated the philosophical claim, appearing as it does in the classical metaphysics of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].<ref>Feldman, S., ''Philosophy in a Time of Crisis: [[Isaac Abarbanel|Don Isaac Abravanel]], Defender of the Faith'' (London and New York: [[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nnYsBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA53 p. 53].</ref>\n\nMoreover, in ''Meditations'' Descartes discusses a piece of [[wax]] and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism: that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances\u2014the mind or soul defined as [[Thought|thinking]], and the body defined as matter and unthinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=86}}</ref> The [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] of Descartes' days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological. Everything that happened, be it the motion of the [[star]]s or the growth of a [[tree]], was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the \"final cause,\" and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes' theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and \"final causes\" in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes' dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or ''res extensa'') in favor of the mind (or ''res cogitans''). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern [[physics]], it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the [[soul]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=87}}</ref>\n\nDescartes' dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was according to Descartes a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In ''Meditations'' Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of \"accidents\".<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=301}}</ref> But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:<ref name=\"Georges Dicker 2013 303\">{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=303}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Nature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.<ref name=\"Georges Dicker 2013 303\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nDescartes' discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy: What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person?<ref name=\"Georges Dicker 2013 303\"/> Therefore, Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the [[mind\u2013body problem]] for many years after Descartes' death.<ref>Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (online): Descartes and the Pineal Gland.</ref> Descartes was also a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and believed in the power of [[Innatism|innate ideas]].<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 88\">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=88}}</ref> Descartes argued the theory of [[innate knowledge]] and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God. It was this theory of innate knowledge that later led philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704) to combat the theory of [[empiricism]], which held that all knowledge is acquired through experience.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=27532614 |title=John Locke's Contributions to Education |last=Baldwin |first=Bird T. |date=April 1913 |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |journal=[[The Sewanee Review]] |access-date=|volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=177\u2013187}}</ref>\n\n===Physiology and psychology===\nIn ''The Passions of the Soul'', written between 1645 and 1646, Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles, and served as a metaphor for feelings, like being in high or bad spirit. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or [[passions]] of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the [[pineal gland]] as connector.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=86}}</ref> Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 87\">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=87}}</ref>\n\nDescartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century [[reflex]] theory. He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. Heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 87\"/> Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 88\"/>\n\nAbove all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was [[Divinity|divine]], thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on [[emotion]]s and how [[Cognition|cognitive]] evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind. In the 20th century [[Alan Turing]] advanced [[computer science]] based on [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced [[Physiology|physiological theories]] more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] was a great admirer of Descartes.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=88}}</ref>\n\n===Moral philosophy===\nFor Descartes, [[ethics]] was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.<ref name=\"Preface\"/> In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind-body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good [[choices]], and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.<ref name=\"Blom\">Blom, John J., Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology. New York University Press. 1978. {{isbn|0-8147-0999-0}}</ref> His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers (see [[Cartesianism]]), and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be, specifically how it should invoke emotion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Revolution A Brief History with Documents|last=Jacob|first=Margaret C.|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2009|isbn=978-0-312-65349-1|location=Boston|pages=16, 17}}</ref>\n\nHumans should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid [[Blessing|blessedness]] or [[pleasure]]. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.<ref name=\"Blom\"/> The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|\"Provisional Morals\"]].\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|Ren\u00e9 Descartes at work]]\nIn the third and fifth ''Meditation'', Descartes offers an [[Ontological argument|ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the ontological argument and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, Descartes can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, nevertheless, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\nIn his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the \"idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite,\" and suggests that \"of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct.\"<ref>Descartes, Rene \"Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress</ref> Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic,<ref name=\"books.google.be\" /><ref name=\"KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207\" /><ref name=\"Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107\" /> and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God,\" while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.<ref name=\"Descartes, Ren\u00e9 2009\"/><ref>Edward C. Mendler, ''False Truths: The Error of Relying on Authority, p. 16</ref>{{check quotation}} Descartes also wrote a response to [[Philosophical skepticism|external world skepticism]]. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory [[perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the \"propensity\" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true \u201csubstance\u201d. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nDescartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, for example, he replied that he 'does not take it upon himself to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descartes - An Intellectual Biography|last=GAUKROGER|first=STEPHEN|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-823994-9|location=Oxford University Press Inc., New York|pages=355\u2013356}}</ref>\n\n===Natural science===\nDescartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural science]]s.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Grosholz |first=Emily |title=Cartesian method and the problem of reduction |authorlink=Emily Grosholz |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&pg=PA1 |isbn=978-0-19-824250-5 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=But contemporary debate has tended to...understand [Cartesian method] merely as the 'method of doubt'...I want to define Descartes' method in broader terms...to trace its impact on the domains of mathematics and [[physics]] as well as [[metaphysics]].}}</ref> For him the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, as he related in a letter to a French translator:<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite web |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |translator-last=Veitch |translator-first=John |url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm |title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface |accessdate= 6 December 2011}}</ref>\n{{quote|Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics.

To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as [[Cartesian doubt|methodological skepticism]]: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rebecca |last=Copenhaver |title=Forms of skepticism |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108095032/http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archivedate=8 January 2005 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref> Descartes built his ideas from scratch.

Descartes \"invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''\". He also \"pioneered the standard notation\" that uses [[Subscript and superscript|superscripts]] to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 2 used in x<sup>2</sup> to indicate x squared.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Descartes, ''Discourse de la M\u00e9thode'' (Leiden, Netherlands): Jan Maire, 1637, appended book: ''La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie'', book one, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f383.image p. 299.] From p. 299: ''\" ...

New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.</ref> He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in our system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities. European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a<sup>2</sup>'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians, such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te|Vieta]], who argued that it could represent only area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or \"universal mathematics,\" as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1972). New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 280\u2013281</ref>\n\nDescartes' work provided the basis for the [[calculus]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and Leibniz, who applied infinitesimal calculus to the [[Tangent#Analytical approach|tangent line problem]], thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Gullberg |authorlink=Jan Gullberg |year=1997 |title=Mathematics From The Birth of Numbers |url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicsfromb1997gull |url-access=registration |publisher=W.W.

With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometrical physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/descartes-physics/|last=Slowik|first=Edward|title=Descartes' Physics |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Archive|date=22 August 2017|editor=Edward N.

He outlined his views on the universe in his ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''.\n\nDescartes also made contributions to the field of [[optics]]. He showed by using geometric construction and the [[law of refraction]] (also known as Descartes' law or more commonly [[Snell's law]]) that the angular radius of a [[rainbow]] is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42\u00b0).<ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=P.A. and G.

Decartes' influence extended not directly from his original French edition of [[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie|La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]], however, but rather from [[Frans van Schooten|Frans van Schooten]]'s expanded second Latin edition of the work.<ref>[[Richard S.

Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of ''Meditations'', which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartes' death. A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was, however, eagerly sought out by Europe's scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes.<ref>Maclean, I., introduction to Descartes, R., ''A Discourse on the Method of Correctly Conducting One's Reason and Seeking Truth in the Sciences'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=f9B3zzrPOY4C&pg=PR43 pp. xliii\u2013xliv].</ref>{{rp|xliii\u2013xliv}}\n\nAlthough Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial.
