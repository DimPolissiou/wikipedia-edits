It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 1 November 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]] upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\" ([[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]). She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> The song's writing process began at Warren's home in [[Wyoming]] where she and Kirkpatrick were attempting to write a second hit for Lipa following their success with \"New Rules\".

It was influenced by similar basslines by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]] that he listened to growing up.

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 1 November 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]] upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\" ([[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]). She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> The song's writing process began at Warren's home in [[Wyoming]] where she and Kirkpatrick were attempting to write a second hit for Lipa following their success with \"New Rules\".

It was influenced by similar basslines by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]] that he listened to growing up. Kirkpatrick described the production as a combination of his favourite [[disco]] and \"Euro-funk\" music, and cited music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]] as an influence.<ref name=\"SU\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n{{Listen\n | filename    = Dua Lipa Don't Start Now.ogg\n | pos         =\n | title       = \"Don't Start Now\"\n | description = A 16-second sample of the second verse where a [[rhythm guitar]] loop is added and Lipa sings with pauses between certain lyrics.<ref name=\"TSJ\"/>\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\"Don't Start Now\" has been widely described by music critics as a [[nu-disco]] song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rs-charts-young-thug-hot-songs-910833/|title=RS Charts: Young Thug's 'Hot' Hits Number One|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=11 November 2019|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review-dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-is-a-euphoric-escape-hatch-to-pops-past/|title=Review: Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia Is a Euphoric Escape Hatch to Pop's Past|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=25 March 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Crack\">{{cite web|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/album-reviews/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia/|title=Dua Lipa \u2013 'Future Nostalgia' review|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[Crack Magazine]]|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/112303-dua-lipas-new-single-dont-start-now-is-about-moving-on/|title=Dua Lipa's new single Don't Start Now is about 'moving on'|website=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=24 October 2019|accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"musicOMH\">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia|title=Dua Lipa \u2013 Future Nostalgia|last=Smith|first=Nick|website=[[musicOMH]]|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> It has numerous [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] tropes, and elements of [[Eurodance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/05/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review|title=Dua Lipa: Future Nostalgia review \u2013 a dazzling dance through the decades|last=Empire|first=Kitty|author-link=Kitty Empire|website=[[The Observer]]|date=5 April 2020|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/business/chart-beat/8550118/dua-lipa-dont-start-now-five-burning-questions|title=Five Burning Questions: Billboard Staffers Discuss Dua Lipa's 'Don't Start Now' Hitting the Top 10|author=Billboard Staff|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=4 February 2020|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/dua-lipas-new-album-future-nostalgia-is-an-apocalypse-game-changer-and-the-best-album-of-2020-so-far|title=Dua Lipa's 'Future Nostalgia' Is an Apocalypse Game-changer\u2014and the Best Album of 2020 So Far|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref> The song is composed in [[Time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time]] and the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[B minor]], with a [[tempo]] of 124 beats per minute.

When giving Dwarves their own language ([[Khuzdul]]) Tolkien decided to create an analogue of a [[Semitic language]] influenced by [[Hebrew language |Hebrew]] [[phonology]]. Like medieval Jewish groups, the Dwarves use their own language only amongst themselves, and adopted the languages of those they live amongst for the most part, for example taking public names from the cultures they lived within, whilst keeping their \"true-names\" and true language a secret.<ref>Douglas Anderson, History of the Hobbit, Harper Collins 2006 p. 80</ref> Along with a few words in Khuzdul, Tolkien also developed runes of his own invention (the [[Cirth]]), said to have been invented by [[Elves (Middle-earth) |Elves]] and later adopted by the Dwarves. Tolkien further underlines the [[diaspora]] of the Dwarves with the lost stronghold of the Mines of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]]. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien uses the main dwarf character [[Gimli (Middle-earth) |Gimli]] to finally reconcile the conflict between Elves and Dwarves through showing great courtesy to [[Galadriel]] and forming a deep friendship with [[Legolas]], which has been seen as Tolkien's reply toward \"Gentile anti-Semitism and Jewish exclusiveness\".<ref name = \"edwards\" />\n\nTolkien also elaborated on Jewish influence on his Dwarves in a letter: \"I do think of the 'Dwarves' like Jews: at once native and alien in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue...\"<ref group=T>{{ME-ref |letters | 176}}</ref>\n\n===The \"Quenta Silmarillion\"===\n\nAfter preparing ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien returned again to the matter of the ''[[Silmarillion]]'', in which he gave the Dwarves a [[creation myth]]. The most Dwarf-centric story from ''The Book of Lost Tales'', \"The Nauglafring\", was not redrafted to fit with the later positive portrayal of the dwarves from ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', nor other events in the ''Silmarillion'',<ref group=T>{{ME-ref |bolt2 |\"The Nauglafring, Notes\"}}</ref> leading Christopher Tolkien significantly to rewrite it with input from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]] in preparation for publication.\n\n===The later ''Silmarillion'' and last writings===\n\nSometime before 1969, Tolkien wrote the essay ''Of Dwarves and Men'', in which he gave detailed consideration to the Dwarves' use of language, that the names given in the stories were of [[Northmen (Middle-earth) |Northern Mannish]] origin, and [[Khuzdul]] being their own secret tongue and the naming of the [[#Divisions |Seven Houses]] of the Dwarves. The essay represents the last of Tolkien's writing regarding the Dwarves and was published in volume 12 of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' in 1996.<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', \"Of Dwarves and Men\"</ref>\n\nIn the last interview before his death, Tolkien, after discussing the nature of [[Elf (Middle-earth) |Elves]], briefly says of his Dwarves: \"The dwarves of course are quite obviously, wouldn't you say that in many ways they remind you of the Jews? Their words are Semitic, obviously, constructed to be Semitic.\"<ref>Gerrolt, Dennis [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/misctolkien/tolkienradiointerview1971.ra&date=2009-10-26+02:42:57 ''Now Read On...'' interview] ''[[BBC]]'', 1971</ref>\n\n===Spelling===\n\nThe original editor of ''The Hobbit'' \"corrected\" Tolkien's plural ''dwarves'' to ''dwarfs'', as did the editor of the Puffin paperback edition of ''The Hobbit''.<ref group=T>''[[The Letters of J.

R. R. Tolkien |Letters]]'', 17)</ref> In Appendix F of ''The Lord of the Rings'' it is explained that if we still spoke of ''dwarves'' regularly, English might have retained a special plural for the word ''dwarf'' as with ''goose''\u2014''geese''. Despite Tolkien's fondness for it, the form ''dwarrow'' only appears in his writing as ''Dwarrowdelf'', a name for Moria.\n\nTolkien used ''Dwarves'', instead, corresponding to his ''Elf'' and ''Elves''. In this matter, one has to consider the fact that the etymological development of the term ''dwarf'' differs from the similar-sounding word ''scarf'' (plural ''scarves''). The English word is related to old [[North Germanic languages |Norse]] ''dvergr'', which, in the other case, would have had the form ''dvorgr''. But this word was never recorded, and the f/g-emendation (English/Norse) dates further back in language history. Tolkien used ''dwarvish''<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1937), ''[[The Hobbit]]'', 4th edition (1978), George Allen & Unwin, preface; {{ISBN |0-04-823147-9}}</ref> and ''dwarf(-)'' (e.g. [[Rings of Power#The Verse of the Rings |Dwarf-lords]], Old Dwarf Road) as adjectives for the people he created, rarely ''dwarven'' if ever.\n\n===Wicked Dwarves===\n\nOf the people of Middle-earth, Dwarves are the most resistant to corruption and influence of Morgoth and later Sauron.

(Appendix F to LoTR)</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Characteristics===\n\nIn ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the Dwarves are described as shorter and stockier than [[Elf (Middle-earth) |Elves]] and [[Man (Middle-earth) |Men]], able to withstand both heat and cold. They prefer to live underground, especially in cities under mountains. Unlike Elves and Men, created by the supreme god [[Eru Il\u00favatar |Il\u00favatar]], Dwarves were created by the [[Vala (Middle-earth) |Vala]] [[Aul\u00eb]]. According to ''The Silmarillion'', Il\u00favatar \"adopted\" Aul\u00eb's creations as a special mercy to Aul\u00eb.\n\nThroughout the [[First Age]] and most of the [[Second Age]], the Dwarves maintain mostly friendly trading relations with Men and Elves (the treachery of the Dwarves of Nogrod towards [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] being an exception). However, in the [[Third Age]], particularly after the closure of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]], they grow mistrustful of Elves, though in later times cordial relations are established with the Elves of [[Mirkwood]] and the Men of [[Dale (Middle-earth) |Dale]]. They also maintain somewhat ambivalent relations with [[Hobbit]]s for most of the Third Age, although after the mission to retake the [[Lonely Mountain]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] is held in great esteem there.\n\n====Longevity, procreation and genders====\n\nDwarves of different 'breeds' vary in their longevity. Durin's race was originally long-lived (especially those named Durin), but like most other peoples they had become less so during the Third Age.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\" group=T>The Peoples of Middle-earth, \"The Making of Appendix A\": (iv) \"Durin's Folk\"</ref> Dwarves have an average lifespan of 250 years.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\" group=T/><ref>A Guide to Tolkien, David Day, Chancellor Press, 2002</ref> Occasionally they would live up to 300 years of age, and [[Dwalin]] reached the rare lifespan of 340 years (comparable to a Middle Man living to 100).<ref name=\"ReferenceD\" group=T/>\n\n{{anchor|Dwarf-women}}\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Tolkien writes that they breed slowly, for no more than a third of them are female, and not all marry; also, female Dwarves or Dwarf-women look and sound (and dress, if journeying\u2014which is rare) so alike to Dwarf-males that other folk cannot distinguish them, and thus others wrongly believe Dwarves grow out of stone. Tolkien names only one female, D\u00eds, the sister of [[Thorin Oakenshield]].<ref>{{cite web |title=D\u00eds {{!}} The younger sister of Thorin Oakenshield |url=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/d/dis.html |website=Encyclopedia of Arda |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref group=T>J.

They mined and worked precious metals throughout the mountains of Middle-earth. They were considered unrivalled in arts such as smithing, crafting, metalworking, and masonry, even by the [[Noldor]].<ref group=T>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, \"Quenta Silmarillion: Of Aul\u00eb and Yavanna\"</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves were the greatest miners ever to exist in [[Middle-earth]], building immense halls under mountains where they built their cities. They built many famed halls including the [[Menegroth]], the fairest dwelling of any king that has been east of the Sea, [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]], the grandest mansions of the Dwarves,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\" group=T>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, \"Quenta Silmarillion: Of the Sindar\"</ref> the Elvenking's Halls, and the [[Erebor |Kingdom Under the Mountain]].\n\nIn the darkness of [[Arda (Tolkien) |Arda]] already the Dwarves wrought great works for even from the first days of their Fathers they had marvellous skill with metals and with stone; but in that ancient time iron and copper they loved to work, rather than silver and gold.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\" group=T/>\n\nIn the tempering of steel alone of all crafts the Dwarves were never outmatched even by the [[Noldor]], and in the making of mail of linked rings, which was first contrived by the smiths of Belegost, their work had no rival. During the third age of the captivity of [[Melkor]], the Dwarves smithied for [[Thingol]]; for they were greatly skilled in such work, though none among them surpassed the craftsmen of Nogrod, of whom Telchar the smith was greatest in renown.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\" group=T/>\nThey were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithing skills were said to be unrivalled, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The crafting skills of the Dwarves were unmatched; they crafted objects of great beauty out of gems and metals. They crafted many famed weapons, armours, and items of art and beauty, among them [[Narsil]], the sword of [[Elendil]], the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min]] and the necklace Nauglam\u00edr, the most prized treasure in [[Nargothrond]] and the most famed Dwarven work of the Elder Days.<ref group=T>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, \"Quenta Silmarillion: Of the Ruin of Doriath\"</ref>\n\nIn the [[Third Age]], Dwarves wrought with patient craft works of metal and stone that now none can rival.<ref group=T>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\"</ref> However, as stated by [[Gloin]] at the [[Council of Elrond]], the Dwarves of Erebor have surpassed their predecessors in mining and building before [[Smaug]] descended on the [[Lonely Mountain]], but not in metal-work, smithing or the making of mail, as their predecessors' secrets have been long lost.<ref group=T>J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, \"Many Meetings\"</ref>\n\nSince they lived underground, Dwarves did not grow their own food supplies if they could help it, and usually obtained food through trade with Elves and Men. In the essay \"Of Dwarves and Men\" in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien wrote that Dwarf and human communities often formed trade relations where the Men were the prime suppliers of food, farmers and herdsmen, while the Dwarves supplied tools and weapons, road-building and construction work.<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T/>\n\nDwarves liked to sing, and play musical instruments. Their more-specialized skills included the making of boots,<ref group=T>J. R. R.

Because it was a constructed (though living) language, it was not descended from any form of Elvish, as most of the languages of [[Man (Middle-earth) |Men]] were, although it is suggested that the language may have had influence on the early languages of Men.<ref>''The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth, Ruth S. Noel, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1980''</ref>\n\nKhuzdul was for the most part a closely guarded tongue (one of the few recorded outsiders to have a knowledge of it was E\u00f6l), and the Dwarves never revealed their Khuzdul names to outsiders, going so far as to omit them from even their tombs. Khuzdul was written in [[Cirth]], a [[runes |runic]] alphabet developed by the [[Elf (Middle-earth) |Elves]]. There is no extant corpus for the Khuzdul language, whether in Tolkien's novels or in his private works, other than the battle cry: Baruk Khaz\u00e2d! Khaz\u00e2d ai-m\u00eanu! (meaning \"Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!\") and the inscription on [[Balin (Middle-earth) |Balin]]'s tombstone, reading: <small>BALIN FUNDINUL UZBAD KHAZAD-D\u00dbMU</small>, or Balin son of Fundin Lord of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]].\n\nThe remainder of the corpus of Khuzdul consists of single words and names, such as the mountains [[Barazinbar]] (Redhorn) and [[Zirakzigil]] (Silvertine). Tolkien himself does not seem to have had a firm idea of the meaning of these words when he created them; his notes on Zirakzigil originally suggested that \"zirak\" means \"silver\" and \"zigil\" means \"spike\", but he later reversed this and proposed that \"zirak\" is \"spike\" and \"zigil\" is \"silver\". Of another Khuzdul name \"[[Kibil-n\u00e2la]]\" he wrote \"the meaning of ''n\u00e2la'' is not known.\"<ref group=T>[[Christopher Tolkien]] (1989), ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', ''The Treason of Isengard'', ''p.174''; {{ISBN |0-395-51562-9}}</ref> Few of other race have succeeded in learning it.<ref name=\"JRRT Of Other Races\" group=T>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''Appendix F'', \"Of Other Races\"</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves do not normally teach their language to others,<ref name=\"Complete\">''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]''</ref> so they learned both [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] in order to communicate with the Elves, most notably the [[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]].<ref name=\"JRRT Of the Sindar\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Ch.

In [[Quenya]] they were the ''Cas\u00e1ri''. The Dwarves called themselves ''Khaz\u00e2d'' in their own language, [[Khuzdul]].\n\nTolkien took the names of twelve of the thirteen dwarves he used in ''The Hobbit'' (and the wizard Gandalf's name) from ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''.\n\n===Divisions===\n\nIn ''The Silmarillion'', it is stated that the Dwarves were originally divided into seven [[clan]]s or \"Houses\". The three who enter Tolkien's histories are:\n* Longbeards (Khuzdul: ''Sigin-tar\u00e2g'') ([[Durin's folk]]), who founded the city of [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]] in the [[Misty Mountains]] (they later founded realms in the [[Ered Mithrin|Grey Mountains]] and the [[Lonely Mountain]]);\n* Firebeards, who founded either Nogrod, Belegost, or both, in the [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]]<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T/>\n* Broadbeams, who founded either Nogrod, Belegost, or both, in the [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]]<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T/>\n\nAfter the end of the [[First Age]], the Dwarves spoken of are almost exclusively of [[Durin]]'s line.\n\nThe other four Houses, the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots, lived in remote regions of Middle-earth, such as [[Rh\u00fbn]]. Almost nothing is known of their histories, except that they each sent a contingent west to fight in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, and in the late Third Age, when war and terror grew in Rh\u00fbn itself, considerable numbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands and sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands.<ref name=\"R.

They were the first to cross the [[Ered Luin]] in the [[Years of the Trees]], and established strongholds in [[Beleriand]] before the building of Nogrod and Belegost in the [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]], and before the [[Elf (Middle-earth) |Elves]] arrived. These very ancient settlements were at [[Nargothrond]] and Amon R\u00fbdh. In Beleriand, these dwarves diminished in physical stature and smith-craft.<ref group=T>The Silmarillion, Quenta Silmarillion, Ch. 21, \"Of T\u00farin Turambar\"</ref>\n\nThe usual [[Sindarin]] name was ''Noegyth Nibin''; others include ''Nibin-Nogrim'' and ''Noegoethig'', formed of ''nibin'' (\"petty\") and one of the Elvish names for the true Dwarves. In [[Quenya]] they were called ''Pitya-naukor''.\n\nThe [[Sindar]], not acquainted with Dwarves yet, saw the Petty-dwarves as little more than bothersome animals, calling them ''(Levain) Tad-dail'' (\"two-legged (animals)\"), and hunted them.<ref group=T>{{ME-ref |UT |\"[[Narn i Ch\u00een H\u00farin |Of T\u00farin Turambar]]\"}}</ref><ref group=T>{{ME-ref |UT |\"[[Narn i Ch\u00een H\u00farin |Narn i H\u00een H\u00farin]]\"}}</ref>{{Request quotation |date=October 2009}} Not until the Dwarves of the [[Ered Luin]] established contact with the Sindar did they realize what the Petty-dwarves were. Afterwards they were mostly left alone, but not before the Petty-dwarves came to hate all Elves with a passion.\n\nPetty-dwarves were smaller than other Dwarves, far more unsociable, and freely gave away their names. Tolkien's original conception was that all Dwarves were greedy, treacherous and unable to create works of beauty without aid. This was so different from their characteristics that evolved in later stories that he felt obliged to describe the Dwarves in these earlier stories as a separate race, the Petty-dwarves.<ref>[[John D. Rateliff]] (2007), ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', Part One ''Mr. Baggins'', ''p.78''; {{ISBN |0-618-96847-4}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the War of the Jewels, after the return of the [[Noldor]], the Petty-dwarves had nearly died out. The last remnant of their people were M\u00eem and his two sons, Ibun and Kh\u00eem. They gave shelter to [[T\u00farin Turambar]] and his band at their home of Amon R\u00fbdh. M\u00eem was captured by a band of Orcs and saved his own life by betraying T\u00farin, though his sons were killed. M\u00eem became the possessor of a treasure-hoard abandoned by the dragon Glaurung, but was killed by [[H\u00farin]], T\u00farin's father.\n\n===History===\nThe Dwarves are portrayed as an ancient people who awoke, like the [[Awakening of the Elves |Elves]], at the start of the First Age, before the existence of the Sun and Moon (the Elves, however, awakened first).\n\n====Creation====\n[[File:Holger danske.jpg|thumb|upright|The Dwarf [[creation story]] echoes the [[King asleep in mountain]] motif, as with the story of [[Ogier the Dane]] (statue pictured).]]\n\nThe story of the creation of the Dwarves is told in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. It occurred during the [[Years of the Trees]], when all of [[Middle-earth]] was controlled by the forces of [[Morgoth |Melkor]]. The [[Vala (Middle-earth) |Vala]] [[Aul\u00eb]] had become impatient for the arising of the [[Children of Il\u00favatar]], and created the seven Fathers of the Dwarves in secret, intending them to be his children to whom he could teach his crafts. He also taught them [[Khuzdul]], a language he had devised for them.\n\nHowever, despite Aul\u00eb's efforts, [[Il\u00favatar]] knew of the Dwarves' creation. When confronted by Il\u00favatar, Aul\u00eb confessed his deed and raised his hammer to destroy his creations. However, Il\u00favatar, seeing that they had been made not out of malice or wickedness, stayed Aul\u00eb's hand and sanctified the dwarves, though he did not allow them to \"awake\" before the [[Awakening of the Elves |Elves]] (whom he had designated as \"The Firstborn\"). Aul\u00eb sealed the seven Fathers of the Dwarves in stone chambers in far-flung regions of Middle-earth to await their awakening.\n\nThis [[creation story]] echoes the folklore motif of the '[[King asleep in mountain]]' and the related motif of the '[[Seven Sleepers]]'.\n\n====The Seven Fathers{{anchor|Durin}}====\n\nEach of the Seven Fathers founded one of the seven Dwarf clans.\n\nDurin I was the eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and the first of his kind to awake in Middle-earth. He awoke in [[Mount Gundabad]], in the northern [[Misty Mountains]]. Durin I belonged to what later became known as the clan of Longbeards.\n\nTwo others were laid in sleep in the north of the [[Ered Luin]] or ''Blue Mountains'', and they founded the lines of the ''Broadbeams'' and the ''Firebeards'' who later lived in Nogrod, Belegost, or both, in the [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]]<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T/>\nThe other four Fathers of Dwarves were laid down in the far east in two locations, separated from Gundabad and each other by distances at least as great as that between the Ered Luin and Gundabad. These founded the lines of the ''Ironfists'' and ''Stiffbeards'', and ''Blacklocks'' and ''Stonefoots''.\nOf the Fathers of the Dwarves, only Durin is said to have \"lain alone\".\n\n====Years of the Trees and First Age====\n\nSome time after the Elves had awakened at [[Cuivi\u00e9nen]], the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves were released from their stone chambers. The eldest of them, called Durin, wandered until he founded the city of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Khazad-d\u00fbm]] in the natural caves beneath three peaks: [[Caradhras]], Celebdil, and Fanuidhol (known in Khuzdul as Baranzinbar, Zirakzigil, and Bundushath\u00fbr, respectively). The city, populated by the Longbeards or [[Durin's folk]], grew and prospered continuously through Durin's life (which was so long that he was called Durin the Deathless, also a reference to the belief by his people that he would be reincarnated seven times). It was the only one of the Dwarf-mansions to survive the First Age.\n\nFar to the west of Khazad-d\u00fbm, the great dwarvish cities of Belegost and Nogrod were founded in [[Ered Luin]] (the Blue Mountains) during the [[Years of the Trees]], before the arrival of the Elves in [[Beleriand]]. The Dwarves of Belegost were the first to forge mail of linked rings, and they also traded weaponry with the Sindar and carved the [[Menegroth |Thousand Caves of Menegroth]] for the Elf king [[Thingol]]. In Nogrod, the smith [[Telchar]] forged [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil |Narsil]] and [[Angrist]], two of the most fateful weapons in the history of Arda, as well as the famed Dragon-helm of Dor-L\u00f3min.\n\nThe Dwarves of Beleriand fought against the forces of Melkor during the first age, and the Dwarves of Belegost were the only people able to withstand dragon-fire in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, when King [[Azagh\u00e2l]], who died in the battle, stabbed Glaurung, the first dragon.\n\nThe Dwarves of Nogrod fought against Melkor as well. However, they slew [[Thingol]] out of greed and stole the [[Silmaril]] they had been charged to set into the necklace called Nauglam\u00edr. A number of retaliatory actions ensued, and the Nogrod army was destroyed by a force of [[Laiquendi]] and [[Ent]]s. Both dwarf kingdoms would eventually be destroyed, along with nearly all of Beleriand, after the [[War of Wrath]], with the dwarvish refugees mainly resettling in Khazad-d\u00fbm.\n\n====Second Age====\nAfter the end of the [[First Age]] the power and wealth of Khazad-d\u00fbm was much increased; for it was enriched by many people and much lore and craft when the ancient cities of Nogrod and Belegost in the [[Blue Mountains (Middle-earth) |Blue mountains]] were ruined in the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]].<ref group=T>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[The Lord of the Rings]], Appendix B, \"The Second Age\"</ref>\n\nIts wealth was also enriched with the discovery of ''[[mithril]]'', a magical, extremely valuable, and nearly indestructible metal found only in its mines.\n\nDuring this Age, the Dwarves continued to trade with neighbouring Men and the Elves of Eregion. Seven of the [[Rings of Power]] forged by the Elven-Smiths were later given by [[Sauron]], who had seized them, to the heads of the seven Dwarf clans (although the Longbeards maintained that Durin's Ring was given to him by [[Celebrimbor]]). The Dwarves of Moria at first fought in the War of Sauron and the Elves, but in the year 1697 of the Second Age, the doors of Khazad-d\u00fbm were shut and its inhabitants no longer ventured forth into the world.\n\nOf the Dwarves, few fought upon either side; but the kindred of [[Durin]] of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]] fought against [[Sauron]].<ref group=T>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\"</ref>\n\n====Third Age====\n\nDuring the [[Third Age]] the Dwarves of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]] continued to prosper until the year 1980, when, in pursuing a vein of ''[[mithril]]'', they broke open a chamber containing the last [[balrog]] known in the histories of Middle-earth, called [[Durin's Bane]]. They battled against the demon for one year, and after the death of two kings, the Dwarves who had not been killed fled from the [[Misty Mountains]]. For almost two decades they had no kingdom, but in the year 1999, Thr\u00e1in I founded a kingdom at the [[Lonely Mountain]]. This kingdom prospered for a time, and the great jewel known as the Arkenstone was discovered.\n\nIn 2210 Thorin I founded a kingdom in the Grey Mountains to the north of [[Mirkwood]]. Both of these realms would eventually be consumed by [[Dragon (Middle-earth) |dragons]]\u2014the Grey Mountains in 2590 and the Lonely Mountain in 2770 by the dragon [[Smaug]]. The refugees from the Grey Mountains who did not return to the Lonely Mountain colonized the [[Iron Hills]], one of the only Dwarf realms never to be abandoned or taken. The main body of the Dwarves became a wandering people, and Thr\u00f3r, who had been king of the Lonely Mountain when it was captured, was slain by [[Orc (Middle-earth) |Orcs]] in the year 2790 and his body mutilated. This led to the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, in which nearly all of the Orc hordes of the Misty Mountains were exterminated but half of the Dwarf host was killed, a blow that took the Dwarves several hundred years to recover from.\n\nFor a time an exile kingdom was founded in the northern [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]], but [[Thr\u00e1in II]] was driven to wandering the wilderness by his [[Rings of Power |Ring]], the last of the Dwarvish Rings not yet taken by [[Sauron]] or consumed by dragons. He was soon captured by Sauron, then reigning as the Necromancer in [[Dol Guldur]]. Thr\u00e1in was tortured, his Ring of Power taken, and finally died. In 2941 [[Thorin II Oakenshield]], son of Thr\u00e1in II and grandson of Thr\u00f3r, recolonized the Lonely Mountain after Smaug the dragon was slain by Bard, the future King of [[Dale (Middle-earth) |Dale]]. After the ensuing Battle of Five Armies, in which the [[Eagle (Middle-earth) |Eagles]], the Elves of Mirkwood, the Men of Dale, and the Dwarves of the Iron Hills (as well as Thorin's band) defeated an invading horde of Goblins and in which Thorin was killed, his cousin [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot]], already Lord of the Iron Hills, became King Under the Mountain, and the Lonely Mountain was not abandoned again.\n\nLate in the Third Age, when war and terror grew in [[Rh\u00fbn]], considerable numbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands, where some of them met [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref name=\"R. Tolkien 1954 pp. 52/53\" group=T/>\n\nDwarves did not figure prominently in the major battles of the [[War of the Ring]] although the Lonely Mountain was besieged for a time and D\u00e1in killed in the Battle of Dale. One dwarf, however\u2014[[Gimli (Middle-earth) |Gimli]]\u2014joined the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters) |Fellowship of the Ring]] and was a companion of [[Frodo Baggins |the Ringbearer]] for a great part of his journey, and also fought at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], and the [[Battle of the Morannon]].\n\n====Fourth Age====\nAt the start of the [[Fourth Age]], Gimli led a group of colonists from the Lonely Mountain to the [[Glittering Caves]], beneath Hornburg in [[Rohan (Middle-earth) |Rohan]], where he established another Dwarf kingdom and ruled there for more than a century. After the death of [[Aragorn]] in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, he sailed to the [[Undying Lands]] with [[Legolas]].\n\nIt is told that a few centuries into the [[Fourth Age]], [[Durin VII]] \u2013 a descendant (some sources say the son)<ref>''The Peoples of Middle-earth'': \"The Making of Appendix A\", '(iv) Durin's Folk', p. 279.</ref> of Thorin III Stonehelm \u2013 at last led Durin's Folk back to recolonize [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]], where they remained \"until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended\".<ref group=T>''The Peoples of Middle-earth'': \"The Making of Appendix A\", '(iv) Durin's Folk', p. 278.</ref>\n\nIt is said that the Dwarf population began to dwindle because most male Dwarves did not desire wives, or could not find one that they desired. It does not help that Dwarf women are less than a third of the population (and many of them choose not to marry, as well).<ref name=\"ROTK_ Appendix\" group=T>{{Harvnb |Return of the King |loc= Appendix |Ref=Return of the King 1955}}</ref> Yet much is still left a mystery in Dwarvish history; the Dwarves' true fate is left unknown.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n[[File:Bakshi Gimli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'']] (1978) voiced by [[David Buck]]]]\n\nIn [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' (1986) Dwarven player-characters receive statistical bonuses to Strength and Constitution, and subtractions from Presence, Agility and Intelligence. Seven \"Dwarven Kindreds\", named after each of the founding fathers\u2014Durin, B\u00e1vor, Dw\u00e1lin, Thr\u00e1r, Druin, Thel\u00f3r and B\u00e1rin\u2014are given in ''The Lords of Middle-earth\u2014Volume III'' (1989).\n\n[[File:Dwarves.jpg|thumb|Dwarves at the Council of Elrond in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[live action]] adaptation of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series) |''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], Gimli's character is occasionally used as comic relief and several of his appearances are intended to emphasize the difference between the Dwarves and Elves.\n\nAs explained in the DVD commentary, the races in the Fellowship come in three height ranges: regular sized Men and Elves, Dwarves who average {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|spell=in}}, and Hobbits who average {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|spell=in}}. The adaptation had to digitally composite certain wide shots in which all of them appear, as well as make use of stunt doubles and various camera perspective tricks. However, while the different races come in three size ranges, the adaptations only used ''two'' different size scales, by putting both Dwarves and Hobbits into the same size scale. This was achieved by simply casting tall actors to play Dwarves, who thus seem proportionately taller than the average-height Hobbit actors, without the need for camera tricks or digital compositing. Thus Gimli rarely interacts with Men and Elves within the same camera frame, or when he does, Gimli is actually played by a shorter stunt double seen from behind. In contrast, because Dwarves and Hobbits are in the same size scale, Gimli interacts freely with the Hobbit characters within the same camera frame. A good example is when the Fellowship enters [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], and Gimli walks up to Frodo and puts his hand on his shoulder, warning him to stay close. Actor John Rhys-Davies is actually <nowiki>6'1''</nowiki> (1.85 m) (two inches (5&nbsp;cm) taller than Viggo Mortensen, who plays Aragorn), much taller than Elijah Wood (Frodo) who is <nowiki>5'6''</nowiki> (1.67 m), thus keeping the proportion that Dwarves are taller than Hobbits.\n\nOther dwarves appear in passing in two scenes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' movie: the \"prologue\" introduces the seven dwarf-lords that received the Rings of Power, and four more are present at the [[Council of Elrond]] (in contrast to the book, where only Gimli and his father [[Gl\u00f3in, son of Gr\u00f3in |Gl\u00f3in]] are described). Peter Jackson's Dwarves wear scale armour.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's adaption of ''The Hobbit'', a wider range of dwarves is seen: the 13 in Thorin's Company and others seen early on in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''. Much more of the Dwarves' history and culture is seen throughout the main story, as with the 13 Dwarves of Thorin's Company. Examples of Khuzdul are seen, such as on [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s map, as well as the Dwarves' history, with the main story and the flashbacks. Female dwarves are shown on-screen briefly in the ''Hobbit'' trilogy, in the flashbacks to the fall of Erebor and Dale to Smaug the Dragon\u2014as mentioned in the novels and first trilogy, they are depicted with beards (somewhat thinner than male beards, like very long and braided sideburns). The behind the scenes extras explain that the producers wanted to use the 13 members of Thorin's company to depict a diverse social strata, to round out their personalities and make them less monolithic. The general rule they applied was that Dwarves more closely related to Thorin and the royal line would dress in better clothing and act more aristocratic, spiraling outward: Thorin and his nephews F\u00edli and K\u00edli are of the royal line so they have the richest costumes, followed by Balin and Dwalin (younger cousins of the royal line but still important lords and generals); then \u00d3in and Gl\u00f3in (more distant cousins but of the royal blood, thus a respected doctor and military general, respectively); then Dori, Nori, and Ori (very distant cousins whose relation to the royal line is so distant it isn't even elaborated\u2014they are depicted as well-to-do middle class merchants, but clearly lower on the social scale than Gl\u00f3in or Dwalin); then finally, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur (who aren't related to the royal line at all, and are depicted as humble and simply dressed working-class Dwarves, miners and toy-makers).\n\nIn [[Decipher Inc.]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'' (2001), based on the Jackson films, Dwarf player-characters get bonuses to Vitality and Strength attributes and must be given craft skills. In the ''Dwarves of Middle-earth'' (2003) supplement, the seven Dwarf Lords and their houses are named as Durin, Sindri, Linnar, Var, Uri, Thulin and Vigdis.\n\nIn the real-time strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', and its [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king |expansion]], both based on the Jackson films, Dwarves are heavily influenced by classical military practice, and use throwing axes, war hammers, spears, and circular or Roman-style shields. One dwarf unit is the [[Phalanx formation|\"Phalanx\"]], similar to its [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] counterpart.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist |group=T |28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist |28em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal |Speculative fiction}}\n*[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/khuzdul.htm Khuzdul - ''the secret tongue of the Dwarves''] at Ardalambion\n*[http://www.dwarrowscholar.com/ Dwarves - ''More on Tolkien's Dwarves] at The Dwarrow Scholar\n\n{{Middle-earth}}\n{{The Lord of the Rings}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dwarf (Middle-earth)}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Dwarves |*]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect |Khazad |the block cipher |KHAZAD}}\n{{Infobox fictional race\n | name               = Dwarves\n | other_names        = Khaz\u00e2d, Hadhodrim, Naugrim\n | iu_created_date    = [[Years of the Trees]]\n | iu_creator         = [[Aul\u00eb]]<br>Durin and the other Fathers of the Dwarves\n | leader             = Kings of Durin's Folk had precedence over all Dwarf-lords\n | home_world         = [[Middle-earth]]\n | base_of_operations = [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]] (to {{ME-date |TA |1981}}), [[List of minor places in Middle-earth#Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]], [[Lonely Mountain]], [[Iron Hills]], Grey Mountains, Belegost, Nogrod, [[Rh\u00fbn]]\n | language           = [[Khuzdul]], [[Quenya]],<ref name=\"JRRT Of the Sindar\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Ch.

When giving Dwarves their own language ([[Khuzdul]]) Tolkien decided to create an analogue of a [[Semitic language]] influenced by [[Hebrew language |Hebrew]] [[phonology]]. Like medieval Jewish groups, the Dwarves use their own language only amongst themselves, and adopted the languages of those they live amongst for the most part, for example taking public names from the cultures they lived within, whilst keeping their \"true-names\" and true language a secret.<ref>Douglas Anderson, History of the Hobbit, Harper Collins 2006 p. 80</ref> Along with a few words in Khuzdul, Tolkien also developed runes of his own invention (the [[Cirth]]), said to have been invented by [[Elves (Middle-earth) |Elves]] and later adopted by the Dwarves. Tolkien further underlines the [[diaspora]] of the Dwarves with the lost stronghold of the Mines of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]]. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien uses the main dwarf character [[Gimli (Middle-earth) |Gimli]] to finally reconcile the conflict between Elves and Dwarves through showing great courtesy to [[Galadriel]] and forming a deep friendship with [[Legolas]], which has been seen as Tolkien's reply toward \"Gentile anti-Semitism and Jewish exclusiveness\".<ref name = \"edwards\" />\n\nTolkien also elaborated on Jewish influence on his Dwarves in a letter: \"I do think of the 'Dwarves' like Jews: at once native and alien in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue...\"<ref group=T>{{ME-ref |letters | 176}}</ref>\n\n===The \"Quenta Silmarillion\"===\n\nAfter preparing ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien returned again to the matter of the ''[[Silmarillion]]'', in which he gave the Dwarves a [[creation myth]].

The essay represents the last of Tolkien's writing regarding the Dwarves and was published in volume 12 of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' in 1996.<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T>[[J.R.R.

Despite Tolkien's fondness for it, the form ''dwarrow'' only appears in his writing as ''Dwarrowdelf'', a name for Moria.\n\nTolkien used ''Dwarves'', instead, corresponding to his ''Elf'' and ''Elves''. In this matter, one has to consider the fact that the etymological development of the term ''dwarf'' differs from the similar-sounding word ''scarf'' (plural ''scarves''). The English word is related to old [[North Germanic languages |Norse]] ''dvergr'', which, in the other case, would have had the form ''dvorgr''. But this word was never recorded, and the f/g-emendation (English/Norse) dates further back in language history. Tolkien used ''dwarvish''<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1937), ''[[The Hobbit]]'', 4th edition (1978), George Allen & Unwin, preface; {{ISBN |0-04-823147-9}}</ref> and ''dwarf(-)'' (e.g. [[Rings of Power#The Verse of the Rings |Dwarf-lords]], Old Dwarf Road) as adjectives for the people he created, rarely ''dwarven'' if ever.\n\n===Wicked Dwarves===\n\nOf the people of Middle-earth, Dwarves are the most resistant to corruption and influence of Morgoth and later Sauron. The seven rings of Power of the dwarves did not turn them to evil, but it did amplify their greed and lust for gold. It is said that very few wilfully served the side of darkness. Of those who did very little was written.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2011/11/15/did-dwarves-ever-serve-sauron/ |title=Did Dwarves Ever Serve Sauron? |author= |date=15 November 2011 |website=xenite.org |accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> Of the seven houses few fought on either side during The Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age, and none from the House of Durin ever fought on the side of evil.<ref group=T>Of the Dwarves few fought upon either side; but the kindred of Durin of Moria fought against Sauron.

For Men of old lusted after their wealth and the work of their hands, and there has been enmity between the races. (Appendix F to LoTR)</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Characteristics===\n\nIn ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the Dwarves are described as shorter and stockier than [[Elf (Middle-earth) |Elves]] and [[Man (Middle-earth) |Men]], able to withstand both heat and cold. They prefer to live underground, especially in cities under mountains. Unlike Elves and Men, created by the supreme god [[Eru Il\u00favatar |Il\u00favatar]], Dwarves were created by the [[Vala (Middle-earth) |Vala]] [[Aul\u00eb]]. According to ''The Silmarillion'', Il\u00favatar \"adopted\" Aul\u00eb's creations as a special mercy to Aul\u00eb.\n\nThroughout the [[First Age]] and most of the [[Second Age]], the Dwarves maintain mostly friendly trading relations with Men and Elves (the treachery of the Dwarves of Nogrod towards [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] being an exception). However, in the [[Third Age]], particularly after the closure of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]], they grow mistrustful of Elves, though in later times cordial relations are established with the Elves of [[Mirkwood]] and the Men of [[Dale (Middle-earth) |Dale]]. They also maintain somewhat ambivalent relations with [[Hobbit]]s for most of the Third Age, although after the mission to retake the [[Lonely Mountain]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] is held in great esteem there.\n\n====Longevity, procreation and genders====\n\nDwarves of different 'breeds' vary in their longevity. Durin's race was originally long-lived (especially those named Durin), but like most other peoples they had become less so during the Third Age.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\" group=T>The Peoples of Middle-earth, \"The Making of Appendix A\": (iv) \"Durin's Folk\"</ref> Dwarves have an average lifespan of 250 years.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\" group=T/><ref>A Guide to Tolkien, David Day, Chancellor Press, 2002</ref> Occasionally they would live up to 300 years of age, and [[Dwalin]] reached the rare lifespan of 340 years (comparable to a Middle Man living to 100).<ref name=\"ReferenceD\" group=T/>\n\n{{anchor|Dwarf-women}}\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Tolkien writes that they breed slowly, for no more than a third of them are female, and not all marry; also, female Dwarves or Dwarf-women look and sound (and dress, if journeying\u2014which is rare) so alike to Dwarf-males that other folk cannot distinguish them, and thus others wrongly believe Dwarves grow out of stone. Tolkien names only one female, D\u00eds, the sister of [[Thorin Oakenshield]].<ref>{{cite web |title=D\u00eds {{!}} The younger sister of Thorin Oakenshield |url=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/d/dis.html |website=Encyclopedia of Arda |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref group=T>J.

They mined and worked precious metals throughout the mountains of Middle-earth. They were considered unrivalled in arts such as smithing, crafting, metalworking, and masonry, even by the [[Noldor]].<ref group=T>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, \"Quenta Silmarillion: Of Aul\u00eb and Yavanna\"</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves were the greatest miners ever to exist in [[Middle-earth]], building immense halls under mountains where they built their cities. They built many famed halls including the [[Menegroth]], the fairest dwelling of any king that has been east of the Sea, [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]], the grandest mansions of the Dwarves,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\" group=T>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, \"Quenta Silmarillion: Of the Sindar\"</ref> the Elvenking's Halls, and the [[Erebor |Kingdom Under the Mountain]].\n\nIn the darkness of [[Arda (Tolkien) |Arda]] already the Dwarves wrought great works for even from the first days of their Fathers they had marvellous skill with metals and with stone; but in that ancient time iron and copper they loved to work, rather than silver and gold.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\" group=T/>\n\nIn the tempering of steel alone of all crafts the Dwarves were never outmatched even by the [[Noldor]], and in the making of mail of linked rings, which was first contrived by the smiths of Belegost, their work had no rival. During the third age of the captivity of [[Melkor]], the Dwarves smithied for [[Thingol]]; for they were greatly skilled in such work, though none among them surpassed the craftsmen of Nogrod, of whom [[Middle-earth dwarf characters#Telchar |Telchar]] the smith was greatest in renown.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\" group=T/>\nThey were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithing skills were said to be unrivalled, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The crafting skills of the Dwarves were unmatched; they crafted objects of great beauty out of gems and metals. They crafted many famed weapons, armours, and items of art and beauty, among them [[Narsil]], the sword of [[Elendil]], the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min]] and the necklace Nauglam\u00edr, the most prized treasure in [[Nargothrond]] and the most famed Dwarven work of the Elder Days.<ref group=T>J.R.R.

Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, \"Many Meetings\"</ref>\n\nSince they lived underground, Dwarves did not grow their own food supplies if they could help it, and usually obtained food through trade with Elves and Men. In the essay \"Of Dwarves and Men\" in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien wrote that Dwarf and human communities often formed trade relations where the Men were the prime suppliers of food, farmers and herdsmen, while the Dwarves supplied tools and weapons, road-building and construction work.<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T/>\n\nDwarves liked to sing, and play musical instruments. Their more-specialized skills included the making of boots,<ref group=T>J. R. R.

Because it was a constructed (though living) language, it was not descended from any form of Elvish, as most of the languages of [[Man (Middle-earth) |Men]] were, although it is suggested that the language may have had influence on the early languages of Men.<ref>''The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth, Ruth S. Noel, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1980''</ref>\n\nKhuzdul was for the most part a closely guarded tongue (one of the few recorded outsiders to have a knowledge of it was E\u00f6l), and the Dwarves never revealed their Khuzdul names to outsiders, going so far as to omit them from even their tombs. Khuzdul was written in [[Cirth]], a [[runes |runic]] alphabet developed by the [[Elf (Middle-earth) |Elves]]. There is no extant corpus for the Khuzdul language, whether in Tolkien's novels or in his private works, other than the battle cry: Baruk Khaz\u00e2d! Khaz\u00e2d ai-m\u00eanu! (meaning \"Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!\") and the inscription on [[Balin (Middle-earth) |Balin]]'s tombstone, reading: <small>BALIN FUNDINUL UZBAD KHAZAD-D\u00dbMU</small>, or Balin son of Fundin Lord of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]].\n\nThe remainder of the corpus of Khuzdul consists of single words and names, such as the mountains [[Barazinbar]] (Redhorn) and [[Zirakzigil]] (Silvertine). Tolkien himself does not seem to have had a firm idea of the meaning of these words when he created them; his notes on Zirakzigil originally suggested that \"zirak\" means \"silver\" and \"zigil\" means \"spike\", but he later reversed this and proposed that \"zirak\" is \"spike\" and \"zigil\" is \"silver\". Of another Khuzdul name \"[[Kibil-n\u00e2la]]\" he wrote \"the meaning of ''n\u00e2la'' is not known.\"<ref group=T>[[Christopher Tolkien]] (1989), ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', ''The Treason of Isengard'', ''p.174''; {{ISBN |0-395-51562-9}}</ref> Few of other race have succeeded in learning it.<ref name=\"JRRT Of Other Races\" group=T>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''Appendix F'', \"Of Other Races\"</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves do not normally teach their language to others,<ref name=\"Complete\">''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]''</ref> so they learned both [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] in order to communicate with the Elves, most notably the [[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]].<ref name=\"JRRT Of the Sindar\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Ch.

In [[Quenya]] they were the ''Cas\u00e1ri''. The Dwarves called themselves ''Khaz\u00e2d'' in their own language, [[Khuzdul]].\n\nTolkien took the names of twelve of the thirteen dwarves he used in ''The Hobbit'' (and the wizard Gandalf's name) from ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''.\n\n===Divisions===\n\nIn ''The Silmarillion'', it is stated that the Dwarves were originally divided into seven [[clan]]s or \"Houses\". The three who enter Tolkien's histories are:\n* Longbeards (Khuzdul: ''Sigin-tar\u00e2g'') ([[Durin's folk]]), who founded the city of [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]] in the [[Misty Mountains]] (they later founded realms in the [[Ered Mithrin|Grey Mountains]] and the [[Lonely Mountain]]);\n* Firebeards, who founded either Nogrod, Belegost, or both, in the [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]]<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T/>\n* Broadbeams, who founded either Nogrod, Belegost, or both, in the [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]]<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T/>\n\nAfter the end of the [[First Age]], the Dwarves spoken of are almost exclusively of [[Durin]]'s line.\n\nThe other four Houses, the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots, lived in remote regions of Middle-earth, such as [[Rh\u00fbn]]. Almost nothing is known of their histories, except that they each sent a contingent west to fight in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, and in the late Third Age, when war and terror grew in Rh\u00fbn itself, considerable numbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands and sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands.<ref name=\"R.

They were the first to cross the [[Ered Luin]] in the [[Years of the Trees]], and established strongholds in [[Beleriand]] before the building of Nogrod and Belegost in the [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]], and before the [[Elf (Middle-earth) |Elves]] arrived. These very ancient settlements were at [[Nargothrond]] and Amon R\u00fbdh. In Beleriand, these dwarves diminished in physical stature and smith-craft.<ref group=T>The Silmarillion, Quenta Silmarillion, Ch. 21, \"Of T\u00farin Turambar\"</ref>\n\nThe usual [[Sindarin]] name was ''Noegyth Nibin''; others include ''Nibin-Nogrim'' and ''Noegoethig'', formed of ''nibin'' (\"petty\") and one of the Elvish names for the true Dwarves. In [[Quenya]] they were called ''Pitya-naukor''.\n\nThe [[Sindar]], not acquainted with Dwarves yet, saw the Petty-dwarves as little more than bothersome animals, calling them ''(Levain) Tad-dail'' (\"two-legged (animals)\"), and hunted them.<ref group=T>{{ME-ref |UT |\"[[Narn i Ch\u00een H\u00farin |Of T\u00farin Turambar]]\"}}</ref><ref group=T>{{ME-ref |UT |\"[[Narn i Ch\u00een H\u00farin |Narn i H\u00een H\u00farin]]\"}}</ref>{{Request quotation |date=October 2009}} Not until the Dwarves of the [[Ered Luin]] established contact with the Sindar did they realize what the Petty-dwarves were. Afterwards they were mostly left alone, but not before the Petty-dwarves came to hate all Elves with a passion.\n\nPetty-dwarves were smaller than other Dwarves, far more unsociable, and freely gave away their names. Tolkien's original conception was that all Dwarves were greedy, treacherous and unable to create works of beauty without aid. This was so different from their characteristics that evolved in later stories that he felt obliged to describe the Dwarves in these earlier stories as a separate race, the Petty-dwarves.<ref>[[John D. Rateliff]] (2007), ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', Part One ''Mr. Baggins'', ''p.78''; {{ISBN |0-618-96847-4}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the War of the Jewels, after the return of the [[Noldor]], the Petty-dwarves had nearly died out. The last remnant of their people were M\u00eem and his two sons, Ibun and Kh\u00eem. They gave shelter to [[T\u00farin Turambar]] and his band at their home of Amon R\u00fbdh. M\u00eem was captured by a band of Orcs and saved his own life by betraying T\u00farin, though his sons were killed. M\u00eem became the possessor of a treasure-hoard abandoned by the dragon Glaurung, but was killed by [[H\u00farin]], T\u00farin's father.\n\n===History===\nThe Dwarves are portrayed as an ancient people who awoke, like the [[Awakening of the Elves |Elves]], at the start of the First Age, before the existence of the Sun and Moon (the Elves, however, awakened first).\n\n====Creation====\n[[File:Holger danske.jpg|thumb|upright|The Dwarf [[creation story]] echoes the [[King asleep in mountain]] motif, as with the story of [[Ogier the Dane]] (statue pictured).]]\n\nThe story of the creation of the Dwarves is told in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. It occurred during the [[Years of the Trees]], when all of [[Middle-earth]] was controlled by the forces of [[Morgoth |Melkor]]. The [[Vala (Middle-earth) |Vala]] [[Aul\u00eb]] had become impatient for the arising of the [[Children of Il\u00favatar]], and created the seven Fathers of the Dwarves in secret, intending them to be his children to whom he could teach his crafts. He also taught them [[Khuzdul]], a language he had devised for them.\n\nHowever, despite Aul\u00eb's efforts, [[Il\u00favatar]] knew of the Dwarves' creation. When confronted by Il\u00favatar, Aul\u00eb confessed his deed and raised his hammer to destroy his creations. However, Il\u00favatar, seeing that they had been made not out of malice or wickedness, stayed Aul\u00eb's hand and sanctified the dwarves, though he did not allow them to \"awake\" before the [[Awakening of the Elves |Elves]] (whom he had designated as \"The Firstborn\"). Aul\u00eb sealed the seven Fathers of the Dwarves in stone chambers in far-flung regions of Middle-earth to await their awakening.\n\nThis [[creation story]] echoes the folklore motif of the '[[King asleep in mountain]]' and the related motif of the '[[Seven Sleepers]]'.\n\n====The Seven Fathers{{anchor|Durin}}====\n\nEach of the Seven Fathers founded one of the seven Dwarf clans.\n\nDurin I was the eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and the first of his kind to awake in Middle-earth. He awoke in [[Mount Gundabad]], in the northern [[Misty Mountains]]. Durin I belonged to what later became known as the clan of Longbeards.\n\nTwo others were laid in sleep in the north of the [[Ered Luin]] or ''Blue Mountains'', and they founded the lines of the ''Broadbeams'' and the ''Firebeards'' who later lived in Nogrod, Belegost, or both, in the [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]]<ref name=\"JRRT Of Dwarves and Men\" group=T/>\nThe other four Fathers of Dwarves were laid down in the far east in two locations, separated from Gundabad and each other by distances at least as great as that between the Ered Luin and Gundabad. These founded the lines of the ''Ironfists'' and ''Stiffbeards'', and ''Blacklocks'' and ''Stonefoots''.\nOf the Fathers of the Dwarves, only Durin is said to have \"lain alone\".\n\n====Years of the Trees and First Age====\n\nSome time after the Elves had awakened at [[Cuivi\u00e9nen]], the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves were released from their stone chambers. The eldest of them, called Durin, wandered until he founded the city of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Khazad-d\u00fbm]] in the natural caves beneath three peaks: [[Caradhras]], Celebdil, and Fanuidhol (known in Khuzdul as Baranzinbar, Zirakzigil, and Bundushath\u00fbr, respectively). The city, populated by the Longbeards or [[Durin's folk]], grew and prospered continuously through Durin's life (which was so long that he was called Durin the Deathless, also a reference to the belief by his people that he would be reincarnated seven times). It was the only one of the Dwarf-mansions to survive the First Age.\n\nFar to the west of Khazad-d\u00fbm, the great dwarvish cities of Belegost and Nogrod were founded in [[Ered Luin]] (the Blue Mountains) during the [[Years of the Trees]], before the arrival of the Elves in [[Beleriand]]. The Dwarves of Belegost were the first to forge mail of linked rings, and they also traded weaponry with the Sindar and carved the [[Menegroth |Thousand Caves of Menegroth]] for the Elf king [[Thingol]]. In Nogrod, the smith [[Telchar]] forged [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil |Narsil]] and [[Angrist]], two of the most fateful weapons in the history of Arda, as well as the famed Dragon-helm of Dor-L\u00f3min.\n\nThe Dwarves of Beleriand fought against the forces of Melkor during the first age, and the Dwarves of Belegost were the only people able to withstand dragon-fire in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, when King [[Azagh\u00e2l]], who died in the battle, stabbed Glaurung, the first dragon.\n\nThe Dwarves of Nogrod fought against Melkor as well. However, they slew [[Thingol]] out of greed and stole the [[Silmaril]] they had been charged to set into the necklace called Nauglam\u00edr. A number of retaliatory actions ensued, and the Nogrod army was destroyed by a force of [[Laiquendi]] and [[Ent]]s. Both dwarf kingdoms would eventually be destroyed, along with nearly all of Beleriand, after the [[War of Wrath]], with the dwarvish refugees mainly resettling in Khazad-d\u00fbm.\n\n====Second Age====\nAfter the end of the [[First Age]] the power and wealth of Khazad-d\u00fbm was much increased; for it was enriched by many people and much lore and craft when the ancient cities of Nogrod and Belegost in the [[Blue Mountains (Middle-earth) |Blue mountains]] were ruined in the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]].<ref group=T>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[The Lord of the Rings]], Appendix B, \"The Second Age\"</ref>\n\nIts wealth was also enriched with the discovery of ''[[mithril]]'', a magical, extremely valuable, and nearly indestructible metal found only in its mines.\n\nDuring this Age, the Dwarves continued to trade with neighbouring Men and the Elves of Eregion. Seven of the [[Rings of Power]] forged by the Elven-Smiths were later given by [[Sauron]], who had seized them, to the heads of the seven Dwarf clans (although the Longbeards maintained that Durin's Ring was given to him by [[Celebrimbor]]). The Dwarves of Moria at first fought in the War of Sauron and the Elves, but in the year 1697 of the Second Age, the doors of Khazad-d\u00fbm were shut and its inhabitants no longer ventured forth into the world.\n\nOf the Dwarves, few fought upon either side; but the kindred of [[Durin]] of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]] fought against [[Sauron]].<ref group=T>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\"</ref>\n\n====Third Age====\n\nDuring the [[Third Age]] the Dwarves of [[Moria (Middle-earth) |Moria]] continued to prosper until the year 1980, when, in pursuing a vein of ''[[mithril]]'', they broke open a chamber containing the last [[balrog]] known in the histories of Middle-earth, called [[Durin's Bane]]. They battled against the demon for one year, and after the death of two kings, the Dwarves who had not been killed fled from the [[Misty Mountains]]. For almost two decades they had no kingdom, but in the year 1999, Thr\u00e1in I founded a kingdom at the [[Lonely Mountain]]. This kingdom prospered for a time, and the great jewel known as the Arkenstone was discovered.\n\nIn 2210 Thorin I founded a kingdom in the Grey Mountains to the north of [[Mirkwood]]. Both of these realms would eventually be consumed by [[Dragon (Middle-earth) |dragons]]\u2014the Grey Mountains in 2590 and the Lonely Mountain in 2770 by the dragon [[Smaug]]. The refugees from the Grey Mountains who did not return to the Lonely Mountain colonized the [[Iron Hills]], one of the only Dwarf realms never to be abandoned or taken. The main body of the Dwarves became a wandering people, and Thr\u00f3r, who had been king of the Lonely Mountain when it was captured, was slain by [[Orc (Middle-earth) |Orcs]] in the year 2790 and his body mutilated. This led to the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, in which nearly all of the Orc hordes of the Misty Mountains were exterminated but half of the Dwarf host was killed, a blow that took the Dwarves several hundred years to recover from.\n\nFor a time an exile kingdom was founded in the northern [[Ered Luin |Blue Mountains]], but [[Thr\u00e1in II]] was driven to wandering the wilderness by his [[Rings of Power |Ring]], the last of the Dwarvish Rings not yet taken by [[Sauron]] or consumed by dragons. He was soon captured by Sauron, then reigning as the Necromancer in [[Dol Guldur]]. Thr\u00e1in was tortured, his Ring of Power taken, and finally died. In 2941 [[Thorin II Oakenshield]], son of Thr\u00e1in II and grandson of Thr\u00f3r, recolonized the Lonely Mountain after Smaug the dragon was slain by Bard, the future King of [[Dale (Middle-earth) |Dale]]. After the ensuing Battle of Five Armies, in which the [[Eagle (Middle-earth) |Eagles]], the Elves of Mirkwood, the Men of Dale, and the Dwarves of the Iron Hills (as well as Thorin's band) defeated an invading horde of Goblins and in which Thorin was killed, his cousin [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot]], already Lord of the Iron Hills, became King Under the Mountain, and the Lonely Mountain was not abandoned again.\n\nLate in the Third Age, when war and terror grew in [[Rh\u00fbn]], considerable numbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands, where some of them met [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref name=\"R. Tolkien 1954 pp. 52/53\" group=T/>\n\nDwarves did not figure prominently in the major battles of the [[War of the Ring]] although the Lonely Mountain was besieged for a time and D\u00e1in killed in the Battle of Dale. One dwarf, however\u2014[[Gimli (Middle-earth) |Gimli]]\u2014joined the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters) |Fellowship of the Ring]] and was a companion of [[Frodo Baggins |the Ringbearer]] for a great part of his journey, and also fought at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], and the [[Battle of the Morannon]].\n\n====Fourth Age====\nAt the start of the [[Fourth Age]], Gimli led a group of colonists from the Lonely Mountain to the [[Glittering Caves]], beneath Hornburg in [[Rohan (Middle-earth) |Rohan]], where he established another Dwarf kingdom and ruled there for more than a century. After the death of [[Aragorn]] in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, he sailed to the [[Undying Lands]] with [[Legolas]].\n\nIt is told that a few centuries into the [[Fourth Age]], [[Durin VII]] \u2013 a descendant (some sources say the son)<ref>''The Peoples of Middle-earth'': \"The Making of Appendix A\", '(iv) Durin's Folk', p. 279.</ref> of Thorin III Stonehelm \u2013 at last led Durin's Folk back to recolonize [[Khazad-d\u00fbm]], where they remained \"until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended\".<ref group=T>''The Peoples of Middle-earth'': \"The Making of Appendix A\", '(iv) Durin's Folk', p. 278.</ref>\n\nIt is said that the Dwarf population began to dwindle because most male Dwarves did not desire wives, or could not find one that they desired. It does not help that Dwarf women are less than a third of the population (and many of them choose not to marry, as well).<ref name=\"ROTK_ Appendix\" group=T>{{Harvnb |Return of the King |loc= Appendix |Ref=Return of the King 1955}}</ref> Yet much is still left a mystery in Dwarvish history; the Dwarves' true fate is left unknown.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n[[File:Bakshi Gimli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'']] (1978) voiced by [[David Buck]]]]\n\nIn [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' (1986) Dwarven player-characters receive statistical bonuses to Strength and Constitution, and subtractions from Presence, Agility and Intelligence. Seven \"Dwarven Kindreds\", named after each of the founding fathers\u2014Durin, B\u00e1vor, Dw\u00e1lin, Thr\u00e1r, Druin, Thel\u00f3r and B\u00e1rin\u2014are given in ''The Lords of Middle-earth\u2014Volume III'' (1989).\n\n[[File:Dwarves.jpg|thumb|Dwarves at the Council of Elrond in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[live action]] adaptation of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series) |''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], Gimli's character is occasionally used as comic relief and several of his appearances are intended to emphasize the difference between the Dwarves and Elves.\n\nAs explained in the DVD commentary, the races in the Fellowship come in three height ranges: regular sized Men and Elves, Dwarves who average {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|spell=in}}, and Hobbits who average {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|spell=in}}. The adaptation had to digitally composite certain wide shots in which all of them appear, as well as make use of stunt doubles and various camera perspective tricks. However, while the different races come in three size ranges, the adaptations only used ''two'' different size scales, by putting both Dwarves and Hobbits into the same size scale. This was achieved by simply casting tall actors to play Dwarves, who thus seem proportionately taller than the average-height Hobbit actors, without the need for camera tricks or digital compositing. Thus Gimli rarely interacts with Men and Elves within the same camera frame, or when he does, Gimli is actually played by a shorter stunt double seen from behind. In contrast, because Dwarves and Hobbits are in the same size scale, Gimli interacts freely with the Hobbit characters within the same camera frame. A good example is when the Fellowship enters [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], and Gimli walks up to Frodo and puts his hand on his shoulder, warning him to stay close. Actor John Rhys-Davies is actually <nowiki>6'1''</nowiki> (1.85 m) (two inches (5&nbsp;cm) taller than Viggo Mortensen, who plays Aragorn), much taller than Elijah Wood (Frodo) who is <nowiki>5'6''</nowiki> (1.67 m), thus keeping the proportion that Dwarves are taller than Hobbits.\n\nOther dwarves appear in passing in two scenes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' movie: the \"prologue\" introduces the seven dwarf-lords that received the Rings of Power, and four more are present at the [[Council of Elrond]] (in contrast to the book, where only Gimli and his father [[Gl\u00f3in, son of Gr\u00f3in |Gl\u00f3in]] are described). Peter Jackson's Dwarves wear scale armour.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's adaption of ''The Hobbit'', a wider range of dwarves is seen: the 13 in Thorin's Company and others seen early on in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''. Much more of the Dwarves' history and culture is seen throughout the main story, as with the 13 Dwarves of Thorin's Company. Examples of Khuzdul are seen, such as on [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s map, as well as the Dwarves' history, with the main story and the flashbacks. Female dwarves are shown on-screen briefly in the ''Hobbit'' trilogy, in the flashbacks to the fall of Erebor and Dale to Smaug the Dragon\u2014as mentioned in the novels and first trilogy, they are depicted with beards (somewhat thinner than male beards, like very long and braided sideburns). The behind the scenes extras explain that the producers wanted to use the 13 members of Thorin's company to depict a diverse social strata, to round out their personalities and make them less monolithic. The general rule they applied was that Dwarves more closely related to Thorin and the royal line would dress in better clothing and act more aristocratic, spiraling outward: Thorin and his nephews F\u00edli and K\u00edli are of the royal line so they have the richest costumes, followed by Balin and Dwalin (younger cousins of the royal line but still important lords and generals); then \u00d3in and Gl\u00f3in (more distant cousins but of the royal blood, thus a respected doctor and military general, respectively); then Dori, Nori, and Ori (very distant cousins whose relation to the royal line is so distant it isn't even elaborated\u2014they are depicted as well-to-do middle class merchants, but clearly lower on the social scale than Gl\u00f3in or Dwalin); then finally, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur (who aren't related to the royal line at all, and are depicted as humble and simply dressed working-class Dwarves, miners and toy-makers).\n\nIn [[Decipher Inc.]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'' (2001), based on the Jackson films, Dwarf player-characters get bonuses to Vitality and Strength attributes and must be given craft skills. In the ''Dwarves of Middle-earth'' (2003) supplement, the seven Dwarf Lords and their houses are named as Durin, Sindri, Linnar, Var, Uri, Thulin and Vigdis.\n\nIn the real-time strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', and its [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king |expansion]], both based on the Jackson films, Dwarves are heavily influenced by classical military practice, and use throwing axes, war hammers, spears, and circular or Roman-style shields. One dwarf unit is the [[Phalanx formation|\"Phalanx\"]], similar to its [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] counterpart.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist |group=T |28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist |28em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal |Speculative fiction}}\n*[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/khuzdul.htm Khuzdul - ''the secret tongue of the Dwarves''] at Ardalambion\n*[http://www.dwarrowscholar.com/ Dwarves - ''More on Tolkien's Dwarves] at The Dwarrow Scholar\n\n{{Middle-earth}}\n{{The Lord of the Rings}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dwarf (Middle-earth)}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Dwarves |*]]\n", "name_user": "Dkreisst", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSkills and industries:remove circular wlink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_(Middle-earth)"}
