It tells the story of the amnesiac reptilian-headed Caiman working together with his friend Nikaido to recover his memories and survive in a strange and violent world.\n\nThe series was formerly serialized in [[Shogakukan]]'s ''[[seinen manga|seinen]]'' magazine ''[[Monthly Ikki]]'' since 2000, but after its cessation in 2014 the series was moved to ''Hibana'' in 2015. However, after the cessation of ''Hibana'' in August 2017, the series was transferred to ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' magazine in November 2017 and finished in September 2018.\n\nThe series was licensed for an English-language release by [[Viz Media]] in 2009, which began distributing the manga digitally when it launched SigIKKI, the now-former online English version of ''Ikki'' magazine.\n\nA 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] was broadcast from January to March 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Dorohedoro'' story takes place in a [[post-apocalyptic]] setting,<ref name=\"debut\">{{cite web |title=Viz Media Debuts Apocalyptic Dorohedoro Manga |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2010-03-09/viz-media-debuts-apocalypitic-dorohedoro-manga |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |date=March 10, 2010}}</ref> split in two separate dimensions; the Hole, a dismal cityscape where humans reside; and the Sorcerers' world, home of sorcerers. Despite appearing similar, humans and sorcerers are two distinct species, the former evolving naturally, while the latter was created by a primordial devil named Chidaruma. Sorcerers are capable of entering the Hole by summoning magical doors.\n\nSorcerers have specialized organs in their body allowing them to produce \"smoke\", which is the source of their unique magical powers. Some sorcerers have incredibly weak powers while others may be capable of far greater feats such as resurrecting the dead or controlling time; these powers are incredibly rare and highly prized. The amount of smoke a sorcerer is capable of producing (thus how effective their magic may be) also factors into a sorcerer's abilities, and many sorcerers work to improve their smoke output through surgery, or more commonly, the illicit use of black powder, which is distributed by a gang of low-level sorcerers called the Cross-Eyes. Smoke can also be bought and sold. The hierarchy of the sorcerers' world is structured around these differences in ability: powerful sorcerers, such as \u201cThe En Family\u201d, enjoy a life of luxury; while weak sorcerers, who produce such low amounts of smoke they may be unable to use magic at all, live in destitution. Powerful sorcerers may undergo a metamorphosis into a 'devil' \u2014 an immortal being with incredible power, following a rigorous training regime. Devils are deeply respected by sorcerer-kind and also manage the affairs of a third realm, Hell, where they work with Chidaruma to torture the souls of dead sorcerers.\n\nSorcerers regularly visit the Hole in order to practice their magic on human victims, leading to huge numbers of disfigured survivors. Hospitals have been set up to deal with the ever-growing numbers of magic victims, but humans can do little to repel sorcerers. To make matters worse, the residual magic smoke in the air mixes with the Hole's toxic rain, causing the dead to periodically rise from the grave and attack the living. The residents of the Hole call this annual event \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and work with local priests to kill zombies for prizes.\n\n===Plot===\nThe plot centers on a man named Caiman and his search for his real identity after a transformation by a sorcerer left him with a reptile's head and no memory of his former life. Along with his female friend Nikaido, he violently assaults sorcerers in the Hole, with the aim of taking their heads into his mouth, where a strange face will appear and confirm whether the sorcerer he has bitten onto was the one responsible for his transformation or not. Somehow, Caiman is immune to magical effects and as a result is extremely dangerous to sorcerers.\n\nThe news of a lizard-headed magician-killer immune to magic attracts the attention of En, a powerful sorcerer and head of a syndicate known as \u201cThe En Family\u201d, who sends his [[Fixer (person)|cleaners]] to kill Caiman. En himself is currently attempting to scrub out a gang of low-level sorcerers known as the Cross-Eyes, after an encounter with their legendary boss almost cost him his life years ago.\n\nAs the residents of the Hole, the En family and the Cross-Eyes gang, along with many others, collide with one another, the mystery of Caiman's identity begins to unravel, reigniting ancient grudges and threatening to forever change both the Hole and the sorcerers' world.\n\n==Characters==\n=== Residents of the Hole ===\n;{{nihongo|Caiman|\u30ab\u30a4\u30de\u30f3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Wataru Takagi]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:The protagonist of the series. Caiman is a victim of a magic attack that has left him with the head of a reptile and no memory of his original identity. He works with his friend Nikaido to hunt down Sorcerers who enter the Hole, hoping to find the one who cast the spell on him and kill him to nullify it. By biting down on the heads of Sorcerers, a mysterious presence that lives in his mouth communicates with the bewildered Sorcerer, stating whether or not they are \"the one\". Caiman then spits them out and asks the Sorcerer to repeat the information to him. This is his only lead to finding his original identity. Caiman's immunity to magic and formidable knife skills make him incredibly skilled at battling Sorcerers. He also has the ability to regenerate his head, allowing him to survive lethal attacks such as [[decapitation]]. When not fighting, Caiman loves eating [[Jiaozi|gyoza]] and frequently sends Nikaido's restaurant, The Hungry Bug, teetering towards financial ruin due to his reluctance to pay his tab. While his imposing figure frightens some, he is generally well-liked in the Hole. At the beginning of the series, he works part time at a hospital for the treatment of magic victims.\n:Caiman's original identity is a complicated affair. He was born a human in the Hole named Ai Coleman, who dreamed of becoming a Sorcerer. Working with professor Kasukabe, Ai underwent an experimental procedure to transform himself into a Sorcerer, utilising the body parts of eight slaughtered Sorcerers. While acquiring a Sorcerer body, Ai plunged into the Hole's central, toxic lake of refuse, where he made contact with an entity formed from the residual magic soaked into Hole's mud and the souls of countless humans slaughtered by Sorcerers. This entity, known as \"Hole\" entered his body acting as a secondary consciousness that would periodically take over. Following the conclusion of the experiment, Ai was found dead in the corrosive waters of the Hole and was subsequently buried. However, due to the presence of Hole within him, he was revived by the polluted rainwater and escaped into the Sorcerer's world. While living as a Sorcerer, Ai bounced between [[Dissociative identity disorder|two distinct personalities]]; Aikawa, a carefree student, and Kai, the murderous boss of 'the Cross-Eye Gang', who began to orchestrate Hole's ancient revenge plot by slaughtering Sorcerers and collecting their devil tumours (the source of each sorcerer's unique power). Ultimately, Caiman came into being when Kai murdered Aikawa's best friend, Risu, triggering his unique \"curse\" magic and sending Kai fleeing back into the Hole. Risu's vengeful ghost decapitated him. However, due to the original 8 sorcerer corpses used in the experiment, he now had 9 heads which functioned as 9 lives. As the second head began to emerge, Kai's headless corpse smashed a bottle of reptile-transformation smoke he had been given for protection. These multiple magic effects smashed together, trapping Risu's curse within Kai's body (the source of the man in his mouth), transforming his head into a lizard's and severely damaging his memories.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nikaid\u014d|\u4e8c\u968e\u5802|Nikaid\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Reina Kond\u014d]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Caiman's best friend, and owner of the Hungry Bug, a gyoza restaurant in the Hole. She found Caiman after his initial transformation and helps him hunt down Sorcerers in the hopes of returning his memories and face. She is secretly a Sorcerer herself, and the only known Sorcerer capable of time manipulation. Unwilling to use her magic due to an incident in her youth, she fled to the Hole at a young age and has resided there ever since. Despite this, she has powerful contacts in the Sorcerer's world, namely a devil named Asu who was once a childhood friend. Nikaido is an incredibly skilled fighter in spite of not using magic, typically utilising powerful kicks and acrobatics to disable foes.\n\n;{{nihongo|Professor Kasukabe|\u6625\u65e5\u90e8\u535a\u58eb|Kasukabe hakase}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mitsuhiro Ichiki]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:A mad scientist obsessed with Sorcerers who has studied them intently for decades. He is approached by Caiman and Nikaido to use his artificial door to the Sorcerer's world. Although in his 60s, he looks incredibly young due to magic cast on him by his estranged, Sorcerer wife, Haru, who has since become a devil. His real name is Haze. He is frequently seen with his sidekick, Jonson. Kasukabe is one of the only characters who remembers Ai Coleman and played a pivotal role in Caiman's history.\n\n;{{nihongo|Jonson|\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30bd\u30f3|Jonson}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]}}<ref name=\"more-cast\">{{cite web |author1=Jennifer Sherman |title=Dorohedoro Anime Casts Ryohei Kimura, Yuuki Kaji |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-09/dorohedoro-anime-casts-ryohei-kimura-yuuki-kaji/.156268 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 9, 2020 |date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n:A giant cockroach living in the sewers of the Hole who was mutated by the residual smoke in the Hole's polluted water. Jonson originally belonged to another resident of the Hole who was hunting down magic victims, but is later adopted by Professor Kasukabe and rarely leaves his side from then on. Kasukabe is able to control Jonson using specialised frequencies and can even make him talk, though he is only capable of saying \"shocking\".\n\n;{{nihongo|Vaux|\u30d0\u30a6\u30af\u30b9|Baukusu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hisao Egawa]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n\n;{{nihongo|13|\u30b5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3|S\u0101t\u012bn}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]}}<ref name=\"more-cast\"/>\n\n=== The En Family ===\n;{{nihongo|En|\u7159}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenyu Horiuchi]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:En is shown to be the Corporate boss of a business that sells mushroom-based products, ranging from food, weaponry, psychedelics and housing. He's shown to be a man who has a large expansive group of lackeys, and is Noi and Shin's boss. He wears a mask that holds over his mouth similar to a surgeon's mask, and his smoke can turn people and objects into mushrooms. He is also quite fond of mushrooms, so much so that he themes every product he sells after them, and tends to only eat mushrooms.\n:From the moment he was born, En was surrounded by mushrooms. He believes he transformed his parents into mushrooms, and survived by eating them until a man entered his house and sold him off to a group who extracted and sold smoke from Sorcerers. He escaped when he was nine, where he was found by a devil who dumped him into hell. En only survived the journey into hell because he was so full of hate that he couldn't risk dying before exacting revenge. In hell he survived by creating mushrooms to feed upon. Some time after the devil Chidaruma found him and gave him the name 'En', then sent him back to the surface. A year and a half later he exacted his revenge against the workers in the factory who stole the magic of others. He destroyed the factory and made all the victims inside his friends. It was from there his criminal empire began to grow.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shin|\u5fc3}} {{nobold|and}} {{nihongo|Noi|\u80fd\u4e95}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]}} (Shin)<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]}} (Noi)<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Shin and Noi are En's [[Mob enforcer|enforcers]]. As partners, Shin and Noi are commonly shown competing with one another while on a job, placing bets on who can kill more people, or kill a person faster.\n:Shin is one of the most powerful fighters. He fights with a hammer as a weapon and uses magic smoke that slices up victims without killing them. Shin's mask is shaped like a human heart, although he usually wears it backwards. Without the mask he is blond with blue eyes, and wears glasses. He is usually in a suit with an untucked white shirt and sneakers.\n:Noi is a powerful cleaner for En's organization and is also En's younger cousin. She is heavily muscled and towering in height. Noi's hair is pale white-blond, and her eyes appear red\u2014suggesting she might be [[Albinism|albino]]. Her hair is mid length, and she has several piercings on her ears. Her smoke heals almost any injury short of actual death. She is very affectionate to Shin, sometimes to his exasperation. Noi's mask is very detailed, dark blue and apparently vinylic.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fujita|\u85e4\u7530}}\n:{{voiced by|Kengo Takanashi}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Fujita is a low-level who works for a company headed by En.\n:His partner is killed by Caiman. He is assigned to find the Sorcerer who transformed Caiman into a saurian. A bit of research reveals a reptilian transformation specialist\u2014Ebisu. Fujita recalls passing her while in the Hole, and so he manages to locate and save her just as she's stuck in the jaws of Caiman. The incident leaves Ebisu traumatized, and Fujita watches after her while waiting for her memory to return.\n:Fujita wears a trapper hat and a Tengu mask, and is known to cover his eyes during horror movies. His magic has yet to be defined, although he fired his smoke like bullets on one occasion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ebisu|\u6075\u6bd4\u5bff}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Tomita]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Ebisu is a young and sullen-looking woman who wears a skull-shaped mask. While in the Hole, she runs into Caiman and Nikaido, who cut off Ebisu's fingers to prevent her from using magic, and bites down on her head after removing her mask. Before he can withdraw to ask her his question, a frantic Fujita appears from a door behind her and forcefully pulls her out of his clamped-down jaws into the door. After this incident, Ebisu is shown to be haunted by nightmares, and has become somewhat insane. At En's residence, she is restrained until Noi can properly heal and restore her fingers and face. Past that point, it is evident her head trauma caused some brain damage, as seen in her suddenly eccentric behavior. She is commonly seen with Fujita.\n:Records state she is skilled in Reptile transformation. However between panels it shows her having attacked someone with a surplus of power after being fed Black Powder by someone who appeared to have met her before. It is revealed she was a black smoke user, and had heard the words said to her from the man inside Caiman's head. Some of her memories return when she herself transforms into a large dinosauric lizard, proving that the consumption of black powder from a young age has caused an increase in power. It is eventually revealed that she was the one who hexed Caiman when she is temporarily killed and the spell is lifted from Caiman. It is revealed later that this is due to a bottle of her smoke that she had sold, and not a direct curse.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kikurage|\u30ad\u30af\u30e9\u30b2}}\n:{{voiced by|Mayu Udono}}<ref name=\"staff2\"/>\nKikurage is a small, white chimeric creature. She has long, fluffy ears, cloven hind-legs and stumpy forelegs. Two of her most notable features are the tiny black horns sticking out of her head, as well as her Devil tail. She has brown spots on her back and tends to let her long tongue hang out of her mouth.It is a devilish looking creature that has the ability to revive devil tumors inside of sorcerers, which is essentially the life source for sorcerers.\nKikurage wears a red, stitched mask with several holes for her horns, mouth and ears.<ref>https://dorohedoro.fandom.com/wiki/Kikurage</ref>\n\nIt was previously controlled by the Life-Giving Sorcerer to perform reviving tricks, En was originally planning to make her his partner, but when he saw she had signs of black smoke on her mouth, En was enraged and turned her into mushrooms, en found Kikurage inside her shirt and took it as a pet and naming it what it is.\n\nIt has a personality of being arrogant and only heal those it adores and when it wants to, it was also doted endlessly by both En and Ebisu throughout the series.\n\n;{{nihongo|Turkey|\u30bf\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc|T\u0101k\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shin-ichiro Miki]]}}<ref name=\"staff2\"/>\nThey are a high level sorcerer with the ability to create living dolls of people using food, which look exactly like the original.

It tells the story of the amnesiac reptilian-headed Caiman working together with his friend Nikaido to recover his memories and survive in a strange and violent world.\n\nThe series was formerly serialized in [[Shogakukan]]'s ''[[seinen manga|seinen]]'' magazine ''[[Monthly Ikki]]'' since 2000, but after its cessation in 2014 the series was moved to ''Hibana'' in 2015. However, after the cessation of ''Hibana'' in August 2017, the series was transferred to ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' magazine in November 2017 and finished in September 2018.\n\nThe series was licensed for an English-language release by [[Viz Media]] in 2009, which began distributing the manga digitally when it launched SigIKKI, the now-former online English version of ''Ikki'' magazine.\n\nA 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] was broadcast from January to March 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Dorohedoro'' story takes place in a [[post-apocalyptic]] setting,<ref name=\"debut\">{{cite web |title=Viz Media Debuts Apocalyptic Dorohedoro Manga |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2010-03-09/viz-media-debuts-apocalypitic-dorohedoro-manga |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |date=March 10, 2010}}</ref> split in two separate dimensions; the Hole, a dismal cityscape where humans reside; and the Sorcerers' world, home of sorcerers. Despite appearing similar, humans and sorcerers are two distinct species, the former evolving naturally, while the latter was created by a primordial devil named Chidaruma. Sorcerers are capable of entering the Hole by summoning magical doors.\n\nSorcerers have specialized organs in their body allowing them to produce \"smoke\", which is the source of their unique magical powers. Some sorcerers have incredibly weak powers while others may be capable of far greater feats such as resurrecting the dead or controlling time; these powers are incredibly rare and highly prized. The amount of smoke a sorcerer is capable of producing (thus how effective their magic may be) also factors into a sorcerer's abilities, and many sorcerers work to improve their smoke output through surgery, or more commonly, the illicit use of black powder, which is distributed by a gang of low-level sorcerers called the Cross-Eyes. Smoke can also be bought and sold. The hierarchy of the sorcerers' world is structured around these differences in ability: powerful sorcerers, such as \u201cThe En Family\u201d, enjoy a life of luxury; while weak sorcerers, who produce such low amounts of smoke they may be unable to use magic at all, live in destitution. Powerful sorcerers may undergo a metamorphosis into a 'devil' \u2014 an immortal being with incredible power, following a rigorous training regime. Devils are deeply respected by sorcerer-kind and also manage the affairs of a third realm, Hell, where they work with Chidaruma to torture the souls of dead sorcerers.\n\nSorcerers regularly visit the Hole in order to practice their magic on human victims, leading to huge numbers of disfigured survivors. Hospitals have been set up to deal with the ever-growing numbers of magic victims, but humans can do little to repel sorcerers. To make matters worse, the residual magic smoke in the air mixes with the Hole's toxic rain, causing the dead to periodically rise from the grave and attack the living. The residents of the Hole call this annual event \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and work with local priests to kill zombies for prizes.\n\n===Plot===\nThe plot centers on a man named Caiman and his search for his real identity after a transformation by a sorcerer left him with a reptile's head and no memory of his former life. Along with his female friend Nikaido, he violently assaults sorcerers in the Hole, with the aim of taking their heads into his mouth, where a strange face will appear and confirm whether the sorcerer he has bitten onto was the one responsible for his transformation or not. Somehow, Caiman is immune to magical effects and as a result is extremely dangerous to sorcerers.\n\nThe news of a lizard-headed magician-killer immune to magic attracts the attention of En, a powerful sorcerer and head of a syndicate known as \u201cThe En Family\u201d, who sends his [[Fixer (person)|cleaners]] to kill Caiman. En himself is currently attempting to scrub out a gang of low-level sorcerers known as the Cross-Eyes, after an encounter with their legendary boss almost cost him his life years ago.\n\nAs the residents of the Hole, the En family and the Cross-Eyes gang, along with many others, collide with one another, the mystery of Caiman's identity begins to unravel, reigniting ancient grudges and threatening to forever change both the Hole and the sorcerers' world.\n\n==Characters==\n=== Residents of the Hole ===\n;{{nihongo|Caiman|\u30ab\u30a4\u30de\u30f3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Wataru Takagi]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:The protagonist of the series. Caiman is a victim of a magic attack that has left him with the head of a reptile and no memory of his original identity. He works with his friend Nikaido to hunt down Sorcerers who enter the Hole, hoping to find the one who cast the spell on him and kill him to nullify it. By biting down on the heads of Sorcerers, a mysterious presence that lives in his mouth communicates with the bewildered Sorcerer, stating whether or not they are \"the one\". Caiman then spits them out and asks the Sorcerer to repeat the information to him. This is his only lead to finding his original identity. Caiman's immunity to magic and formidable knife skills make him incredibly skilled at battling Sorcerers. He also has the ability to regenerate his head, allowing him to survive lethal attacks such as [[decapitation]]. When not fighting, Caiman loves eating [[Jiaozi|gyoza]] and frequently sends Nikaido's restaurant, The Hungry Bug, teetering towards financial ruin due to his reluctance to pay his tab. While his imposing figure frightens some, he is generally well-liked in the Hole. At the beginning of the series, he works part time at a hospital for the treatment of magic victims.\n:Caiman's original identity is a complicated affair. He was born a human in the Hole named Ai Coleman, who dreamed of becoming a Sorcerer. Working with professor Kasukabe, Ai underwent an experimental procedure to transform himself into a Sorcerer, utilising the body parts of eight slaughtered Sorcerers. While acquiring a Sorcerer body, Ai plunged into the Hole's central, toxic lake of refuse, where he made contact with an entity formed from the residual magic soaked into Hole's mud and the souls of countless humans slaughtered by Sorcerers. This entity, known as \"Hole\" entered his body acting as a secondary consciousness that would periodically take over. Following the conclusion of the experiment, Ai was found dead in the corrosive waters of the Hole and was subsequently buried. However, due to the presence of Hole within him, he was revived by the polluted rainwater and escaped into the Sorcerer's world. While living as a Sorcerer, Ai bounced between [[Dissociative identity disorder|two distinct personalities]]; Aikawa, a carefree student, and Kai, the murderous boss of 'the Cross-Eye Gang', who began to orchestrate Hole's ancient revenge plot by slaughtering Sorcerers and collecting their devil tumours (the source of each sorcerer's unique power). Ultimately, Caiman came into being when Kai murdered Aikawa's best friend, Risu, triggering his unique \"curse\" magic and sending Kai fleeing back into the Hole. Risu's vengeful ghost decapitated him. However, due to the original 8 sorcerer corpses used in the experiment, he now had 9 heads which functioned as 9 lives. As the second head began to emerge, Kai's headless corpse smashed a bottle of reptile-transformation smoke he had been given for protection. These multiple magic effects smashed together, trapping Risu's curse within Kai's body (the source of the man in his mouth), transforming his head into a lizard's and severely damaging his memories.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nikaid\u014d|\u4e8c\u968e\u5802|Nikaid\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Reina Kond\u014d]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Caiman's best friend, and owner of the Hungry Bug, a gyoza restaurant in the Hole. She found Caiman after his initial transformation and helps him hunt down Sorcerers in the hopes of returning his memories and face. She is secretly a Sorcerer herself, and the only known Sorcerer capable of time manipulation. Unwilling to use her magic due to an incident in her youth, she fled to the Hole at a young age and has resided there ever since. Despite this, she has powerful contacts in the Sorcerer's world, namely a devil named Asu who was once a childhood friend. Nikaido is an incredibly skilled fighter in spite of not using magic, typically utilising powerful kicks and acrobatics to disable foes.\n\n;{{nihongo|Professor Kasukabe|\u6625\u65e5\u90e8\u535a\u58eb|Kasukabe hakase}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mitsuhiro Ichiki]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:A mad scientist obsessed with Sorcerers who has studied them intently for decades. He is approached by Caiman and Nikaido to use his artificial door to the Sorcerer's world. Although in his 60s, he looks incredibly young due to magic cast on him by his estranged, Sorcerer wife, Haru, who has since become a devil. His real name is Haze. He is frequently seen with his sidekick, Jonson. Kasukabe is one of the only characters who remembers Ai Coleman and played a pivotal role in Caiman's history.\n\n;{{nihongo|Jonson|\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30bd\u30f3|Jonson}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]}}<ref name=\"more-cast\">{{cite web |author1=Jennifer Sherman |title=Dorohedoro Anime Casts Ryohei Kimura, Yuuki Kaji |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-09/dorohedoro-anime-casts-ryohei-kimura-yuuki-kaji/.156268 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 9, 2020 |date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n:A giant cockroach living in the sewers of the Hole who was mutated by the residual smoke in the Hole's polluted water.

He's shown to be a man who has a large expansive group of lackeys, and is Noi and Shin's boss. He wears a mask that holds over his mouth similar to a surgeon's mask, and his smoke can turn people and objects into mushrooms. He is also quite fond of mushrooms, so much so that he themes every product he sells after them, and tends to only eat mushrooms.\n:From the moment he was born, En was surrounded by mushrooms. He believes he transformed his parents into mushrooms, and survived by eating them until a man entered his house and sold him off to a group who extracted and sold smoke from Sorcerers. He escaped when he was nine, where he was found by a devil who dumped him into hell. En only survived the journey into hell because he was so full of hate that he couldn't risk dying before exacting revenge. In hell he survived by creating mushrooms to feed upon. Some time after the devil Chidaruma found him and gave him the name 'En', then sent him back to the surface. A year and a half later he exacted his revenge against the workers in the factory who stole the magic of others. He destroyed the factory and made all the victims inside his friends. It was from there his criminal empire began to grow.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shin|\u5fc3}} {{nobold|and}} {{nihongo|Noi|\u80fd\u4e95}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]}} (Shin)<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]}} (Noi)<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Shin and Noi are En's [[Mob enforcer|enforcers]]. As partners, Shin and Noi are commonly shown competing with one another while on a job, placing bets on who can kill more people, or kill a person faster.\n:Shin is one of the most powerful fighters. He fights with a hammer as a weapon and uses magic smoke that slices up victims without killing them. Shin's mask is shaped like a human heart, although he usually wears it backwards. Without the mask he is blond with blue eyes, and wears glasses. He is usually in a suit with an untucked white shirt and sneakers.\n:Noi is a powerful cleaner for En's organization and is also En's younger cousin. She is heavily muscled and towering in height. Noi's hair is pale white-blond, and her eyes appear red\u2014suggesting she might be [[Albinism|albino]]. Her hair is mid length, and she has several piercings on her ears. Her smoke heals almost any injury short of actual death. She is very affectionate to Shin, sometimes to his exasperation. Noi's mask is very detailed, dark blue and apparently vinylic.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fujita|\u85e4\u7530}}\n:{{voiced by|Kengo Takanashi}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Fujita is a low-level who works for a company headed by En.\n:His partner is killed by Caiman. He is assigned to find the Sorcerer who transformed Caiman into a saurian. A bit of research reveals a reptilian transformation specialist\u2014Ebisu. Fujita recalls passing her while in the Hole, and so he manages to locate and save her just as she's stuck in the jaws of Caiman. The incident leaves Ebisu traumatized, and Fujita watches after her while waiting for her memory to return.\n:Fujita wears a trapper hat and a Tengu mask, and is known to cover his eyes during horror movies. His magic has yet to be defined, although he fired his smoke like bullets on one occasion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ebisu|\u6075\u6bd4\u5bff}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Tomita]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Ebisu is a young and sullen-looking woman who wears a skull-shaped mask. While in the Hole, she runs into Caiman and Nikaido, who cut off Ebisu's fingers to prevent her from using magic, and bites down on her head after removing her mask. Before he can withdraw to ask her his question, a frantic Fujita appears from a door behind her and forcefully pulls her out of his clamped-down jaws into the door. After this incident, Ebisu is shown to be haunted by nightmares, and has become somewhat insane. At En's residence, she is restrained until Noi can properly heal and restore her fingers and face. Past that point, it is evident her head trauma caused some brain damage, as seen in her suddenly eccentric behavior. She is commonly seen with Fujita.\n:Records state she is skilled in Reptile transformation. However between panels it shows her having attacked someone with a surplus of power after being fed Black Powder by someone who appeared to have met her before. It is revealed she was a black smoke user, and had heard the words said to her from the man inside Caiman's head. Some of her memories return when she herself transforms into a large dinosauric lizard, proving that the consumption of black powder from a young age has caused an increase in power. It is eventually revealed that she was the one who hexed Caiman when she is temporarily killed and the spell is lifted from Caiman. It is revealed later that this is due to a bottle of her smoke that she had sold, and not a direct curse.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kikurage|\u30ad\u30af\u30e9\u30b2}}\n:{{voiced by|Mayu Udono}}<ref name=\"staff2\"/>\nKikurage is a small, white chimeric creature.

He graduated from the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1913 and the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] in 1921, and was assigned to administrative duties within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]]. He spent two years as the head of the War History Bureau, during which time he came into contact with many important members of the ''[[T\u014dseiha]]'' political faction within the Army, including [[Kuniaki Koiso]] and [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], and was involved in the creation of the [[Sakurakai]] organization with [[Kingoro Hashimoto]]. Also during this period, he had serious conflicts with the head of the General Affairs section of the General Staff [[Renya Mutaguchi]], who also happened to be a staunch supporter of the rival ''[[K\u014dd\u014dha]]'' faction. he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in December 1932 and assigned to the IJA 11th Infantry Regiment. From August 1934, he was assigned to the staff of the [[IJA 6th Division]]. During the [[February 26 incident]], IJA 6th Division played a role in the suppression of the pro-''K\u014dd\u014dha'' attempted coup-d'etat. \n\n===Soviet-Japanese border conflict===\nSat\u014d was promoted to colonel in October 1937 and assigned command of the [[Manchukuo]]-based IJA 75th Infantry Regiment. His regiment was at the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]], refusing to budge from its positions even after sustaining over 50% casualties, and then ousted the Soviet forces from a disputed hill in a night assault which the Japanese considered to be a model of its tactical type.  Sat\u014d later boasted that since he was not in favor with T\u014dj\u014d, his unit had been given the worst position on the front lines, and he looked forward to being given the worst position again at the next battle.  From December 1938 he was commander of the 2nd Sector, 8th Border Garrison, which was at the  [[Nomonhan Incident]]. In  August 1939 he was promoted to [[major general]] and was assigned to command the IJA 23rd Infantry Brigade, in [[Hailar District|Hailar]], Manchukuo.\n\n===The Burma campaign===\nIn March 1941, Sat\u014d was attached to the staff of the [[54th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 54th Division]] and in October 1941 became commander of the IJA 67th Independent Brigade. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in December 1942. From March 1943, he was assigned command of the [[31st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 31st Division]] from the time of its activation in China. Assigned to construction operations in [[Thailand]], the division was ordered to [[Burma]] to join the [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|Fifteenth Army]] in September, 1943. The Japanese plan to invade India, codenamed [[Operation U-Go|U-Go]], was originally intended as a spoiling attack against the [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]] at [[Imphal]], to disrupt the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] offensive plans for that year. The commander of the Fifteenth Army was none other than his old nemesis [[Lieutenant General]] [[Renya Mutaguchi]]. Despite the objections of his staff, Mutaguchi enlarged the plan to include an invasion of India itself and perhaps even overthrow the [[British Raj]].<ref>Allen, pp. 154\u2013155</ref> Despite reports to Tokyo from his subordinates on the infeasibility of the plan, the objections were eventually overruled by [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]].\n\nPart of the plan involved sending the 31st Division (which was composed of 58th, 124th, and 138th Regiments, and the 31st Mountain Artillery Regiment) to capture [[Kohima]] and thus cut off Imphal, and then destroy the [[rail yard]] at [[Dimapur]]. Divisional commander Sat\u014d was unhappy with his role. He had not been involved in the planning of the offensive and seriously doubted the Japanese chances for success; he had already told his staff that they might all starve to death, as Mutaguchi made no provision for logistics or resupply.<ref>Allen, p.232</ref>\n\nIn common with many senior Japanese officers, Sat\u014d considered Mutaguchi to be a \"blockhead\", although General [[General Slim|William Slim]] considered Sat\u014d himself to be {{Quotation|...the most unenterprising of all the Japanese generals I encountered. He had been ordered to take Kohima and dig in. His bullet head was filled with one idea only - to take Kohima. It never struck him that he could inflict terrible damage on us without taking Kohima at all. Leaving a small force to contain it, and moving by tracks to the east of Warren's brigade at Nichugard, he could, by 5 April, have struck the railway with the bulk of his division. But he had no vision, so, as his troops came up, he flung them into attack after attack on the little town of Kohima.|William Slim|[[Defeat into Victory]]|}}.<ref>Allen, pp.284\u2013285</ref>\nBy the middle of May, Sato's troops were starving as had been predicted. He considered that Mutaguchi and the HQ of Japanese Fifteenth Army were taking little notice of his situation, as they had issued several confusing and contradictory orders to him during April.<ref name=Allen287>Allen, p.287</ref> Because the main attack on Imphal faltered around the middle of April, Mutaguchi ordered 31st Division or parts of it to join in the attack on Imphal from the north, even while the division was struggling to capture and hold Kohima. Sat\u014d considered that his division was being \"messed around\" without proper planning or consideration for the conditions. Nor did Sat\u014d believe that Fifteenth Army headquarters were exerting themselves to move supplies to his division.<ref>Allen, pp.287\u2013293</ref> He began pulling his troops back to conserve their strength, thus allowing the British to secure Kohima Ridge.\n\nOn 25 May, Sat\u014d notified Fifteenth Army HQ that he would withdraw on 1 June unless his division received supplies.<ref>Allen, p.288</ref>  Finally on 31 May, he abandoned positions north of the road, in spite of orders from Mutaguchi to hold his positions.<ref>Allen, p.289</ref> (For a divisional commander to retreat without orders or permission from his superior was unheard-of in the Japanese Army.)<ref>Allen, p.292 (fn), p.308</ref> After ignoring army orders for several weeks, Sat\u014d was removed from command of 31st Division on 7 July 1944.\n\nSat\u014d refused an invitation by Mutaguchi to commit ''[[seppuku]]'' and demanded a [[court martial]] to clear his name and publicly expose Mutaguchi's incompetence. At the prompting of Lieutenant General [[Masakazu Kawabe]], commander of [[Burma Area Army]], doctors declared that he had suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and was unfit to stand trial on 23 November 1944.<ref>Allen, p.309</ref> \n\nHe was ordered to retire, but was recalled to active duty immediately and assigned to the staff of the [[Sixteenth Army (Japan)|Sixteenth Army]], which was a garrison force in [[Java]]. In May 1945, he was attached to the staff of the [[Sendai]]-based Northeastern Area Army, which was assigned to defend the [[Tohoku region]] of Japan against possible Allied invasion. \n\n===Postwar===\nAfter the [[surrender of Japan]], Sat\u014d was often vilified in the press as a coward and was accused of causing the Japanese defeat in Burma. For his part, Sat\u014d continued to insist until his death in 1959 that the actions he took were necessary to save the lives of his men, and that the charges of insanity made against him for withdrawing from the battle were unjustified. Sat\u014d devoted his efforts to assisting surviving members of his former command, and he created a group of ex-army men who erected a monuments to the fallen of the Imphal Campaign in [[Matsuyama, Ehime]] and in [[Shonai, Yamagata]]. \n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Allen|first=Louis|title=Burma: The Longest War 1941\u201345|origyear=1984|year=2000|publisher=Phoenix Press|location=London|isbn=1-84212-260-6}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brayley|first=Martin|title=The British Army 1939\u201345 (3): The Far East|year=2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=London|isbn=1-84176-238-5}}\n* {{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Leslie|title=Kohima: The Furthest Battle|year=2009|publisher=[[The History Press]]|location=|isbn=978-1-86227-488-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Latimer|first=Jon|title=Burma: The Forgotten War|year=2004|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn=978-0-7195-6576-2}}\n*{{cite book | last = Dupuy  | first =  Trevor N.  | coauthors =  | year = 2006 | title = [[Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography]]  | publisher = HarperCollins Publishers  | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-7858-0437-4 }}\n*{{cite book  | last = Fuller  | first = Richard  | coauthors =   | year = 1992  | title = Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai  | publisher = Arms and Armor  | location = London  | isbn = 1-85409-151-4  | url-access = registration  | url = https://archive.org/details/shokanhirohitoss00full  }}\n<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3560238.stm|title=After the war my father didn't recognise me|work=BBC News|accessdate=2008-03-27|last=|first=| date=August 13, 2004}}\n</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web| last = Ammenthorp| first = Steen| url = http://www.generals.dk/general/Sato/Kotoku/Japan.html| title = Sato, Kotoku\n| work = The Generals of World War II}}\n*{{cite web| last = Budge| first = Kent| url = http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/S/a/Sato_Kotoku.htm\n| title = Sato Kotoku| work = Pacific War Online Encyclopedia}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sato, Kotoku}}\n[[Category:1893 births]]\n[[Category:1959 deaths]]\n[[Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:Japanese generals]]\n[[Category:People from Yamagata Prefecture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n|name= K\u014dtoku Sat\u014d\n|native_name=\u4f50\u85e4 \u5e78\u5fb3\n|native_name_lang=jpn\n|birth_date={{birth date|1893|03|05}}\n|death_date=  {{Death date and age|1959|02|26|1893|03|05}}\n|birth_place=[[Yamagata Prefecture]], [[Japan]]\n|death_place= \n|image=\n|caption=\n|nickname=\n|allegiance={{Flag|Empire of Japan}}\n|branch={{army|Empire of Japan}}\n|serviceyears=1913 -1945\n|rank=[[Lieutenant General]]\n|commands= [[31st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|31st Division]]\n|unit=\n|battles= [[Soviet-Japanese Border Wars]]<br />[[World War II]]\n|awards=\n|family=\n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{nihongo|'''K\u014dtoku Sat\u014d'''|\u4f50\u85e4 \u5e78\u5fb3|Sat\u014d K\u014dtoku|extra= March 5, 1893 &ndash; February 26, 1959}} was a [[lieutenant general]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[World War II]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\nSat\u014d was born in [[Yamagata prefecture]] and attended military preparatory school in [[Sendai]].

At the prompting of Lieutenant General [[Masakazu Kawabe]], commander of [[Burma Area Army]], doctors declared that he had suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and was unfit to stand trial on 23 November 1944.<ref>Allen, p.309</ref> \n\nHe was ordered to retire, but was recalled to active duty immediately and assigned to the staff of the [[Sixteenth Army (Japan)|Sixteenth Army]], which was a garrison force in [[Java]]. In May 1945, he was attached to the staff of the [[Sendai]]-based Northeastern Area Army, which was assigned to defend the [[Tohoku region]] of Japan against possible Allied invasion. \n\n===Postwar===\nAfter the [[surrender of Japan]], Sat\u014d was often vilified in the press as a coward and was accused of causing the Japanese defeat in Burma. For his part, Sat\u014d continued to insist until his death in 1959 that the actions he took were necessary to save the lives of his men, and that the charges of insanity made against him for withdrawing from the battle were unjustified. Sat\u014d devoted his efforts to assisting surviving members of his former command, and he created a group of ex-army men who erected a monuments to the fallen of the Imphal Campaign in [[Matsuyama, Ehime]] and in [[Shonai, Yamagata]]. \n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Allen|first=Louis|title=Burma: The Longest War 1941\u201345|origyear=1984|year=2000|publisher=Phoenix Press|location=London|isbn=1-84212-260-6}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brayley|first=Martin|title=The British Army 1939\u201345 (3): The Far East|year=2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=London|isbn=1-84176-238-5}}\n* {{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Leslie|title=Kohima: The Furthest Battle|year=2009|publisher=[[The History Press]]|location=|isbn=978-1-86227-488-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Latimer|first=Jon|title=Burma: The Forgotten War|year=2004|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn=978-0-7195-6576-2}}\n*{{cite book | last = Dupuy  | first =  Trevor N.  | coauthors =  | year = 2006 | title = [[Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography]]  | publisher = HarperCollins Publishers  | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-7858-0437-4 }}\n*{{cite book  | last = Fuller  | first = Richard  | coauthors =   | year = 1992  | title = Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai  | publisher = Arms and Armor  | location = London  | isbn = 1-85409-151-4  | url-access = registration  | url = https://archive.org/details/shokanhirohitoss00full  }}\n<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3560238.stm|title=After the war my father didn't recognise me|work=BBC News|accessdate=2008-03-27|last=|first=| date=August 13, 2004}}\n</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web| last = Ammenthorp| first = Steen| url = http://www.generals.dk/general/Sato/Kotoku/Japan.html| title = Sato, Kotoku\n| work = The Generals of World War II}}\n*{{cite web| last = Budge| first = Kent| url = http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/S/a/Sato_Kotoku.htm\n| title = Sato Kotoku| work = Pacific War Online Encyclopedia}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sato, Kotoku}}\n[[Category:1893 births]]\n[[Category:1959 deaths]]\n[[Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:Japanese generals]]\n[[Category:People from Yamagata Prefecture]]\n", "name_user": "EdmundT", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSoviet-Japanese border conflict:Spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dtoku_Sat%C5%8D"}

Relocating again to [[San Francisco]] the next year, they released 1992's ''[[Bivouac (album)|Bivouac]]'' through the Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.\n\nSchwarzenbach's charisma and personal, frustrated lyrics helped establish him as a [[cult following|cult idol]], even as he underwent surgery to remove painful, voice-threatening [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]]s from his throat. Jawbreaker toured with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] in 1993 and released ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]'' in 1994, attracting the attention of major labels. They signed a $1 million contract with [[DGC Records]] and released 1995's ''[[Dear You]]'', but its polished production and smooth vocals caused significant backlash from the band's core audience.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Internal tensions led to Jawbreaker's dissolution in 1996. On April 19, 2017, the band announced their reunion.<ref name=\"reunion\"/>\n\nFollowing the breakup, the members of Jawbreaker were active in other projects including [[Jets to Brazil]] and [[Whysall Lane]]. Pfahler continued to issue previously-recorded Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, and public interest in the band continued due in part to nationally charting [[pop punk]] and emo acts openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound. In 2004, Pfahler licensed the out-of-print ''Dear You'' from DGC's parent company [[Geffen Records]] and re-released it to a positive response.

Records]], [[Capitol Records]], and DGC.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> They signed to DGC in a one million-dollar deal, due in part to the relationship they had developed with [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Mark Kates who they had met on the Nirvana tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Fans and key figures in the punk rock community were quick to denounce the band for the move.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> In an interview for [[Ben Weasel]]'s ''Panic Button'' zine following the Nirvana tour, Schwarzenbach had stated flatly that Jawbreaker was not interested in signing to a major record label. In response to the signing, Weasel took the band to task in a column for ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' accompanied by a photo depicting him eating his own hat, which he had promised to do if the band ever signed to a major.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u201396: ''Dear You'' and breakup ===\nJawbreaker began recording their major-label debut, ''[[Dear You]]'', in February 1995 at [[Fantasy Studios]] in [[Berkeley, California]] with [[Rob Cavallo]], who had [[record producer|produced]] Green Day's breakthrough album ''[[Dookie]]'' the previous year.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Recording sessions lasted two months and resulted in disenchantment and tension within the band, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> After a week of recording drums and bass guitar, Bauermeister and Pfahler were largely absent from the rest of the sessions while Schwarzenbach continued to work on the album with Cavallo.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I didn't even go\", recalled Bauermeister in 2010, \"I just hung out at home with my wife. I was already trying to separate myself from the band, while Blake became more of the major force.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> With a large recording budget at their disposal, Schwarzenbach and Cavallo spent much of their time polishing the record's production value, making the vocals and guitar clear and bringing them to the forefront of the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Cavallo, \"Blake really wanted to be heard. I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently. Then, to me, I thought those songs could benefit from some precision.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n[[File:Rob Cavallo.jpg|thumb|upright|Producer [[Rob Cavallo]] gave ''Dear You'' very polished production value in comparison to Jawbreaker's previous albums.]] \nIn the months leading up to the album's release, a number of music publications positioned Jawbreaker as the next stars of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] punk scene, sometimes referring to them as \"the thinking man's Green Day\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> When ''Dear You'' was released in September 1995, however, its polished production and clear vocals strongly divided the band's fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> \"[''Dear You'']'s production glistened and gleamed,\" says Greenwald, \"Schwarzenbach's voice was sanded and smoothed, and the songs were mellow, introspective affairs. The reaction was harsh\u2014those who had entrusted their emotional lives to Schwarzenbach, had viewed him as a tattered, secular priest to lay their burdens on, felt betrayed.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Ben Weasel was so displeased with the album, particularly the sound of Schwarzenbach's singing, that he wrote Pfahler a letter detailing his complaints with it.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Despite a [[music video]] in rotation to support the [[single (music)|single]] \"Fireman,\" sales of ''Dear You'' were poor.<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/>\n\nAs the band toured in support of the album, audience reaction toward the new material was either lukewarm or outright negative.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I have never seen anything like that\u2014before or since\", said Kates, \"There was a point where they were headlining the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] and there were kids sitting on the floor, with their backs to the stage, when they were playing songs from ''Dear You''. I'm not making that up. If you were to try to explain that to somebody now, it would make no sense.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Jawbreaker continued touring in 1996, opening for the [[Foo Fighters]] that spring, but audience reception did not improve.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Samiam's Sergie Loobkoff cites a show at [[The Warfield]] in San Francisco as a turning point: \"That is when I knew they were ''definitely'' going to break up. It was their hometown; they had put out the big major-label record. But then you're looking around and it was like no one cared.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nAttitudes between the band members continued to sour, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach, who took to traveling in separate vans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Tensions came to a head in [[Salem, Oregon]], culminating in a fistfight between the two which spilled out of the van and onto the sidewalk.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Jordan |title=Jawbreaker / Timmy Hansell (In Honor.org) |date=2008-08-30 |website=Pastepunk.com |url=http://www.pastepunk.com/site/jawbreaker-timmy-hansell-in-honororg/ |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> \"I remember just calling Blake a 'fucking [[prima donna]]' and a 'stupid son of a bitch who thinks it's all about him.'

Relocating again to [[San Francisco]] the next year, they released 1992's ''[[Bivouac (album)|Bivouac]]'' through the Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.\n\nSchwarzenbach's charisma and personal, frustrated lyrics helped establish him as a [[cult following|cult idol]], even as he underwent surgery to remove painful, voice-threatening [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]]s from his throat. Jawbreaker toured with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] in 1993 and released ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]'' in 1994, attracting the attention of major labels. They signed a $1 million contract with [[DGC Records]] and released 1995's ''[[Dear You]]'', but its polished production and smooth vocals caused significant backlash from the band's core audience.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Internal tensions led to Jawbreaker's dissolution in 1996. On April 19, 2017, the band announced their reunion.<ref name=\"reunion\"/>\n\nFollowing the breakup, the members of Jawbreaker were active in other projects including [[Jets to Brazil]] and [[Whysall Lane]]. Pfahler continued to issue previously-recorded Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, and public interest in the band continued due in part to nationally charting [[pop punk]] and emo acts openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound. In 2004, Pfahler licensed the out-of-print ''Dear You'' from DGC's parent company [[Geffen Records]] and re-released it to a positive response.

I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently.
