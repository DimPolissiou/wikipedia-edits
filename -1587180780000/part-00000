Both the prison-probation review and the Comprehensive Spending Review should result in steps which should improve public confidence in community penalties.\"<ref>Annual report 1998/1999, paragraph 13.15</ref>\n\nThe Home Office Prison-Probation review consultation paper<ref>Prison- Probation Review: Home Office (August 1998)</ref> did not mention family court welfare given that family court welfare was to move to a new unified family court welfare service.<ref>Support Services in Family Proceedings \u2013 Future Organisation of Court Welfare Services (Department of Health, Home Office, Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department, Welsh Office) (July 1998): Consultation closed on 13 November 1998.</ref>\n\nThe government then announced a unified family court welfare service.<ref>House of Lords July 27, 1999</ref> Among many key to be addressed were ensuring:\n* Cafcass statutory basis;\n* Funding to cover start-up, transitional and ongoing costs; \n* Change management of the merger of 114 autonomous bodies into a single organisation\n* Maintenance of current casework.\n\nThese were addressed by a Project Team.<ref>The Project Team was drawn from the three relevant government departments supplemented by consultants dealing with, for example, IT, payroll, estates and finance.</ref>\n\nThe Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill<ref>Presented to the House of Commons on March 15, 2000.</ref> was led by the Home Office as most of the Bill\u2019s provisions concerned the establishment of a National Probation Service for England and Wales.

These standards set out what service users, partner agencies and practitioners in the family justice system could expect. The Standards updated the 2003 Cafcass Service Standards and Principles, and after piloting in the North-East Region, were phased in from 1 April 2007.\n \nThe standards noted the importance of service-user feedback and the active engagement and participation of children in their case planning process. Cafcass asserted the importance of including children's views in the decision making processes involved in court proceedings. Young people could offer a \"Needs, Wishes and Feelings\" statement directly to the judge. However, Cafcass admitted{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} that they do not conform to any National Standards.\n\nThe Children's Rights Team spearheaded the formation of a Young People's Board for Cafcass. This Board consists of 12 young people with experience of Cafcass's services. Since the Board's formation in August 2006 they helped to shape Cafcass policies and procedures.\n\nIn 2011 the Family Justice Review, in its final report, stated the following about the Young People\u2019s Board:\n\n\u2018''We have been impressed by the valuable work undertaken by the Cafcass Young People\u2019s Board. They provide an important perspective on the work of the family justice system and offer an intelligent and energetic challenge to the board of Cafcass. We believe that this work should be maintained through a Young People\u2019s Board for the Family Justice Service, with a remit to consider issues in both public and private law and to report directly to the service.\u2019''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217343/family-justice-review-final-report.pdf |title=Family Justice Review Final Report |date=November 2011 |website=www.gov.uk |accessdate=October 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102025004/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217343/family-justice-review-final-report.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nThe Young People\u2019s Board was expanded to cover the family justice system on a national scale and is now called The Family Justice Young People's Board.

The GM&O was incorporated in 1938 to merge the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad and the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]], which was accomplished in 1940.  The GM&O later bought and merged the [[Alton Railroad]] in 1947.\n\nIsaac B. Tigrett, a native of [[Jackson, Tennessee]], was president of the GM&N from 1920 and of the GM&O from 1938 to 1952, and oversaw the development of the road from a nearly bankrupt operation into a thriving success.

The President of the GM&O Railroad during this period was G. Paul Brock. The Railroad retained the passenger terminal at Beauregard Street for additional offices.\n\nAt the end of 1944 GM&O operated 1950 miles of road, including NOGN; at the end of 1950 it operated 2898 route-miles. At the end of 1970 route mileage was 2734 (3946 miles of track); GM&O reported 8285 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 44 million passenger-miles for that year.\n\nThe GM&O Railroad was the first \"large\" railroad in the United States to replace all its steam locomotives with diesels.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nOn August 10, 1972 the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad merged into the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], forming the 9600-mile north-south [[Illinois Central Gulf Railroad]]. In 1996 Illinois Central spun off some of its redundant trackage, including most of the former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio. Most of this trackage was acquired by other railroads.\n\nOn February 11, 1998 the Illinois Central was purchased by the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) with the integration of operations beginning on July 1, 1999.\n\n== Passenger Operations ==\n[[File:Gulf Mobile and Ohio The Rebel.JPG|thumb|Postcard c. 1940 depicting one of the ''Rebel'' streamliners]]\n[[File:Gulf Mobile and Ohio streamliner circa 1940s.JPG|thumb|Streamliner circa 1940s between Chicago and St. Louis.]]\nIn addition to the GM&O's most popular train, the streamlined [[Rebel (train)|''Rebel'']] (New Orleans - [[Jackson, Tennessee]] 1935-1941; extended to St. Louis thereafter), the railroad also operated a number of other named trains.

The actual filming location was [[Sparta, Illinois]].  The location where the GM&O locomotives and cars were filmed was in Sparta Illinois also.  The train was leased from GM&O with a train crew to comply with union and  operating rules of the road. The train came from Metro St. Louis, Missouri and traveled south along a GM&O right of way towards Sparta Illinois.  At the time of filming, GM&O had not merged yet with the Illinois Central Railroad.  The opening scene of the film shows the train crossing a main street in Sparta at night with the bright headlamp on the lead engine approaching town from an overhead shot. This was done using a scaffold across the tracks.  This scene shows Virgil detraining and entering the depot station.  The train was then driven south to an available turntable and parked for the night turning the engines around for the return trip to Sparta to shoot the  final scene which was shot the following day and was among the final scenes of the film showing Virgil boarding the train and saying goodbye to Gillespie.  As the train leaves Sparta, a close up shot of Virgil riding in a passenger car was taken by helicopter as the train travels the opposite direction with the scene expanding the view showing it meandering through the countryside as it leaves Sparta.\n\nIn popular music, the GM&O line is referenced in [[Adrian Belew]]'s \"The Rail Song,\" a nostalgic song about the heyday and subsequent decline of the American railroads.

The GM&O was incorporated in 1938 to merge the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad and the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]], which was accomplished in 1940.  The GM&O later bought and merged the [[Alton Railroad]] in 1947.\n\nIsaac B. Tigrett, a native of [[Jackson, Tennessee]], was president of the GM&N from 1920 and of the GM&O from 1938 to 1952, and oversaw the development of the road from a nearly bankrupt operation into a thriving success.  He was the great-uncle of [[Hard Rock Cafe]] founder [[Isaac Tigrett]], also a native of Jackson.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-418fSrmYu8C&pg=PA51&dq=%22Isaac+B.+Tigrett%22&hl=en&ei=9QSITNaaPMP58AbEkqCLAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22Isaac%20B.%20Tigrett%22&f=false Lesley Barker, ''St. Louis Gateway Rail:  The 1970s'', Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 51]</ref>\n\nFrom 1952 to 1972 the headquarters of the GM&O were in Mobile, Alabama at 104 St. Francis Street. The President of the GM&O Railroad during this period was G. Paul Brock. The Railroad retained the passenger terminal at Beauregard Street for additional offices.\n\nAt the end of 1944 GM&O operated 1950 miles of road, including NOGN; at the end of 1950 it operated 2898 route-miles. At the end of 1970 route mileage was 2734 (3946 miles of track); GM&O reported 8285 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 44 million passenger-miles for that year.\n\nThe GM&O Railroad was the first \"large\" railroad in the United States to replace all its steam locomotives with diesels.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nOn August 10, 1972 the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad merged into the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], forming the 9600-mile north-south [[Illinois Central Gulf Railroad]]. In 1996 Illinois Central spun off some of its redundant trackage, including most of the former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio. Most of this trackage was acquired by other railroads.\n\nOn February 11, 1998 the Illinois Central was purchased by the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) with the integration of operations beginning on July 1, 1999.\n\n== Passenger Operations ==\n[[File:Gulf Mobile and Ohio The Rebel.JPG|thumb|Postcard c. 1940 depicting one of the ''Rebel'' streamliners]]\n[[File:Gulf Mobile and Ohio streamliner circa 1940s.JPG|thumb|Streamliner circa 1940s between Chicago and St. Louis.]]\nIn addition to the GM&O's most popular train, the streamlined [[Rebel (train)|''Rebel'']] (New Orleans - [[Jackson, Tennessee]] 1935-1941; extended to St. Louis thereafter), the railroad also operated a number of other named trains.

The actual filming location was [[Sparta, Illinois]].  The location where the GM&O locomotives and cars were filmed was in Sparta Illinois also.  The train was leased from GM&O with a train crew to comply with union and  operating rules of the road. The train came from Metro St. Louis, Missouri and traveled south along a GM&O right of way towards Sparta Illinois.  At the time of filming, GM&O had not merged yet with the Illinois Central Railroad.  The opening scene of the film shows the train crossing a main street in Sparta at night with the bright headlamp on the lead engine approaching town from an overhead shot. This was done using a scaffold across the tracks.  This scene shows Virgil detraining and entering the depot station.  The train was then driven south to an available turntable and parked for the night turning the engines around for the return trip to Sparta to shoot the  final scene which was shot the following day and was among the final scenes of the film showing Virgil boarding the train and saying goodbye to Gillespie.

The cat name \"Thomas\" or \"Tom\", as well as the generic term \"tomcat\", appears to have been originated and popularised by an anonymous work (sometimes attributed to [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], although most likely by [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]]) first printed in 1760, ''The Life and Adventures of a Cat'', whose hero is called \"Tom the Cat\"; before this time male cats were generally called \"ram-cats\" or \"gib-cats\" rather than \"tomcats\".<ref name=room18>Room (1993), p.18</ref><ref name=nq>''Notes and Queries'', 7th series, V, May 5th 1888, 350</ref>\n\nScottish cat names included \"Baudrons\" or \"Baudrans\", an affectionate term equivalent to \"puss\".<ref name=wright191>Wright, J.

[...] Cats had names like 'Blackie' and 'Spotty', names that illustrated their physical appearance. The 1980s marked a turning point, with the 10 most popular dog names all being compatible as human names, but in the '90s this progressed even further. People are now giving animals the same names as contemporary names given to babies.\" He believed that as people have fewer children or no children at all, pets become more important in their lives.<ref>Stubbs, Brett, \"Joys of picking a pet project\", ''Sunday Tasmanian'', August 27, 2000, retrieved via Newsbank.com on May 19, 2010</ref>\n\nIn Australia, the United Kingdom<ref name=scpdh>Poole, Shona Crawford, \"Down Henry!

These were derived from the character of Tybalt or Tibert in the [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] folk tale cycle,<ref name=brown536>Brown (1985) ''The Baby Name Book'', Greenwich, p.536</ref> and ultimately from the Germanic name [[Theobald]], derived from ''[[theodiscus|theod-]]'' \"people\" and ''bald'' \"bold\".<ref name=room14>Room (1993) ''The naming of animals: an appellative reference to domestic, work, and show animals, real and fictional'', McFarland, p.14</ref> The name was applied to cats as they were popularly thought to be daring and curious.<ref name=room14/> The old cat name \"Gib\", a contraction of the name \"Gilbert\", was also thought to have arisen through the latter being used as a 'translation' of the [[French language|French]] \"Tibert\".<ref name=nares360>Nares, R.

The cat name \"Thomas\" or \"Tom\", as well as the generic term \"tomcat\", appears to have been originated and popularised by an anonymous work (sometimes attributed to [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], although most likely by [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]]) first printed in 1760, ''The Life and Adventures of a Cat'', whose hero is called \"Tom the Cat\"; before this time male cats were generally called \"ram-cats\" or \"gib-cats\" rather than \"tomcats\".<ref name=room18>Room (1993), p.18</ref><ref name=nq>''Notes and Queries'', 7th series, V, May 5th 1888, 350</ref>\n\nScottish cat names included \"Baudrons\" or \"Baudrans\", an affectionate term equivalent to \"puss\".<ref name=wright191>Wright, J. (1898) ''The English dialect dictionary'', v1, Frowde, p.191</ref> The word appears to be related to the dialect term ''bawd'' used for the [[European hare]], much as the dialect names \"puss\", \"[[furze]] cat\" and \"mawkin\" were also recorded for the hare.<ref name=lps361>''Proceedings of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society: Literary and Historical Section'', v31 (1932), 361</ref> In Wales, \"titw\" was used as a similar affectionate term for cats.<ref name=pughe>Pughe, W.
