{"title_page": "Montafon", "text_new": "{{tone|date=February 2015}}\n'''Montafon''' (in local dialect: \"''Muntafu\")'' is a 39&nbsp;km long valley in the federal state of [[Vorarlberg]] ([[Austria]]) that is crossed by the river [[Ill (Vorarlberg)]]. It extends from the city of [[Bludenz]] and the [[Verwall Alps]] in the north, to the [[Silvretta]] and [[R\u00e4tikon]] mountain range in the south. [[Piz Buin]] is with 3312m the highest peak within the Silvretta mountain range. The area has a population of 16.642 people.

After driving through the Alma woods and past the Tr\u00e4nab\u00e4chle (brook of tears) the valley opens to its main splendor at St. Anton (in the local dialect: \"Santat\u00f6ni\") on the left, and Vens and Vandans on the right. St. Anton, which is not to be confused with its larger and more famous [[St. Anton am Arlberg]], is the hometown of the Stemer clan and the Battlogg clan.\n\nOn the way to Rodund lays the main [[Hydroelectric power station|electrohydric plant]] of the [[Vorarlberger Illwerke]], through Gantschier and Kaltenbrunnen and on to [[Schruns]] and Tschagguns (in the local dialect: \"Schru und Tschaggu\"). The mountain town of Bartholom\u00e4berg is situated above Schruns, with its outliers Jetzmunt and Lutt overlooking St. Anton as well as its southeastern outliers Kristberg and Innerberg overlooking the [[Silbertal|Silbertal valley]]. This valley stretches from Schruns to the outpost of the Fellamendli in a south-easterly direction pointing towards the [[Arlberg]] mountain range. The hamlet of Latschau, with its hydroelectric power station and the main base of the [[Golm (austria)|Golm ski resort]], watches over Tschagguns opposite from Bartholom\u00e4berg.\n\nFrom Schruns and Tschagguns onward you cross the Montafon midpoint that divides the outer valley (\"Au\u00dferfratte\") from the inner valley (\"Innerfratte\"). As you arrive in St. Gallenkirch, you will be able to branch off at Galgenul towards Gargellen, another magically rugged branch valley that finishes at the ski resort of [[Gargellen]]. Continuing in the main Montafon valley, you will pass through Gortipohl and on to Gaschurn (in the local dialect: \"Gaschorra\") and then Partenen, where the road starts to snake up to the [[Silvretta]] mountain pass.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy in Montafon consists of a mixture of traditional activities like [[Wood industry|forestry industry]], energy-production due to the height-differences and its potential for [[Hydroelectricity]], the production of [[agriculture]] products as well as [[tourism]] related services and products.\n\n=== Agriculture and Farming ===\nFarming and agriculture are part of the [[Alpine transhumance]], a 3-phase cultivation and inclusion of all mountain levels.

A main road, the Silvretta high alpine road (German: Hochalpenstra\u00dfe) gives access to the remote ski areas that are located on a sea-level between 650 and 1430m.

[[Freeriding]] is a popular sport and various fun parks with half-pipes can be found there. For [[Cross-country skiing (sport)]] there are 121&nbsp;km classic routes as well as 33&nbsp;km skating-routes.\n\nMore and more popular is [[Ski mountaineering]] which can be done on every mountain in Montafon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.montafon.at/skitouren|title=Skitouren Vorarlberg : Wintersport im Montafon, Alpen|website=www.montafon.at|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summers, people can use the vast hiking trails along all the mountain ranges. There are even trails that can be accessed via pushchairs (\u201eMuntafuner Gagla Weg\u201c). Nine of the ski lifts are also open during the summer season and allow quick ascends or descends of the mountains. All hiking and biking trails are marked very well and signs indicate rights and limitations. Many areas are protected and biking is not always allowed. Littering can be fined and all trash should be disposed of in the appropriate places at the starting or finishing point. 26 alpine huts are open during summer and special buses for hikers operate in the area.\n\nClimbing can be done on various trails of different difficulties.

He studied with an orientation toward jazz, playing in a small Parisian club, the Sully d' Auteuil. Conducted by [[Hubert Damisch]], the Sully boasted an orchestra of talented students including [[Sacha Distel]] and Louis Viale. In 1953, Urtreger won first prize in a piano contest for amateurs, and from that moment decided to be a professional musician.\n\n==Later life and career==\nIn 1954, he accompanied in a Parisian concert two great American expatriates: saxophonist [[Don Byas]] and trumpeter [[Buck Clayton]].  Their collaboration in the \"Salon du Jazz\" became one of the most highly requested French performances by the American musicians that toured the French capital.\n\nAfter serving in the military from 1955 to 1957, Urtreger would play in a club on the [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|left bank]] of the Seine, the famous [[Club Saint-Germain]]. Again he collaborated with two jazz masters: [[Miles Davis]] and [[Lester Young]].  His work so impressed the latter that Urteger accompanied Young for a short tour of Europe in 1956.

Shortly thereafter, he broadened his focus to accompany other artists of other genres, largely due to financial necessity.  His canon of jazz work is still widely regarded as sensitive with a full, dense sound of swing.
