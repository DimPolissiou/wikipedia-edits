Their songs are characterized by a blend of instrumental music and [[sound effect]]s and are commonly used to provide atmosphere during the [[Halloween]] season, in [[haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attractions]], theme parks, and in the [[role-playing game]] industry.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1996\u20131998)===\n[[Composer]]/[[filmmaker]] Edward Douglas formed Midnight Syndicate in 1996 shortly after releasing a [[low-budget film|micro-budget]], [[direct-to-video]] horror film called ''The Dead Matter (1996)''<ref>[http://www.fearnet.com/news/b13590_Musical_Horrors_Incarnate__Midnight_Syndicate_s_THE_DEAD_MATTER.html?intcid=search_articles_midnight-syndicate Interview with Edward Douglas], ''FEARnet'', October 2008.</ref> which he directed and scored and would later remake.<ref>Michael Gingold, \"The Dead Matter: From Midnight music to a movie\", ''[[Fangoria Magazine]]'' (New York, NY), August, 2010, Pg.6.</ref>  Midnight Syndicate's self-titled debut album was released the following year.<ref>[http://cocatalog.loc.gov US Copyright office] ''Midnight Syndicate'' album \u00a9 date 1997-09-17</ref>  A majority of music on the album was written, arranged, and performed by Edward Douglas. Contributors included Scott Angus, Mark Rakocy, Dennis Carleton, Jamie Barbour, Ray Portler, the rap act Dark Side, and [[Christopher Robichaud]].  Douglas coined the term ''cine-fusion'' to describe the album. ''Cine-fusion'' is described in the album's liner notes as\n:\"a blending of [[film score|movie soundtrack music]] and [[pop music]]&nbsp;... a compilation of soundtracks to movies that do not exist.  The goal of the music is to stimulate the imaginations of listeners so that they are able to transport themselves to worlds or movies of their own creation.\"\nMusically, the album contained an eclectic blend of styles including everything from dark instrumental music (of which three tracks appeared on future releases), [[Rock music|rock]],<ref name=\"music extreme\">[http://www.musicextreme.com/midnight.htm Interview with Gavin Goszka], Federico Marongiu, \"Midnight Syndicate\", ''Music Extreme'' (Argentina), 2001.</ref> [[Rock-a-Billy|rock-a-billy]], [[techno music|techno]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[New-age music|new-age]], [[Black comedy#Musicians|humor-pop]], [[jazz]], and [[Space music|space]].

Douglas and Goszka wrote and performed the music on the album while Vargo served as [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] and [[creative director]] of the project, as well as writing and performing the vocals and narrations, and designing the cover art and packaging. The album and songs were also titled after several of Vargo's most popular paintings. ''[[Born of the Night]]'' was independently released in September 1998 through Vargo's Monolith Graphics and Douglas' Entity Productions, hitting the horror market just in time for the Halloween season. It was Midnight Syndicate's first critically acclaimed gothic-horror soundtrack and proved to be an instant success,<ref>John Soeder, \"Gothic Horror Rock Featured This Weekend\", ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' (Cleveland, OH), March 2, 2000.</ref> establishing Midnight Syndicate's trademark sound.\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Realm of Shadows]]'' followed suit with the same flavor of dark instrumental music and another gothic setting. Douglas and Goszka wrote all of the music for this album while Vargo wrote and performed the opening narration and theme story. Again, the songs were titled after Vargo's artworks. Both albums were featured as official soundtracks for Universal Studios' ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', and used in several other major theme parks during Halloween, such as [[Busch Gardens]], [[Cedar Point]] and [[Thorpe Park|Thorpe Park's]] ''Fright Nights'' event.<ref name=scene99>Jeff Niesel, \"Soundbites\", ''[http://www.clevescene.com/issues/1999-10-14/music/soundbites.html Scene Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050117183008/http://clevescene.com/issues/1999-10-14/music/soundbites.html |date=2005-01-17 }}'' (Cleveland, OH), October 14, 1999.</ref> The heavy metal band [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] also featured tracks from ''[[Born of the Night]]'' as opening music for their 2000 US tour.

Set in a Victorian haunted [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental institution]] called Haverghast Asylum, ''[[Gates of Delirium]]'' was the first Midnight Syndicate disc to feature the fictitious Haverghast family,<ref name=\"music extreme\" /> a theme the band would revisit on future discs such as ''[[The 13th Hour]]''.

Produced by [[Marvel Television]] and [[ABC Studios]], they are set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. When categorizing their wider television slate, Marvel considers the ABC series to be their \"'''Marvel Heroes'''\" series.\n\nThe first television series in the MCU was ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', developed by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) writer/director [[Joss Whedon]] for Marvel Television and ABC. Starring [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]], reprising his role from the films, the series debuted in September 2013 and will run through its seventh season in 2020. It was followed by ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' in 2015, with [[Hayley Atwell]] reprising her role of [[Peggy Carter]] from the films for two seasons. ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', a project that originated as an MCU film before being redeveloped as a series, was released in 2017 as a co-production with [[IMAX Corporation]]. A version of the series' first two episodes were released in IMAX theaters before the series' ABC premiere. ''Inhumans'' starred [[Anson Mount]] and was canceled after a single season.\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' debuted to strong ratings for ABC, but these steadily dropped and all three series ultimately became modest ratings performers. Reviews for ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' compared it unfavourably to the MCU films at first, but these improved and the response to ''Agent Carter'' was more positive. ''Inhumans'' was not well received. Marvel and ABC have attempted to develop several more series together, including a spin-off from ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' called ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]'' and a comedy based on the [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] comics. Development on any future series was halted when Marvel Television was folded into [[Marvel Studios]] in December 2019, though ABC remained committed to featuring Marvel content and began discussions with Marvel Studios for a new series shortly after.\n\n==Development==\nBy July 2012, [[Marvel Television]] had entered into discussions with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to create a show set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"July2012TVshow\" /> In August, ABC ordered a [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a show called ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'', with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) writer/director [[Joss Whedon]] involved;<ref name=\"DeadlineSHIELDPilot\" /> it was later renamed ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"Apr2013ABCAllAccess\" /> In January 2014, the series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' was announced, joining ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' at ABC.<ref name=\"CarterConfirmed\" /> In November 2016, Marvel and [[IMAX Corporation]] announced ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', based on the species [[Inhumans|of the same name]], after a planned film based on the characters had been removed from Marvel Studios' slate.<ref name=\"InhumansAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"InhumansAnnouncement2\" /><ref name=\"MountInhumans\" /> The first two episodes of the series were set to premiere in [[IMAX]] theaters in September 2017 for two weeks, before airing on ABC with the remainder of the series.<ref name=\"InhumansAnnouncement\" /> Discussing Marvel Television's wider slate of series in August 2019, Loeb explained that Marvel categorized its ABC series as the \"Marvel Heroes\" series due to their close connections to the MCU films, especially with the main characters of both ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and ''Agent Carter'' having originated in films before transitioning to their television series.<ref name=\"LoebAug2019\" /> Marvel Television was folded into [[Marvel Studios]] in December 2019, with development on future Marvel Television series halted. Despite this, ABC remained committed to featuring Marvel content,<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" /> and ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke said in January 2020 that the network was beginning talks with Feige and Marvel Studios about what a potential Marvel Studios series on ABC would be.<ref name=\"MarvelStudiosABC\" />\n\n== Series ==\n<section begin=TVSeriesTable />\n{{Series overview|Marvel's ABC television series\n| infoA       = [[Showrunner]](s)\n| infoB       = Status\n| width       = 99%\n| multiseries = y\n| network     = y\n| dontclose   = y\n| network_transclude = onlyinclude\n}}\n<section begin=ABC />\n{{Series overview|Marvel's ABC television series\n| series      = ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''\n| infoA       = y\n| infoB       = y\n| network_transclude = onlyinclude\n\n| color1      = #F77F00\n| link1       = Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

With no help from S.H.I.E.L.D., they enter into an uneasy partnership with rogue adventurer [[Dominic Fortune]].<ref name=\"MWPremise\" /><ref name=\"AndradeFehr\" />\n\nBy April 2015, Marvel was developing a spinoff series from ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' The series, which was being developed by ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executive producer Jeffrey Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski, would be based on storylines occurring at the end of the second season of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and would receive its own pilot rather than a [[backdoor pilot]].<ref name=\"EWAoSSpinoff\" /> [[Adrianne Palicki]] and [[Nick Blood]] entered into discussions to headline the potential new series as their characters Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, respectively.<ref name=\"PalickiBloodSpinoff\" /> By May 7, 2015\u2014when ABC announced their series renewals, cancellations, and new series pickups\u2014the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' spinoff was passed on.<ref name=\"NoAoSSpinoff\" /> In August 2015, the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' spinoff series received new life as a reworked series, titled ''Marvel's Most Wanted'', with a pilot order.<ref name=\"THRMostWanted\" /> Bell and Zbyszewski once again developed the series, while also serving as co-writers of the pilot.<ref name=\"VarietyMostWanted\" /> The series would still focus on Morse and Hunter, with Palicki and Blood both attached, and was described as \"a new take focusing on the same duo and their continuing adventures.\"<ref name=\"THRMostWanted\" /> In May 2016, the series was passed on by ABC once again.<ref name=\"NoMW2016\" />\n\n===Untitled John Ridley-developed series===\nFrom mid-April 2015, Marvel worked with screenwriter [[John Ridley]] to craft a new television series, \"reinventing\" an existing Marvel character or property.<ref name=\"RidleySeries\" /> In January 2016, Ridley confirmed the project was in development and stated that he was looking to \"bring some of the socially conscious nature\" of ''Jessica Jones'' and his series ''[[American Crime (TV series)|American Crime]]'' to the show, while also creating something that is \"straight entertainment\".<ref name=\"RidleyDevConfirmed\" /> A year later, [[Channing Dungey]] revealed that Ridley's project was still progressing, with Ridley working on a rewrite of his script.<ref name=\"RidleyRewrite\" /> Ridley added that the rewrite was not because \"anything didn't work the first time around\", but rather trying to make sure the series does something viewers have not necessarily seen before in a superhero television series, hoping it would occupy \"a space that is not currently being filled\" by Marvel. He also stated that he hoped to create the series \"in the near term.\"<ref name=\"RidleyIGNJan2017\" /> By August 2017, Dungey was \"not sure\" if Ridley was still working on the project.<ref name=\"DungeyRidleyUnsure\" /> It was confirmed to have \"fizzled\" in December 2019.<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" />\n\n===''Damage Control''===\n{{further|Damage Control (comics)#Live action}}\nThe show follows the overworked and underpaid [[Damage Control (comics)|clean-up crew]] of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that specializes in dealing with the aftermath of superhero conflicts, rescheduling events because of the conflicts, and retrieving lost items.<ref name=\"DamageControl\" />\n\nIn October 2015, ABC ordered a [[put pilot]] for a half-hour live-action comedy series ''Marvel's Damage Control'', based on the comics construction company of [[Damage Control (comics)|the same name]]. The series was being developed by [[Ben Karlin]] for ABC Studios and Marvel Television, with Karlin writing the script and serving as executive producer.<ref name=\"DamageControl\" /><ref name=\"DamageControl2\" /> Then ABC Entertainment president [[Paul Lee (television executive)|Paul Lee]] wanted the series to begin airing as early as the [[2016\u201317 United States network television schedule|2016\u201317 television season]].<ref name=\"SecondComedy\" /> Any development on the series was ended by December 2019.<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" />\n\nThe Damage Control organization was mentioned in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"WatchdogsEasterEggs\" /> before being introduced as the \"Department of Damage Control\" in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' with [[Tyne Daly]] portraying head of department [[Anne Marie Hoag]].<ref name=\"HomecomingEasterEggs\" />\n\n===Untitled Allan Heinberg-developed series===\nDungey said in May 2016 that there were \"a handful of projects in development\", after passing on ''Marvel's Most Wanted'' and canceling ''Agent Carter'', and that Marvel and ABC were looking \"at series that would be beneficial to both brands.\"<ref name=\"DungeyMay2016\" /> In January 2018, she noted that Marvel and ABC \"tried a few things that haven't worked out as well as we would've liked. We developed a couple things this season that we don't think are going to end up going forward, so we're going to look really carefully about what we do next, because the idea for us is to come up with something that works very well for both Marvel and ABC, so we're going to continue to try there.\"<ref name=\"DungeyJan2018\" /> In August, Dungey said \"we're cooking up a couple things for broadcast\" in terms of potential new Marvel series on ABC, and that there was one idea in particular that she was excited to talk about.<ref name=\"DungeyAug2018\" /> In September 2018, ABC gave a production commitment to a series featuring lesser-known female superheroes, written and executive produced by [[Allan Heinberg]]. Jeph Loeb was also set to executive produce the potential series. The idea had been a \"strong contender from the get-go\" in terms of the new series that Marvel and ABC had been developing.<ref name=\"ABCFemaleSeries\" /> However, in February 2019, ABC chose not to proceed with the pilot, despite its \"big\" production commitment. Nellie Andreeva of ''Deadline Hollywood'' said it was \"unclear\" if the series would be redeveloped.<ref name=\"HeinbergSeriesPass\" />\n\n===Other===\nIn January 2016, Lee announced that ABC Studios was developing a second comedy series with Marvel after ''Damage Control'' with the hope that it would air on ABC.<ref name=\"SecondComedy\" /> In August 2019, ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke stated that ABC was in active discussions with Marvel regarding \"one project in particular\" that would be \"something brand new, mostly\" and be a female-focused superhero series. This project was separate from the female-focused superhero series developed for ABC by [[Allan Heinberg]] earlier in 2019.<ref name=\"NewSeriesAug2019\" /> ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported plans for the series had \"stalled\" by January 2020,<ref name=\"MarvelStudiosABC\" /> a month after Marvel Television announced they were no longer developing new series.<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Marvel's Netflix television series]]\n* [[Marvel's young adult television series]]\n* [[Adventure into Fear (planned franchise)|Adventure into Fear]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- DEVELOPMENT -->\n\n<ref name=\"July2012TVshow\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/ |title=ABC And Marvel Eying 'Avengers'-Themed TV Series |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=July 27, 2012 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AHlObsMr?url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/ |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |access-date=July 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LoebAug2019\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/marvel-jeph-loeb-interview-disney-legion-netflix-runaways-ghost-rider-howard-the-duck-hulu-1202666578/ |title=Marvel TV Boss Jeph Loeb On Secret ABC Series, Disney+, 'Legion' End, More Crossovers, 'Ghost Rider' & Hulu Plans |last=Patten |first=Dominic |date=August 12, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812231407/https://deadline.com/2019/08/marvel-jeph-loeb-interview-disney-legion-netflix-runaways-ghost-rider-howard-the-duck-hulu-1202666578/ |archive-date=August 12, 2019 |access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvel-tv-division-folded-studio-unit-layoffs-expected-1261586 |title=Marvel TV Division Folded Into Studio Unit, Layoffs Expected |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=December 8, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211034642/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvel-tv-division-folded-studio-unit-layoffs-expected-1261586 |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<!-- AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D. -->\n\n<ref name=\"DeadlineSHIELDPilot\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/08/abc-greenlights-s-h-i-e-l-d-marvel-pilot-joss-whedon-to-co-write-possibly-direct/ |title=ABC Greenlights 'S.H.I.E.L.D' Marvel Pilot, Joss Whedon To Co-Write & Possibly Direct |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=August 28, 2012 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AHlRjwro?url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/abc-greenlights-s-h-i-e-l-d-marvel-pilot-joss-whedon-to-co-write-possibly-direct/ |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |access-date=August 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SHIELDS1Synopsis\">{{Cite web |url=http://abcallaccess.com/show/marvels-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d/ |title=Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |date=April 6, 2013 |publisher=[[ABC Studios]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FgcqWd0z?url=http://abcallaccess.com/show/marvels-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d/ |archive-date=April 6, 2013 |access-date=April 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SHIELDS2Returners\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/agents-of-shield-season-2-trailer/ |title='Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'

Produced by [[Marvel Television]] and [[ABC Studios]], they are set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. When categorizing their wider television slate, Marvel considers the ABC series to be their \"'''Marvel Heroes'''\" series.\n\nThe first television series in the MCU was ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', developed by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) writer/director [[Joss Whedon]] for Marvel Television and ABC. Starring [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]], reprising his role from the films, the series debuted in September 2013 and will run through its seventh season in 2020. It was followed by ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' in 2015, with [[Hayley Atwell]] reprising her role of [[Peggy Carter]] from the films for two seasons. ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', a project that originated as an MCU film before being redeveloped as a series, was released in 2017 as a co-production with [[IMAX Corporation]]. A version of the series' first two episodes were released in IMAX theaters before the series' ABC premiere. ''Inhumans'' starred [[Anson Mount]] and was canceled after a single season.\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' debuted to strong ratings for ABC, but these steadily dropped and all three series ultimately became modest ratings performers. Reviews for ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' compared it unfavourably to the MCU films at first, but these improved and the response to ''Agent Carter'' was more positive. ''Inhumans'' was not well received. Marvel and ABC have attempted to develop several more series together, including a spin-off from ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' called ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]'' and a comedy based on the [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] comics. Development on any future series was halted when Marvel Television was folded into [[Marvel Studios]] in December 2019, though ABC remained committed to featuring Marvel content and began discussions with Marvel Studios for a new series shortly after.\n\n==Development==\nBy July 2012, [[Marvel Television]] had entered into discussions with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to create a show set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"July2012TVshow\" /> In August, ABC ordered a [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a show called ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'', with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) writer/director [[Joss Whedon]] involved;<ref name=\"DeadlineSHIELDPilot\" /> it was later renamed ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"Apr2013ABCAllAccess\" /> In January 2014, the series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' was announced, joining ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' at ABC.<ref name=\"CarterConfirmed\" /> In November 2016, Marvel and [[IMAX Corporation]] announced ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', based on the species [[Inhumans|of the same name]], after a planned film based on the characters had been removed from Marvel Studios' slate.<ref name=\"InhumansAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"InhumansAnnouncement2\" /><ref name=\"MountInhumans\" /> The first two episodes of the series were set to premiere in [[IMAX]] theaters in September 2017 for two weeks, before airing on ABC with the remainder of the series.<ref name=\"InhumansAnnouncement\" /> Discussing Marvel Television's wider slate of series in August 2019, Loeb explained that Marvel categorized its ABC series as the \"Marvel Heroes\" series due to their close connections to the MCU films, especially with the main characters of both ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and ''Agent Carter'' having originated in films before transitioning to their television series.<ref name=\"LoebAug2019\" /> Marvel Television was folded into [[Marvel Studios]] in December 2019, with development on future Marvel Television series halted. Despite this, ABC remained committed to featuring Marvel content,<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" /> and ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke said in January 2020 that the network was beginning talks with Feige and Marvel Studios about what a potential Marvel Studios series on ABC would be.<ref name=\"MarvelStudiosABC\" />\n\n== Series ==\n<section begin=TVSeriesTable />\n{{Series overview|Marvel's ABC television series\n| infoA       = [[Showrunner]](s)\n| infoB       = Status\n| width       = 99%\n| multiseries = y\n| network     = y\n| dontclose   = y\n| network_transclude = onlyinclude\n}}\n<section begin=ABC />\n{{Series overview|Marvel's ABC television series\n| series      = ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''\n| infoA       = y\n| infoB       = y\n| network_transclude = onlyinclude\n\n| color1      = #F77F00\n| link1       = Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

With no help from S.H.I.E.L.D., they enter into an uneasy partnership with rogue adventurer [[Dominic Fortune]].<ref name=\"MWPremise\" /><ref name=\"AndradeFehr\" />\n\nBy April 2015, Marvel was developing a spinoff series from ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' The series, which was being developed by ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executive producer Jeffrey Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski, would be based on storylines occurring at the end of the second season of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and would receive its own pilot rather than a [[backdoor pilot]].<ref name=\"EWAoSSpinoff\" /> [[Adrianne Palicki]] and [[Nick Blood]] entered into discussions to headline the potential new series as their characters Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, respectively.<ref name=\"PalickiBloodSpinoff\" /> By May 7, 2015\u2014when ABC announced their series renewals, cancellations, and new series pickups\u2014the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' spinoff was passed on.<ref name=\"NoAoSSpinoff\" /> In August 2015, the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' spinoff series received new life as a reworked series, titled ''Marvel's Most Wanted'', with a pilot order.<ref name=\"THRMostWanted\" /> Bell and Zbyszewski once again developed the series, while also serving as co-writers of the pilot.<ref name=\"VarietyMostWanted\" /> The series would still focus on Morse and Hunter, with Palicki and Blood both attached, and was described as \"a new take focusing on the same duo and their continuing adventures.\"<ref name=\"THRMostWanted\" /> In May 2016, the series was passed on by ABC once again.<ref name=\"NoMW2016\" />\n\n===Untitled John Ridley-developed series===\nFrom mid-April 2015, Marvel worked with screenwriter [[John Ridley]] to craft a new television series, \"reinventing\" an existing Marvel character or property.<ref name=\"RidleySeries\" /> In January 2016, Ridley confirmed the project was in development and stated that he was looking to \"bring some of the socially conscious nature\" of ''Jessica Jones'' and his series ''[[American Crime (TV series)|American Crime]]'' to the show, while also creating something that is \"straight entertainment\".<ref name=\"RidleyDevConfirmed\" /> A year later, [[Channing Dungey]] revealed that Ridley's project was still progressing, with Ridley working on a rewrite of his script.<ref name=\"RidleyRewrite\" /> Ridley added that the rewrite was not because \"anything didn't work the first time around\", but rather trying to make sure the series does something viewers have not necessarily seen before in a superhero television series, hoping it would occupy \"a space that is not currently being filled\" by Marvel. He also stated that he hoped to create the series \"in the near term.\"<ref name=\"RidleyIGNJan2017\" /> By August 2017, Dungey was \"not sure\" if Ridley was still working on the project.<ref name=\"DungeyRidleyUnsure\" /> It was confirmed to have \"fizzled\" in December 2019.<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" />\n\n===''Damage Control''===\n{{further|Damage Control (comics)#Live action}}\nThe show follows the overworked and underpaid [[Damage Control (comics)|clean-up crew]] of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that specializes in dealing with the aftermath of superhero conflicts, rescheduling events because of the conflicts, and retrieving lost items.<ref name=\"DamageControl\" />\n\nIn October 2015, ABC ordered a [[put pilot]] for a half-hour live-action comedy series ''Marvel's Damage Control'', based on the comics construction company of [[Damage Control (comics)|the same name]]. The series was being developed by [[Ben Karlin]] for ABC Studios and Marvel Television, with Karlin writing the script and serving as executive producer.<ref name=\"DamageControl\" /><ref name=\"DamageControl2\" /> Then ABC Entertainment president [[Paul Lee (television executive)|Paul Lee]] wanted the series to begin airing as early as the [[2016\u201317 United States network television schedule|2016\u201317 television season]].<ref name=\"SecondComedy\" /> Any development on the series was ended by December 2019.<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" />\n\nThe Damage Control organization was mentioned in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"WatchdogsEasterEggs\" /> before being introduced as the \"Department of Damage Control\" in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' with [[Tyne Daly]] portraying head of department [[Anne Marie Hoag]].<ref name=\"HomecomingEasterEggs\" />\n\n===Untitled Allan Heinberg-developed series===\nDungey said in May 2016 that there were \"a handful of projects in development\", after passing on ''Marvel's Most Wanted'' and canceling ''Agent Carter'', and that Marvel and ABC were looking \"at series that would be beneficial to both brands.\"<ref name=\"DungeyMay2016\" /> In January 2018, she noted that Marvel and ABC \"tried a few things that haven't worked out as well as we would've liked. We developed a couple things this season that we don't think are going to end up going forward, so we're going to look really carefully about what we do next, because the idea for us is to come up with something that works very well for both Marvel and ABC, so we're going to continue to try there.\"<ref name=\"DungeyJan2018\" /> In August, Dungey said \"we're cooking up a couple things for broadcast\" in terms of potential new Marvel series on ABC, and that there was one idea in particular that she was excited to talk about.<ref name=\"DungeyAug2018\" /> In September 2018, ABC gave a production commitment to a series featuring lesser-known female superheroes, written and executive produced by [[Allan Heinberg]]. Jeph Loeb was also set to executive produce the potential series. The idea had been a \"strong contender from the get-go\" in terms of the new series that Marvel and ABC had been developing.<ref name=\"ABCFemaleSeries\" /> However, in February 2019, ABC chose not to proceed with the pilot, despite its \"big\" production commitment.

''Bretz's Flood'', by John Soennichsen, published by Sasquatch Books Seattle, Copyright 2008 .</ref> (September 2, 1882 \u2013 February 3, 1981) was an American [[geology|geologist]], best known for his research that led to the acceptance of the [[Missoula Floods]] and for his work on caves. He was born to Oliver Joseph Bretz and Rhoda Maria Howlett, farmers in [[Saranac, Michigan|Saranac]], [[Michigan]], the oldest of five children. He earned a degree in [[biology]] from [[Albion College]] in 1905, where he also met his wife Fanny Chalis. Thereafter, he became interested in the geology of Eastern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state.\n\n==Early career==\nBretz was of [[German American|German heritage]].<ref name=historylink>{{historylink|id=8382|title=Bretz, J Harlen (1882-1981), Geologist|author=Cassandra Tate|date=November 29, 2007}}</ref> Bretz graduated with his [[Bachelor of Arts|AB]] from [[Albion College]] in 1905. He then started his career as a [[high school]] History and Physiography (study of the physical features of the Earth's surface)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historylink.org/File/8382|title=Bretz, J Harlen (1882-1981), Geologist|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> [[teacher]] in [[Seattle]]. During this time he began studying the [[glacier|glacial]] geology of the [[Puget Sound]] area. He continued his studies at the [[University of Chicago]] where he earned his [[Ph.D.]] in geology in 1913. He became an assistant professor of geology, first at the [[University of Washington]] and then the University of Chicago.\n\nHe made important discoveries regarding the origin of the [[Channeled Scablands]].\n\n==The Spokane floods: an outrageous hypothesis==\nIn the summer of 1922, and for the next seven years, Bretz conducted field research of the [[Columbia River Plateau]]. Between the Summer of 1922 through 1931 he wrote 15 papers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historylink.org/File/8382|title=Bretz, J Harlen (1882-1981), Geologist|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref>\n\nSince 1910 he had been interested in unusual [[erosion]] features in the area after seeing a newly published [[topographic]] map of the Potholes Cataract. Bretz coined the term Channeled Scablands in 1923 to describe the area near the Grand Coulee, where massive erosion had cut through basalt deposits.<ref name=\"bretz23\">Bretz, J Harlen (1923). \"The Channeled Scabland of the Columbia Plateau\". Journal of Geology 31: 617\u2013649.</ref> The area was a [[desert]], but Bretz's theories required cataclysmic water flows to form the landscape, for which Bretz coined the term [[Spokane Floods]] in a 1925 publication.<ref name=\"bretz25\">Bretz, J Harlen (1925). \"The Spokane flood beyond the Channeled Scablands\". Journal of Geology 33: 97\u2013115, 236\u2013259. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F623179 DOI:10.1086/623179]</ref>\n\nBretz published a paper in 1923, arguing that the [[channeled scablands]] in [[Eastern Washington]] were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This was seen as arguing for a [[Catastrophism|catastrophic]] explanation of the geology, against the prevailing view of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], and Bretz's views were initially discredited. However, as the nature of the [[Ice Age]] was better understood, Bretz's original research was vindicated, and by the 1950s his conclusions were also vindicated.\n\nBretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day. The geology establishment was resistant to such a sweeping theory for the origin of a broad landscape for a variety of reasons, including lack of familiarity with the remote areas of the interior Pacific Northwest where the research was based, and the lack of status and reputation of Bretz in the eyes of the largely Ivy League-based geology elites. Furthermore, his theory implied the potential possibilities of a Biblical flood, which the scientific community strongly rejected.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3211_megafloo.html PBS documentary]</ref> The [[Geological Society of America|Geological Society of Washington, D.C]] invited the young Bretz to present his previously published research at a 12&nbsp;January 1927 meeting where several other geologists presented competing theories. Bretz saw this as an ambush, and referred to the group as six \"challenging elders\". Their intention was to defeat him in a public debate, and thereby end the challenge his theories posed to their conservative interpretation of uniformitarianism.\n\nAnother geologist at the meeting, [[Joseph Pardee|J.T. Pardee]], had worked with Bretz and had evidence of an ancient [[Proglacial lake|glacial lake]] that lent credence to Bretz's theories. Pardee, however, lacked the academic freedom of Bretz (he worked for the [[US Geological Survey]]) and did not enter the fray.\n\nBretz defended his theories, kicking off an acrimonious 40&nbsp;year debate over the origin of the Scablands. As he wrote in 1928, \"Ideas without precedent are generally looked upon with disfavor and men are shocked if their conceptions of an orderly world are challenged.\"<ref>Quote engraved on monument outside the Dry Falls Museum in Coulee City WA</ref>\n\nBoth Pardee and Bretz continued their research over the next 30&nbsp;years, collecting and analyzing evidence that eventually identified [[Lake Missoula]] as the source of the [[Missoula Floods|Spokane Floods]] and creator of the Channeled Scablands. Research on open channel hydraulics and NASA satellite images in the 1970s further vindicated Bretz's and Pardee's theories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0912/features/legacy.shtml|title=The University of Chicago Magazine: Features|website=magazine.uchicago.edu|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref>\n\n==Caves and karst==\nBretz wrote an extremely influential paper on the morphology and origin of [[limestone]] [[caves]] (1942) together with detailed studies of the caves of [[Missouri]] (1956) and [[Illinois]] (with Stanley Harris, 1961).\n\n==Awards and honors==\nThe National Speleological Society made Bretz an honorary member in 1954.\n\nBretz received the [[Penrose Medal]]; the [[Geological Society of America]]'s highest award, in 1979, at the age of 96.<ref>[https://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm Penrose Medal 1979] to J Harlen Bretz, [[Geological Society of America]]</ref> After this award, he told his son: \"All my enemies are dead, so I have no one to gloat over.\"\n\nEach year at [[Albion College]], the J Harlen Bretz Award is given to the most outstanding senior in the geology department.\n\nBretz Drive in [[Homewood, Illinois]] was named in his honor.\n\nA [http://glaciers.us/sites/default/files/states/washington/JH_Bretz/harlen20.jpg plaque] was dedicated to Bretz in 1994 outside the [http://parks.state.wa.us/251/Dry-Falls Visitor Center at Dry Falls State Park] in [[Coulee City, Washington]] that reads \"Dedicated to J Harlen Bretz who patiently taught us that catastrophic floods may sometimes play a role in nature's unfolding drama\".\n\n==Personal life==\nBretz and his wife Fanny had two children, Rudolf Challis Bretz and Rhoda Bretz Riley. The Bretz family settled in [[Homewood, Illinois]] where they bought property and constructed a [[Sears Catalog Home]] on it in 1921. Bretz nicknamed the property \"Boulderstrewn\" because of all the rocks and minerals he collected and was given that were placed around the property. He donated a portion of this collection to [[Albion College]] in the 1970s [http://campus.albion.edu/bretz/2011/02/01/albion-trips-to-boulder-strewn-homewood-il/]. Boulderstrewn was renowned for being an active place where Bretz hosted many parties with students and faculty from the [[University of Chicago]]. His post-retirement body of work includes ''Geology of the Chicago Region'' (1955), ''The Caves of Missouri'' ''(1956),'' ''Washington's Channeled Scabland'' (1959), ''Caves of Illinois'' (1961), and ''Geomorphic History of the Ozarks'' (1965) -- in addition to his 1949 ''Incomplete Genealogy of the Family of John Bretz Of Fairfield Co., Ohio, with a Partial History of One Line of Descent in this Family.''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n |first1= John Eliot\n |last1= Allen\n |first2= Marjorie\n |last2= Burns\n |first3= Sam C.\n |last3= Sargent\n |year=2009\n |title=Cataclysms on the Columbia: The Great Missoula Floods \n |publisher= Ooligan Press\n |isbn=978-1932010312\n}}\n* {{citation\n |first1 = J.

He earned a degree in [[biology]] from [[Albion College]] in 1905, where he also met his wife Fanny Chalis.

During this time he began studying the [[glacier|glacial]] geology of the [[Puget Sound]] area. He continued his studies at the [[University of Chicago]] where he earned his [[Ph.D.]] in geology in 1913. He became an assistant professor of geology, first at the [[University of Washington]] and then the University of Chicago.\n\nHe made important discoveries regarding the origin of the [[Channeled Scablands]].\n\n==The Spokane floods: an outrageous hypothesis==\nIn the summer of 1922, and for the next seven years, Bretz conducted field research of the [[Columbia River Plateau]]. Between the Summer of 1922 through 1931 he wrote 15 papers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historylink.org/File/8382|title=Bretz, J Harlen (1882-1981), Geologist|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref>\n\nSince 1910 he had been interested in unusual [[erosion]] features in the area after seeing a newly published [[topographic]] map of the Potholes Cataract. Bretz coined the term Channeled Scablands in 1923 to describe the area near the Grand Coulee, where massive erosion had cut through basalt deposits.<ref name=\"bretz23\">Bretz, J Harlen (1923). \"The Channeled Scabland of the Columbia Plateau\". Journal of Geology 31: 617\u2013649.</ref> The area was a [[desert]], but Bretz's theories required cataclysmic water flows to form the landscape, for which Bretz coined the term [[Spokane Floods]] in a 1925 publication.<ref name=\"bretz25\">Bretz, J Harlen (1925). \"The Spokane flood beyond the Channeled Scablands\". Journal of Geology 33: 97\u2013115, 236\u2013259. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F623179 DOI:10.1086/623179]</ref>\n\nBretz published a paper in 1923, arguing that the [[channeled scablands]] in [[Eastern Washington]] were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This was seen as arguing for a [[Catastrophism|catastrophic]] explanation of the geology, against the prevailing view of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], and Bretz's views were initially discredited. However, as the nature of the [[Ice Age]] was better understood, Bretz's original research was vindicated, and by the 1950s his conclusions were also vindicated.\n\nBretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day. The geology establishment was resistant to such a sweeping theory for the origin of a broad landscape for a variety of reasons, including lack of familiarity with the remote areas of the interior Pacific Northwest where the research was based, and the lack of status and reputation of Bretz in the eyes of the largely Ivy League-based geology elites. Furthermore, his theory implied the potential possibilities of a Biblical flood, which the scientific community strongly rejected.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3211_megafloo.html PBS documentary]</ref> The [[Geological Society of America|Geological Society of Washington, D.C]] invited the young Bretz to present his previously published research at a 12&nbsp;January 1927 meeting where several other geologists presented competing theories. Bretz saw this as an ambush, and referred to the group as six \"challenging elders\". Their intention was to defeat him in a public debate, and thereby end the challenge his theories posed to their conservative interpretation of uniformitarianism.\n\nAnother geologist at the meeting, [[Joseph Pardee|J.T. Pardee]], had worked with Bretz and had evidence of an ancient [[Proglacial lake|glacial lake]] that lent credence to Bretz's theories.

If there are no additional state restrictions, a firearm may be transferred to an individual upon approval by the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS) maintained by the FBI. In some states, proof of a previous background check can be used to bypass the NICS check. For example, a state-issued [[concealed carry (USA)|concealed carry]] permit usually includes a background check equivalent to the one required by the Act. Other alternatives to the NICS check include state-issued handgun purchase permits or mandatory state or local background checks.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn Section 922(g) of title 18, United  States Code the Brady Bill prohibits certain persons from shipping or transporting any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce, or receiving any firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or possessing any firearm in or affecting commerce.

These cases wound their way through the courts, eventually leading the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Brady Act in the case of ''[[Printz v. United States]]''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn ''Printz'', the NRA argued that the Brady Act was unconstitutional because its provisions requiring local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks was a violation of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th Amendment to the Constitution]] (Brief [[Amicus Curiae]] of the National Rifle Association of America in Support of Petitioners, ''Printz v. United States'', 521 U.S. 898, 1997). Based on these grounds, the NRA told the Court \"the whole Statute must be voided.\"{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn its 1997 decision in the case, the Supreme Court ruled that the provision of the Brady Act that compelled state and local law enforcement officials to perform the background checks was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] on [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th amendment]] grounds. The Court determined that this provision violated both the concept of federalism and that of the unitary executive. However, the overall Brady statute was upheld and state and local law enforcement officials remained free to conduct background checks if they so chose.
