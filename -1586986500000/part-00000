A car accident occurs, where Tiger gets into a coma, Shenbagam presumably dies, and Anu is lost. This accident was planned by Tiger's brother Sethu and Sethu's friend Maruthanaayagam. Anu is adopted with the name Roja by Shanthamoorty, who raises her in his orphanage. Many years later, Roja is grown up, but then a crimininal named Bhaiya Ganesh enters the orphanage secretly in order to molest the girls. Eventually a girl in the ashramam named Priya and Maruthanaayagam's daughter Saakshi kill Bhaiya Ganesh, and put the blame on Shanthamoorthy, who is then arrested. Roja is also unaware of her heritage as the daughter of Tiger Manickam and Shenbagam. Priya meanwhile, found Roja's childhoom items which Roja had when she was with Tiger and Shenbagam, and Priya goes to Tiger Manickam and lies to him that she is his daughter. Priya is then named Anu. Anu is also well-affiliated with Shenbagam's family. Roja, in order to bring Shanthamoorthy back, gets married to renowned Lawyer Arjun Prathap on a contractual basis for one year who agrees to help Roja. Arjun is actually the nephew of Shenbagam and belongs to Shenbagam's family. Arjun receives Roja's consent to dissolve the marriage after exactly one year by getting signatures in a mutual consent agreement. Roja accepts this agreement so that Arjun could become involved in a case related to her foster father. Arjun dislikes love and marriage due to his traumatic past involving his friend Venu's demise, but indulges in the contractual marriage in an attempt to prevent the marriage between him and Anu.\n\nThe entire family except Arjun's mother Kalpana hates Roja because she took Anu's spot. Annapoorani, who is Arjun and Anu's grandmother and Shenbagam's mother hates Roja the most. Anu teams up with Annapoorani's evil daughter and son-in-law Yashoda and Balu and try to get Roja out of the house several times. Yashoda hates Roja because Roja once humiliated her. Roja tries several times to find out her heritage, and Shantamoorthy's case, but she is stopped by Anu. Eventually Roja and Arjun fall in love with each other and the contractual marriage is forgotten. A police office called Chandrakantha who has a mysterious past also decides to help Arjun with the Bhaiya Ganesh murder case. When she is close to figuring the mystery, she is stopped by the Comissioner Gowtham Nath, who is affiliated with Saakshi for some reason. \n\nAnnapoorani's sister Kamakshi visits Canada once, and she along with Arjun, Roja, and Kalpana try to find out Roja's past and if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. Annapoorani is very sad that everyone is against Anu, and visits 108 temples and leaves the family. Kamakshi leaves India. Anu and Yashoda plan to kill Roja, but Roja only loses her eyesight. Arjun and Kalpana visit Arulvakku Amuthanayagi and seek help to restore Roja's eyesight. Arjun, on the advice of Amuthanayagi, does severe penance and brings Roja's eyesight back. After Roja's eyesight comes back, Annapoorani and Kamakshi return. Annapoorani has developed much more hatred for Arjun and Roja when she returns. Annapoorani decides to make Anu marry Arjun's brother Ashwin, but Ashwin likes a girl named Pooja. Ashwin and Pooja try to marry each other (with the help of Arjun, Roja, and Kamakshi) but are stopped by Annapoorani. Annapoorani makes arrangements for Ashwin- Anu marriage and Ashwin agrees reluctantly after Pooja gets kidnapped. However, Arjun saves Pooja in the last minute and stops the marriage. The story unfolds to show how Roja realises her dream of opening the orphanage with the help of Arjun amongst love, betrayal, hate and her past, how Arjun and Roja help Ashwin unite with Pooja, and how they try to find out if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. More twists arrive when it is revealed that Shenbagam is actually alive, but she has forgotten her past and lives as a nurse named Saraswati.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main Cast===\n* [[Priyanka Nalkari]] as Roja: Arjun's wife; She is the real Anu.\n* Sibbu Suryan as Arjun Prathap: He is a famous criminal lawyer; Roja's husband.\n*Shamili Sukumar as Priya (Main Antagonist): She fakes the identity of Anu.\n\n===Supporting Cast===\n*[[Dr. Sharmila]] as Shenbagam Manickam / Saraswathi: Roja's biological mother; Arjun's paternal aunt\n* Gayathri Shastry as Kalpana Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's mother\n* Sunitha as Saakshi Marudhanayagam (Antagonist): Priya's best friend.\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Annapoorani Vijayakumar: Pratap, Shenbagam and Yashodha's mother\n* Venkat Renganathan as Ashwin Prathap: Arjun's younger brother\n* Smriti Kashyap as Pooja: Ashwin's wife\n* Sumathi Shree as Sumathi\n* Shiva as Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's father\n* [[Rajesh (actor)|Rajesh]]<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://cinema.dinamalar.com/tamil-tv-serials/68563/Chinna-thirai-Television-News/Actor-Rajesh-again-in-Television.htm |title=\u0bae\u0bc0\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bcd |publisher=cinema.dinamalar.com |access-date=2018-04-26 |language=ta}} </ref> as Tiger Manickam: Roja's biological father; He is a famous criminal lawyer\n* [[K.

A car accident occurs, where Tiger gets into a coma, Shenbagam presumably dies, and Anu is lost. This accident was planned by Tiger's brother Sethu and Sethu's friend Maruthanaayagam. Anu is adopted with the name Roja by Shanthamoorty, who raises her in his orphanage. Many years later, Roja is grown up, but then a crimininal named Bhaiya Ganesh enters the orphanage secretly in order to molest the girls. Eventually a girl in the ashramam named Priya and Maruthanaayagam's daughter Saakshi kill Bhaiya Ganesh, and put the blame on Shanthamoorthy, who is then arrested. Roja is also unaware of her heritage as the daughter of Tiger Manickam and Shenbagam. Priya meanwhile, found Roja's childhoom items which Roja had when she was with Tiger and Shenbagam, and Priya goes to Tiger Manickam and lies to him that she is his daughter. Priya is then named Anu. Anu is also well-affiliated with Shenbagam's family. Roja, in order to bring Shanthamoorthy back, gets married to renowned Lawyer Arjun Prathap on a contractual basis for one year who agrees to help Roja. Arjun is actually the nephew of Shenbagam and belongs to Shenbagam's family. Arjun receives Roja's consent to dissolve the marriage after exactly one year by getting signatures in a mutual consent agreement. Roja accepts this agreement so that Arjun could become involved in a case related to her foster father. Arjun dislikes love and marriage due to his traumatic past involving his friend Venu's demise, but indulges in the contractual marriage in an attempt to prevent the marriage between him and Anu.\n\nThe entire family except Arjun's mother Kalpana hates Roja because she took Anu's spot. Annapoorani, who is Arjun and Anu's grandmother and Shenbagam's mother hates Roja the most. Anu teams up with Annapoorani's evil daughter and son-in-law Yashoda and Balu and try to get Roja out of the house several times. Yashoda hates Roja because Roja once humiliated her. Roja tries several times to find out her heritage, and Shantamoorthy's case, but she is stopped by Anu. Eventually Roja and Arjun fall in love with each other and the contractual marriage is forgotten. A police office called Chandrakantha who has a mysterious past also decides to help Arjun with the Bhaiya Ganesh murder case. When she is close to figuring the mystery, she is stopped by the Comissioner Gowtham Nath, who is affiliated with Saakshi for some reason. \n\nAnnapoorani's sister Kamakshi visits Canada once, and she along with Arjun, Roja, and Kalpana try to find out Roja's past and if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. Annapoorani is very sad that everyone is against Anu, and visits 108 temples and leaves the family. Kamakshi leaves India. Anu and Yashoda plan to kill Roja, but Roja only loses her eyesight. Arjun and Kalpana visit Arulvakku Amuthanayagi and seek help to restore Roja's eyesight. Arjun, on the advice of Amuthanayagi, does severe penance and brings Roja's eyesight back. After Roja's eyesight comes back, Annapoorani and Kamakshi return. Annapoorani has developed much more hatred for Arjun and Roja when she returns. Annapoorani decides to make Anu marry Arjun's brother Ashwin, but Ashwin likes a girl named Pooja. Ashwin and Pooja try to marry each other (with the help of Arjun, Roja, and Kamakshi) but are stopped by Annapoorani. Annapoorani makes arrangements for Ashwin- Anu marriage and Ashwin agrees reluctantly after Pooja gets kidnapped. However, Arjun saves Pooja in the last minute and stops the marriage. The story unfolds to show how Roja realises her dream of opening the orphanage with the help of Arjun amongst love, betrayal, hate and her past, how Arjun and Roja help Ashwin unite with Pooja, and how they try to find out if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. More twists arrive when it is revealed that Shenbagam is actually alive, but she has forgotten her past and lives as a nurse named Saraswati.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Priyanka Nalkari]] as Roja: Arjun's wife; She is the real Anu.\n* Sibbu Suryan as Arjun Prathap: He is a famous criminal lawyer; Roja's husband.\n*Shamili Sukumar as Priya (Main Antagonist): She fakes in the identity of Anu.\n\n===Supporting===\n*[[Dr. Sharmila]] as Shenbagam Manickam / Saraswathi: Roja's biological mother; Arjun's paternal aunt\n* Gayathri Shastry as Kalpana Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's mother\n* Sowmya Sharada \u2192 Sunitha as Saakshi Marudhanayagam (Antagonist): Priya's best friend.\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Annapoorani Vijayakumar: Pratap, Shenbagam and Yashodha's mother\n* Venkat Renganathan as Ashwin Prathap: Arjun's younger brother\n* Smriti Kashyap as Pooja: Ashwin's wife\n* Sumathi Shree as Sumathi\n* Shiva as Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's father\n* [[Rajesh (actor)|Rajesh]]<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://cinema.dinamalar.com/tamil-tv-serials/68563/Chinna-thirai-Television-News/Actor-Rajesh-again-in-Television.htm |title=\u0bae\u0bc0\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bcd |publisher=cinema.dinamalar.com |access-date=2018-04-26 |language=ta}} </ref> as Tiger Manickam: Roja's biological father; He is a famous criminal lawyer\n* [[K.

Every season centers around a new character.<ref>{{cite web |website=ZDF |url=https://www.zdf.de/serien/druck |title=Jugendserie:Druck - ZDFmediatek |date= |accessdate=25 February 2020 |language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe first season centers around Hanna and started with the first clip on March 19, 2018. After having \"stolen\" her best friend's boyfriend, Hanna suddenly loses all her friends and her former crew ostracizes and nags her. Her relationship with her boyfriend Jonas suffers from this. Hanna finally finds a new group of friends who help her get a grip on her life.\n\nThe second season centers around Mia, a close friend of Hanna. Mia is a feminist and dislikes the arrogant Alexander Hardenberg, who exerts a bad influence on her friend Kiki.

After having \"stolen\" her best friend's boyfriend, Hanna suddenly loses all her friends and her former crew ostracizes and nags her. Her relationship with her boyfriend Jonas suffers from this. Hanna finally finds a new group of friends who help her get a grip on her life.\n\nThe second season centers around Mia, a close friend of Hanna. Mia is a feminist and dislikes the arrogant Alexander Hardenberg, who exerts a bad influence on her friend Kiki.
