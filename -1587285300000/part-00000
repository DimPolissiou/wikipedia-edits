On Saturdays an extra lunchtime train ran out and back, calling at Catcliffe northbound only.\n\nTo travel from Sheffield (MR) to Chesterfield (MR) via the \"Old Road\" it was necessary to head off north east towards Rotherham then swing south onto the \"Old Road\" itself which was the original [[North Midland Railway]] route from Rotherham to Chesterfield along the Rother Valley. Three trains a day ran to [[Holmes railway station|Holmes]] almost in Rotherham itself before turning sharply south to Treeton. Three trains plus an extra on Saturdays turned off before [[Brightside railway station|Brightside]] onto Sheffield District Railway metals to Treeton, however, only one of these called at Catcliffe plus one on Saturdays, the others passed without stopping.{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|p=718}}\n\nBy August 1939 the service to Mansfield remained little changed, except that Upperthorpe and Killamarsh station had closed in 1930 and not all called at Attercliffe Road.\n\nThe Sheffield to Chesterfield service via Catcliffe and the Old Road had evolved to two trains per day with an extra on Saturdays, all of which called at Catcliffe.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/16418497@N03/6234644598/in/photostream/ Bradshaw, August 1939 p903]</ref> \n\n{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{Rail line\n|previous=[[West

Their voice is remarkable in that it has two different calls. One is a short single high-pitched note, a loud, whistling ''kree-kree-kree'', done only twice in a row. The other is a screech-like shrill while in flight. Unlike other woodpecker species, the black woodpecker does not have a dipping, bounding flight, but instead flies with slow, unsteady-seeming wing beats with its head raised.<ref name=\"Winkler\"/><ref name=\"Perrins\"/>\n\n==Habitat==\nThe black woodpecker is mainly found in forested regions, with a preference for extensive, mature woodland, including [[coniferous]], [[Tropical forest|tropical]], subtropical and [[Taiga|boreal forests]]. It is very widespread throughout mountainous and lowland forests. It is more likely to occur in marginal woods near human habitations during the non-breeding season.

Ecography, 18(4), 363-369.</ref> Like all woodpeckers, this species has a specially adapted neck containing very strong muscles, which allow it to endlessly hack away at tree bark. Due to the size of its bill and large size and great physical power of this bird, it can access prey fairly deep within a tree. In order to position itself correctly, it has short, stumpy legs, as well as long, sharp claws and very stiff tail feathers. The woodpecker will more than likely choose a tree with a fungal disease, such as heart rot, although some will utilise a living, healthy tree. Once a hole has been made, the black woodpecker chips downwards through the trunk of the tree, creating a nesting chamber, the only lining being the woodchips created throughout the process. The black woodpecker's excavations provide homes for many other species of bird and mammal, and is therefore considered to be a \"keystone\" species in many of its habitats throughout its range. It not only provides habitats for other species, but also controls populations of wood-boring insects, helping to protect the trees.<ref name=\"Perrins\"/><ref>Gorman, G. (2008) ''Central and Eastern European Wildlife''. Bradt Travel Guides, Buckshire.</ref>\n\nWhen the nest is ready, the female lays a single clutch of two to eight eggs, the average being four to six. The nest hole is usually dug in a live poplar or pine tree.<ref name=\"JWM\"/> The breeding pair take it in turns to incubate the eggs, also sharing duties of feeding and brooding the chicks once they have hatched. The nestlings may fight their way to the entrance of the nest in order to be fed first. After 18 to 35 days, the young black woodpeckers will leave the nest, staying with the adults for another week.<ref name=\"Winkler\"/><ref name=\"Perrins\"/>\n\n==Mortality and status==\nThe black woodpecker is a fairly widely distributed woodland species and can successfully breed in most areas where extensive woodland is left. At one point, when much of Europe and Asia was deforested, this species declined and in some areas is still struggling today, including in the [[Pyrenees]]. They normally require mature trees and ample stands of dead trees to sustain a viable breeding population.<ref>Garmendia, A., C\u00e1rcamo, S., & Schwendtner, O. (2006).

In Forest Diversity and Management (pp. 339-355). Springer Netherlands.</ref> However, with the restoration of some forested areas, black woodpeckers have increased in some parts of Europe.<ref name= Mikusinski/> They are occasionally considered a nuisance species due to their damage to power lines, communication poles and houses, occasionally resulting in woodpecker mortality due to electrocution or being culled by humans.<ref>Turcek, F.

Their voice is remarkable in that it has two different calls. One is a short single high-pitched note, a loud, whistling ''kree-kree-kree'', done only twice in a row. The other is a screech-like shrill while in flight. Unlike other woodpecker species, the black woodpecker does not have a dipping, bounding flight, but instead flies with slow, unsteady-seeming wing beats with its head raised.<ref name=\"Winkler\"/><ref name=\"Perrins\"/>\n\n==Habitat==\nThe black woodpecker is mainly found in forested regions, with a preference for extensive, mature woodland, including [[coniferous]], [[Tropical forest|tropical]], subtropical and [[Taiga|boreal forests]]. It is very widespread throughout mountainous and lowland forests. It is more likely to occur in marginal woods near human habitations during the non-breeding season.

Due to the size of its bill and large size and great physical power of this bird, it can access prey fairly deep within a tree. In order to position itself correctly, it has short, stumpy legs, as well as long, sharp claws and very stiff tail feathers. The woodpecker will more than likely choose a tree with a fungal disease, such as heart rot, although some will utilise a living, healthy tree. Once a hole has been made, the black woodpecker chips downwards through the trunk of the tree, creating a nesting chamber, the only lining being the woodchips created throughout the process. The black woodpecker's excavations provide homes for many other species of bird and mammal, and is therefore considered to be a \"keystone\" species in many of its habitats throughout its range. It not only provides habitats for other species, but also controls populations of wood-boring insects, helping to protect the trees.<ref name=\"Perrins\"/><ref>Gorman, G. (2008) ''Central and Eastern European Wildlife''. Bradt Travel Guides, Buckshire.</ref>\n\nWhen the nest is ready, the female lays a single clutch of two to eight eggs, the average being four to six. The nest hole is usually dug in a live poplar or pine tree.<ref name=\"JWM\"/> The breeding pair take it in turns to incubate the eggs, also sharing duties of feeding and brooding the chicks once they have hatched. The nestlings may fight their way to the entrance of the nest in order to be fed first. After 18 to 35 days, the young black woodpeckers will leave the nest, staying with the adults for another week.<ref name=\"Winkler\"/><ref name=\"Perrins\"/>\n\n==Mortality and status==\nThe black woodpecker is a fairly widely distributed woodland species and can successfully breed in most areas where extensive woodland is left. At one point, when much of Europe and Asia was deforested, this species declined and in some areas is still struggling today, including in the [[Pyrenees]]. They normally require mature trees and ample stands of dead trees to sustain a viable breeding population.<ref>Garmendia, A., C\u00e1rcamo, S., & Schwendtner, O. (2006).

neural circuits govern aggression in female flies and if this circuit is important in the expression of aggressive behavior in male flies.<ref name=\":5\" /> While it is often thought that males are more aggressive than females in most species, Palavicino-Maggio and her colleagues saw quite the opposite when they screened for aggressive behaviors in fly lines using Drosophila Flylight Gal4.<ref name=\":5\" /> They found that the GMR26E01-Gal4 line had extremelty aggressive females, but males with normal aggressive behavior. <nowiki>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391301</nowiki>\u00a0 Further, the fights that the females engaged in, ended in hierarchical social relationships among the flies.<ref name=\":5\" /> They then tried to hone in on which subpopulation of neurons were responsible for driving this behavior and they found 2-4 pairs of neurons in the female brain pC1 region that were cholinergic and weakly GABAergic that seemed to drive the aggressive behavior in females but did not exist in males.<ref name=\":5\" /> The fascinating finding that such a small populations of neurons can drive specific and intense behavioral outputs will serve as a critical tool and model to understand how exactly interactions between neurons drive complex behaviors and provide a stepping stone for translation into more complex models of social behavior.<ref name=\":5\"

One of the many reasons that patients stop taking medication to treat mental illness is due to side effects like weight gain.<ref name=\":3\" /> Understanding how these side effects manifest as a means to find ways to alleviate them may help with patient compliance, health, and wellbeing.<ref name=\":3\" /> Palavicino-Maggio hypothesized that [[Antipsychotic|antipsychotics]] modulate [[fructose]] absorption in the intestine by affecting GLUT5 function, a transporter for fructose, and thus contributing to weight gain.<ref name=\":3\" /> \u00a0Palavicino-Maggio found that [[clozapine]], a typical antipsychotic, induced weight gain in mice and increased fructose uptake by the intestinal GLUT5 transporter though it did not increase expression of the transporter.<ref

neural circuits govern aggression in female flies and if this circuit is important in the expression of aggressive behavior in male flies.<ref name=\":5\" /> While it is often thought that males are more aggressive than females in most species, Palavicino-Maggio and her colleagues saw quite the opposite when they screened for aggressive behaviors in fly lines using Drosophila Flylight Gal4.<ref name=\":5\" /> They found that the GMR26E01-Gal4 line had extremelty aggressive females, but males with normal aggressive behavior. <nowiki>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391301</nowiki>\u00a0 Further, the fights that the females engaged in, ended in hierarchical social relationships among the flies.<ref name=\":5\" /> They then tried to hone in on which subpopulation of neurons were responsible for driving this behavior and they found 2-4 pairs of neurons in the female brain pC1 region that were cholinergic and weakly GABAergic that seemed to drive the aggressive behavior in females but did not exist in males.<ref name=\":5\" /> The fascinating finding that such a small populations of neurons can drive specific and intense behavioral outputs will serve as a critical tool and model to understand how exactly interactions between neurons drive complex behaviors and provide a stepping stone for translation into more complex models of social behavior.<ref name=\":5\"

The film stars [[Matt Damon]] and [[Christian Bale]], with [[Jon Bernthal]], [[Caitriona Balfe]], [[Tracy Letts]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Noah Jupe]], [[Remo Girone]], and [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive designer [[Carroll Shelby]] and his British driver, [[Ken Miles]], who are dispatched by [[Henry Ford II]] and [[Lee Iacocca]] with the mission of building the [[Ford GT40]], a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari racing team]] at the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race in France. In early stages of the film's production, [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] were cast in the starring roles, but those plans fell through. Mangold was then hired in February 2018, and Damon, Bale, and the rest of the cast joined that summer.

[[Enzo Ferrari]] however, uses Ford's offer to secure a more lucrative deal with [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] that allows him to retain complete ownership of [[Scuderia Ferrari]]. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari also intentionally insults both Ford Motors and Henry Ford II. In response, a furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]] owner [[Carroll Shelby]], a racing driver who won Le Mans in [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|1959]] but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of [[Ken Miles]], a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic.\n\nShelby and Miles test the [[Ford GT40#Mk I|Ford GT40 Mk I]] prototype at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send [[Phil Hill]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] to the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans]] instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218&nbsp;mph on the [[Mulsanne Straight]] before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the [[Ford GT40#Mk II|GT40 Mk II]], but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], he will be allowed to race at Le Mans.\n\nShelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with [[NASCAR]] team [[Holman-Moody]] supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car's limit to 7,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], and he wins the race.\n\nAt the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, but after team engineer [[Phil Remington]] fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferraris. While racing with Ferrari driver [[Lorenzo Bandini]] \u2013 piloting Ferrari's new prototype [[Ferrari P|330 P3]] \u2013 Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car [[photo finish]]. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans.\n\nTwo months after Le Mans, while testing the [[Ford GT40#J-car|J-car]] at [[Riverside International Raceway]], Miles once again experiences brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie and son Peter a visit and gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] race at [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park|Willow Springs]] in 1963.\n\nFord continued its winning streak at Le Mans in [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]], [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]], and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]]. Miles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Carroll Shelby]], American former race car driver, automotive designer, and builder\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Ken Miles]], British [[World War II]] veteran and professional race car driver\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as [[Lee Iacocca]], vice president of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]\n* [[Caitriona Balfe]] as Mollie Miles, Miles' wife\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Leo Beebe, senior executive vice president\n* [[Noah Jupe]] as Peter Miles, Miles's son\n* [[Tracy Letts]] as [[Henry Ford II]], the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Ford and grandson of automotive pioneer [[Henry Ford]] \n* [[Remo Girone]] as [[Enzo Ferrari]], founder of [[Ferrari]] and its automobile racing team [[Scuderia Ferrari]].\n* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as [[Phil Remington]]\n* [[JJ Feild]] as [[Roy Lunn]], a Ford engineer involved in the GT40 program\n* [[Jack McMullen]] as Charlie Agapiou\n* [[Corrado Invernizzi]] as Franco Gozzi, [[Enzo Ferrari]]'s right-hand man\n* Joe Williamson as [[Donald N.

The film stars [[Matt Damon]] and [[Christian Bale]], with [[Jon Bernthal]], [[Caitriona Balfe]], [[Tracy Letts]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Noah Jupe]], [[Remo Girone]], and [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive designer [[Carroll Shelby]] and his British driver, [[Ken Miles]], who are dispatched by [[Henry Ford II]] and [[Lee Iacocca]] with the mission of building the [[Ford GT40]], a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari racing team]] at the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race in France. In early stages of the film's production, [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] were cast in the starring roles, but those plans fell through. Mangold was then hired in February 2018, and Damon, Bale, and the rest of the cast joined that summer. Filming began in July 2018 in California and lasted a little over two months.\n\n''Ford v Ferrari'' had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 15 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film has grossed $225.5 million worldwide and received acclaim from critics, who lauded the performances (particularly Bale's and Damon's), Mangold's direction, the editing and the racing sequences. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review Awards 2019#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] as one of the ten best films of the year, and at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] received four nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/2020-oscar-nominations-list-academy-awards-nominees-1203461985/|title=Oscar Nominations 2020: The Complete List|date=2020-01-13|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113151810/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/2020-oscar-nominations-list-academy-awards-nominees-1203461985/|archive-date=January 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> For his performance, Bale was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Drama]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2020-golden-globes-nominations-full-list-1259626/item/best-motion-picture-musical-comedy-1259661|title=Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy - Golden Globes: Full List of Nominations|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=December 9, 2019|date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209142818/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2020-golden-globes-nominations-full-list-1259626/item/best-motion-picture-musical-comedy-1259661|archive-date=December 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.indiewire.com/2019/12/national-board-of-review-2019-winners-irishman-1202193897/ |title= National Board of Review 2019: 'The Irishman' Wins Best Film, Adam Sandler Named Best Actor |publisher= [[National Board of Review]] |date= December 3, 2019 |accessdate= December 3, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191203194830/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/12/national-board-of-review-2019-winners-irishman-1202193897/ |archive-date= December 3, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963, [[Ford Motor Company]] Vice President [[Lee Iacocca]] proposes to [[Henry Ford II]] to purchase the cash-strapped [[Ferrari]] as a means to boost their car sales by participating in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. [[Enzo Ferrari]], however, walks out of the deal, as [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] offers him a more lucrative deal that allows him to retain complete ownership of [[Scuderia Ferrari]]. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, an insulted Ferrari returns the favor to the company and its CEO. A furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]] owner [[Carroll Shelby]], a racing driver who won Le Mans in [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|1959]] but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of [[Ken Miles]], a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic.\n\nShelby and Miles test the [[Ford GT40#Mk I|Ford GT40 Mk I]] prototype at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send [[Phil Hill]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] to the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans]] instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218&nbsp;mph on the [[Mulsanne Straight]] before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the [[Ford GT40#Mk II|GT40 Mk II]], but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], he will be allowed to race at Le Mans.\n\nShelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with [[NASCAR]] team [[Holman-Moody]] supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car's limit to 7,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], and he wins the race.\n\nAt the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, but after team engineer [[Phil Remington]] fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferraris. While racing with Ferrari driver [[Lorenzo Bandini]] \u2013 piloting Ferrari's new prototype [[Ferrari P|330 P3]] \u2013 Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car [[photo finish]]. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans.\n\nTwo months after Le Mans, while testing the [[Ford GT40#J-car|J-car]] at [[Riverside International Raceway]], Miles once again experiences brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie and son Peter a visit and gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] race at [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park|Willow Springs]] in 1963.\n\nFord continued its winning streak at Le Mans in [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]], [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]], and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]].
