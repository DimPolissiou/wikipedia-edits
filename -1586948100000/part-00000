The screenplay was written by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], who revealed that the aim of the series was to make viewers forget [[Ang Lee]]'s 1995 film ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]''. The series was \"more overtly sexual\" than previous Austen adaptations, and Davies included scenes featuring a seduction and a duel that were absent from the feature film but are included in Austen's book. ''Sense and Sensibility'' was directed by [[John Alexander (director)|John Alexander]] and produced by Anne Pivcevic. [[Hattie Morahan]] and [[Charity Wakefield]] starred as [[Elinor Dashwood|Elinor]] and [[Marianne Dashwood]], two sisters who go on \"a voyage of burgeoning sexual and romantic discovery\".<ref name=\"SSBBC\"/>\n\nThe series was shot on location in the English counties of [[Berkshire]], [[Surrey]], [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Devon]] for two months from April 2007. ''Sense and Sensibility'' was co-produced by the [[BBC]] and American studio [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]]. It was aired in three parts from 1 January 2008 in the United Kingdom and attracted an average of 6 million viewers per episode. The first episode also became one of the top ten most streamed programmes on the [[BBC iPlayer]]. ''Sense and Sensibility'' garnered mostly positive reviews from television critics, while the cast and crew earned several award nominations for their work. It was released on a two-disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Henry Dashwood ([[Simon Williams (actor)|Simon Williams]]) dies, he leaves his entire fortune and his home, Norland Park, to his son John ([[Mark Gatiss]]). John promises that he will provide for his stepmother, Mary Dashwood ([[Janet McTeer]]), and half-sisters [[Elinor Dashwood|Elinor]] ([[Hattie Morahan]]), [[Marianne Dashwood|Marianne]] ([[Charity Wakefield]]), and Margaret ([[Lucy Boynton]]). However, John's wife, Fanny ([[Claire Skinner]]), convinces him to make a much smaller provision than he had originally intended. In addition, they will have to leave Norland Park as it now belongs to John Dashwood. Fanny's brother, [[Edward Ferrars]] ([[Dan Stevens]]), comes to visit, and he quickly befriends Elinor. While Mrs. Dashwood hopes they will become engaged, Fanny informs her that his mother will not approve the match. Mrs. Dashwood receives a letter from her cousin, Sir John Middleton ([[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]]), offering her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in [[Devon]]shire. She and her daughters decide to leave Norland immediately.\n\nDuring a welcome dinner at Barton Park, Sir John introduces the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton ([[Rosanna Lavelle]]); her mother, Mrs. Jennings ([[Linda Bassett]]); and their family friend, Colonel Brandon ([[David Morrissey]]). Brandon instantly falls in love with Marianne, but she believes that he is too old for her. While out walking with Margaret, Marianne falls and twists her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as [[John Willoughby]] ([[Dominic Cooper]]), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on whether they have become secretly engaged.\n\nBrandon invites the Dashwoods and the Middletons to a party on his estate at Delaford, but before the trip can take place, he is called away on urgent business. Willoughby requests a private audience with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne, leading them both to expect that he will propose. However, Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London, and he may not be able to return to Devonshire for at least a year. Shortly after Willoughby's departure, Edward comes to visit, and the Dashwoods notice that he appears to be unhappy and distant. Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy ([[Anna Madeley]]) and Anne Steele ([[Daisy Haggard]]), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news which devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby there. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.\n\nDuring a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but he barely acknowledges their acquaintance. Marianne later learns that he is engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced and then abandoned when pregnant Brandon's young ward, Eliza Williams, who has subsequently given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars ([[Jean Marsh]]) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter on the way back to Devon, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her back indoors, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, but he had to marry a rich woman because his aunt had disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert ([[Leo Bill]]). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Conception and adaptation===\nOn 5 October 2005, a reporter for the [[BBC News]] revealed that writer [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] was planning to adapt [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' into a major television drama due to be broadcast on the [[BBC]] in two years.<ref name=\"MajorDrama\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4311734.stm|title=BBC plans major new Austen drama|date=5 October 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> Davies commented, \"When they are great stories, you keep on coming back to them and doing them in different ways with different people at different lengths.\"<ref name=\"MajorDrama\"/> Davies explained that his script was in the early stages and that no actors had yet been cast.<ref name=\"MajorDrama\"/> The writer later expressed his delight at adapting the novel during an interview with Paul Carey from the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', calling Austen his \"favourite novelist\".<ref name=\"Bleak\">{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-139947984|title='People keep stopping me in the street to say how much they are enjoying Bleak House so I am really pleased'|last=Carey|first=Paul|date=17 December 2005|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=17 December 2012}}{{subscription required}}</ref> He also admitted that due to the acclaim he received for his adaptation of ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'', there was pressure on him to get ''Sense and Sensibility'' right.<ref name=\"Bleak\"/> Davies later stated that the aim of the miniseries was to make viewers forget about [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility (film)|1995 film adaptation]] of the novel.<ref name=\"SexingUp\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Davies+does+a+another+novel+sexing+up+and+it%27s+Jane+Austen+tweaked...-a0166517151|title=Davies does another novel sexing up and it's Jane Austen tweaked again|last=Hill|first=Claire|date=28 May 2007|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe opening episode of ''Sense and Sensibility'' features the moment Willoughby seduces Eliza, who is still a schoolgirl.<ref name=\"Conlan\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/19/broadcasting.bbc1|title=Davies turns up heat on Austen|last=Conlan|first=Tara|date=19 January 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the ''Western Mail'' that he wanted \"to do justice\" to Willoughby's back story, saying that it is \"quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that goes on and is just talked about.

The screenplay was written by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], who revealed that the aim of the series was to make viewers forget [[Ang Lee]]'s 1995 film ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]''. The series was \"more overtly sexual\" than previous Austen adaptations, and Davies included scenes featuring a seduction and a duel that were absent from the feature film but are included in Austen's book. ''Sense and Sensibility'' was directed by [[John Alexander (director)|John Alexander]] and produced by Anne Pivcevic. [[Hattie Morahan]] and [[Charity Wakefield]] starred as [[Elinor Dashwood|Elinor]] and [[Marianne Dashwood]], two sisters who go on \"a voyage of burgeoning sexual and romantic discovery\".<ref name=\"SSBBC\"/>\n\nThe series was shot on location in the English counties of [[Berkshire]], [[Surrey]], [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Devon]] for two months from April 2007. ''Sense and Sensibility'' was co-produced by the [[BBC]] and American studio [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]]. It was aired in three parts from 1 January 2008 in the United Kingdom and attracted an average of 6 million viewers per episode. The first episode also became one of the top ten most streamed programmes on the [[BBC iPlayer]]. ''Sense and Sensibility'' garnered mostly positive reviews from television critics, while the cast and crew earned several award nominations for their work. It was released on a two-disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Henry Dashwood ([[Simon Williams (actor)|Simon Williams]]) dies, he leaves his entire fortune and his home, Norland Park, to his son John ([[Mark Gatiss]]). John promises that he will provide for his stepmother, Mary Dashwood ([[Janet McTeer]]), and half-sisters [[Elinor Dashwood|Elinor]] ([[Hattie Morahan]]), [[Marianne Dashwood|Marianne]] ([[Charity Wakefield]]), and Margaret ([[Lucy Boynton]]). However, John's wife, Fanny ([[Claire Skinner]]), convinces him to make a much smaller provision than he had originally intended. In addition, they will have to leave Norland Park as it now belongs to John Dashwood. Fanny's brother, [[Edward Ferrars]] ([[Dan Stevens]]), comes to visit, and he quickly befriends Elinor. While Mrs. Dashwood hopes they will become engaged, Fanny informs her that his mother will not approve the match. Mrs. Dashwood receives a letter from her cousin, Sir John Middleton ([[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]]), offering her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in [[Devon]]shire. She and her daughters decide to leave Norland immediately.\n\nDuring a welcome dinner at Barton Park, Sir John introduces the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton ([[Rosanna Lavelle]]); her mother, Mrs. Jennings ([[Linda Bassett]]); and their family friend, Colonel Brandon ([[David Morrissey]]). Brandon instantly falls in love with Marianne, but she believes that he is too old for her. While out walking with Margaret, Marianne falls and twists her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as [[John Willoughby]] ([[Dominic Cooper]]), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on whether they have become secretly engaged.\n\nBrandon invites the Dashwoods and the Middletons to a party on his estate at Delaford, but before the trip can take place, he is called away on urgent business. Willoughby requests a private audience with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne, leading them both to expect that he will propose. However, Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London, and he may not be able to return to Devonshire for at least a year. Shortly after Willoughby's departure, Edward comes to visit, and the Dashwoods notice that he appears to be unhappy and distant. Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy ([[Anna Madeley]]) and Anne Steele ([[Daisy Haggard]]), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news which devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby there. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.\n\nDuring a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but he barely acknowledges their acquaintance. Marianne later learns that he is engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced and then abandoned when pregnant Brandon's young ward, Eliza Williams, who has subsequently given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars ([[Jean Marsh]]) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter on the way back to Devon, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her back indoors, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, but he had to marry a rich woman because his aunt had disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert ([[Leo Bill]]). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Conception and adaptation===\nOn 5 October 2005, a reporter for the [[BBC News]] revealed that writer [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] was planning to adapt [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' into a major television drama due to be broadcast on the [[BBC]] in two years.<ref name=\"MajorDrama\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4311734.stm|title=BBC plans major new Austen drama|date=5 October 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> Davies commented, \"When they are great stories, you keep on coming back to them and doing them in different ways with different people at different lengths.\"<ref name=\"MajorDrama\"/> Davies explained that his script was in the early stages and that no actors had yet been cast.<ref name=\"MajorDrama\"/> The writer later expressed his delight at adapting the novel during an interview with Paul Carey from the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', calling Austen his \"favourite novelist\".<ref name=\"Bleak\">{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-139947984|title='People keep stopping me in the street to say how much they are enjoying Bleak House so I am really pleased'|last=Carey|first=Paul|date=17 December 2005|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=17 December 2012}}{{subscription required}}</ref> He also admitted that due to the acclaim he received for his adaptation of ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'', there was pressure on him to get ''Sense and Sensibility'' right.<ref name=\"Bleak\"/> Davies later stated that the aim of the miniseries was to make viewers forget about [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility (film)|1995 film adaptation]] of the novel.<ref name=\"SexingUp\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Davies+does+a+another+novel+sexing+up+and+it%27s+Jane+Austen+tweaked...-a0166517151|title=Davies does another novel sexing up and it's Jane Austen tweaked again|last=Hill|first=Claire|date=28 May 2007|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe opening episode of ''Sense and Sensibility'' features the moment Willoughby seduces Eliza, who is still a schoolgirl.<ref name=\"Conlan\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/19/broadcasting.bbc1|title=Davies turns up heat on Austen|last=Conlan|first=Tara|date=19 January 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the ''Western Mail'' that he wanted \"to do justice\" to Willoughby's back story, saying that it is \"quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that goes on and is just talked about.

One of the first acts of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s new government was his signing of a [[ukaz|presidential decree]] on 27 December 1991, providing for Russian jurisdiction over the central television system. The 'All-Union State TV and Radio Company' ([[Gosteleradio]]) was transformed into the 'Russian State TV and Radio Company Ostankino'.\n\nA presidential decree of 30 November 1994 transformed Ostankino into a [[closed joint-stock company]], '''Russian Public TV''' (Obshchestvennoe Rossiyskoye Televidenie or ORT). The shares were distributed between state agencies (51%) and private shareholders, including numerous banks (49%). The partial privatization was inspired by the intolerable financial situation of Ostankino owing to huge transmission costs and a bloated payroll (total staff of about 10,000 in early 1995).\n\nFollowing the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 financial collapse]], the channel obtained a government loan of $100 million from state-controlled [[banking in Russia|bank]] [[Vneshekonombank]].<ref>''Television in the Russian Federation: Organisational Structure, Program Production and Audience''</ref> Also in 1998, the closed joint stock company was transformed into an open stock company. However, controlling votes on the board of directors remained in the hands of structures linked to then-Kremlin-connected businessman Boris Berezovsky. Thanks to this state of affairs, Berezovsky was able to preserve control over the channel's cash flows as well as over its editorial line until 2002.\n\nFrom 1 April 1995 until late 2002, the channel was called '''ORT''' (\u041e\u0420\u0422\u2014\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, ''Obshchestvennoye Rossiyskoye Televideniye''; Public Russian Television). It maintained the traditional programs and shows of the First Channel of the Soviet Television (RTO), such as ''[[Vremya]]'', ''[[KVN]]'', ''[[Chto? Gde? Kogda?]]'', ''[[V mire zhivotnykh]]'' and ''[[Travelers' Club]]''; the last two are no longer on the air of this channel.\n\n==Political coverage==\nIn autumn of 1999 the channel actively participated in [[State Duma]] [[1999 Russian legislative election|electoral campaign]] by criticizing Moscow mayor [[Yuriy Luzhkov]], [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and their party [[Fatherland-All Russia]], major opponents of the pro-[[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] party [[Unity Party of Russia|Unity]]. [[Sergey Dorenko]], popularly dubbed as TV-killer, was a close ally of [[business oligarch]] and media magnate [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]. From September 1999 to September 2000 he hosted the influential weekly program simply called ''Sergey Dorenko's Program'' on Saturdays at 9&nbsp;pm. This was especially heavy on criticism and mercilessly attacked Putin's opponents.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/july-dec99/russian_elections_12-17.html Russian Elections] (transcript), Jim Lehrer NewsHour, PBS, 17 December 1999.

Accessed 23 April 2008.</ref> Soon after Berezovsky's withdrawal, the new ownership changed the channel's name to Pervy Kanal (Channel One). Konstantin Ernst remains as general director. As of 2008, Channel One's minority shares are held by three little-known companies, [[ORT-KB]], [[Eberlink2002]], and [[Rastrkom-2002]]. Their parent companies are domiciled in Panama and Seychelles and are managed by Evrofinans Group. The ultimate owner is still believed to be [[Roman Abramovich]], who also controls the [[Video International]] advertising agency, the exclusive media seller of Channel One.\n\nRussian television media in the Putin era have been criticised for the pro-government bias.<ref>For example, see ''Index on Censorship'' Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, issue entitled \"How Free is the Russian Media?\"</ref> The critics charge that Channel One's news and information programs are frequently used for propaganda purposes. These critics contend that Channel One airs a disproportionate number of stories focusing on positive aspects of official government policy, while largely neglecting certain controversial topics such as war in [[Chechnya]] or social problems. In addition, some have argued that the station's news reports often blur the line between factual reporting and editorial commentary, especially when broadcasting stories concerning [[Russian government]] policies or goals. For example, during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]]s, many political observers believe the Russian government actively supported the candidacy of then Ukrainian Prime-minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]] over that of [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. In a 13 October 2004 news story, Channel One reporter Natalya Kondratyuk declared that \"the Premier [Yanukovich], as a candidate, is adding to his ratings by working on the economy and by solving current social problems; he does not use slogans; he is not criticizing his opponent; and he is not creating scandals. Yushchenko\u2019s style of campaigning is diametrically opposite.\"\n[[File:Vladimir Posner interviews Hillary Rodham Clinton in Moscow 2010.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Posner interviews [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]] on the \"Posner Show\" in Moscow, 19 March 2010]]\nIn another controversial example, on a 23 January 2005 broadcast, in the midst of widespread protests against a new reform of Russia's social benefits system (L'goty), a Channel One anchor opined, \"you can understand, and should understand, those who went out on the streets, but you also have to understand that the old system has completely outlived its use.\" Later, in the same story, a reporter characterized those protesting against the reforms as political opportunists, adding, \"criticizing the reform is good PR.\" A few days later, on 27 January 2005, as the protests continued across Russia, a Channel One reporter noted, \"You can understand the elderly [protestors, but] repealing free [bus] fares was the last hope for public transport.\"\n\nSimilarly, on a 12 February 2005 broadcast, a Channel One anchor declared, \"The key question of the week has been: how are Presidents [[Mikheil Saakashvili|[Mikheil] Saakashvili]] [of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>) and Yushchenko [of [[Ukraine]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> different? At first, it seemed the difference was only in their appearance, in all other ways, they were like characters from the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' for us.\" Critics of Channel One news argue that hundreds of similar examples exist where station news reporters and anchors insert editorial commentary into news reports, almost always to commend perceived allies of [[Russia]] or criticize perceived enemies.\n\nAs of 2006, [[Vladimir Pozner Jr.|Vladimir Posner]], [[Ekaterina Andreeva (journalist)|Ekaterina Andreeva]], [[Petr Tolstoy]] and [[Mikhail Leontiev]] are among the most prominent political journalists of the channel. On Sunday, 28 January 2006, the Channel One news and analytical program ''Sunday Time'' (''[[Vremya|Voskresnoye Vremya]]'') hosted by [[Petr Tolstoy]] distorted the content of a speech by [[Belarus]]ian President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] related to the [[Russia-Belarus energy dispute]] to the contrary by editing it and deleting some crucial words.<ref>(1) {{in lang|ru}} [http://forum.for-ua.com/read.php?1,1575885 \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e \u043f\u043e \u041b\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0435 (\u041e\u0420\u0422)]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210111228/http://forum.for-ua.com/read.php?1%2C1575885 |date=10 February 2007 }} (Kak delali provokatsi po Lukashchenke (ORT), \"How they provoked on Lukashenko (ORT)\"), for-ua.com<br />\n(2) {{in lang|ru}} [http://www-download.1tv.ru/Video/2007_01/2801072102.flv video (in Russian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323120346/http://www-download.1tv.ru/Video/2007_01/2801072102.flv |date=23 March 2007 }} (FLV file)<br />\n(3) {{in lang|ru}} [http://www.itar-tass.com/level2.html?NewsID=11196940&PageNum=0 text of original speech in Russian]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519034944/http://www.itar-tass.com/level2.html?NewsID=11196940&PageNum=0 |date=19 May 2007 }} (ITAR-TASS)</ref>\n\nAccording to a [[BBC News]] analysis by [[Stephen Ennis]] the channel has in its reports about Ukraine's [[War in Donbass]] \"sought to further [[demonise]] and [[dehumanise]] the [[Ukrainian army]]\".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/monitoring/how-russian-tv-uses-psychology-over-ukraine How Russian TV uses psychology over Ukraine], [[BBC News]] (4 February 2015)</ref>\n\nA 16 January 2016 Channel One news reports on a 13-year-old girl with German and Russian citizenship in [[Berlin]] who was allegedly raped by immigrants was denounced by the [[German police]] as fake.<ref name=conrfpsw/> German foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] has accused the Russian government of using the alleged rape for \"political propaganda\".<ref name=conrfpsw>[http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2016/02/07/russia-having-success-in-hybrid-war-against-germany/ Russia having success in hybrid war against Germany] by Lucian Kim (7 February 2016)</ref>\n\nOn 26 February 2018 Channel One used footage from [[Multinational force|multinational]] [[military simulation]] organization [[Echelon International]], attempting to pass it off as authentic [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian War]] footage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-43198324|title=Russian TV Airs Fake Syria War Footage|last=Kiseleva|first=Maria|date=26 February 2018|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n===Original programming on historical themes===\nSome of the television period dramas produced by Channel One were series criticized for low level of historical accuracy, for instance \u2013 ''[[Brezhnev (film)|Brezhnev]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2012/11/13/52322-dorogoy-leonid-ilich-brezhnev-snova-s-nami|publisher=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|title=\u0414\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434 \u0418\u043b\u044c\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438}}</ref> ''The Saboteur'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sovross.ru/old/2004/135/135_3_3.htm|title=\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0443. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435|trans-title=Assassination Attempt on Victory.

One of the first acts of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s new government was his signing of a [[ukaz|presidential decree]] on 27 December 1991, providing for Russian jurisdiction over the central television system. The 'All-Union State TV and Radio Company' ([[Gosteleradio]]) was transformed into the 'Russian State TV and Radio Company Ostankino'.\n\nA presidential decree of 30 November 1994 transformed Ostankino into a [[closed joint-stock company]], '''Russian Public TV''' (Obshchestvennoe Rossiyskoye Televidenie or ORT). The shares were distributed between state agencies (51%) and private shareholders, including numerous banks (49%). The partial privatization was inspired by the intolerable financial situation of Ostankino owing to huge transmission costs and a bloated payroll (total staff of about 10,000 in early 1995).\n\nFollowing the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 financial collapse]], the channel obtained a government loan of $100 million from state-controlled [[banking in Russia|bank]] [[Vneshekonombank]].<ref>''Television in the Russian Federation: Organisational Structure, Program Production and Audience''</ref> Also in 1998, the closed joint stock company was transformed into an open stock company. However, controlling votes on the board of directors remained in the hands of structures linked to then-Kremlin-connected businessman Boris Berezovsky. Thanks to this state of affairs, Berezovsky was able to preserve control over the channel's cash flows as well as over its editorial line until 2002.\n\nFrom 1 April 1995 until late 2002, the channel was called '''ORT''' (\u041e\u0420\u0422\u2014\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, ''Obshchestvennoye Rossiyskoye Televideniye''; Public Russian Television). It maintained the traditional programs and shows of the First Channel of the Soviet Television (RTO), such as ''[[Vremya]]'', ''[[KVN]]'', ''[[Chto? Gde? Kogda?]]'', ''[[V mire zhivotnykh]]'' and ''[[Travelers' Club]]''; the last two are no longer on the air of this channel.\n\n==Political coverage==\nIn autumn of 1999 the channel actively participated in [[State Duma]] [[1999 Russian legislative election|electoral campaign]] by criticizing Moscow mayor [[Yuriy Luzhkov]], [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and their party [[Fatherland-All Russia]], major opponents of the pro-[[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] party [[Unity Party of Russia|Unity]]. [[Sergey Dorenko]], popularly dubbed as TV-killer, was a close ally of [[business oligarch]] and media magnate [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]. From September 1999 to September 2000 he hosted the influential weekly program simply called ''Sergey Dorenko's Program'' on Saturdays at 9&nbsp;pm. This was especially heavy on criticism and mercilessly attacked Putin's opponents.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/july-dec99/russian_elections_12-17.html Russian Elections] (transcript), Jim Lehrer NewsHour, PBS, 17 December 1999.

Accessed 23 April 2008.</ref> Soon after Berezovsky's withdrawal, the new ownership changed the channel's name to Pervy Kanal (Channel One). Konstantin Ernst remains as general director. As of 2008, Channel One's minority shares are held by three little-known companies, [[ORT-KB]], [[Eberlink2002]], and [[Rastrkom-2002]]. Their parent companies are domiciled in Panama and Seychelles and are managed by Evrofinans Group. The ultimate owner is still believed to be [[Roman Abramovich]], who also controls the [[Video International]] advertising agency, the exclusive media seller of Channel One.\n\nRussian television media in the Putin era have been criticised for the pro-government bias.<ref>For example, see ''Index on Censorship'' Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, issue entitled \"How Free is the Russian Media?\"</ref> The critics charge that Channel One's news and information programs are frequently used for propaganda purposes. These critics contend that Channel One airs a disproportionate number of stories focusing on positive aspects of official government policy, while largely neglecting certain controversial topics such as war in [[Chechnya]] or social problems. In addition, some have argued that the station's news reports often blur the line between factual reporting and editorial commentary, especially when broadcasting stories concerning [[Russian government]] policies or goals. For example, during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]]s, many political observers believe the Russian government actively supported the candidacy of then Ukrainian Prime-minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]] over that of [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. In a 13 October 2004 news story, Channel One reporter Natalya Kondratyuk declared that \"the Premier [Yanukovich], as a candidate, is adding to his ratings by working on the economy and by solving current social problems; he does not use slogans; he is not criticizing his opponent; and he is not creating scandals. Yushchenko\u2019s style of campaigning is diametrically opposite.\"\n[[File:Vladimir Posner interviews Hillary Rodham Clinton in Moscow 2010.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Posner interviews [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]] on the \"Posner Show\" in Moscow, 19 March 2010]]\nIn another controversial example, on a 23 January 2005 broadcast, in the midst of widespread protests against a new reform of Russia's social benefits system (L'goty), a Channel One anchor opined, \"you can understand, and should understand, those who went out on the streets, but you also have to understand that the old system has completely outlived its use.\" Later, in the same story, a reporter characterized those protesting against the reforms as political opportunists, adding, \"criticizing the reform is good PR.\" A few days later, on 27 January 2005, as the protests continued across Russia, a Channel One reporter noted, \"You can understand the elderly [protestors, but] repealing free [bus] fares was the last hope for public transport.\"\n\nSimilarly, on a 12 February 2005 broadcast, a Channel One anchor declared, \"The key question of the week has been: how are Presidents [[Mikheil Saakashvili|[Mikheil] Saakashvili]] [of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>) and Yushchenko [of [[Ukraine]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> different? At first, it seemed the difference was only in their appearance, in all other ways, they were like characters from the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' for us.\" Critics of Channel One news argue that hundreds of similar examples exist where station news reporters and anchors insert editorial commentary into news reports, almost always to commend perceived allies of [[Russia]] or criticize perceived enemies.\n\nAs of 2006, [[Vladimir Pozner Jr.|Vladimir Posner]], [[Ekaterina Andreeva (journalist)|Ekaterina Andreeva]], [[Petr Tolstoy]] and [[Mikhail Leontiev]] are among the most prominent political journalists of the channel.

The [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] efficiency is lower than in [[Agrobacterium tumefaciens|agrobacterial]] mediated transformation, which is also common in plant genetic engineering, but particle bombardment is especially suitable for plastid transformation.\n\nIn order to persist and be stably maintained in the cell, a plasmid DNA molecule must contain an [[origin of replication]], which allows it to be replicated in the cell independently of the [[chromosome]]. Because transformation usually produces a mixture of rare transformed cells and abundant non-transformed cells, a method is needed to identify the cells that have acquired the plasmid. Plasmids used in transformation experiments will usually also contain a gene giving resistance to an antibiotic (or, more recently developed resistance against a herbicide) that the intended recipient strain of bacteria is sensitive to. Selection for cells able to grow on media containing this antibiotic can then select the cells that have acquired the plasmid by transformation, as cells lacking the plasmid will be unable to grow.\n\n==Biological containment and agricultural coexistence==\nGenetically modified plants must be safe for the environment and suitable for [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence with conventional and organic crops]]. A major hurdle for traditional nuclear genetically modified crops is posed by the potential [[outcrossing]] of the [[transgene]] via pollen movement. Initially it was thought that, plastid transformation, which yields transplastomic plants in which the pollen does not contain the transgene, not only increases biosafety, but also facilitates the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic agriculture. Therefore, developing such crops was a major goal of research projects such as [[Co-Extra]] and Transcontainer.\n\nHowever, a study conducted on the [[Nicotiana|tabacco plant]] in 2007 has disproved this theory.
