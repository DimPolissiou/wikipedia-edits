The cars themselves did not carry any staff members.<ref name=\"ntsbrep\" /> Angels Flight was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 13, 2000.\n\n== 2001 accident ==\nOn February 1, 2001, Angels Flight had a serious accident that killed a passenger, Leon Praport (age 83), and injured seven others, including Praport's wife, Lola. The accident occurred when car ''Sinai'', approaching the upper station, reversed direction and accelerated downhill in an uncontrolled fashion to strike car ''Olivet'' near the lower terminus.<ref name=\"ntsbrep\" />\n\n[[File:Angels flight los angeles.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Angels Flight car in 2008]]<!---November 2008--->\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) conducted an investigation into the accident and determined that the probable cause was the improper design and construction of the Angels Flight funicular drive and the failure of the various regulatory bodies to ensure that the railway system conformed to initial safety design specifications and known funicular safety standards. The NTSB further remarked that the company that designed and built the drive, control, braking and haul systems, [[Lift Engineering]]/Yantrak, was no longer in business and that the whereabouts of the company's principal was unknown.<ref name=\"ntsbrep\" />\n\nUnlike the original, the new funicular used two separate haulage systems (one for each car), with the two systems connected to each other, the drive motor, and the [[service brake]] by a [[gear train]]; it was the failure of this gear train that was the immediate cause of the accident since it effectively disconnected ''Sinai'' both from ''Olivet''{{'}}s balancing load and from the service brake. There were [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brakes]] that acted on the rim of each haulage drum, but due to inadequate maintenance, the emergency brakes for both cars were inoperative, which left ''Sinai'' without any brakes once its physical connection to the service brake was lost. Contrary to what might be expected, the new funicular was constructed with neither safety cable nor track brakes, either of which would have prevented the accident; the NTSB was unable to identify another funicular worldwide that operated without either of these safety features.<ref name=\"ntsbrep\" />\n\n[[File:AngelsFlight.jpg|thumb|300px|Angels Flight; 1960, L.o.C.

The test was always performed with the ''Sinai'' car traveling uphill, which meant that when the power was cut and the brakes applied (as part of the test), ''Sinai''{{'}}s momentum caused the car to continue moving uphill a short distance (slackening the cable) and then to roll back from gravity, jerking the cable tight.\n\nIf the emergency brakes had been functional, they would have caught ''Sinai'' when the cable snapped tight, but without the emergency brakes, the force of the jerk caused by the daily test was directed through the [[Spline (mechanical)|spline]] (the part that failed) and to the service brake. In addition, it was found that the original design called for the spline to be made of [[American Iron and Steel Institute|AISI]] 1018 steel on one drawing and of AISI 8822 steel on a different drawing, but it is unlikely that this ambiguity in the design contributed to the accident.<ref name=consultantsbureau>{{cite web |url = http://www.consultantsbureau.com/angel_flight_accident.htm |title = Angels Flight Accident |website = Consultants' Bureau |publisher = Kashar Technical Services |access-date = December 26, 2008 |date = May 3, 2007 |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> }}</ref> However, regular analysis of gear box oil-samples was discontinued in May 1998, despite the fact that the company performing the tests recommending that the rising particulate level in the oil samples warranted the test occurring more frequently.<ref name=\"ntsbrep\" /> The continued rising particulate level may have been in part caused by unusual wear of the splines. Continued testing could have resulted in an inspection to locate the cause of the unusual wear.\n\nBesides the design failures in the haulage system, the system was also criticised by the NTSB for the lack of gates on the cars and the absence of a parallel walkway for emergency evacuation.

But if the brake fluid had been changed as instructed in the maintenance manual, this would not have happened.\n*  The technician installing the solenoid had obtained a properly fitting part when discovering the solenoid did not properly fit the valve, instead of forcing it in with a tool (the installed valve was a newer design, for which the older solenoid was dimensionally incompatible, and tool marks on the solenoid show that it was forced in).\n*  The daily brake test had included testing the service brake and emergency brake separately instead of testing them simultaneously (which made it impossible to confirm that they were both working).\n*  The daily brake test procedure had included looking at the brake pads and the hydraulic pressure in the emergency brake system to confirm it was operating.\n*  The pressure gauges for the hydraulic brake systems had been placed on the operator's control panel instead of in the equipment cabinet.\n*  The daily brake test had involved applying the brakes more gradually so that the up-hill-bound car would not have the momentum to produce slack in the cable and roll backwards, jerking the cable tight.\n*  The splines (the part that failed) had been designed to be extraordinarily strong to withstand the excessive force that occurred when the brake test was performed and the emergency brake was inoperative (which resulted in the force of the cable being pulled tight to be directed to the service brake through the splines, rather than to the emergency brake which was before the splines).\n}}\n\n== Repair ==\n[[File:AngelsFlightInterior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the renovated Angels Flight car in March 2010.]] On November 1, 2008, both of the repaired and restored Angels Flight cars, ''Sinai'' and ''Olivet'', were put back on their tracks and, on January 16, 2009, testing began on the railway.<ref>{{cite web |last = Alossi |first = Rich |title = History in Motion: Angels Flight Takes Off! |publisher = angelinic |date = January 16, 2009 |url = http://www.angelenic.com/6656/history-in-motion-angels-flight-takes-off/ |access-date = January 17, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122201436/http://www.angelenic.com/6656/history-in-motion-angels-flight-takes-off/ |archive-date = January 22, 2009 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=GSS>{{cite web |url = http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/3622.php |title = Angels Flight |publisher = Glass Steel and Stone |access-date = November 14, 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100115115657/http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/3622.php |archive-date = January 15, 2010 }}</ref> On November 20, 2009, another step in the approval process was achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://la.curbed.com/tags/angels-flight |title=Angels Flight |work=Curbed Los Angeles |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724092340/http://la.curbed.com/tags/angels-flight |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}{{failed verification|date=July 2015|ambiguous as this is just a list of posts.What is the step anyway?}}</ref> On March 10, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission approved the safety certificate for the railroad to begin operating again.<ref>{{cite news |last = DiMassa |first = Cara Mia |title = Nine Years After Fatal Accident, Angels Flight Rail Line Receives Safety Certificate |date = March 10, 2010 |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/03/nine-years-after-fatal-accident-angels-flight-rail-lines-receives-safety-certificate.html |access-date = March 14, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100415015622/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/03/nine-years-after-fatal-accident-angels-flight-rail-lines-receives-safety-certificate.html |archive-date = April 15, 2010 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Angels Flight Railway Gets PUC Safety OK |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-angels-flight11-2010mar11,0,4881940.story |access-date=March 14, 2010 |date=March 11, 2010 |last=DiMassa |first=Cara Mia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415024323/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-angels-flight11-2010mar11%2C0%2C4881940.story |archive-date=April 15, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe new drive and safety system completely replaced the system which was the cause of the fatal 2001 accident.

The NTSB further remarked that the company that designed and built the drive, control, braking and haul systems, [[Lift Engineering]]/Yantrak, was no longer in business and that the whereabouts of the company's principal was unknown.<ref name=\"ntsbrep\" />\n\nUnlike the original, the new funicular used two separate haulage systems (one for each car), with the two systems connected to each other, the drive motor, and the [[service brake]] by a [[gear train]]; it was the failure of this gear train that was the immediate cause of the accident since it effectively disconnected ''Sinai'' both from ''Olivet''{{'}}s balancing load and from the service brake. There were [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brakes]] that acted on the rim of each haulage drum, but due to inadequate maintenance, the emergency brakes for both cars were inoperative, which left ''Sinai'' without any brakes once its physical connection to the service brake was lost. Contrary to what might be expected, the new funicular was constructed with neither safety cable nor track brakes, either of which would have prevented the accident; the NTSB was unable to identify another funicular worldwide that operated without either of these safety features.<ref name=\"ntsbrep\" />\n\n[[File:AngelsFlight.jpg|thumb|300px|Angels Flight; 1960, L.o.C.

The test was always performed with the ''Sinai'' car traveling uphill, which meant that when the power was cut and the brakes applied (as part of the test), ''Sinai''{{'}}s momentum caused the car to continue moving uphill a short distance (slackening the cable) and then to roll back from gravity, jerking the cable tight.\n\nIf the emergency brakes had been functional, they would have caught ''Sinai'' when the cable snapped tight, but without the emergency brakes, the force of the jerk caused by the daily test was directed through the [[Spline (mechanical)|spline]] (the part that failed) and to the service brake. In addition, it was found that the original design called for the spline to be made of [[American Iron and Steel Institute|AISI]] 1018 steel on one drawing and of AISI 8822 steel on a different drawing, but it is unlikely that this ambiguity in the design contributed to the accident.<ref name=consultantsbureau>{{cite web |url = http://www.consultantsbureau.com/angel_flight_accident.htm |title = Angels Flight Accident |website = Consultants' Bureau |publisher = Kashar Technical Services |access-date = December 26, 2008 |date = May 3, 2007 |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> }}</ref> However, regular analysis of gear box oil-samples was discontinued in May 1998, despite the fact that the company performing the tests recommending that the rising particulate level in the oil samples warranted the test occurring more frequently.<ref name=\"ntsbrep\" /> The continued rising particulate level may have been in part caused by unusual wear of the splines. Continued testing could have resulted in an inspection to locate the cause of the unusual wear.\n\nBesides the design failures in the haulage system, the system was also criticised by the NTSB for the lack of gates on the cars and the absence of a parallel walkway for emergency evacuation.

But if the brake fluid had been changed as instructed in the maintenance manual, this would not have happened.\n*  The technician installing the solenoid had obtained a properly fitting part when discovering the solenoid did not properly fit the valve, instead of forcing it in with a tool (the installed valve was a newer design, for which the older solenoid was dimensionally incompatible, and tool marks on the solenoid show that it was forced in).\n*  The daily brake test had included testing the service brake and emergency brake separately instead of testing them simultaneously (which made it impossible to confirm that they were both working).\n*  The daily brake test procedure had included looking at the brake pads and the hydraulic pressure in the emergency brake system to confirm it was operating.\n*  The pressure gauges for the hydraulic brake systems had been placed on the operator's control panel instead of in the equipment cabinet.\n*  The daily brake test had involved applying the brakes more gradually so that the up-hill-bound car would not have the momentum to produce slack in the cable and roll backwards, jerking the cable tight.\n*  The splines (the part that failed) had been designed to be extraordinarily strong to withstand the excessive force that occurred when the brake test was performed and the emergency brake was inoperative (which resulted in the force of the cable being pulled tight to be directed to the service brake through the splines, rather than to the emergency brake which was before the splines).\n}}\n\n== Repair ==\n[[File:AngelsFlightInterior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the renovated Angels Flight car in March 2010.]] On November 1, 2008, both of the repaired and restored Angels Flight cars, ''Sinai'' and ''Olivet'', were put back on their tracks and, on January 16, 2009, testing began on the railway.<ref>{{cite web |last = Alossi |first = Rich |title = History in Motion: Angels Flight Takes Off! |publisher = angelinic |date = January 16, 2009 |url = http://www.angelenic.com/6656/history-in-motion-angels-flight-takes-off/ |access-date = January 17, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122201436/http://www.angelenic.com/6656/history-in-motion-angels-flight-takes-off/ |archive-date = January 22, 2009 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=GSS>{{cite web |url = http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/3622.php |title = Angels Flight |publisher = Glass Steel and Stone |access-date = November 14, 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100115115657/http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/3622.php |archive-date = January 15, 2010 }}</ref> On November 20, 2009, another step in the approval process was achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://la.curbed.com/tags/angels-flight |title=Angels Flight |work=Curbed Los Angeles |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724092340/http://la.curbed.com/tags/angels-flight |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}{{failed verification|date=July 2015|ambiguous as this is just a list of posts.What is the step anyway?}}</ref> On March 10, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission approved the safety certificate for the railroad to begin operating again.<ref>{{cite news |last = DiMassa |first = Cara Mia |title = Nine Years After Fatal Accident, Angels Flight Rail Line Receives Safety Certificate |date = March 10, 2010 |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/03/nine-years-after-fatal-accident-angels-flight-rail-lines-receives-safety-certificate.html |access-date = March 14, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100415015622/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/03/nine-years-after-fatal-accident-angels-flight-rail-lines-receives-safety-certificate.html |archive-date = April 15, 2010 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Angels Flight Railway Gets PUC Safety OK |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-angels-flight11-2010mar11,0,4881940.story |access-date=March 14, 2010 |date=March 11, 2010 |last=DiMassa |first=Cara Mia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415024323/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-angels-flight11-2010mar11%2C0%2C4881940.story |archive-date=April 15, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe new drive and safety system completely replaced the system which was the cause of the fatal 2001 accident.

The two female leads live in an apartment very near Angels Flight. The extended opening scene in the movie is set aboard an Angels Flight car, and in one interior apartment scene a set of lights are seen through a window ascending at a steep angle, depicting one of the Angels Flight cars moving upward.\n* Angels Flight appears in the 1947 movie ''[[The Unfaithful (1947 film)|The Unfaithful]]''. Actress Marta Mitrovich rides it from top to bottom at about the 24 minute mark of the movie.\n* Angels Flight is seen during a street chase scene in the 1948 film ''[[Hollow Triumph]]''. Paul Henreid's character kicks the man chasing him off the back of the car as it ascends.\n* Angels Flight is featured in a 20-second sequence showing the two cars passing in the film ''[[Night Has a Thousand Eyes]]'' (1948).\n* Angels Flight is seen at roughly 46 minutes in for about 8 seconds, one car going down and then the second car going up and passing the downward moving car as Van Heflin flees from Robert Ryan through night time Los Angeles in the film noir, ''[[Act of Violence]]'' (1949).\n* Angels Flight is seen through the windows a couple of times during the 'planning' scene in the noir film ''[[Criss Cross (film)|Criss Cross]]'' (1949).\n* In the 1951 remake of the classic [[Fritz Lang]] film, ''[[M (1951 film)|M]]'', there is a scene in the opening credits shot from inside one of the Angels Flight cars, of a man jumping in at the last minute as it starts to ascend. The scene continues to go on for several more moments as the car makes its way up the hill, and a man, who is presumably the child killer, looks out the back door at the nighttime traffic.\n* Angels Flight features in the 1952 crime thriller ''[[The Turning Point (1952 film)|The Turning Point]]'', with [[William Holden]] and [[Alexis Smith]] taking a ride up it to follow a lead.\n* Angels Flight is seen in a 1953 TV episode of ''[[Boston Blackie]]'' called \"Death Does a Rhumba\".\n* In ''Cry of the Hunted'' (1953), Jory ([[Vittorio Gassman]]), a prisoner being transported, escapes and rides the Angels Flight to evade capture.\n* Angels Flight appears in ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954).

[[Lon Chaney Jr.]] rides up to Olive Street and the Hillcrest Hotel. Marian Carr later rides down to Hill Street. In one scene, you can barely make out a sign showing the cost to ride Angels Flight is \"ROUND TRIP OR TWO RIDES \u2013 5 CENTS\" and \"30 RIDE BOOK \u2013 50 CENTS\".\n* The 1956 Kent Mackenzie short film ''Bunker Hill: A Tale of Urban Renewal'' features Angels Flight.\n* Angels Flight is seen several times in the 1961 Kent Mackenzie film ''The Exiles'', which dramatizes the lives of several real Native Americans living on [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] in 1958 (when the film was shot). The DVD of ''The Exiles'' also includes the 1956 Kent Mackenzie short film ''Bunker Hill: A Tale of Urban Renewal'' and the 1969 short film, ''The Last Day of Angels Flight''..\n* In 1963 the railway appeared in the cult trash horror classic ''[[The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies]]'', where one of the characters walks up the hill alongside the tracks.\n* ''Angel's Flight'' is a low-budget 1965 [[film noir]] about a Bunker Hill serial killer, shot on and around Angels Flight in both the downtown and Bunker Hill neighborhoods.\n* There is a scene shot on the railway in ''[[They Came to Rob Las Vegas]]'' released in 1968.\n* The only color episode of the original ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' TV series, the February 1966 episode \"[[List of Perry Mason episodes#ep262|The Case of the Twice-Told Twist]]\", has a brief scene in the opening act, where Perry Mason ([[Raymond Burr]]) and secretary Della Street ([[Barbara Hale]]) ride Angels Flight.\n* There is a brief shot of the Angels Flight in the introduction of the January 1969 ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]'' episode \"[[Dragnet (1967 series) (season 3)#ep61|Narcotics DR-21]]\".\n* Edmund Penney's 15-minute documentary from 1969, ''Angels Flight Railway'', features footage shot in 1965 and during the funicular's last days in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://angelsflight.org/portfolio/edpenneydocumentary/ |title = Angels Flight |publisher = Angels Flight Railway Foundation (copy of original video) |access-date = January 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n* ''The Last Day of Angels Flight'' was a documentary filmed on the day the railway closed in March 1969.\n* On November 23, 2010, NBC's ''[[The Biggest Loser]]'' featured the ride in part of a challenge in which the contestants have to either walk the stairs for 5 points or take the train for 1 point.

Also, the owners of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] wanted that team to be in the same division with their natural rivals of the Cubs. The league could have insisted on a purely geographical alignment like the American League did. But the owners were also concerned about what they thought would be a large imbalance in the strength of the divisions. In the previous two seasons prior to realignment, the Cardinals, Giants, and Cubs finished 1-2-3 in the National League standings. The owners were concerned about putting those teams in the same division, thereby creating one very strong division (West) and one weak one (East). Given all of this, the owners of the [[Atlanta Braves]] and the [[Cincinnati Reds]] consented to being placed into the West Division, even though [[Atlanta]] and [[Cincinnati]] are both in the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Hence, the West Division had teams spread all the way from the East to the Pacific Coast, and scattered over three time zones (no MLB teams played in the [[Mountain Time Zone]] from 1969 to 1992, when the Colorado Rockies were enfranchised). The East Division was spread over the Eastern Time Zone and the [[Central Time Zone]] - despite the fact that the National League had six teams in the Eastern Time Zone and six teams spread between the Central Time Zone and the [[Pacific Time Zone]].\n\nAll of this increased the traveling distances and times for all of the teams, and it also made [[radio broadcasting]] and [[television|TV broadcast]]s of the games more difficult to schedule. The Braves and the Reds had to travel all the way to [[California]] three times during each baseball season, and the three teams in California had to travel to Atlanta, Cincinnati, and [[Houston]] three times also. Sometimes, the trouble could be alleviated for them by playing some games in Chicago, St. Louis, or [[Pittsburgh]] on the same long road trips. The 1994 addition of the Central Division would completely remedy these problems, when the Reds and Braves moved to the NL Central and NL East respectively.\n\n==First season==\nThe very first baseball season of division play, 1969, resulted in what might be considered by many{{who|date=June 2012}} to be two of the best pennant races in Major League baseball history. In the National League West, five of the teams battled for the divisional championship - with only the expansion team, the [[San Diego Padres]], failing to be a contender. The remaining five teams were separated by as few as one-and-one-half games in the standings on August 18, despite the [[Houston Astros]] having lost 20 of its first 24 games.\n\nBeginning in mid-August the [[Houston Astros]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] started collapsing, leaving the Braves, the Reds, and the [[San Francisco Giants]] in contention. Following a very-long hot streak in July, August, and September, the Braves clinched the divisional championship by winning their next-to-last game. The Giants finished in a close second place. One of the main factors in the big surge by the Braves was that the slugging [[outfielder]] [[Rico Carty]] returned to the team after missing the first half of the season while he was recovering from [[tuberculosis]]. Carty immediately resumed his starring role, adding to the powerful offensive line-up of the Braves that also featured the sluggers [[Hank Aaron]] and [[Orlando Cepeda]] and the good singles hitter [[F\u00e9lix Mill\u00e1n]] who was on base to score a lot of runs. Aaron finished in third place for the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|N.L. Most Valuable Player Award]], and the [[starting pitcher]] [[Phil Niekro]] finished in second place for the [[Cy Young Award|N.L. Cy Young Award]].\n \nPerhaps this latter pennant race was overshadowed by that of the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]], with the Mets coming back from trailing by nine-and-one-half games near midseason to overtake the [[Chicago Cubs]] for the East championship. The sometimes called [[1969 New York Mets season|\"Miracle Mets\"]] won the first [[National League Championship Series]] over the Braves three games to none, and then the Mets defeated the [[Baltimore Orioles]] four games to one in the [[1969 World Series|World Series]] in October 1969.\n\n==Divisional membership==\n\n===Current members===\n*[[Arizona Diamondbacks]] - Joined in 1998 as an expansion team\n*[[Colorado Rockies]] - Joined in 1993 as an expansion team\n*[[Los Angeles Dodgers]] - Founding member\n*[[San Diego Padres]] - Founding member\n*[[San Francisco Giants]] - Founding member\n\n===Former members===\n*[[Atlanta Braves]] - Founding member - moved to the [[National League East|NL East]] in 1994.\n*[[Cincinnati Reds]] - Founding member - moved to the [[National League Central|NL Central]] in 1994.\n*[[Houston Astros]] - Founding member - moved to the NL Central in 1994, then to the [[American League West|AL West]] in 2013.\n\n===Division lineups===\n\n''' Place cursor over year for division champ or World Series team.'''\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"36\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Years'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"36\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:125%; background:#DEB887;\"|   NL West Division{{ref label|NL West|A|A}}\n|-\n!

This format was to be changed in 1994, though it was not carried out until 1995 due to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike]] that started on August 12, 1994. There was the addition of two further teams in the playoffs in each league. This has led to the creation of a \"[[Division Series]]\" round of the playoffs, in which two best-of-five series are conducted to determine the participants of the League Championship Series. As before, the winners of each league's pennant compete in the best-of-seven [[World Series]] to determine the champion of Major League Baseball.\n\n*'''Team names link to the season in which each

This Division was formed for the 1969 season when the National League expanded to 12 teams by adding the [[San Diego Padres]] and the [[Montreal Expos]]. For purpose of keeping a regular-season of 162 games, half of the teams were put into the new [[National League East|East Division]] and half into the new West Division. Within each division, the teams played 18 games each against their five division mates (90 games), and also 12 games against the teams in the opposite division (72 games), totaling 162 games.\n\n==Geography==\nDespite the geography, the owners of the [[Chicago Cubs]] insisted that their team be placed into the East Division along with the teams in New York City, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Pittsburgh]]. Also, the owners of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] wanted that team to be in the same division with their natural rivals of the Cubs. The league could have insisted on a purely geographical alignment like the American League did. But the owners were also concerned about what they thought would be a large imbalance in the strength of the divisions. In the previous two seasons prior to realignment, the Cardinals, Giants, and Cubs finished 1-2-3 in the National League standings. The owners were concerned about putting those teams in the same division, thereby creating one very strong division (West) and one weak one (East). Given all of this, the owners of the [[Atlanta Braves]] and the [[Cincinnati Reds]] consented to being placed into the West Division, even though [[Atlanta]] and [[Cincinnati]] are both in the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Hence, the West Division had teams spread all the way from the East to the Pacific Coast, and scattered over three time zones (no MLB teams played in the [[Mountain Time Zone]] from 1969 to 1992, when the Colorado Rockies were enfranchised). The East Division was spread over the Eastern Time Zone and the [[Central Time Zone]] - despite the fact that the National League had six teams in the Eastern Time Zone and six teams spread between the Central Time Zone and the [[Pacific Time Zone]].\n\nAll of this increased the traveling distances and times for all of the teams, and it also made [[radio broadcasting]] and [[television|TV broadcast]]s of the games more difficult to schedule. The Braves and the Reds had to travel all the way to [[California]] three times during each baseball season, and the three teams in California had to travel to Atlanta, Cincinnati, and [[Houston]] three times also. Sometimes, the trouble could be alleviated for them by playing some games in Chicago, St. Louis, or [[Pittsburgh]] on the same long road trips. The 1994 addition of the Central Division would completely remedy these problems, when the Reds and Braves moved to the NL Central and NL East respectively.\n\n==First season==\nThe very first baseball season of division play, 1969, resulted in what might be considered by many{{who|date=June 2012}} to be two of the best pennant races in Major League baseball history. In the National League West, five of the teams battled for the divisional championship - with only the expansion team, the [[San Diego Padres]], failing to be a contender. The remaining five teams were separated by as few as one-and-one-half games in the standings on August 18, despite the [[Houston Astros]] having lost 20 of its first 24 games.\n\nBeginning in mid-August the [[Houston Astros]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] started collapsing, leaving the Braves, the Reds, and the [[San Francisco Giants]] in contention. Following a very-long hot streak in July, August, and September, the Braves clinched the divisional championship by winning their next-to-last game. The Giants finished in a close second place. One of the main factors in the big surge by the Braves was that the slugging [[outfielder]] [[Rico Carty]] returned to the team after missing the first half of the season while he was recovering from [[tuberculosis]]. Carty immediately resumed his starring role, adding to the powerful offensive line-up of the Braves that also featured the sluggers [[Hank Aaron]] and [[Orlando Cepeda]] and the good singles hitter [[F\u00e9lix Mill\u00e1n]] who was on base to score a lot of runs. Aaron finished in third place for the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|N.L. Most Valuable Player Award]], and the [[starting pitcher]] [[Phil Niekro]] finished in second place for the [[Cy Young Award|N.L. Cy Young Award]].\n \nPerhaps this latter pennant race was overshadowed by that of the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]], with the Mets coming back from trailing by nine-and-one-half games near midseason to overtake the [[Chicago Cubs]] for the East championship. The sometimes called [[1969 New York Mets season|\"Miracle Mets\"]] won the first [[National League Championship Series]] over the Braves three games to none, and then the Mets defeated the [[Baltimore Orioles]] four games to one in the [[1969 World Series|World Series]] in October 1969.\n\n==Divisional membership==\n\n===Current members===\n*[[Arizona Diamondbacks]] - Joined in 1998 as an expansion team\n*[[Colorado Rockies]] - Joined in 1993 as an expansion team\n*[[Los Angeles Dodgers]] - Founding member\n*[[San Diego Padres]] - Founding member\n*[[San Francisco Giants]] - Founding member\n\n===Former members===\n*[[Atlanta Braves]] - Founding member - moved to the [[National League East|NL East]] in 1994.\n*[[Cincinnati Reds]] - Founding member - moved to the [[National League Central|NL Central]] in 1994.\n*[[Houston Astros]] - Founding member - moved to the NL Central in 1994, then to the [[American League West|AL West]] in 2013.\n\n===Division lineups===\n\n''' Place cursor over year for division champ or World Series team.'''\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"36\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Years'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"36\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:125%; background:#DEB887;\"|   NL West Division{{ref label|NL West|A|A}}\n|-\n!

This format was to be changed in 1994, though it was not carried out until 1995 due to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike]] that started on August 12, 1994. There was the addition of two further teams in the playoffs in each league. This has led to the creation of a \"[[Division Series]]\" round of the playoffs, in which two best-of-five series are conducted to determine the participants of the League Championship Series. As before, the winners of each league's pennant compete in the best-of-seven [[World Series]] to determine the champion of Major League Baseball.\n\n*'''Team names link to the season in which each

[[File:Russia-Vladimir-Cathedral of Demetrius-4.jpg|thumb|220px|Vsevolod's Christian name was Dmitry, so he dedicated his palace church to [[Saint Demetrius|St&nbsp;Demetrius]], his patron saint.]]\n\n==Family==\nVsevolod was the tenth or eleventh son of [[Yuri Dolgoruky]] (c. 1099 \u2013 1157), who founded the town [[Dmitrov]] to commemorate the site of Vsevolod's birth. [[Nikolai Karamzin]] (1766 \u2013 1826) initiated the speculation identifying Vsevolod's mother Helene as a [[Greece|Greek]] princess, because after her husband's death she took Vsevolod with her to [[Constantinople]].\n\nVsevolod spent his youth at the chivalric court of the [[Komnenoi]]. On his return from the [[Byzantine Empire]] to Rus' in 1170, Vsevolod supposedly visited [[Tbilisi]], as a local chronicle records that that year the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] king entertained his <!-- whose ? --> nephew from Constantinople and married him to his relative, an [[Ossetia]]n princess.\n\n==Reign==\nIn 1173 two [[Smolensk]] princes captured [[Kiev]], captured Vsevolod and briefly installed him on the throne. Ransomed a year later, Vsevolod took his brother [[Mikhail of Vladimir|Mikhalko]]'s side in his struggle against the powerful [[boyar]]s of [[Rostov]] and [[Suzdal]]. Upon Mikhalko's death in 1176, Vsevolod succeeded him in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. He promptly subjugated the boyars and systematically raided the Volga peoples, notably [[Volga Bulgaria]]. He installed puppet rulers on the throne of [[Novgorod]] and married his daughters to princes of [[Chernigov]] and [[Kiev]].\n\n[[File:Saint Demetrios de Thessalonique.jpg|thumb|Vsevolod's icon shows his patron saint, St Demetrius, drawing a sword from a scabbard]]\n\nVsevolod showed little mercy to those who disobeyed his commands. In 1180 and 1187 he punished the princes of [[Ryazan]] by ousting them from their lands. In 1207 he burnt to the ground both Ryazan and [[Belgorod Kievsky|Belgorod]]. His military fame spread quickly. ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', thought to be written during Vsevolod's reign, addresses him thus: ''\"Great prince Vsevolod! Don't you think of flying here from afar to safeguard the paternal golden throne of Kiev? For you can with your oars scatter in drops the Volga, and with your helmets scoop dry the Don.\"''\n\nBut Kievan matters concerned Vsevolod little in the latter part of his reign. He concentrated on building up his own capital, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. His [[Ossetians|Ossetian]] wife, [[Maria Shvarnovna]], who devoted herself to works of piety and founded several convents, was glorified by the [[Russian Orthodox church|Russian church]] as a saint. By her Vsevolod had no fewer than fourteen children, thus earning for himself the [[sobriquet]] ''Big Nest''. Four of them, [[Konstantin of Rostov|Konstantin]], [[Yuri II|George]], [[Yaroslav II of Russia|Yaroslav]] and [[Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich of Vladimir|Sviatoslav]], succeeded him as Grand Dukes of Vladimir. He died on 12 April 1212 and was buried at the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir]].\n\n==Marriage and children==\nVsevolod married first [[Maria Shvarnovna|Maria]], whose origins are disputed. She has been variously identified as [[Ossetians|Ossetian]], [[Alans|Alan]] and [[Moravia]]n. They had at least fourteen children:\n\n*Sbyslava (Pelaghea) Vsevolodovna (born 26 October 1178).\n*Vseslava Vsevolodovna. Married [[Rostislav Yaroslavich]], Prince of [[Snov River|Snov]].

[[File:Russia-Vladimir-Cathedral of Demetrius-4.jpg|thumb|220px|Vsevolod's Christian name was Dmitry, so he dedicated his palace church to [[Saint Demetrius|St&nbsp;Demetrius]], his patron saint.]]\n\n==Family==\nVsevolod was the tenth or eleventh son of [[Yuri Dolgoruky]] (c. 1099 \u2013 1157), who founded the town [[Dmitrov]] to commemorate the site of Vsevolod's birth. [[Nikolai Karamzin]] (1766 \u2013 1826) initiated the speculation identifying Vsevolod's mother Helene as a [[Greece|Greek]] princess, because after her husband's death she took Vsevolod with her to [[Constantinople]].\n\nVsevolod spent his youth at the chivalric court of the [[Komnenoi]]. On his return from the [[Byzantine Empire]] to Rus' in 1170, Vsevolod supposedly visited [[Tbilisi]], as a local chronicle records that that year the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] king entertained his <!-- whose ? --> nephew from Constantinople and married him to his relative, an [[Ossetia]]n princess.\n\n==Reign==\nIn 1173 two [[Smolensk]] princes captured [[Kiev]], captured Vsevolod and briefly installed him on the throne.

{"title_page": "Ship prefix", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n\nA '''ship prefix''' is a combination of letters, usually abbreviations, used in front of the name of a civilian or naval [[ship]] that has historically served numerous purposes, such as identifying the vessel's mode of propulsion, purpose, or ownership/nationality. In the modern environment prefixes are used inconsistently in civilian service, however, in government service the vessels prefix is seldom missing due to government regulations dictating a certain prefix be present. Today the common practice is to F YOU use a single prefix for all [[warship]]s of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as [[coast guard]]s. For example, the modern navy of Japan adopts the prefix \"JS\" \u2013 Japanese Ship. However, not all navies used prefixes; this includes the significant navies of China, France and Russia.\n\n==Usage==\nHistorically, prefixes for civilian vessels often identified the vessel's mode of propulsion, such as, \"SS\" (screw steamer){{citation needed|date=April 2020}}, \"MV\" (motor vessel), or \"PS\" ([[paddle steamer]]).\n\nAlternatively, they might have reflected a vessel's purpose, e.g. \"RMS\" (Royal Mail Ship), or \"RV\" ([[research vessel]]).\n\nThese days, general civilian prefixes are used inconsistently, and frequently not at all. In terms of abbreviations that may reflect a vessel's purpose or function, technology has introduced a broad variety of differently named vessels onto the world's oceans, such as; \"LPGC\" (liquified petroleum gas carrier), or \"TB\" (tug-boat), or \"DB\" (derrick barge). In many cases though, these abbreviations are used for purely formal, legal identification and are not used colloquially or in the daily working environment.\n\nIn terms of vessels used by nations' armed services, prefixes primarily reflect ownership \u2013 but may also indicate a vessels type or purpose as a sub-set. Historically, the most significant navy was Britain's [[Royal Navy]], which has usually used the prefix \"HMS\", standing for \"His/Her Majesty's Ship\". The Royal Navy also adopted nomenclature that reflected a vessel's type or purpose, e.g. HM Sloop. Commonwealth navies adopted a variation, with, for example, HMAS, HMCS, and HMNZS pertaining to Australia, Canada, and New Zealand respectively.\n\nIn the early days of the [[United States Navy]], abbreviations often included the type of vessel, for instance \"USF\" (United States [[Frigate]]), but this method was abandoned by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s Executive Order No. 549 of 1907 which made \"United States Ship\" (USS) the standard signifier for USN ships on active commissioned service.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_549|title=Executive Order 549|last=Roosevelt|first=Theodore|date=8 January 1907|publisher=President of the United States|location=Washington, DC}}</ref>{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} In the United States Navy that prefix officially only applies while the ship is in active commission, with only the name used before or after a period of commission and for all vessels \"in service\" rather than commissioned status.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/heritage/customs-and-traditions/ship-naming.html|title=Ship Naming|website=Naval History and Heritage Command|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref>\n\nToday the common practice is to use a single prefix for all [[warship]]s of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as [[coast guard]]s. For example, the modern navy of Japan adopts the prefix \"JS\" \u2013 Japanese Ship.\n\nHowever, not all navies used prefixes; this includes the significant navies of China, France and Russia.\n\nFrom the 20th century onwards, most navies identify ships by letters or [[hull number]]s (pennant numbers)<ref name=Pnum.Brit>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.EncyclopediaBritannia.org/index.php/Pennant_number\n   |title=Pennant number}}</ref> or a combination of such. These identification codes were, and still are, painted on the side of the ship. Each navy has its own system: the United States Navy uses [[hull classification symbol]]s, and the Royal Navy (e.g. 'D35' is destroyer 35 \u2013 HMS ''Dragon'') and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth use [[pennant number]]s.\n\nThese tables list both current and historical prefixes known to have been used.<ref>{{Cite

nevertheless it is often seen on the [[World Wide Web]]. Until the moment a Dutch naval ship officially enters active service in the fleet, the ship's name is used without the prefix.<ref>Circulaire Zeemacht 1569cc (1988).</ref> Since [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]] succeeded [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] on 30 April 2013, \"Hr.Ms.\" is replaced by \"Zr.Ms.\".\n\nIn Australia, the prefix NUSHIP is used to denote ships that have yet to be commissioned into the fleet.<ref>{{cite web |title= What are Ship Prefixes for Naval and Merchant Vessels?\n|last = Dasgupta\n|first = Soumyajit\n|url =http://www.marineinsight.com/marine/marine-news/headline/what-are-ship-prefixes-for-naval-and-merchant-vessels/\n|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, all prefixes other than \"USS\", \"USNS\", \"USNV\", and \"USRC\" were made obsolete in 1901, when President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] issued an Executive order fixing American naval nomenclature.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} USRC was replaced by USCGC when the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] merged with the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] to become the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1915.{{sfn|United States Coast Guard Historian's Office}} USLHT also was replaced by USCGC when the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] became a part of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1939. USC&GS was replaced by NOAAS when the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] merged with other U.S. Government scientific agencies to form the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) in 1970. USFC was replaced by USFS when the United States Commission on Fish and Fisheries was reorganized as the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries in 1903, and USFS in turn was replaced in 1940 by US FWS when the Bureau of Fisheries merged with the [[United States Department of the Interior]]'s Division of Biological Survey to form the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (which in 1956 was reorganized as the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]). Seagoing ships Fish and Wildlife Service ships with the prefix US FWS that were transferred to NOAA when NOAA was created in 1970 switched to the NOAAS prefix.\n\nA United States Navy ship that is not in active commission does not hold the title of United States Ship with simply the name without prefix used before and after commissioned service.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} Vessels, such as yard and harbor craft that are not commissioned and \"in service\" are officially referred to by name or hull number without prefix.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} Prior to commissioning, ships may be described as a [[pre-commissioning unit]] or PCU; for example, the uncommissioned {{USS|Gerald R. Ford|CVN-78|3}} has been described as the \"pre-commissioning unit (PCU) ''Gerald R. Ford''.\"<ref name=\"NNS PCU CVN-78\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=74667 |agency=Navy News Service |title=PCU Gerald R.

Ford'' without any prefix, and will be known as USS ''Gerald R. Ford'' once commissioned.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} [[Military Sealift Command]] (MSC) civilian manned ships \"in service\" are given the prefix United States Naval Ship (USNS).{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}}\n\nWhen it is stricken from the fleet list, a ship typically has the prefix \"ex-\" added to its name, to distinguish it from any active ships bearing the same name. For example, after [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']] (CV-64) was retired in 2003, she became referred to as ex-''Constellation''.\n\nNote that while calling a US ship \"the USS ''Flattop''\" may make grammatical sense, the preliminary article \"the\" is discouraged by nearly all style guides, and the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy uses ship names without article, except for [[USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)|USS ''The Sullivans'']], named for the five [[Sullivan brothers]], all lost at sea during [[World War II]].<ref>http://www.the-sullivans.navy.mil/</ref> Its British equivalent (\"the HMS ''Flattop''\") is also discouraged, since \"the Her Majesty's Ship\" would be grammatically incorrect.\n\n== In science fiction ==\nFictional equivalents of tri-letter prefixes frequently appear in English-language science fiction works, applied to seafaring and spaceborne ships alike. See also [[Space navy]] for similar adoption of naval customs for fictional spacefaring military organizations.\n* ''[[Star Trek]]'' \u2013 the [[United Federation of Planets]] uses the prefix \"USS\" for [[List of Starfleet starships ordered by class|its starships]]. While [[Gene Roddenberry]] never defined what the abbreviation stood for, some speculate that it means \"United Space Ship\", \"United Star Ship\", or \"United [''Federation of Planets''] Starfleet Starship/Ship\". In the alternate \"[[Mirror Universe]]\", the Terran Empire use an \"ISS\" prefix instead. Other races use different prefixes for their ships:\n** [[Klingon]]s use IKS (Imperial Klingon Ship) or IKC (Imperial Klingon Cruiser).\n** [[Romulan]] vessels typically receive the prefix IRW (Imperial Romulan Warbird), or RIS where some speculate that it means \"Romulan Imperial Ship\", and ChR. (ChR is from novelist Diane Duane's imagining of the ''Star Trek'' Universe, in which the Romulans refer to their home planet as \"Ch'Rihan\". Though Duane's version has a loyal following among many fans, it is not considered official ''Star Trek'' canon; similarly, the [[Ferengi]] designation of FMS, and the [[Cardassian]] CDS, are also not canon.)\n* ''[[Star Wars]]'' \u2013 The [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] sometimes uses the prefix ISD for [[Imperial Star Destroyer]].\n* ''[[Babylon 5]]'' \u2013 The [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] uses the prefix \"EAS\" for \"Earth Alliance Ship\". Some fan material also uses it for \"Earth Alliance Station\".\n* ''[[Elite: Dangerous]]'' \u2013 The Federation uses the prefix \"FNS\" (Federal Naval Ship) for some military ships. The Empire uses \"INV\" (Imperial Naval Vessel).\n* ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' \u2013 Vessels in the [[Union of Allied Planets]] fleet are given the prefix \"IAV\", for Interstellar Alliance Vessel.\n* ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' \u2013 The [[Terran Confederation (Wing Commander)|Terran Confederation]] uses TCS (Terran Confederation Ship) for its vessels.\n* ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' \u2013 [[United Nations Space Command]] spacecraft use the prefix \"UNSC\". The Covenant use three letter designations for ship class such as CAS or CSO\n* ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'' \u2013 features several prefixes, primarily \"SSV\" for \"Systems Alliance space vehicle\"<ref>In-Game Codex, entry for SSV ''Normandy''.</ref> and \"MSV\" for \"Merchant Space Vehicle\", used on numerous human commercial ships, as well as \"PFS\" for a Turian Hierarchy naval craft, and a freighter AML ''Demeter'' of unknown affiliation.\n* ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' \u2013 \"USG\", standing for \"United Spacefaring Guild\", which oversees civilian spacecraft operation, including the planet-cracker class leader USG ''Ishimura'' of the Concordance Extraction Corporation; \"USM\" for the Earth Defense Force of EarthGov; and \"CMS\" for its former opponents, the Sovereign Colonies Armed Forces.\n* ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]'' \u2013 The United Earth Directorate uses DSS (presumably for Directorate Space Ship, e. g. ''DSS Aleksander''); the Terran Confederacy used CSF (Confederate Space Fleet, e. g. ''CSF Ragnorak'') for their battlecruisers.\n* ''[[Killzone (series)|Killzone]]'' \u2013 The Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) uses \"ISC\", for Interplanetary Strategic Cruiser.\n* ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' \u2013 The Federated Nations use \"FNS\", presumably meaning \"Federated Nations Ship\".\n* ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' \u2013 The ships use prefix \"USCSS\" for \"United States Cargo SpaceShip\" on the Nostromo, Prometheus, and Covenant.\n* ''[[The Lost Fleet]]'' \u2013 The Alliance use the prefix \"ASN\" for \"Allied Systems Navy\" (or possibly \"Alliance of Systems Navy\"), the Syndicate Worlds do not use prefixes.\n* ''[[CoDominium]]'' \u2013 CoDominium vessels use the prefix \"CDS\" for CoDominium Ship.\n* \"[[Honorverse]]\" \u2013 The Manticoran kingdom uses \"HMS\" as a prefix, the Graysons use \"GNS\"(Grayson Navy Ship), and the Havenite ships use \"PNS\" (People's Navy Ship) and later \"RHNS\" (Republic of Haven Navy Ship), being reflections of actual ship prefixing traditions, and mirroring the Napoleonic wars. The Solarian League uses \"SLNS\" (Solarian League Navy Ship) and the Andermani Empire uses \"IANS\" for Imperial Andermani Navy Ship. \n* ''[[The Culture]]'' \u2013 Ships are identified by a three-letter prefix denoting class (such as GSV for \"General Systems Vehicle\" or ROU for \"Rapid Offensive Unit\"), followed by their personal name.\n* ''[[The Expanse (novel series)|The Expanse]]'' \u2013 Ships of the United Nations Navy use the prefix \"UNN,\" while ships of the Martian Congressional Republic Navy are prefixed with \"MCRN\". The Nauvoo, a [[generation ship]] commissioned by the [[Church of Latter Day Saints]] was prefixed with \"LDSS\" for \"Latter Day Saints' Ship\", and later changed to \"OPAS\" and re-christened as the \"OPAS Behemoth\" representing the Outer Planets Alliance.\n* ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' \u2013 Ships mentioned there have prefixes such as ITV (\"Interstellar Transport Vessel\", the first non-tutorial match in the tournament happens on board of ''ITV Oblivion'') and ISV (\"Interstellar Science Vessel\", ship's name being ''ISV-Kran'' from ''[[Unreal (1998 video game)|Unreal]]'').\n* ''[[Return to Na Pali|Unreal: Return to Na Pali]]'' \u2013 ISV (''ISV-Kran'') and UMS (\"Unified Military Services\", a prefix for warships).\n* ''[[The Orville]]''\u2014The Planetary Union uses the prefix \"USS\", presumably for \"Union Space Ship\" (in homage to ''Star Trek'').\n* ''[[Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon]]'' - The Terran Empire uses the prefix RLS, which stands for Royal Light Ship; this is also a direct homage to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], author of the original ''[[Treasure Island]]''.

In the modern environment prefixes are used inconsistently in civilian service, however, in government service the vessels prefix is seldom missing due to government regulations dictating a certain prefix be present. Today the common practice is to use a single prefix for all [[warship]]s of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as [[coast guard]]s. For example, the modern navy of Japan adopts the prefix \"JS\" \u2013 Japanese Ship. However, not all navies used prefixes; this includes the significant navies of China, France and Russia.\n\n==Usage==\nHistorically, prefixes for civilian vessels often identified the vessel's mode of propulsion, such as, \"SS\" (screw steamer){{citation needed|date=April 2020}}, \"MV\" (motor vessel), or \"PS\" ([[paddle steamer]]).\n\nAlternatively, they might have reflected a vessel's purpose, e.g. \"RMS\" (Royal Mail Ship), or \"RV\" ([[research vessel]]).\n\nThese days, general civilian prefixes are used inconsistently, and frequently not at all. In terms of abbreviations that may reflect a vessel's purpose or function, technology has introduced a broad variety of differently named vessels onto the world's oceans, such as; \"LPGC\" (liquified petroleum gas carrier), or \"TB\" (tug-boat), or \"DB\" (derrick barge). In many cases though, these abbreviations are used for purely formal, legal identification and are not used colloquially or in the daily working environment.\n\nIn terms of vessels used by nations' armed services, prefixes primarily reflect ownership \u2013 but may also indicate a vessels type or purpose as a sub-set. Historically, the most significant navy was Britain's [[Royal Navy]], which has usually used the prefix \"HMS\", standing for \"His/Her Majesty's Ship\". The Royal Navy also adopted nomenclature that reflected a vessel's type or purpose, e.g. HM Sloop. Commonwealth navies adopted a variation, with, for example, HMAS, HMCS, and HMNZS pertaining to Australia, Canada, and New Zealand respectively.\n\nIn the early days of the [[United States Navy]], abbreviations often included the type of vessel, for instance \"USF\" (United States [[Frigate]]), but this method was abandoned by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s Executive Order No. 549 of 1907 which made \"United States Ship\" (USS) the standard signifier for USN ships on active commissioned service.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_549|title=Executive Order 549|last=Roosevelt|first=Theodore|date=8 January 1907|publisher=President of the United States|location=Washington, DC}}</ref>{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} In the United States Navy that prefix officially only applies while the ship is in active commission, with only the name used before or after a period of commission and for all vessels \"in service\" rather than commissioned status.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/heritage/customs-and-traditions/ship-naming.html|title=Ship Naming|website=Naval History and Heritage Command|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref>\n\nToday the common practice is to use a single prefix for all [[warship]]s of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as [[coast guard]]s. For example, the modern navy of Japan adopts the prefix \"JS\" \u2013 Japanese Ship.\n\nHowever, not all navies used prefixes; this includes the significant navies of China, France and Russia.\n\nFrom the 20th century onwards, most navies identify ships by letters or [[hull number]]s (pennant numbers)<ref name=Pnum.Brit>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.EncyclopediaBritannia.org/index.php/Pennant_number\n   |title=Pennant number}}</ref> or a combination of such. These identification codes were, and still are, painted on the side of the ship. Each navy has its own system: the United States Navy uses [[hull classification symbol]]s, and the Royal Navy (e.g. 'D35' is destroyer 35 \u2013 HMS ''Dragon'') and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth use [[pennant number]]s.\n\nThese tables list both current and historical prefixes known to have been used.<ref>{{Cite

nevertheless it is often seen on the [[World Wide Web]]. Until the moment a Dutch naval ship officially enters active service in the fleet, the ship's name is used without the prefix.<ref>Circulaire Zeemacht 1569cc (1988).</ref> Since [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]] succeeded [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] on 30 April 2013, \"Hr.Ms.\" is replaced by \"Zr.Ms.\".\n\nIn Australia, the prefix NUSHIP is used to denote ships that have yet to be commissioned into the fleet.<ref>{{cite web |title= What are Ship Prefixes for Naval and Merchant Vessels?\n|last = Dasgupta\n|first = Soumyajit\n|url =http://www.marineinsight.com/marine/marine-news/headline/what-are-ship-prefixes-for-naval-and-merchant-vessels/\n|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, all prefixes other than \"USS\", \"USNS\", \"USNV\", and \"USRC\" were made obsolete in 1901, when President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] issued an Executive order fixing American naval nomenclature.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} USRC was replaced by USCGC when the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] merged with the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] to become the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1915.{{sfn|United States Coast Guard Historian's Office}} USLHT also was replaced by USCGC when the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] became a part of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1939. USC&GS was replaced by NOAAS when the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] merged with other U.S. Government scientific agencies to form the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) in 1970. USFC was replaced by USFS when the United States Commission on Fish and Fisheries was reorganized as the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries in 1903, and USFS in turn was replaced in 1940 by US FWS when the Bureau of Fisheries merged with the [[United States Department of the Interior]]'s Division of Biological Survey to form the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (which in 1956 was reorganized as the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]). Seagoing ships Fish and Wildlife Service ships with the prefix US FWS that were transferred to NOAA when NOAA was created in 1970 switched to the NOAAS prefix.\n\nA United States Navy ship that is not in active commission does not hold the title of United States Ship with simply the name without prefix used before and after commissioned service.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} Vessels, such as yard and harbor craft that are not commissioned and \"in service\" are officially referred to by name or hull number without prefix.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} Prior to commissioning, ships may be described as a [[pre-commissioning unit]] or PCU; for example, the uncommissioned {{USS|Gerald R. Ford|CVN-78|3}} has been described as the \"pre-commissioning unit (PCU) ''Gerald R. Ford''.\"<ref name=\"NNS PCU CVN-78\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=74667 |agency=Navy News Service |title=PCU Gerald R.

Ford'' without any prefix, and will be known as USS ''Gerald R. Ford'' once commissioned.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} [[Military Sealift Command]] (MSC) civilian manned ships \"in service\" are given the prefix United States Naval Ship (USNS).{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}}\n\nWhen it is stricken from the fleet list, a ship typically has the prefix \"ex-\" added to its name, to distinguish it from any active ships bearing the same name. For example, after [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']] (CV-64) was retired in 2003, she became referred to as ex-''Constellation''.\n\nNote that while calling a US ship \"the USS ''Flattop''\" may make grammatical sense, the preliminary article \"the\" is discouraged by nearly all style guides, and the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy uses ship names without article, except for [[USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)|USS ''The Sullivans'']], named for the five [[Sullivan brothers]], all lost at sea during [[World War II]].<ref>http://www.the-sullivans.navy.mil/</ref> Its British equivalent (\"the HMS ''Flattop''\") is also discouraged, since \"the Her Majesty's Ship\" would be grammatically incorrect.\n\n== In science fiction ==\nFictional equivalents of tri-letter prefixes frequently appear in English-language science fiction works, applied to seafaring and spaceborne ships alike. See also [[Space navy]] for similar adoption of naval customs for fictional spacefaring military organizations.\n* ''[[Star Trek]]'' \u2013 the [[United Federation of Planets]] uses the prefix \"USS\" for [[List of Starfleet starships ordered by class|its starships]]. While [[Gene Roddenberry]] never defined what the abbreviation stood for, some speculate that it means \"United Space Ship\", \"United Star Ship\", or \"United [''Federation of Planets''] Starfleet Starship/Ship\". In the alternate \"[[Mirror Universe]]\", the Terran Empire use an \"ISS\" prefix instead. Other races use different prefixes for their ships:\n** [[Klingon]]s use IKS (Imperial Klingon Ship) or IKC (Imperial Klingon Cruiser).\n** [[Romulan]] vessels typically receive the prefix IRW (Imperial Romulan Warbird), or RIS where some speculate that it means \"Romulan Imperial Ship\", and ChR. (ChR is from novelist Diane Duane's imagining of the ''Star Trek'' Universe, in which the Romulans refer to their home planet as \"Ch'Rihan\". Though Duane's version has a loyal following among many fans, it is not considered official ''Star Trek'' canon; similarly, the [[Ferengi]] designation of FMS, and the [[Cardassian]] CDS, are also not canon.)\n* ''[[Star Wars]]'' \u2013 The [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] sometimes uses the prefix ISD for [[Imperial Star Destroyer]].\n* ''[[Babylon 5]]'' \u2013 The [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] uses the prefix \"EAS\" for \"Earth Alliance Ship\". Some fan material also uses it for \"Earth Alliance Station\".\n* ''[[Elite: Dangerous]]'' \u2013 The Federation uses the prefix \"FNS\" (Federal Naval Ship) for some military ships. The Empire uses \"INV\" (Imperial Naval Vessel).\n* ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' \u2013 Vessels in the [[Union of Allied Planets]] fleet are given the prefix \"IAV\", for Interstellar Alliance Vessel.\n* ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' \u2013 The [[Terran Confederation (Wing Commander)|Terran Confederation]] uses TCS (Terran Confederation Ship) for its vessels.\n* ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' \u2013 [[United Nations Space Command]] spacecraft use the prefix \"UNSC\". The Covenant use three letter designations for ship class such as CAS or CSO\n* ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'' \u2013 features several prefixes, primarily \"SSV\" for \"Systems Alliance space vehicle\"<ref>In-Game Codex, entry for SSV ''Normandy''.</ref> and \"MSV\" for \"Merchant Space Vehicle\", used on numerous human commercial ships, as well as \"PFS\" for a Turian Hierarchy naval craft, and a freighter AML ''Demeter'' of unknown affiliation.\n* ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' \u2013 \"USG\", standing for \"United Spacefaring Guild\", which oversees civilian spacecraft operation, including the planet-cracker class leader USG ''Ishimura'' of the Concordance Extraction Corporation; \"USM\" for the Earth Defense Force of EarthGov; and \"CMS\" for its former opponents, the Sovereign Colonies Armed Forces.\n* ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]'' \u2013 The United Earth Directorate uses DSS (presumably for Directorate Space Ship, e. g. ''DSS Aleksander''); the Terran Confederacy used CSF (Confederate Space Fleet, e. g. ''CSF Ragnorak'') for their battlecruisers.\n* ''[[Killzone (series)|Killzone]]'' \u2013 The Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) uses \"ISC\", for Interplanetary Strategic Cruiser.\n* ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' \u2013 The Federated Nations use \"FNS\", presumably meaning \"Federated Nations Ship\".\n* ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' \u2013 The ships use prefix \"USCSS\" for \"United States Cargo SpaceShip\" on the Nostromo, Prometheus, and Covenant.\n* ''[[The Lost Fleet]]'' \u2013 The Alliance use the prefix \"ASN\" for \"Allied Systems Navy\" (or possibly \"Alliance of Systems Navy\"), the Syndicate Worlds do not use prefixes.\n* ''[[CoDominium]]'' \u2013 CoDominium vessels use the prefix \"CDS\" for CoDominium Ship.\n* \"[[Honorverse]]\" \u2013 The Manticoran kingdom uses \"HMS\" as a prefix, the Graysons use \"GNS\"(Grayson Navy Ship), and the Havenite ships use \"PNS\" (People's Navy Ship) and later \"RHNS\" (Republic of Haven Navy Ship), being reflections of actual ship prefixing traditions, and mirroring the Napoleonic wars. The Solarian League uses \"SLNS\" (Solarian League Navy Ship) and the Andermani Empire uses \"IANS\" for Imperial Andermani Navy Ship. \n* ''[[The Culture]]'' \u2013 Ships are identified by a three-letter prefix denoting class (such as GSV for \"General Systems Vehicle\" or ROU for \"Rapid Offensive Unit\"), followed by their personal name.\n* ''[[The Expanse (novel series)|The Expanse]]'' \u2013 Ships of the United Nations Navy use the prefix \"UNN,\" while ships of the Martian Congressional Republic Navy are prefixed with \"MCRN\". The Nauvoo, a [[generation ship]] commissioned by the [[Church of Latter Day Saints]] was prefixed with \"LDSS\" for \"Latter Day Saints' Ship\", and later changed to \"OPAS\" and re-christened as the \"OPAS Behemoth\" representing the Outer Planets Alliance.\n* ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' \u2013 Ships mentioned there have prefixes such as ITV (\"Interstellar Transport Vessel\", the first non-tutorial match in the tournament happens on board of ''ITV Oblivion'') and ISV (\"Interstellar Science Vessel\", ship's name being ''ISV-Kran'' from ''[[Unreal (1998 video game)|Unreal]]'').\n* ''[[Return to Na Pali|Unreal: Return to Na Pali]]'' \u2013 ISV (''ISV-Kran'') and UMS (\"Unified Military Services\", a prefix for warships).\n* ''[[The Orville]]''\u2014The Planetary Union uses the prefix \"USS\", presumably for \"Union Space Ship\" (in homage to ''Star Trek'').\n* ''[[Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon]]'' - The Terran Empire uses the prefix RLS, which stands for Royal Light Ship; this is also a direct homage to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], author of the original ''[[Treasure Island]]''. The Procyon Expanse uses the prefix PSR, which stands for Procyon Star Runner.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/heritage/customs-and-traditions/ship-naming.html |title = Ship Naming in the United States Navy |author=Naval History And Heritage Command |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |access-date=7 April 2015 |ref = {{sfnref|Naval History And Heritage Command}} }}\n* {{cite web |url = http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/when.asp |title = Coast Guard History |last=United States Coast Guard Historian's Office |date=5 January 2015 |work=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=United States Coast Guard |access-date=7 April 2015 |ref = {{sfnref|United States Coast Guard Historian's Office}} }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Ship prefixes}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150620072159/http://seawaves.com/port-visits-2/prefixes/ Warship National Prefixes]\n\n[[Category:Ship prefixes| ]]\n", "name_user": "192.183.207.136", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_prefix"}

In addition to the lavish architecture, a huge [[Wurlitzer]] pipe organ was installed.
