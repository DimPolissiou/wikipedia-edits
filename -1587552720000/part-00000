In [[St Peter Port]], the main town of Guernsey, some lorries lined up to load [[tomato]]es for export to England were mistaken by the reconnaissance for troop carriers. Forty-four islanders were killed in the raids.

A workshop erected by the Germans on the Albert Pier was demolished in the 1970s.\n\nDuring the mid 1980s the harbour was dredged to provide easier access for shipping, with the excavated aggregate pumped through pipes to reclaim the land currently used for the North Beach parking, between the harbour and the Queen Elizabeth II Marina.\n\n==Harbour Facilities==\n\n===Freight and Passengers===\n\nA passenger terminal and customs facilities are located on [[St Julian's Pier]].\n\nFacilities at the harbour include two [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro]] ramps for cars and lorries that travel on car/passenger ferries such as the 102m long trimaran ''[[HSC Condor Liberation|Condor Liberation]]'' or freight/car/passenger traditional ferries such as the ''Commodore Clipper''.\n{{s-rail-start|noclear=yes}}\n{{s-rail|title=Ferry}}\n{{rail line one to three|previous=|next1=[[Saint Malo]]|next2=[[Jersey]]|next3=[[Poole]]|route=[[Condor Ferries]]<br /><small>High speed catermaran</small> |col={{ferry colour}} }}\n{{rail line one to two|previous=|next1=[[Jersey]]|next2=[[Portsmouth]]|route=[[Condor Ferries]]<br /><small>Ferry</small> |col={{ferry colour}} }}\n{{rail line | previous=|next=[[Sark]]|route=Isle of Sark Shipping Company <br /><small>Sark Ferry</small> |col={{ferry colour}} }}\n{{rail line | previous=|next=[[Herm]]|route=[[Trident Charter Company]] <br /><small>Herm Ferry</small> |col={{ferry colour}} }}\n{{s-end}}\n\nTwo large cranes and a number of smaller ones facilitate the loading/unloading of containers.\n\n===Piers===\n\n====Albert Pier====\n\nThe southern arm of the original harbour going east from near the Town Church was originally a [[Mole (architecture)|mole]], referred to in 1275 by [[Edward I of England]] when it was mentioned as needing reconstruction, given permission to raise a local tax to cover the cost, little was done until a dry stone pier, was constructed by 1580.<ref name=TGOSPH/><ref name=Ports/> The pier was well built, standing 35&nbsp;ft high and 360&nbsp;ft long, paved with a parapet and still being in good condition in 1815.<ref name=TGOSPH/> Until 1806 a roundhouse tower at the end of the pier had been used as a holding cell for prisoners who needed to be shipped by sea to Castle Cornet, a lighthouse was built on the remains of the roundhouse in 1831 before being demolished in 1860.<ref>{{cite book |last=Toms |first=Carel |title=St Peter Port, People & Places |ISBN=1 86077 258 7 |date=2003}}</ref>{{rp|10}} Improved in 1861-63 with north return arm now at right angles.<ref name=TGOSPH/>{{rp|17}} It was renamed in honour of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] who had died in 1861.

The disembarkation of passengers, mainly using their own ships tenders was, until 2014 using a [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro]] ramp on the White Rock pier until an alternative pontoon and ramp were installed attached to the Albert Pier. Initially the ramp caused complaints as it was considered too steep to passengers to climb when tides were very low, in 2015 this was rectified with a longer ramp which reduced the gradient.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/channel/update/2015-06-30/replacement-gangway-for-cruise-ship-passengers-delayed/ |title=Replacement gangway for cruise ship passengers delayed |publisher=ITV |date=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nBusinesses are developing for transporting and entertaining the 130,000+ annual visitors, with some queues being experienced on days when two large ships arrive on the same day.\n\n==Memorials==\n\nA number of commemoration plaques and memorials are located at the harbour:\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\nAt start of St Julians Pier\n* Plaque in memory of the local people lost when [[RMS Titanic]] sank\n\nOn St Julians Pier:\n* Plaque to commemorate [[Evacuation of civilians from the Channel Islands in 1940|evacuation of children in 1940]]\n* Plaque in memory of those killed in the harbour bombing in 1940\n* Plaque in memory of the holocaust and [[History of the Jews in Guernsey|Jewish residents deported in 1942]]\n* Plaque to commemorate [[Deportations from the German-occupied Channel Islands|deportation of islanders in 1942-3]]\n* Plaque in memory of [[German fortification of Guernsey|foreign workers]] who died in 1940-5\n* [[Resistance in the German-occupied Channel Islands|Guernsey Resistance]] plaque<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-32531107 |title=Guernsey occupation resistance plaque unveiled |publisher=BBC |date=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n* Liberation monument to commemorate the [[Liberation of the German-occupied Channel Islands|liberation in 1945]] (winner of [[Civic Trust Awards|Civic Trust Award]] in 1997<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.civictrustawards.org.uk/benet/region/Channel%20Islands |title=Schemes in Channel Islands |publisher=Civic Trust Awards}}</ref>\n{{col-2}}\n\nAt end of St Julians Pier\n* Plaque in memory of loss of [[SS Stella (1890)]] and sacrifice of Mary Ann Rogers.\n\nOn slipway in inner harbour:\n* Stone commemorating landing of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort]] in August 1846\n* Stone commemorating landing of [[Liberation of the German-occupied Channel Islands|Task Force 135]] troops on 9 May 1945\n\nOn Albert Pier:\n* Statue of Prince Albert\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:CastleCornet.png|An old print of Castle Cornet c. 1814.\nImage:Liberation Monument Guernsey 2.jpg|Liberation Monument\nImage:Guernsey July 2010 Plaque 51.jpg|Evacuation of children\nImage:Guernsey July 2010 Plaque 52.jpg|Deportation of three Jews\nImage:Guernsey July 2010 Plaque 53.jpg|Deportation of islanders\nImage:Arrival at St Peter Port, Guernsey - May 1945 Art.IWMARTLD5600.jpg|British troops landing during the liberation\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Maritime history of the Channel Islands]]\n* [http://www.myharbours.gg/media/pdfimage/1/n/Guernsey_Ports_Master_Plan_Feb_2013_(Low_Res).pdf Harbour master plan 2013]\n* [http://www.harbours.gg/ Guernsey harbours web site]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{coord|49.454456|-2.525396|type:landmark_region:GG_scale:2000_source:Google|display=title}}\n\n{{UK Docks}}\n\n[[Category:Ports and harbours of Guernsey]]\n[[Category:Saint Peter Port]]\n", "name_user": "88.81.132.116", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHarbour Facilities)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter_Port_Harbour"}
