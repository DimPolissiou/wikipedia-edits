At the time of his selection, (January 1996), Kariya was ranked 14th in league scoring with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games, although the Ducks were overall a low-scoring team.

However, they were swept by Detroit again, this time in the first round.\n\nIn the [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000 season]], the Ducks finished with the same number of points as the previous season, but a much more competitive Western Conference had them miss the playoffs by four points behind rival San Jose Sharks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/10/sports/sp-17958 |title=Ducks' Failure to Pick Up the Pace Led to a Stumble \u2013 latimes |website=Los Angeles Times |date=2000-04-10 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> Despite this, the Mighty Ducks scored more goals than the conference champion [[Dallas Stars]]. In the following season, [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301]], the Ducks ended up performing worse, as Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne's point production significantly declined from the previous season \u2013 Kariya went from 86 points to 67 points and Selanne went from 85 points to 57 points. Selanne was subsequently dealt to San Jose at the trade deadline for [[Jeff Friesen]], [[Steve Shields (ice hockey)|Steve Shields]] and a second-round draft pick, while head coach Craig Hartsburg was fired during the season. The team ended up with a losing record and last place in the Western Conference that season. Without Selanne, Kariya's numbers continued to drop in the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]] with new coach [[Bryan Murray (ice hockey)|Bryan Murray]]. The Mighty Ducks finished in 13th place in the Western Conference.\n\n====Western Conference champions (2002\u20132003)====\nThe Mighty Ducks did not reach the post-season again until the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]] with head coach [[Mike Babcock]]. They entered the playoffs in seventh place with a 40\u201327\u20139\u20136 record, good enough for 95 points. In the first round, the Ducks were once again matched up with the Detroit Red Wings, the defending Stanley Cup champions. They shocked the hockey world by sweeping the Red Wings in four games. Steve Rucchin scored the series-winning goal in overtime in Game 4. In the second round, the Ducks faced the Dallas Stars. Game 1 turned out to be the fourth-longest game in NHL history, with [[Petr S\u00fdkora|Petr Sykora]] scoring in the fifth overtime to give the Mighty Ducks the series lead. The Ducks would finish off the Stars in Game 6 at home. In the team's first trip to the Western Conference Finals, they were matched up against another [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella team]], the sixth-seeded, three-year-old [[Minnesota Wild]]. [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] strung together three consecutive shutouts and allowed only one total goal in the series in an eventual sweep.\n\nThe [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals]], to be played against the [[New Jersey Devils]], had some interesting story lines. Anaheim forward [[Rob Niedermayer]] was playing against his brother [[Scott Niedermayer|Scott]], while Giguere faced off against fellow French-Canadian goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]]. The series began with the home team winning the first five games. In Game 6 at home, Kariya was knocked out from a hit by Devils captain [[Scott Stevens]]. However, Kariya would return in the second period and score the fourth goal of the game. In an exciting third period, the Mighty Ducks defeated the Devils 5\u20132 to send the series back to New Jersey for Game 7. Anaheim, however, could not complete their winning streak, as they lost a hard-fought Game 7 to the Devils 3\u20130. For his brilliant play during the post-season, Giguere was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the [[Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) of the playoffs. He became only the fifth player in NHL history to have won the trophy as a member of the losing team. Giguere posted a 15\u20136 record, 7\u20130 in overtime, with a 1.62 [[goals against average]], a .945 [[save percentage]] and a record 168-minute, 27-second shutout streak in overtime.\n\n===Post-Kariya era, Selanne's return and franchise rebrand (2003\u20132007)===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nAfter the season, Kariya promised to bring the Mighty Ducks back to the Stanley Cup Final the following year. However, Kariya left the Ducks in the summer and joined former teammate Teemu Selanne on the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. The [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304 season]] was a season to forget, as Jean-Sebastien Giguere could not repeat his stellar goaltending from the previous year. Even with newcomers [[Sergei Fedorov]] and [[V\u00e1clav Prospal|Vaclav Prospal]], the team finished in 12th place in the standings with a 29\u201335\u201310\u20138 record. Giguere's stats subsequently declined from the previous season, as he only won half the games he did the year before, his goals against average increased from 2.30 to 2.62, his save percentage went down from .914 to .907 and he went from eight shutouts recorded to just three. The team also went from 203 goals to 174.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, as the NHL and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA)'s labor dispute was headed towards a [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|long lockout]], Disney tried to sell the team but received a low offer of US$40&nbsp;million, less than the franchise's original price. In 2005, [[Broadcom Corporation]] co-founder [[Henry Samueli]] of [[Irvine, California]], and his wife Susan bought the Mighty Ducks from The Walt Disney Company for a reported US$75&nbsp;million. The Samuelis pledged to keep the team in Anaheim. [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]], former [[Vancouver Canucks]] general manager and president, was appointed general manager and executive vice-president of the Mighty Ducks on June 20, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ducks-41944-cup-stanley.html |title=Ducks history and fun facts |website=OCRegister.com |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> In January, Samueli announced the team would be renamed as simply the \"Anaheim Ducks\" as of the following season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/name-103201-ducks-team.html |title=Name change set for Mighty Ducks |website=OCRegister.com |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Scott Hannan and Scott Niedermayer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scott Niedermayer]] battles for the puck with [[San Jose Sharks]]' [[Scott Hannan]] in a game during the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]]; signed in the 2005 off-season, he was later named as team captain.]]\nOn August 1, 2005, former [[James Norris Memorial Trophy|Norris Trophy]]-winning defenseman [[Randy Carlyle]] was hired as the seventh head coach in team history. Burke was familiar with Carlyle's coaching ability, as the latter had coached the [[Manitoba Moose]] from 1996 to 2001 (International Hockey League) and 2004\u201305 ([[American Hockey League]]); the Moose had been the Canucks farm club since 2001. Carlyle replaced Mike Babcock, who later signed on to coach Detroit. On August 4, 2005, free agent defenseman Scott Niedermayer signed with the Mighty Ducks to play with his brother Rob; Scott Niedermayer was almost immediately named team captain. On August 22, Teemu Selanne returned to Anaheim after undergoing knee surgery. He led the team in scoring during the season with 40 goals and 50 assists for 90 points. He would also record his 1,000th NHL point on January 30, 2006.\n\nThe [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]] also saw the emergence of rookies [[Ryan Getzlaf]], [[Corey Perry]] and [[Chris Kunitz]] (Kunitz also played for the Ducks in 2003\u201304, but immediately returned to the Mighty Ducks' AHL affiliate, the [[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks]]). On November 15, 2005, Anaheim traded [[Sergei Fedorov]] and a fifth-round draft pick to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in exchange for defenseman [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]] and forward [[Tyler Wright]].\n\nThe Ducks finished the season with a 43\u201327\u201312 record, good enough for 98 points and the sixth seed. The Ducks faced the [[Calgary Flames]] in the Western Conference quarter-finals and forced a seventh game in Calgary, shutting-out the Flames to reach the Conference semi-finals. In an interesting playoffs, all the bottom seeds won in the first round, so the Ducks matched-up against the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. Goaltender [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] shined as the Ducks swept the Avalanche in four-straight games, Bryzgalov breaking Giguere's scoreless streak record from the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs. In the franchise's second Western Conference Finals appearance, they faced the eighth-seeded [[Edmonton Oilers]], a series the Ducks would ultimately lose in five games.\n\n====Stanley Cup champions (2006\u20132007)====\nPrior to the [[2006\u201307 NHL season|2006\u201307 season]], the Ducks adopted a completely new look to go along with their new name; their team colors became black, gold and orange, and the logo of a duck-shaped goalie mask was dropped in favor of the word \"Ducks\", with a webbed foot in place of the \"D\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ducks-40729-orange-team.html |title=O.C. colors Ducks' new look |website=OCRegister.com |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pronger-shooting.jpg|thumb|[[Chris Pronger]] during the [[2006\u201307 NHL season|2006\u201307]] season.

With this trade, solid scoring lines, a shut-down line featuring Rob Niedermayer, [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]] and [[Travis Moen]] and an enviable defense, the Ducks were considered by many to be a Stanley Cup favorite. On November 9, 2006, the Ducks defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6\u20130 at [[General Motors Place]] in Vancouver to improve their season record to 12\u20130\u20134. The win set an NHL open era record by remaining undefeated in regulation for the first 16 games of the season, eclipsing the previous mark set by the 1983\u201384 Edmonton Oilers (the record has since been broken by the Chicago Blackhawks' 21\u20130\u20133 start during the [[2012\u201313 NHL season|2012\u201313 season]]). Anaheim were subsequently shut out by the Flames the following game, 3\u20130, ending their streak. On January 16, 2007, the Ducks played in their franchise's 1,000th regular season game, and on March 11, the Ducks recorded their franchise's 1,000th point with a 4\u20132 win over the Canucks, which improved their franchise all-time record to 423\u2013444\u2013155, with 1,001 points. On April 7, the Ducks won their first division title in franchise history when the Canucks defeated the second-place San Jose Sharks in the final game of the season. The Ducks ended the regular season with a 48\u201320\u201314 record and 110 points\u2014both franchise records. Although they had three fewer wins than the [[Nashville Predators]], the Ducks won the second seed in the West by virtue of winning the Pacific Division title as well as the Predators finishing second in the Central Division behind the Detroit Red Wings (the top seed in the West).\n\nThe Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild in the Conference quarter-finals in five games and the Canucks in the semi-finals, also in five games. Once again, the Ducks faced the Detroit Red Wings in the franchise's third trip to the Western Conference Finals. In Game 3, Chris Pronger elbowed [[Tomas Holmstr\u00f6m|Tomas Holmstrom]] and subsequently received a one-game suspension for the illegal check. However, the Ducks won Game 4 without Pronger and Game 5 in Detroit, with Teemu Selanne scoring the latter game's overtime winner. The Ducks then finished off the Red Wings in Game 6 to advance to their second-ever Stanley Cup Final appearance.\n\n[[File:Stanley Cup Ducks and Bush.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] is presented with a Ducks jersey during a White House ceremony in honor of the team's championship season.]]\nIn the [[2007 Stanley Cup Finals|Finals]], the Ducks won the first two games at home against the [[Ottawa Senators]]. However, the Ducks lost Game 3 and Pronger received his second one-game suspension, this time for elbowing [[Dean McAmmond]]. The Ducks were again able to win without Pronger, defeating the Senators in Game 4 for an opportunity to win the Stanley Cup on home ice in Game 5. On June 6, the Ducks defeated the Senators 6\u20132 at Honda Center to claim their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Travis Moen was credited with the Cup game-winning goal. Scott Niedermayer, the only player on the team who had previously won a Stanley Cup, was awarded the second [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] in Ducks history. The Ducks became the first California team, and the fourth [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] team since the [[1915 Stanley Cup Finals|1915]] [[Vancouver Millionaires]], [[1917 Stanley Cup Finals|1917]] [[Seattle Metropolitans]] and [[1925 Stanley Cup Finals|1925]] [[Victoria Cougars]], to win the Stanley Cup.\n\n===Post-Stanley Cup, Bob Murray replaces Burke (2007\u20132010)===\nThe Ducks began their title defense in the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]] without two fan favorites, Scott Niedermayer and Teemu Selanne, who were both contemplating retirement. To offset those losses, Burke signed forward [[Todd Bertuzzi]] and defenseman [[Mathieu Schneider]]. During the season, Burke put goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov on waivers, where he was picked-up by the Phoenix Coyotes. Free agent signee [[Jonas Hiller]] then became the back-up to starter Jean-Sebastien Giguere. Both Selanne and Niedermayer would ultimately return and the team finished with a 47\u201327\u20138 record, good enough to earn home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs finishing as the fourth seed in the Western Conference. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in six games by the Dallas Stars. In the off-season, Burke bought-out the remaining year on Todd Bertuzzi's contract and traded Mathieu Schneider to the [[Atlanta Thrashers]].\n\n[[File:Henrik Sedin Saku Koivu faceoff.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Saku Koivu]] of the Ducks, and [[Henrik Sedin]] of the [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[face-off]] during a game in the [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310]] season. The Ducks signed Koivu during the 2009 off-season.]] \nAfter an extremely slow start to the [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309 season]], on November 12, 2008, Burke resigned to take the same position for the Toronto Maple Leafs. [[Bob Murray (ice hockey, born 1954)|Bob Murray]] replaced him as general manager, but the team struggled to make the playoffs as the eighth seed in the Western Conference. A bevy of trade deadline deals saw the departure of some mainstays from the Cup team, including Chris Kunitz, who was traded to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] for defenseman [[Ryan Whitney]]; Samuel Pahlsson, who was traded to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for defenseman [[James Wisniewski]]; and Travis Moen, who was traded to the San Jose Sharks for two prospects. The trades gave the Ducks new life as a hot streak to end the season launched the team into the playoffs. Jonas Hiller emerged as the new number one goalie during the stretch drive. The Ducks defeated the number one seed and [[Presidents' Trophy]]-winning San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round before being eliminated in the conference semi-finals by the eventual Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings in seven games. Before the [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310 season]], the Ducks traded Chris Pronger to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] for Joffrey Lupul, [[Luca Sbisa]] and two first-round draft picks. Francois Beauchemin and Rob Niedermayer also left via free agency for the Toronto Maple Leafs and [[New Jersey Devils]], respectively. The Ducks then signed free agent center and former [[Montreal Canadiens]] captain [[Saku Koivu]] to a one-year deal.\n\nAnother slow start would doom the Ducks. Before the trade deadline, the Ducks traded Giguere to the Toronto Maple Leafs for [[Jason Blake (ice hockey)|Jason Blake]] and [[Vesa Toskala]] after signing Hiller to a contract extension. The trade deadline saw the Ducks trade Ryan Whitney to Edmonton for offensive defenseman [[\u013dubom\u00edr Vi\u0161\u0148ovsk\u00fd|Lubomir Visnovsky]], as well as the acquisitions of defenseman [[Aaron Ward (ice hockey)|Aaron Ward]] from the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and goalie [[Curtis McElhinney]] from the Calgary Flames. The Ducks played through frequent injuries and picked up play in the second half of the season, but struggled coming out of the Olympic break. For the first time since the lockout, the Ducks failed to make the playoffs with a 39\u201332\u201311 record. The 2010 off-season was also busy for the Ducks, as Scott Niedermayer announced his retirement in a June press conference. Niedermayer decided to stay a member of the Ducks as a team consultant. The Ducks resigned Saku Koivu for two years and signed free agent defenseman [[Toni Lydman]] to a three-year contract. In addition to Lydman, the Ducks were able to get defenseman [[Cam Fowler]] via the draft, and 35-year-old strong-willed defenseman [[Andy Sutton]] signed to a two-year deal. Restricted free agent [[Bobby Ryan]] was signed to a five-year deal.\n\n===Getzlaf and Perry era (2010\u2013present)===\n[[File:Ryan Getzlaf Ducks 2012-02-15.JPG|thumb|Ryan Getzlaf is the current team captain of the Ducks. Drafted by the team in 2003, he was named team captain in 2010.]]\nThe 2010\u201311 season did not begin well for the Ducks, who would lose their first three games. They maintained a .500 throughout record through the first half of the season, but would find their rhythm and finish 47\u201330\u20135, good for 99 points and fourth place in the Western Conference. Corey Perry and Jonas Hiller represented the Ducks at the All-Star Game, and Corey Perry went on to have a 50-goal, 98-point season, which won him the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]] and [[Hart Memorial Trophy]]. He became the first-ever Duck to win the Hart, as well as the first Richard winner as a Duck since Teemu Selanne won the award in 1999. However, Hiller was injured at the All-Star Game and missed the rest of the season. Even though the Ducks had a great season led by Perry, Hiller, Selanne, Visnovsky and Getzlaf, they would end up losing in the first round of the [[2011 Stanley Cup playoffs|2011 playoffs]] to the fifth-seeded Nashville Predators.\n\nBefore the [[2011\u201312 NHL season|2011\u201312 season]] began, the team mourned the loss of former Mighty Duck [[Ruslan Salei]], who died in a plane crash with several other former NHL players of [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) club [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl]]. The team wore a black patch with his former jersey number, 24, in current team numbering. The Ducks started the season with NHL Premiere games in [[Helsinki]] and [[Stockholm]]. This was the third time in franchise history that they started the regular season with games in Europe. They lost 4\u20131 to the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in Helsinki but defeated the [[New York Rangers]] 2\u20131 after a shootout in Stockholm. After a slow start to the season, the Ducks replaced head coach Randy Carlyle with former Washington Capitals head coach [[Bruce Boudreau]]. The rest of the season was mostly forgettable, as the Ducks could not get out of the hole they dug themselves in the first half of the season, and ultimately failed to reach the playoffs in the 2011\u201312 season.\n[[File:Bruce Boudreau Ducks 2012-02-15.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bruce Boudreau was the head coach of the Ducks from 2011 to 2016. He coached the team to four consecutive division titles.]]\nThe [[2012\u201313 NHL season|2012\u201313 season]] was shortened to 48 games due to a [[2012\u201313 NHL lockout|labor lockout]]. When play resumed in January 2013 after a new [[collective bargaining agreement]] was signed, the Ducks opened the season by sweeping a two-game Canadian road trip with a decisive 7\u20133 victory against the Vancouver Canucks on January 19, followed by a 5\u20134 decision against the Calgary Flames on January 21. Their home opener came on January 25, also against the Canucks, who would prevail 5\u20130. The distinction of the Ducks' longest homestand was split between two five-game stretches from March 18\u201325 and from April 3\u201310. Anaheim's lengthiest road trip was a six-game haul from February 6\u201316. Due to the shortened season and the compacted game scheduling, all games were to be played against the Ducks' own Western Conference opponents, and no games were played against Eastern Conference teams. The Ducks finished the season with a 30\u201312\u20136 record and would win their second Pacific Division title in franchise history. In the Western Conference quarter-finals, they ended up losing to the seventh-seeded Detroit Red Wings in seven games, despite holding a 3\u20132 series lead after Game 5.\n\nEntering the [[2013\u201314 NHL season|2013\u201314 season]], the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it was announced that Teemu Selanne would be playing in his final NHL season. In the off-season, star forward Bobby Ryan was traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forwards [[Jakob Silfverberg]], [[Stefan Noesen]] and Ottawa's first-round pick in the [[2014 NHL Entry Draft]], and the Ducks also signed defenseman [[Mark Fistric]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=680383 |title=Off-ice official Laing balances hockey with police work |publisher=National Hockey League |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> center [[Mathieu Perreault]] and a returning [[Dustin Penner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id%3D427860 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719044728/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=427860 |archivedate=July 19, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> Despite a bad start suffering a 6\u20131 mauling at the hands of the Colorado Avalanche, the Ducks followed the opener with seven-straight wins, a run which was repeated and surpassed twice more during the season, including a franchise-record setting ten consecutive wins from December 6 to 28, 2013. At one point of the season, the Ducks won 18 of 19 games, the longest run of one-loss play in the NHL for 45 years. A 9\u20131 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on January 15 saw Anaheim establish a 20\u20130\u20132 record at the Honda Center, which matched the longest season-opening home points streak in 34 years, as well as setting a franchise-record for goals scored in a game (9), and powerplay goals scored in a game (6).<ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Beacham |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/ducks-soar-top-nhl-18-231839316--nhl.html |title=Ducks soar to top of NHL with 18 wins in 19 games |publisher=Yahoo! |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> Dustin Penner was eventually traded to the Washington Capitals, and prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Ducks acquired veteran defenseman [[St\u00e9phane Robidas|Stephane Robidas]] from the Dallas Stars. Behind a Hart Trophy-caliber season from club captain Ryan Getzlaf, solid depth scoring, a steady if unspectacular defence and solid goaltending in the form of Jonas Hiller and rookie [[Frederik Andersen]], many felt that the Ducks were primed to be a top contender for the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe Ducks remained towards the top of the NHL standings for the entire season, ending the regular season with a franchise-best 54\u201320\u20138 record (116 points) and eventually finishing one point behind the [[Boston Bruins]] in the race for the Presidents' Trophy, awarded to the team finishing the regular season with the best record. The Ducks secured a second consecutive Pacific Division title and the number one seed in the Western Conference. Anaheim faced the eighth-seeded Dallas Stars in the Western Conference quarter-finals and were victorious in six games, marking the first time since 2009 that the Ducks had won a playoff series. In the Western Conference semi-finals, the Ducks faced their geographic rival and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings for the first time ever in the playoffs. In a hotly contested series, the Ducks ultimately went down in seven games to their Southern Californian rivals, losing Game 7 by a score of 6\u20132 at the Honda Center.\n\nOn June 27, 2014, the Ducks acquired center [[Ryan Kesler]] and a third-round pick in [[2015 NHL Entry Draft|2015]] from the Vancouver Canucks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ducks|first1=Anaheim|title=Ducks Acquire Ryan Kesler|url=http://ducks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=724111|publisher=Anaheim Ducks | date = June 27, 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref> In the following season, they would win their third-straight Pacific Division title and finish as the top seed in the West with 109 points. In the [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs|2015 playoffs]], they swept the [[Winnipeg Jets]] in the first round and beat the Calgary Flames in five games to set up a Western Conference final against the Chicago Blackhawks. After taking three games to two series lead on the strong play of goaltender Frederik Andersen, the Ducks lost the final two games of the series, including Game 7 on home ice.

The original jerseys of the Ducks (then the Mighty Ducks) used jade green, purple, white and grey as primary colors for both the home and away jerseys. The team's dark jerseys were dominantly purple in color with diagonal gray and white stripes; the jersey is jade green below the stripes, which appear on the arms and waist, and the collar was jade and white. The white jerseys were similar, except that the purple is replaced mainly with white and the collar is completely purple in color. In 1996, shoulder patches were added to both jerseys featuring a forward-facing version of the main logo's \"duck mask\", surrounded by a circle reading \"Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\".

The new team jersey shows only minor modifications from the 2006\u201307 season's jerseys, including a small NHL crest just below the neck, and a smaller ducks logo on the chest. After the first year of the Edge uniform system being in place, the Ducks increased the size of their logo. The Ducks would use these uniforms as their primary uniforms until the 2013\u201314 season.\n\nOn June 27, 2014, the Ducks unveiled their new uniforms that were based on the 2010\u20132014 alternate jerseys.

The third was a jade green-colored jersey with silver and purple stripes at the shoulders outlined in thin yellow, and a silver stripe at the bottom. It had the Mighty Ducks logo in the center of the chest. The fourth jersey was much like it. It was white with jade green, purple, and silver stripes at the shoulders of the jersey, but no bottom stripe. The eggplant pants were also briefly shelved in favor of black pants. These jerseys saw action until the end of [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]], when they stopped playing with their third jerseys, and used only the fourth (the eggplant pants were also restored). At the end of [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]], the fourth was also retired.\n\nThe 2003 third jersey was black with purple and gray stripes at the waist and on the sleeves. It had the alternate script logo of the present Mighty Ducks and old-style laces at the neck, as well as a shoulder patch displaying an interlocking \"MD\" (for \"Mighty Ducks\"). The popularity of this jersey amongst fans was so great it replaced the purple and jade jersey, serving as the home jersey for the last half of the 2005\u201306 season and playoffs. It was dropped following the season as the team went to a modified name, new uniforms, and color scheme; however, this popular jersey influenced the design of the new jerseys for 2006\u201307. It was the only time in the modern NHL days when a mainly black jersey was not worn with black pants; instead, the pants were purple.\n\nThe 2010 third jersey was officially unveiled on November 26, 2010, against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], the day after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The jersey features the webbed \"D\" on the chest with the recolored Mighty Ducks logo on each shoulder.

When Disney, which produced the movies and owned the NHL team, sold the team in 2005, the name was shortened to \"Anaheim Ducks.\" Orange, which has become one of the team's primary colors, is in reference to Orange County, where Anaheim is located.}}</ref>\n\nThe Ducks' logo features a webbed foot forming a \"D\". The text itself is gold (which sometimes may appear as bronze as well) with orange and black accents (forming a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] appearance). The entire logo is in turn outlined by silver. This is shortened from a prior version that spelled out the word \"Ducks\" in all capital letters.\n\nThe old logo of the Ducks prior to the name change featured an old-style goaltender mask, shaped to form the appearance of a duck bill. Behind the mask are two intersecting hockey sticks, a black hockey puck, and a triangle; the color of the triangle was either green or gray, depending on how the logo is used. This is now used on a shoulder patch of the current uniforms, with the triangle in orange.\n\n===Mascot===\nThe official mascot for the Anaheim Ducks is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] duck by the name of Wild Wing. He has been the team's mascot since its inaugural season, and his name was chosen through fan voting. He wears a Ducks jersey with the number 93 on the back, referring to the year the Ducks became an NHL team.\n[[File:'Johnny Five' keeps 9th CST members out of hot zone, Cal Guard pilot program tests robot for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear response 151111-A-AB123-002.jpg|thumb|left|Wild Wing with members of the [[California National Guard]] prior to the [[ceremonial first puck]].]]\nHe regularly descends from the rafters of the arena when making his in-game entrances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anaheimducks.com/fanzone/wing.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617080118/http://www.anaheimducks.com/fanzone/wing.php |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> In one such descent the rigging that lowered Wild Wing from the rafters malfunctioned leaving the mascot trapped fifty feet above the ice for several minutes. Another well known blunder occurred in October 1995 when Wild Wing, attempting to jump through a \"wall of fire\", accidentally tripped causing the mascot to land on the fire and set his costume ablaze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/2003/07/10/mascot_timeline/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928093110/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/2003/07/10/mascot_timeline/ |archivedate=September 28, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nHis physical appearance is similar to the duck mask in the original Mighty Ducks logo. A bronze statue of Wild Wing was located outside the south doors of Honda Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/atoz/article_1146482.php |title=Mallard nests at The Pond |website=OCRegister.com |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> from 1993 to 2012, until construction began on the 'Grand Terrace' addition to the arena. When construction was completed and the Grand Terrace opened in October 2013, the statue was noticeably absent.\n\nThe mascot's name was also used for the leader of the Ducks, Wildwing Flashblade, in Disney's [[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|Mighty Ducks]] cartoon series.\n\nDuring the same time in which the team announced a name change as well as change in jersey designs, there was an attempt by the team's owners to change or replace the mascot, Wild Wing, but was halted after a highly successful petition by fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThe Mighty Ducks also used a secondary \"mascot\", a person (with no particular costume) called \"The Iceman\", during the team's first game in 1993. \"The Iceman\" appeared occasionally in the stands, played an electric guitar, and attempted to liven up the crowd. However, \"The Iceman\" was poorly received by fans and was quickly eliminated as the Ducks lost to the Red Wings in their inaugural game, 7-2.\n\n===Rivalries===\nThe Ducks have two rivalries with two teams out of geographical proximity. The [[Freeway Face-Off]] with the [[Los Angeles Kings]] as both teams arenas are accessible via [[Interstate 5 in California]] and the fact that both teams are within the [[Greater Los Angeles area|greater Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. The Ducks also have a rivalry with the [[San Jose Sharks]]. Despite the arenas being six hours away from each other, the teams have developed a strong rivalry, primarily from the 2009 and 2018 [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. The Ducks won the series in 2009, but the Sharks came back in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/18/broom-service-led-by-martin-jones-sharks-sweep-anaheim-ducks/ |title=Broom service!

However, they were swept by Detroit again, this time in the first round.\n\nIn the [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000 season]], the Ducks finished with the same number of points as the previous season, but a much more competitive Western Conference had them miss the playoffs by four points behind rival San Jose Sharks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/10/sports/sp-17958 |title=Ducks' Failure to Pick Up the Pace Led to a Stumble \u2013 latimes |website=Los Angeles Times |date=2000-04-10 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> Despite this, the Mighty Ducks scored more goals than the conference champion [[Dallas Stars]]. In the following season, [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301]], the Ducks ended up performing worse, as Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne's point production significantly declined from the previous season \u2013 Kariya went from 86 points to 67 points and Selanne went from 85 points to 57 points. Selanne was subsequently dealt to San Jose at the trade deadline for [[Jeff Friesen]], [[Steve Shields (ice hockey)|Steve Shields]] and a second-round draft pick, while head coach Craig Hartsburg was fired during the season. The team ended up with a losing record and last place in the Western Conference that season. Without Selanne, Kariya's numbers continued to drop in the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]] with new coach [[Bryan Murray (ice hockey)|Bryan Murray]]. The Mighty Ducks finished in 13th place in the Western Conference.\n\n====Western Conference champions (2002\u20132003)====\nThe Mighty Ducks did not reach the post-season again until the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]] with head coach [[Mike Babcock]]. They entered the playoffs in seventh place with a 40\u201327\u20139\u20136 record, good enough for 95 points. In the first round, the Ducks were once again matched up with the Detroit Red Wings, the defending Stanley Cup champions. They shocked the hockey world by sweeping the Red Wings in four games. Steve Rucchin scored the series-winning goal in overtime in Game 4. In the second round, the Ducks faced the Dallas Stars. Game 1 turned out to be the fourth-longest game in NHL history, with [[Petr S\u00fdkora|Petr Sykora]] scoring in the fifth overtime to give the Mighty Ducks the series lead. The Ducks would finish off the Stars in Game 6 at home. In the team's first trip to the Western Conference Finals, they were matched up against another [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella team]], the sixth-seeded, three-year-old [[Minnesota Wild]]. [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] strung together three consecutive shutouts and allowed only one total goal in the series in an eventual sweep.\n\nThe [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals]], to be played against the [[New Jersey Devils]], had some interesting story lines. Anaheim forward [[Rob Niedermayer]] was playing against his brother [[Scott Niedermayer|Scott]], while Giguere faced off against fellow French-Canadian goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]]. The series began with the home team winning the first five games. In Game 6 at home, Kariya was knocked out from a hit by Devils captain [[Scott Stevens]]. However, Kariya would return in the second period and score the fourth goal of the game. In an exciting third period, the Mighty Ducks defeated the Devils 5\u20132 to send the series back to New Jersey for Game 7. Anaheim, however, could not complete their winning streak, as they lost a hard-fought Game 7 to the Devils 3\u20130. For his brilliant play during the post-season, Giguere was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the [[Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) of the playoffs. He became only the fifth player in NHL history to have won the trophy as a member of the losing team. Giguere posted a 15\u20136 record, 7\u20130 in overtime, with a 1.62 [[goals against average]], a .945 [[save percentage]] and a record 168-minute, 27-second shutout streak in overtime.\n\n===Post-Kariya era, Selanne's return and franchise rebrand (2003\u20132007)===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nAfter the season, Kariya promised to bring the Mighty Ducks back to the Stanley Cup Final the following year. However, Kariya left the Ducks in the summer and joined former teammate Teemu Selanne on the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. The [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304 season]] was a season to forget, as Jean-Sebastien Giguere could not repeat his stellar goaltending from the previous year. Even with newcomers [[Sergei Fedorov]] and [[V\u00e1clav Prospal|Vaclav Prospal]], the team finished in 12th place in the standings with a 29\u201335\u201310\u20138 record. Giguere's stats subsequently declined from the previous season, as he only won half the games he did the year before, his goals against average increased from 2.30 to 2.62, his save percentage went down from .914 to .907 and he went from eight shutouts recorded to just three. The team also went from 203 goals to 174.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, as the NHL and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA)'s labor dispute was headed towards a [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|long lockout]], Disney tried to sell the team but received a low offer of US$40&nbsp;million, less than the franchise's original price. In 2005, [[Broadcom Corporation]] co-founder [[Henry Samueli]] of [[Irvine, California]], and his wife Susan bought the Mighty Ducks from The Walt Disney Company for a reported US$75&nbsp;million. The Samuelis pledged to keep the team in Anaheim. [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]], former [[Vancouver Canucks]] general manager and president, was appointed general manager and executive vice-president of the Mighty Ducks on June 20, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ducks-41944-cup-stanley.html |title=Ducks history and fun facts |website=OCRegister.com |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> In January, Samueli announced the team would be renamed as simply the \"Anaheim Ducks\" as of the following season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/name-103201-ducks-team.html |title=Name change set for Mighty Ducks |website=OCRegister.com |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Scott Hannan and Scott Niedermayer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scott Niedermayer]] battles for the puck with [[San Jose Sharks]]' [[Scott Hannan]] in a game during the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]]; signed in the 2005 off-season, he was later named as team captain.]]\nOn August 1, 2005, former [[James Norris Memorial Trophy|Norris Trophy]]-winning defenseman [[Randy Carlyle]] was hired as the seventh head coach in team history. Burke was familiar with Carlyle's coaching ability, as the latter had coached the [[Manitoba Moose]] from 1996 to 2001 (International Hockey League) and 2004\u201305 ([[American Hockey League]]); the Moose had been the Canucks farm club since 2001. Carlyle replaced Mike Babcock, who later signed on to coach Detroit. On August 4, 2005, free agent defenseman Scott Niedermayer signed with the Mighty Ducks to play with his brother Rob; Scott Niedermayer was almost immediately named team captain. On August 22, Teemu Selanne returned to Anaheim after undergoing knee surgery. He led the team in scoring during the season with 40 goals and 50 assists for 90 points. He would also record his 1,000th NHL point on January 30, 2006.\n\nThe [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]] also saw the emergence of rookies [[Ryan Getzlaf]], [[Corey Perry]] and [[Chris Kunitz]] (Kunitz also played for the Ducks in 2003\u201304, but immediately returned to the Mighty Ducks' AHL affiliate, the [[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks]]). On November 15, 2005, Anaheim traded [[Sergei Fedorov]] and a fifth-round draft pick to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in exchange for defenseman [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]] and forward [[Tyler Wright]].\n\nThe Ducks finished the season with a 43\u201327\u201312 record, good enough for 98 points and the sixth seed. The Ducks faced the [[Calgary Flames]] in the Western Conference quarter-finals and forced a seventh game in Calgary, shutting-out the Flames to reach the Conference semi-finals. In an interesting playoffs, all the bottom seeds won in the first round, so the Ducks matched-up against the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. Goaltender [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] shined as the Ducks swept the Avalanche in four-straight games, Bryzgalov breaking Giguere's scoreless streak record from the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs. In the franchise's second Western Conference Finals appearance, they faced the eighth-seeded [[Edmonton Oilers]], a series the Ducks would ultimately lose in five games.\n\n====Stanley Cup champions (2006\u20132007)====\nPrior to the [[2006\u201307 NHL season|2006\u201307 season]], the Ducks adopted a completely new look to go along with their new name; their team colors became black, gold and orange, and the logo of a duck-shaped goalie mask was dropped in favor of the word \"Ducks\", with a webbed foot in place of the \"D\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ducks-40729-orange-team.html |title=O.C. colors Ducks' new look |website=OCRegister.com |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pronger-shooting.jpg|thumb|[[Chris Pronger]] during the [[2006\u201307 NHL season|2006\u201307]] season. The Ducks acquired Pronger during the 2006 off-season, in a trade with the [[Edmonton Oilers]].]]\nThe Ducks traded [[Joffrey Lupul]], [[Ladislav \u0160m\u00edd|Ladislav Smid]] and a first-round draft pick to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for star defenseman [[Chris Pronger]]. With this trade, solid scoring lines, a shut-down line featuring Rob Niedermayer, [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]] and [[Travis Moen]] and an enviable defense, the Ducks were considered by many to be a Stanley Cup favorite. On November 9, 2006, the Ducks defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6\u20130 at [[General Motors Place]] in Vancouver to improve their season record to 12\u20130\u20134. The win set an NHL open era record by remaining undefeated in regulation for the first 16 games of the season, eclipsing the previous mark set by the 1983\u201384 Edmonton Oilers (the record has since been broken by the Chicago Blackhawks' 21\u20130\u20133 start during the [[2012\u201313 NHL season|2012\u201313 season]]). Anaheim were subsequently shut out by the Flames the following game, 3\u20130, ending their streak. On January 16, 2007, the Ducks played in their franchise's 1,000th regular season game, and on March 11, the Ducks recorded their franchise's 1,000th point with a 4\u20132 win over the Canucks, which improved their franchise all-time record to 423\u2013444\u2013155, with 1,001 points. On April 7, the Ducks won their first division title in franchise history when the Canucks defeated the second-place San Jose Sharks in the final game of the season. The Ducks ended the regular season with a 48\u201320\u201314 record and 110 points\u2014both franchise records. Although they had three fewer wins than the [[Nashville Predators]], the Ducks won the second seed in the West by virtue of winning the Pacific Division title as well as the Predators finishing second in the Central Division behind the Detroit Red Wings (the top seed in the West).\n\nThe Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild in the Conference quarter-finals in five games and the Canucks in the semi-finals, also in five games. Once again, the Ducks faced the Detroit Red Wings in the franchise's third trip to the Western Conference Finals. In Game 3, Chris Pronger elbowed [[Tomas Holmstr\u00f6m|Tomas Holmstrom]] and subsequently received a one-game suspension for the illegal check. However, the Ducks won Game 4 without Pronger and Game 5 in Detroit, with Teemu Selanne scoring the latter game's overtime winner. The Ducks then finished off the Red Wings in Game 6 to advance to their second-ever Stanley Cup Final appearance.\n\n[[File:Stanley Cup Ducks and Bush.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] is presented with a Ducks jersey during a White House ceremony in honor of the team's championship season.]]\nIn the [[2007 Stanley Cup Finals|Finals]], the Ducks won the first two games at home against the [[Ottawa Senators]]. However, the Ducks lost Game 3 and Pronger received his second one-game suspension, this time for elbowing [[Dean McAmmond]]. The Ducks were again able to win without Pronger, defeating the Senators in Game 4 for an opportunity to win the Stanley Cup on home ice in Game 5. On June 6, the Ducks defeated the Senators 6\u20132 at Honda Center to claim their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Travis Moen was credited with the Cup game-winning goal. Scott Niedermayer, the only player on the team who had previously won a Stanley Cup, was awarded the second [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] in Ducks history. The Ducks became the first California team, and the fourth [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] team since the [[1915 Stanley Cup Finals|1915]] [[Vancouver Millionaires]], [[1917 Stanley Cup Finals|1917]] [[Seattle Metropolitans]] and [[1925 Stanley Cup Finals|1925]] [[Victoria Cougars]], to win the Stanley Cup.\n\n===Post-Stanley Cup, Bob Murray replaces Burke (2007\u20132010)===\nThe Ducks began their title defense in the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]] without two fan favorites, Scott Niedermayer and Teemu Selanne, who were both contemplating retirement. To offset those losses, Burke signed forward [[Todd Bertuzzi]] and defenseman [[Mathieu Schneider]]. During the season, Burke put goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov on waivers, where he was picked-up by the Phoenix Coyotes. Free agent signee [[Jonas Hiller]] then became the back-up to starter Jean-Sebastien Giguere. Both Selanne and Niedermayer would ultimately return and the team finished with a 47\u201327\u20138 record, good enough to earn home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs finishing as the fourth seed in the Western Conference. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in six games by the Dallas Stars. In the off-season, Burke bought-out the remaining year on Todd Bertuzzi's contract and traded Mathieu Schneider to the [[Atlanta Thrashers]].\n\n[[File:Henrik Sedin Saku Koivu faceoff.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Saku Koivu]] of the Ducks, and [[Henrik Sedin]] of the [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[face-off]] during a game in the [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310]] season. The Ducks signed Koivu during the 2009 off-season.]] \nAfter an extremely slow start to the [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309 season]], on November 12, 2008, Burke resigned to take the same position for the Toronto Maple Leafs. [[Bob Murray (ice hockey, born 1954)|Bob Murray]] replaced him as general manager, but the team struggled to make the playoffs as the eighth seed in the Western Conference. A bevy of trade deadline deals saw the departure of some mainstays from the Cup team, including Chris Kunitz, who was traded to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] for defenseman [[Ryan Whitney]]; Samuel Pahlsson, who was traded to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for defenseman [[James Wisniewski]]; and Travis Moen, who was traded to the San Jose Sharks for two prospects. The trades gave the Ducks new life as a hot streak to end the season launched the team into the playoffs. Jonas Hiller emerged as the new number one goalie during the stretch drive. The Ducks defeated the number one seed and [[Presidents' Trophy]]-winning San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round before being eliminated in the conference semi-finals by the eventual Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings in seven games. Before the [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310 season]], the Ducks traded Chris Pronger to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] for Joffrey Lupul, [[Luca Sbisa]] and two first-round draft picks. Francois Beauchemin and Rob Niedermayer also left via free agency for the Toronto Maple Leafs and [[New Jersey Devils]], respectively. The Ducks then signed free agent center and former [[Montreal Canadiens]] captain [[Saku Koivu]] to a one-year deal.\n\nAnother slow start would doom the Ducks. Before the trade deadline, the Ducks traded Giguere to the Toronto Maple Leafs for [[Jason Blake (ice hockey)|Jason Blake]] and [[Vesa Toskala]] after signing Hiller to a contract extension. The trade deadline saw the Ducks trade Ryan Whitney to Edmonton for offensive defenseman [[\u013dubom\u00edr Vi\u0161\u0148ovsk\u00fd|Lubomir Visnovsky]], as well as the acquisitions of defenseman [[Aaron Ward (ice hockey)|Aaron Ward]] from the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and goalie [[Curtis McElhinney]] from the Calgary Flames. The Ducks played through frequent injuries and picked up play in the second half of the season, but struggled coming out of the Olympic break. For the first time since the lockout, the Ducks failed to make the playoffs with a 39\u201332\u201311 record. The 2010 off-season was also busy for the Ducks, as Scott Niedermayer announced his retirement in a June press conference. Niedermayer decided to stay a member of the Ducks as a team consultant. The Ducks resigned Saku Koivu for two years and signed free agent defenseman [[Toni Lydman]] to a three-year contract. In addition to Lydman, the Ducks were able to get defenseman [[Cam Fowler]] via the draft, and 35-year-old strong-willed defenseman [[Andy Sutton]] signed to a two-year deal. Restricted free agent [[Bobby Ryan]] was signed to a five-year deal.\n\n===Getzlaf and Perry era (2010\u2013present)===\n[[File:Ryan Getzlaf Ducks 2012-02-15.JPG|thumb|Ryan Getzlaf is the current team captain of the Ducks. Drafted by the team in 2003, he was named team captain in 2010.]]\nThe 2010\u201311 season did not begin well for the Ducks, who would lose their first three games. They maintained a .500 throughout record through the first half of the season, but would find their rhythm and finish 47\u201330\u20135, good for 99 points and fourth place in the Western Conference. Corey Perry and Jonas Hiller represented the Ducks at the All-Star Game, and Corey Perry went on to have a 50-goal, 98-point season, which won him the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]] and [[Hart Memorial Trophy]]. He became the first-ever Duck to win the Hart, as well as the first Richard winner as a Duck since Teemu Selanne won the award in 1999. However, Hiller was injured at the All-Star Game and missed the rest of the season. Even though the Ducks had a great season led by Perry, Hiller, Selanne, Visnovsky and Getzlaf, they would end up losing in the first round of the [[2011 Stanley Cup playoffs|2011 playoffs]] to the fifth-seeded Nashville Predators.\n\nBefore the [[2011\u201312 NHL season|2011\u201312 season]] began, the team mourned the loss of former Mighty Duck [[Ruslan Salei]], who died in a plane crash with several other former NHL players of [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) club [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl]]. The team wore a black patch with his former jersey number, 24, in current team numbering. The Ducks started the season with NHL Premiere games in [[Helsinki]] and [[Stockholm]]. This was the third time in franchise history that they started the regular season with games in Europe. They lost 4\u20131 to the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in Helsinki but defeated the [[New York Rangers]] 2\u20131 after a shootout in Stockholm. After a slow start to the season, the Ducks replaced head coach Randy Carlyle with former Washington Capitals head coach [[Bruce Boudreau]]. The rest of the season was mostly forgettable, as the Ducks could not get out of the hole they dug themselves in the first half of the season, and ultimately failed to reach the playoffs in the 2011\u201312 season.\n[[File:Bruce Boudreau Ducks 2012-02-15.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bruce Boudreau was the head coach of the Ducks from 2011 to 2016. He coached the team to four consecutive division titles.]]\nThe [[2012\u201313 NHL season|2012\u201313 season]] was shortened to 48 games due to a [[2012\u201313 NHL lockout|labor lockout]]. When play resumed in January 2013 after a new [[collective bargaining agreement]] was signed, the Ducks opened the season by sweeping a two-game Canadian road trip with a decisive 7\u20133 victory against the Vancouver Canucks on January 19, followed by a 5\u20134 decision against the Calgary Flames on January 21. Their home opener came on January 25, also against the Canucks, who would prevail 5\u20130. The distinction of the Ducks' longest homestand was split between two five-game stretches from March 18\u201325 and from April 3\u201310. Anaheim's lengthiest road trip was a six-game haul from February 6\u201316. Due to the shortened season and the compacted game scheduling, all games were to be played against the Ducks' own Western Conference opponents, and no games were played against Eastern Conference teams. The Ducks finished the season with a 30\u201312\u20136 record and would win their second Pacific Division title in franchise history. In the Western Conference quarter-finals, they ended up losing to the seventh-seeded Detroit Red Wings in seven games, despite holding a 3\u20132 series lead after Game 5.\n\nEntering the [[2013\u201314 NHL season|2013\u201314 season]], the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it was announced that Teemu Selanne would be playing in his final NHL season.

At one point of the season, the Ducks won 18 of 19 games, the longest run of one-loss play in the NHL for 45 years. A 9\u20131 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on January 15 saw Anaheim establish a 20\u20130\u20132 record at the Honda Center, which matched the longest season-opening home points streak in 34 years, as well as setting a franchise-record for goals scored in a game (9), and powerplay goals scored in a game (6).<ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Beacham |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/ducks-soar-top-nhl-18-231839316--nhl.html |title=Ducks soar to top of NHL with 18 wins in 19 games |publisher=Yahoo! |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> Dustin Penner was eventually traded to the Washington Capitals, and prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Ducks acquired veteran defenseman [[St\u00e9phane Robidas|Stephane Robidas]] from the Dallas Stars.

The Ducks secured a second consecutive Pacific Division title and the number one seed in the Western Conference. Anaheim faced the eighth-seeded Dallas Stars in the Western Conference quarter-finals and were victorious in six games, marking the first time since 2009 that the Ducks had won a playoff series. In the Western Conference semi-finals, the Ducks faced their geographic rival and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings for the first time ever in the playoffs. In a hotly contested series, the Ducks ultimately went down in seven games to their Southern Californian rivals, losing Game 7 by a score of 6\u20132 at the Honda Center.\n\nOn June 27, 2014, the Ducks acquired center [[Ryan Kesler]] and a third-round pick in [[2015 NHL Entry Draft|2015]] from the Vancouver Canucks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ducks|first1=Anaheim|title=Ducks Acquire Ryan Kesler|url=http://ducks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=724111|publisher=Anaheim Ducks | date = June 27, 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref> In the following season, they would win their third-straight Pacific Division title and finish as the top seed in the West with 109 points.

In 2019, the Ducks fired Carlyle and replaced him with Bob Murray as interim, however the Ducks missed the playoffs.\n\n==Team information==\n===Name===\nFounded in 1993, the then-called Mighty Ducks of Anaheim were directly named for ''[[The Mighty Ducks (film series)|The Mighty Ducks]]'' movies. When [[The Walt Disney Company]], which produced the movies and owned the NHL team, sold the team in 2005, the name was shortened to its current state, \"Anaheim Ducks.\"<ref name=LV />\n\n===Uniforms===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MightyDucksJerseys.png|thumb|275px|The inaugural Mighty Ducks of Anaheim jerseys used from 1993 to 2006. The jerseys shown above feature shoulder patches that were used from 1996 to 2006.]] -->\nThe Ducks have officially worn three unique regular jerseys and five unique third jerseys in their franchise history. The original jerseys of the Ducks (then the Mighty Ducks) used jade green, purple, white and grey as primary colors for both the home and away jerseys. The team's dark jerseys were dominantly purple in color with diagonal gray and white stripes; the jersey is jade green below the stripes, which appear on the arms and waist, and the collar was jade and white. The white jerseys were similar, except that the purple is replaced mainly with white and the collar is completely purple in color. In 1996, shoulder patches were added to both jerseys featuring a forward-facing version of the main logo's \"duck mask\", surrounded by a circle reading \"Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\". The hockey pants also had a jade stripe on the sides that was eliminated after the Ducks' 2003 Stanley Cup run and heading into the 2003\u201304 season.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Anaheimducksjerseys.png|thumb|275px|Anaheim Ducks jerseys used during the 2006\u201307 season.

Burke sought inspiration for the jersey from the [[United States Military Academy]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} ending up with diagonal gold, white, black and orange stripes down the arms and waist with the word \"Ducks\" on the front. The jersey is similar to the team's most recent third jersey prior to the name change. The orange pays tribute to [[Orange County, California|Orange County]],<ref name=orangecolor>Anaheim Ducks.

Page 41.</ref> where Anaheim is located.\n\nFor the 2007\u201308 NHL season, the Ducks, like all NHL teams, changed over to new [[Reebok]] Edge jerseys. The new team jersey shows only minor modifications from the 2006\u201307 season's jerseys, including a small NHL crest just below the neck, and a smaller ducks logo on the chest. After the first year of the Edge uniform system being in place, the Ducks increased the size of their logo. The Ducks would use these uniforms as their primary uniforms until the 2013\u201314 season.\n\nOn June 27, 2014, the Ducks unveiled their new uniforms that were based on the 2010\u20132014 alternate jerseys. Changes to the collar and number font were included.\n\n====Alternate uniforms====\nThe [[third jersey]]s of the Ducks were created in 1995, 1997, 2003, 2010, 2015, 2018 and 2019. The 1995 jersey was jade green with purple and white stripes on the collar and on the end of the sleeves. The logo was of team mascot Wildwing wearing a Mighty Ducks jersey while breaking through a sheet of ice. The jersey was short-lived; as severe criticism encouraged management to retire the jersey at the end of the 1995\u201396 season.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DucksAlternate.svg|left|thumb|150px|Ducks alternate logo (2010\u2013present). This is currently used as a patch on the Ducks' home and away jerseys and features the original Mighty Ducks logo.]]  -->The 1997 third jersey came with a rare fourth jersey partner. The third was a jade green-colored jersey with silver and purple stripes at the shoulders outlined in thin yellow, and a silver stripe at the bottom. It had the Mighty Ducks logo in the center of the chest. The fourth jersey was much like it. It was white with jade green, purple, and silver stripes at the shoulders of the jersey, but no bottom stripe. The eggplant pants were also briefly shelved in favor of black pants. These jerseys saw action until the end of [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]], when they stopped playing with their third jerseys, and used only the fourth (the eggplant pants were also restored). At the end of [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]], the fourth was also retired.\n\nThe 2003 third jersey was black with purple and gray stripes at the waist and on the sleeves. It had the alternate script logo of the present Mighty Ducks and old-style laces at the neck, as well as a shoulder patch displaying an interlocking \"MD\" (for \"Mighty Ducks\"). The popularity of this jersey amongst fans was so great it replaced the purple and jade jersey, serving as the home jersey for the last half of the 2005\u201306 season and playoffs. It was dropped following the season as the team went to a modified name, new uniforms, and color scheme; however, this popular jersey influenced the design of the new jerseys for 2006\u201307. It was the only time in the modern NHL days when a mainly black jersey was not worn with black pants; instead, the pants were purple.\n\nThe 2010 third jersey was officially unveiled on November 26, 2010, against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], the day after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The jersey features the webbed \"D\" on the chest with the recolored Mighty Ducks logo on each shoulder. It features striping similar to the regular uniforms, and orange is much more prominent as a secondary color. In June 2014, the third jersey was made as the Ducks' primary home jersey, alongside a white one in the same style for away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ducks.blog.ocregister.com/2010/06/11/ducks-to-wear-third-jerseys-in-2010-11/37839 |title=Ducks to wear third jerseys in 2010-11 |website=OCRegister.com |accessdate=2016-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614221137/http://ducks.blog.ocregister.com/2010/06/11/ducks-to-wear-third-jerseys-in-2010-11/37839/ |archive-date=June 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 2015, the Ducks unveiled a brand new, orange third jersey when they went up against the Colorado Avalanche.

This jersey is primarily orange with black lettering and numbers. The chromed Ducks logo, designed for the Stadium Series, is on the chest. There are gold, black and white stripes on the sleeves as well as black trim around the bottom and sleeves. The jersey has old fashion black lace on the neck and also has a unique \"OC\" logo on the left shoulder to represent Orange County where the Ducks are from.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ducks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=694168 |title=Ducks Unveil 2014 Coors Light Stadium Series\u2122 Jersey for Dodger Stadium Contest on Jan. 25 vs. Kings \u2013 Anaheim Ducks |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Ducks announced for their 25th anniversary season of 2018\u201319 the adoption of a new third jersey that features the franchise's original colors of eggplant and jade.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ducks reveal quacktastic third jersey for home opener|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/anaheim-ducks-reveal-25th-anniversary-home-opener-third-jersey/c-299549712|website=NHL.com|date=July 21, 2018|access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> The uniform was only used for that particular season, after which the Ducks returned to the orange thirds last used from 2015\u201317.\n\nTheir 2019-20 season third jersey was officially announced September 2019 and debuted in their [https://www.nhl.com/ducks/info/third-jersey-schedule October 5, 2019 game against San Jose].

The text itself is gold (which sometimes may appear as bronze as well) with orange and black accents (forming a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] appearance). The entire logo is in turn outlined by silver. This is shortened from a prior version that spelled out the word \"Ducks\" in all capital letters.\n\nThe old logo of the Ducks prior to the name change featured an old-style goaltender mask, shaped to form the appearance of a duck bill. Behind the mask are two intersecting hockey sticks, a black hockey puck, and a triangle; the color of the triangle was either green or gray, depending on how the logo is used. This is now used on a shoulder patch of the current uniforms, with the triangle in orange.\n\n===Mascot===\nThe official mascot for the Anaheim Ducks is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] duck by the name of Wild Wing. He has been the team's mascot since its inaugural season, and his name was chosen through fan voting. He wears a Ducks jersey with the number 93 on the back, referring to the year the Ducks became an NHL team.\n[[File:'Johnny Five' keeps 9th CST members out of hot zone, Cal Guard pilot program tests robot for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear response 151111-A-AB123-002.jpg|thumb|left|Wild Wing with members of the [[California National Guard]] prior to the [[ceremonial first puck]].]]\nHe regularly descends from the rafters of the arena when making his in-game entrances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anaheimducks.com/fanzone/wing.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617080118/http://www.anaheimducks.com/fanzone/wing.php |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> In one such descent the rigging that lowered Wild Wing from the rafters malfunctioned leaving the mascot trapped fifty feet above the ice for several minutes.

When construction was completed and the Grand Terrace opened in October 2013, the statue was noticeably absent.\n\nThe mascot's name was also used for the leader of the Ducks, Wildwing Flashblade, in Disney's [[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|Mighty Ducks]] cartoon series.\n\nDuring the same time in which the team announced a name change as well as change in jersey designs, there was an attempt by the team's owners to change or replace the mascot, Wild Wing, but was halted after a highly successful petition by fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThe Mighty Ducks also used a secondary \"mascot\", a person (with no particular costume) called \"The Iceman\", during the team's first game in 1993. \"The Iceman\" appeared occasionally in the stands, played an electric guitar, and attempted to liven up the crowd. However, \"The Iceman\" was poorly received by fans and was quickly eliminated as the Ducks lost to the Red Wings in their inaugural game, 7-2.\n\n===Rivalries===\nThe Ducks have two rivalries with two teams out of geographical proximity. The [[Freeway Face-Off]] with the [[Los Angeles Kings]] as both teams arenas are accessible via [[Interstate 5 in California]] and the fact that both teams are within the [[Greater Los Angeles area|greater Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. The Ducks also have a rivalry with the [[San Jose Sharks]].

The most famous ones are the \"Eskimo\", \"Avalanche\", \"Ice Rink\" and \"Snowman\". These led to a solo record deal with [[XL Recordings]].

However, the 'Kat' is never officially used by Wiley anymore, only being mentioned loosely in some of his songs.\n\nIn 2006, Wiley released his second album ''Da 2nd Phaze'' on the Boy Better Know label. The album consists of 20 tracks that have been put together by Wiley from the past three years, including exclusive bonus tracks from Gods Gift, Alex Mills and More Fire Crew, which is believed to signal the end of the Wiley-Lethal feud.\n\nThis was followed in by Wiley's third album ''[[Playtime Is Over (Wiley album)|Playtime is Over]]'' on [[Big Dada Records]], an album which followed his eskibeat roots. Wiley's eskibeat and solo material is managed by the Perpetuity Music Group.

It consists of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights, plus other organic compounds. It is generally accepted that oil is formed mostly from the carbon rich remains of ancient plankton after exposure to heat and pressure in [[Earth]]'s crust over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the decayed residue was covered by layers of mud and silt, sinking further down into Earth\u2019s crust and preserved there between hot and pressured layers, gradually transforming into oil reservoirs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781439873908|title=The Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum, Fifth Edition|last=Speight|first=James|date=2014-01-30|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439873892|series=Chemical Industries|language=en|doi=10.1201/b16559}}</ref>\n\n===Early history===\n[[Petroleum]] in an unrefined state has been utilized by humans for over 5000 years.

Even though the [[Industrial Revolution]] generated an increasing need for energy, this was initially met mainly by coal, and from other sources including whale oil. However, when it was discovered that [[kerosene]] could be extracted from [[crude oil]] and used as a lighting and heating fuel, the demand for petroleum increased greatly, and by the early twentieth century had become the most valuable commodity traded on world markets.<ref name=\"Halliday\">Halliday, Fred.

Cutting off the oil supply considerably weakened Japan in the latter part of the war. After [[World War II]] ended, the countries of the [[Middle East]] took the lead in oil production from the United States. Important developments since World War II include deep-water drilling, the introduction of the [[Drillship]], and the growth of a global shipping network for petroleum relying upon oil tankers and pipelines. In 1949, first offshore oil drilling at Oil Rocks (Neft Dashlari) in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan eventually resulted in a city built on pylons. In the 1960s and 1970s, multi-governmental organizations of oil\u2013producing nations [[OPEC]] and [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries|OAPEC]] played a major role in setting petroleum prices and policy. [[Oil spill]]s and their cleanup have become an issue of increasing political, environmental, and economic importance.\n\nWith the advent of hydraulic fracturing and other horizontal drilling techniques, shale play has seen an enormous uptick in production.

Rail and truck can also be used for longer distances but are most cost-effective for shorter routes.\n* Storage: Midstream service providers provide storage facilities at [[Oil depot|terminals]] throughout the oil and gas distribution systems. These facilities are most often located near refining and processing facilities and are connected to pipeline systems to facilitate shipment when product demand must be met. While petroleum products are held in storage tanks, natural gas tends to be stored in underground facilities, such as salt dome caverns and depleted reservoirs.\n* Technological applications: Midstream service providers apply technological solutions to improve efficiency during midstream processes. Technology can be used during compression of fuels to ease flow through pipelines; to better detect [[Leak detection|leaks in pipelines]]; and to automate communications for better pipeline and equipment monitoring.\n\nWhile some upstream companies carry out certain midstream operations, the midstream sector is dominated by a number of companies that specialize in these services.

However, when it was discovered that [[kerosene]] could be extracted from [[crude oil]] and used as a lighting and heating fuel, the demand for petroleum increased greatly, and by the early twentieth century had become the most valuable commodity traded on world markets.<ref name=\"Halliday\">Halliday, Fred.

Cutting off the oil supply considerably weakened Japan in the latter part of the war. After [[World War II]] ended, the countries of the [[Middle East]] took the lead in oil production from the United States. Important developments since World War II include deep-water drilling, the introduction of the [[Drillship]], and the growth of a global shipping network for petroleum relying upon oil tankers and pipelines. In 1949, first offshore oil drilling at Oil Rocks (Neft Dashlari) in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan eventually resulted in a city built on pylons. In the 1960s and 1970s, multi-governmental organizations of oil\u2013producing nations [[OPEC]] and [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries|OAPEC]] played a major role in setting petroleum prices and policy. [[Oil spill]]s and their cleanup have become an issue of increasing political, environmental, and economic importance.\n\nWith the advent of hydraulic fracturing and other horizontal drilling techniques, shale play has seen an enormous uptick in production.

Already in 1959, at a symposium organised by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] for the centennial of the [[American oil industry]], the [[physicist]] [[Edward Teller]] warned then of the danger of global [[climate change]].<ref name=Franta/> Edward Teller explained that carbon dioxide \"in the atmosphere causes a [[greenhouse effect]]\" and that burning more [[fossil fuels]] could \"melt the icecap and submerge New York\".<ref name=Franta>Benjamin Franta, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/01/on-its-hundredth-birthday-in-1959-edward-teller-warned-the-oil-industry-about-global-warming \"On its 100th birthday in 1959, Edward Teller warned the oil industry about global warming\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 January 2018 (page visited on 2 January 2018).</ref>\n\nThe [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], founded by the [[United Nations]] in 1988, concludes that [[Human impact on the environment|human-sourced]] [[greenhouse gases]] are [[Attribution of recent climate change|responsible]] for most of the [[Instrumental temperature record|observed temperature increase]] since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nAs a result of climate change concerns, many alternative energy enthusiasts have begun using other methods of energy such as solar and wind, among others. This recent view has some petroleum enthusiasts skeptic about the true future of the industry. <ref>{{Cite book|date=2016|editor-last=Mart\u00edn|editor-first=Mariano|title=Alternative Energy Sources and Technologies|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-28752-2|isbn=978-3-319-28750-8}}</ref>\n\n== Future shortages ==\n\nAs petroleum is a [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable natural resource]] the industry is faced with an inevitable eventual depletion of the world's oil supply. The BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2007 listed the [[reserves-to-production ratio|reserve/production ratio]] for proven resources worldwide. This study indicated a ratio of proven reserves to production in the Middle East at 79.5 years, Latin America at 41.2 years and North America at 12 years. A misguided interpretation of the ratio has led to many false predictions of imminent world oil shortages since the early years of the oil industry in the 1800s. This has been especially true in the United States, where the ratio of proved reserves-to-production has been between 8 years and 17 years since 1920. Many have mistakenly interpreted the result as the number of years before the [[oil depletion|oil supply is exhausted]]. Such analyses do not take into account future [[Oil reserves#Reserves growth|reserves growth]].<ref>{{cite book\n |author      = Deffeyes, Kenneth S.\n |title       = Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage\n |publisher   = Princeton University press\n |year        = 2001\n |pages       = 1\u201313\n |url         = http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8845.html\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100703000000/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8845.html\n |archivedate = 2010-07-03\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hubbert peak theory]], which introduced the concept of [[peak oil]], questions the sustainability of oil production. It suggests that after a peak in oil production rates, a period of [[oil depletion]] will ensue. Since virtually all economic sectors rely heavily on petroleum, peak oil could lead to a partial or complete failure of markets.<ref>\"[http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/study-warns-of-perilous-oil-crisis/?scp=1&sq=peak%20oil&st=cse German Military Braces for Scarcity After \u2018Peak Oil\u2019]\".

However output levels are low, and these fuels will not displace local oil production. More than 90% of the ethanol used in the US is blended with gasoline to produce a 10% ethanol mix, lifting the oxygen content of the fuel.<ref>IBISWorld. \"US Oil Drilling Industry Market Research Report.\" http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=103&chid=10 Retrieved 14 May 2008</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n;Industry pioneers\n* [[Faustino Piaggio]], an early oil industry pioneer\n\n;Oil production\n*[[Oil peak]]\n* [[Oil terminal]]\n* [[Oil supplies]]\n* [[Integrated operations]]\n* [[Instrumentation in petrochemical industries]]\n* [[Standardization in oil industry]]\n* [[List of crude oil products]]\n\n;Financial and political\n* [[List of oil exploration and production companies]]\n* [[List of largest oil and gas companies by revenue]]\n* [[Chronology of world oil market events (1970\u20132005)]]\n* [[Energy crisis]]: [[1973 oil crisis]], [[1979 energy crisis]]\n* [[Energy development]]\n* [[Petroleum politics]]\n* [[Oil imperialism theories]]\n* [[World oil market chronology from 2003]]\n* [[Oil-storage trade]]\n* [[Oil and gas law in the United States]]\n* [[Fossil fuels lobby]]\n\n;Environmental issues\n* [[Environmental impact of the petroleum industry]]\n* [[Greenhouse gas]]es\n* [[Routine flaring]]\n* [[Oil spill]]s\n\n;Oil geology\n* [[Abiogenic petroleum origin]]\n* [[Fossil fuel]]\n* [[Oil sands]]\n* [[Petroleum geology]]\n* [[Thermal depolymerization]]\n\n;Oil-producing areas\n* [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada]]\n* [[History of the petroleum industry in the United States]]\n* [[List of oil fields]]\n* [[Oil megaprojects]]\n* [[List of countries by oil production]]\n* [[Oil industry in Azerbaijan]]\n\n;Industry Research Projects\n* [[TaskForceMajella]]\n\n;Other articles\n* {{intitle|oil industry}}\n* {{intitle|petroleum industry}}\n* {{intitle|gas industry}}\n\n}}\n\n== Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |author1=Mau, Mark |author2=Edmundson, Henry | title=Groundbreakers: the Story of Oilfield Technology and the People Who Made It Happen| publisher=FastPrint | year=2015 | location=UK| isbn=978-178456-187-1}}\n* Nevins, Alan.
