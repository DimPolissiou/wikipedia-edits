The 2nd Massachusetts was commanded by [[Colonel]] [[George H. Gordon]], a West Point graduate (Class of 1846),<ref name=\"mcwc\">http://www.mycivilwar.com/regiments/usa-ma/ma_inf_reg_02.htm</ref> along with Lieutenant Colonel [[George Leonard Andrews]], also a West Point graduate (Class of 1851), and Major [[Wilder Dwight]]. On July 8, the regiment left for [[Maryland]] where it joined the forces under General [[Robert Patterson]].\n\nIn 1861, the regiment served guarding the upper [[Potomac River]] and [[Frederick, Maryland]], and in the spring of 1862, the regiment served under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], unsuccessfully opposing Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson]] in the [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Shenandoah Valley]]. In June, the regiment was transferred to the Union [[Army of Virginia]] and participated in General Pope\"s [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. During this time, Colonel Gordon was promoted to brigadier general and commanded the brigade. Lieutenant Colonel Andrews was promoted to colonel and given command of the 2nd Massachusetts. Major Dwight was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n\n==Battle of Antietam, and early 1863==\nIn August, the regiment became part of the 3rd Brigade (commanded by Gordon), 1st Division (commanded by Major General [[Alpheus S. Williams]]), II Corps (commanded by Banks), of [[Major General (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] [[Army of Virginia]].

During the Battle of Antietam, the XII Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph K. Mansfield]] supported General [[Joseph Hooker]]'s advanced through the cornfield during the morning phase of the battle and received heavy casualties including Lieutenant Colonel Dwight, who was mortally wounded.

Mudge, replied to the order to attack, \"Well it is murder, but it's the order.\" In the charge a bullet struck Mudge just below the throat and killed him instantly.<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5846617</ref> The regiment suffered 137 casualties in the assault. After the battle, the regiment was sent to [[New York City]] to help end the [[Draft Riots]] that were going on.<ref name=\"mcwc\" /> Cpt. [[Charles Fessenden Morse]] of Company B was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n\n==Atlanta==\nLate in 1863, the XII Corps, with the 2nd Massachusetts included, along with the [[XI Corps (United States)|XI Corps]] was placed under the command of General [[Joseph Hooker]] and sent west to join the [[Army of the Cumberland]]. Hooker's two Corps played a decisive role in the [[Battle of Wauhatchie]], which opened up the \"Cracker Line\" to the besieged Union army, and seized [[Lookout Mountain]] in the famed \"Battle Above The Clouds\" during the early stages of the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Battle of Chattanooga]]. In 1864, it participated in General [[William T. Sherman]]'s [[Atlanta Campaign]].  Later, the XI Corps and XII Corps were combined to form the [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX Corps]]. It participated in the [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain]], The [[Battle of Peachtree Creek]] and the [[Siege of Atlanta]]. In September, it was part of the forces the occupied Atlanta, with Lt. Col. Morse serving as [[provost marshal]] of the city.\n\n==March to the sea==\nIn November, the 2nd Massachusetts was part of [[Sherman's March to the Sea]].

He caught a beautiful fish. It told him to cook it and then give two pieces to his wife, and bury two more in the garden. He did this. His wife gave birth to twin boys, and two plants sprang up, bearing shields, in the garden.\n\nWhen the boys were grown, they decided to travel. At a crossroad, they parted ways. One found a city grieving, because every year a maiden had to be offered up to a dragon, and this year the lot had fallen on the princess. He went to see where the princess was, and then left her to fetch a mirror. He told her to cover it with her veil and hide behind it; when the dragon approached, she was to tear the veil off. She did, and the dragon stared at his rival, identical to him.  He threatened it until he finally smashed it to pieces, but as every fragment reflected him, he thought he too had been smashed. While it was still baffled, the knight killed it. The king married him to his daughter.\n\nThe princess showed him all over the castle, and he saw a castle of black marble, and was warned that whoever went to it never returned. He set out the next day. When he blew his horn and struck the gate, a woman finally opened the door. Echoes warned him off. He lifted his helmet, and the woman, who was an evil witch, let him in because he was so handsome. She told him that he would marry her, and he refused. The witch showed him over the castle and killed him by dropping him through a [[trapdoor]].\n\nHis brother came to the city, and was taken for him. He kept quiet, so he could help his brother, and told the princess that he had to go back to the castle. He demanded to know what happened to his brother, and the echoes told him. When he met the witch, he quickly stabbed her with his sword, and then she asked him to save her life with magical plants from the garden. He found the bodies of his brother and all her other victims, whom he restored with that magic, and also a cave full of the maidens killed by the dragon, whom he also restored. After they all escaped, the witch died and her castle fell.\n\n==Motifs==\nThe motif of the demand for sacrifice of youngsters of either sex happens in the [[Greece|Greek]] myth of [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]].<ref>Schmidt, Bernhard.

The [[World Health Organization]] says that jurisdictions should aim to test every suspected case of COVID-19<ref name=\"auto1\"> {{Cite web| url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331509/WHO-COVID-19-lab_testing-2020.1-eng.pdf| title=Laboratory testing strategy recommendations for COVID-19, Interim Guidance 21 March 2020}}</ref>. Before beginning to reopen the economy, researchers have advised the United States to aim for 152 tests per 100,000 people each day <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html| first=Keith |last=Collins |title=Coronavirus Testing Needs to Triple Before the U.S. Can Reopen, Experts Say| date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>. In late April, Ontario was testing just under 10,000 people per day, equal to a testing rate of about 70 tests per 100,000 people per day.\n \n=== Types of tests ===\n==== Virus-RNA tests ====\nAs of April 2020, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in Ontario is conducted using a method called [[RT-PCR]]. A carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres across Ontario. At the centres, highly-skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test mixes the sample with a test kit containing chemicals designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between two temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nIn early April, Ontario has contracted Spartan Bioscience Inc. from Ottawa to supply it with virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/13/ontario-orders-close-to-one-million-spartan-bioscience-portable-covid-19-test-kits.html|title=Ontario orders close to one million Spartan Bioscience portable COVID-19 test kits}} </ref>. The contract was for 900,000 swab test kits, whereas the number of machines has not been disclosed. While these machines cannot process many samples in total, they have the advantage of being small and easy to use. Thus, they can be used to provide rapid results at the point-of-care. They are expected to be useful at border crossings, isolated communities, prisons, and care homes.\n\n==== Serology tests ====\nOntario is performing experiments testing the performance of blood tests that look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref> {{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/20/covid-19-community-spread-in-ontario-has-likely-reached-its-peak-new-modelling-shows/|title=COVID-19 community spread in Ontario has likely reached its peak, new modelling shows}}</ref>. Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection. However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.\n\n=== Testing facilities ===\n\nPublic Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent. The main laboratory is the top four floors of the MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto <ref> {{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/canada/2020/04/10/a-virtual-tour-of-a-public-health-ontario-lab-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing.html?fbclid=IwAR09umcjbDihhlDeBgrtnnU9lD5ts73VIcN0N6_55XSC4Cwv5M6Nb0QAREU| title=A virtual tour of a Public Health Ontario lab ramping up its COVID-19 testing}} </ref>.

In addition to the six public health labs, this includes 10 hospital networks and three private lab networks, including Dynacare and LifeLabs <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/04/how-ontario-turned-the-tide-on-a-huge-backlog-of-covid-19-tests.html|title=How Ontario turned the tide on a huge backlog of COVID-19 tests}}</ref>.\n\n=== Testing Access ===\nAccess to testing is set by Public Health Ontario who publishes a guidance document that defines the conditions for an individual to be tested <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_covid_testing_guidance.pdf|title=Ontario Public Health 2019 COVID testing guidance}}</ref>. Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.  The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw| title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada |first=Emily |last=Chung |date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>. Starting in March, various public health units across the province have opened assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional. This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices. If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing. Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at longterm care homes.\n\nSince many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be a factor of 20 to 100 higher \n<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stay-home-covid-19-spreading-in-community-100s-could-be-infected-says-ottawas-medical-officer-of-health/|title=STAY HOME: COVID-19 spreading in the community, 100s could be infected, says Ottawa's medical officer of health}}</ref>. Unlike some countries, the number of suspected or probable infections is not reported by the Ontario government.\n\n=== Testing Performance ===\nThe bar chart to the right shows the number of tests performed per day, the daily backlog, and the percentage of positive tests in Ontario for March and April 2020. The WHO advises to test every suspected case. Positive test rates above 10% indicate that the testing is too targeted and the number of test-confirmed cases will not accurately indicate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population. This 10% limit was exceeded on multiple days in early April. Since a relatively limited number of cases are tested, the actual number of cases will be much higher than the test-confirmed numbers.\n\n[[File:COVID-19 Ontario Testing Rates.png|thumb|The COVID-19 testing rates in Ontario from March to April 2020, Source:[https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario|data.ontario.ca]]] \n\nIn late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crawley |first1=Mike |title=Wait list for COVID-19 test results balloons to 11,000 in Ontario |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-test-ontario-waiting-lab-results-coronavirus-1.5510644 |website=CBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw|title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada|work=CBC|first=Emily |last=Chung}} </ref> but had high testing numbers compared to most western countries (see [[Template:COVID-19 testing by country subdivision]]).\n\nOn April 15, polling firms, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research, released results of a survey conducted on April 11 and 12 about COVID-19 prevalence and testing.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/one-fifth-of-ontario-households-have-one-or-more-symptoms-of-covid-19/ |title= COVID-19 Symptom Study - Ontario}}</ref> Of the 5,045 respondents, 19% of households contained someone who had at least one symptom and in 8% of households someone had a key symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n=== Testing Capacity ===\nSince January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR. Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of [[reagent]] chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs. To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted. In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.  New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly.

A carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres across Ontario. At the centres, highly-skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test mixes the sample with a test kit containing chemicals designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between two temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nIn early April, Ontario has contracted Spartan Bioscience Inc. from Ottawa to supply it with virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/13/ontario-orders-close-to-one-million-spartan-bioscience-portable-covid-19-test-kits.html|title=Ontario orders close to one million Spartan Bioscience portable COVID-19 test kits}} </ref>. The contract was for 900,000 swab test kits, whereas the number of machines has not been disclosed. While these machines cannot process many samples in total, they have the advantage of being small and easy to use. Thus, they can be used to provide rapid results at the point-of-care. They are expected to be useful at border crossings, isolated communities, prisons, and care homes.\n\n==== Serology tests ====\nOntario is performing experiments testing the performance of blood tests that look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref> {{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/20/covid-19-community-spread-in-ontario-has-likely-reached-its-peak-new-modelling-shows/|title=COVID-19 community spread in Ontario has likely reached its peak, new modelling shows}}</ref>. Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection. However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.\n\n=== Testing facilities ===\n\nPublic Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent. The main laboratory is the top four floors of the MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto <ref> {{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/canada/2020/04/10/a-virtual-tour-of-a-public-health-ontario-lab-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing.html?fbclid=IwAR09umcjbDihhlDeBgrtnnU9lD5ts73VIcN0N6_55XSC4Cwv5M6Nb0QAREU| title=A virtual tour of a Public Health Ontario lab ramping up its COVID-19 testing}} </ref>.

In addition to the six public health labs, this includes 10 hospital networks and three private lab networks, including Dynacare and LifeLabs <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/04/how-ontario-turned-the-tide-on-a-huge-backlog-of-covid-19-tests.html|title=How Ontario turned the tide on a huge backlog of COVID-19 tests}}</ref>.\n\n=== Testing Access ===\nAccess to testing is set by Public Health Ontario who publishes a guidance document that defines the conditions for an individual to be tested <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_covid_testing_guidance.pdf|title=Ontario Public Health 2019 COVID testing guidance}}</ref>. Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.  The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw| title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada |first=Emily |last=Chung |date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>. Starting in March, various public health units across the province have opened assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional. This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices. If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing. Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at longterm care homes.\n\nSince many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be a factor of 20 to 100 higher \n<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stay-home-covid-19-spreading-in-community-100s-could-be-infected-says-ottawas-medical-officer-of-health/|title=STAY HOME: COVID-19 spreading in the community, 100s could be infected, says Ottawa's medical officer of health}}</ref>. Unlike some countries, the number of suspected or probable infections is not reported by the Ontario government.\n\n=== Testing Performance ===\nThe bar chart to the right shows the number of tests performed per day, the daily backlog, and the percentage of positive tests in Ontario for March and April 2020. The WHO advises to test every suspected case. Positive test rates above 10% indicate that the testing is too targeted and the number of test-confirmed cases will not accurately indicate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population. This 10% limit was exceeded on multiple days in early April. Since a relatively limited number of cases are tested, the actual number of cases will be much higher than the test-confirmed numbers.\n\n[[File:COVID-19 Ontario Testing Rates.png|thumb|The COVID-19 testing rates in Ontario from March to April 2020, Source:[https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario|data.ontario.ca]]] \n\nIn late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crawley |first1=Mike |title=Wait list for COVID-19 test results balloons to 11,000 in Ontario |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-test-ontario-waiting-lab-results-coronavirus-1.5510644 |website=CBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw|title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada|work=CBC|first=Emily |last=Chung}} </ref> but had high testing numbers compared to most western countries (see [[Template:COVID-19 testing by country subdivision]]).\n\nOn April 15, polling firms, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research, released results of a survey conducted on April 11 and 12 about COVID-19 prevalence and testing.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/one-fifth-of-ontario-households-have-one-or-more-symptoms-of-covid-19/ |title= COVID-19 Symptom Study - Ontario}}</ref> Of the 5,045 respondents, 19% of households contained someone who had at least one symptom and in 8% of households someone had a key symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n=== Testing Capacity ===\nSince January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR. Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of [[reagent]] chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs. To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted. In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.  New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly. Returning tests results to individuals is automated with an online portal <ref> {{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6773258/coronavirus-ontario-online-test-results-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus: Ontario announces online portal to check COVID-19 test results}}</ref>.\n\n==== Testing Capacity Projections ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Madge's best friend [[Helen Daniels]] ([[Anne Haddy]]), lives next door and Madge gets a job with Helen's grandson, [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]), at the Daniels Corporation. Paul believes that Madge would be better off at the Waterhole pub and she becomes the manager. Max leaves for Queensland and their brother [[Tom Ramsay|Tom]] ([[Gary Files]]) moves in and takes over his business. Madge's daughter [[Charlene Robinson|Charlene]] ([[Kylie Minogue]]) also comes to Ramsay Street to live with Madge on being dismissed by her father, [[Fred Mitchell (Neighbours)|Fred]] (Nick Waters). Charlene holds Madge responsible for the break-up of her and Fred's marriage and she hurts her mother further, when she reveals she is friends with [[Susan Cole]] (Gloria Ajenstat), the woman Fred left Madge for.

Madge tells him to leave, but Charlene convinces her to let him stay. Harold proposes to Madge and she accepts. When their old friend [[Lou Carpenter]] ([[Tom Oliver]]) hears about the engagement, he flies to Erinsborough to try and win Madge for himself. Madge chooses Harold and they marry.

Lou later realises that he cannot replace Harold and calls off the wedding. Madge and Lou remain friends and she sells the coffee shop lease to [[Cathy Alessi]] ([[Elspeth Ballantyne]]). She then returns to Brisbane to help Charlene with her new baby, Daniel.\n\n===1996\u20132001===\nFour years later, Helen contacts Madge and tells her that Harold is alive.

She keeps it a secret from Harold and he is appalled when he finds out the truth as her advice to readers had angered him.\n\nMadge collapses one night when she is locking up the Coffee Shop. She suffers abdominal pains and [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) sends her to the hospital for tests. Madge learns that she has pancreatic cancer. Madge prepares to fight the cancer, but she is told that it has spread to her liver and she only has six months to live.

After he crashes his vehicle through the Erinsborough Festival, he sees Madge sitting beside him. At the hospital, Madge appears to him again, telling him she has returned as she knows he needs her. They discuss Daniel's upcoming wedding, and Madge declares she wants to meet his fianc\u00e9e [[Amber Turner|Amber]] (Jenna Rosenow) to see what she thinks of her.

Madge encourages Harold to go on a date with [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]), but he tells her that she is the only one for him. When Sky asks Harold to move to Port Douglas to be with her and her children, she mentions Madge came to her in a dream.

Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and Lalo is released. As Mike and Jimmy agreed, Jimmy tells Lalo his car broke down and he walked alone cross-country so he would not risk losing the money. Lalo tells Jimmy he plans to avoid suspicious police and prosecutors by returning to Mexico.\n\nKim tends to Jimmy's sunburn and bruises and he tells her the same story he told Lalo. Kim realizes he is lying when she sees that Jimmy saved his bullet-pierced coffee mug.{{efn|During the events of \"[[Cobbler (Better Call Saul)|Cobbler]]\".}}\n\nMike reports to Gus, who realizes Juan Bolsa arranged the attack on Jimmy to protect Gus' business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho wants to stop working as Gus' informant, but Gus refuses to release a valuable asset.\n\nJimmy ends a day of convalescence early to deal with a client. Kim tells him she knows he is lying about his desert trip and she will be ready to listen when he decides to tell her the truth. Kim quits Schweikart and Cokely, handing over the Mesa Verde account and keeping her ''[[pro bono]]'' clients. As she departs, she takes the bottle stopper she previously kept as a souvenir.{{efn|During the events of \"[[Switch (Better Call Saul)|Switch]]\".}}\n\nJimmy tells Mike he is experiencing [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]]. Mike tells Jimmy it will pass with time. When Jimmy questions the events that brought them to the desert, Mike says they both made choices, good and bad, so they have to live with the consequences.\n\nLalo says goodbye to Hector and has Nacho bring him to the pickup site where Jimmy received Lalo's bail money. Instead of waiting for the Cousins to arrive, Lalo searches for Jimmy's car. After finding it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque.\n\nJimmy and Kim argue about Kim quitting S&C. Mike calls Jimmy and tells him to leave his phone on but hidden so Mike can listen, just as Kim finds Lalo knocking at their door. He enters the apartment, and Mike keeps a sniper rifle trained on him from a nearby roof. Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert walk, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and departs. He tells Nacho to drive to Mexico, but not the original pickup site.\n\n== Production ==\nThe final scene, with Lalo arriving at Kim and Jimmy's apartment, ran for sixteen minutes without commercial breaks in the original broadcast in order to keep the dramatic tension.

The episode aired on April 13, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n== Plot ==\nJimmy and Mike arrive at a truck stop where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and Lalo is released. As Mike and Jimmy agreed, Jimmy tells Lalo his car broke down and he walked alone cross-country so he would not risk losing the money. Lalo tells Jimmy he plans to avoid suspicious police and prosecutors by returning to Mexico.\n\nKim tends to Jimmy's sunburn and bruises and he tells her the same story he told Lalo. Kim realizes he is lying when she sees that Jimmy saved his bullet-pierced coffee mug.{{efn|During the events of \"[[Cobbler (Better Call Saul)|Cobbler]]\".}}\n\nMike reports to Gus, who realizes Juan Bolsa arranged the attack on Jimmy to protect Gus' business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho wants to stop working as Gus' informant, but Gus refuses to release a valuable asset.\n\nJimmy ends a day of convalescence early to deal with a client. Kim tells him she knows he is lying about his desert trip and she will be ready to listen when he decides to tell her the truth. Kim quits Schweikart and Cokely, handing over the Mesa Verde account and keeping her ''[[pro bono]]'' clients. As she departs, she takes the bottle stopper she previously kept as a souvenir.{{efn|During the events of \"[[Switch (Better Call Saul)|Switch]]\".}}\n\nJimmy tells Mike he is experiencing [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]]. Mike tells Jimmy it will pass with time. When Jimmy questions the events that brought them to the desert, Mike says they both made choices, good and bad, so they have to live with the consequences.\n\nLalo says goodbye to Hector and has Nacho bring him to the pickup site where Jimmy received Lalo's bail money. Instead of waiting for the Cousins to arrive, Lalo searches for Jimmy's car. After finding it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque.\n\nJimmy and Kim argue about Kim quitting S&C. Mike calls Jimmy to warn about Lalo, and to leave the phone on but hidden so Mike can listen, just as Kim finds Lalo knocking at their door. As Lalo enters, Mike keeps a sniper rifle trained on him from a nearby roof. Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert walk, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. With Jimmy unable to respond, Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and departs. He tells Nacho to drive him all the way into Mexico.\n\n== Production ==\nThe final scene, with Lalo arriving at Kim and Jimmy's apartment, ran for sixteen minutes without commercial breaks in the original broadcast in order to keep the dramatic tension.

In the season premiere, CBS deleted an entire segment featuring Belafonte singing ''Lord, Don't Stop the Carnival'' against a backdrop of the havoc during the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]],<ref name=\"thr\"/> along with two lines from a satire of their main competitor, ''[[Bonanza]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rd8jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EygEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7434%2C649028 |title=Bits of Show Business |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2 October 1988 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref> As the year progressed, battles over content continued, including a [[David Steinberg]] sermon about [[Moses]] and the [[Burning Bush]].\n\nWith some local stations making their own deletions of controversial sketches or comments, the continuing problems over the show reached a boiling point after CBS showed a rerun on March 9, 1969. The network explained the decision by stating that because that week's episode did not arrive in time to be previewed, it would not be shown. In that program, [[Joan Baez]] paid tribute to her then-husband [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]], who was entering jail after refusing military service,<ref name=\"tcc\"/> while comedian [[Jackie Mason]] made a joke about children \"playing doctor\". When the show finally did air, three weeks later, the network allowed Baez to state that her husband was in prison, but edited out the reason.\n\nDespite the conflict, the show was picked up for the [[1969\u201370 United States network television schedule|1969\u201370 season]] on March 14, seemingly ending the debate over the show's status. An episode slated for an April 13 broadcast was refused by CBS because the brothers had brought back Steinberg to perform another sermon routine; the original sermon on October 27, 1968 had been met with hundreds of angry viewer letters.<ref>{{cite episode |title=#226: David Steinberg, Nancy Wilson|series=The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour|network=[[E!]]|airdate=1998-03-18}}</ref> However, the episode was aired in Canada on CTV on a pre-release which was a common occurrence at that time.  Network CEO and president [[William S. Paley]] abruptly canceled the show on April 4, 1969, citing the Smothers' failure to meet the contractual pre-air delivery dates required for local affiliate screening. Another of the network's presidents, [[Robert Wood (television executive)|Robert Wood]], stated that it became evident that the brothers \"were unwilling to accept the criteria of taste established by CBS.\"<ref>''[[CBS Evening News]]'', 4 April 1969. \"CBS announced today that ''The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' will not be returning to the CBS television network next season.
