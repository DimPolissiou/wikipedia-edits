The [[cannon]] appeared in 1327. Later in 1364, the [[hand cannon]] appeared. Early projectiles were made of stone. Eventually it was discovered that stone would not penetrate stone fortifications, which led to the use of denser metals as projectiles. Hand cannon projectiles developed in a similar manner. The first recorded instance of a metal ball from a hand cannon penetrating armor was in 1425.<ref>{{cite web|title=Important Dates in Gun History|url=http://armscollectors.com/gunhistorydates.htm|website=armscollectors.com|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>  Shot retrieved from the wreck of the ''Mary Rose'' (sunk in 1545, raised in 1982) are of different sizes, and some are stone while others are cast iron.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Cannon from the Mary Rose|url=http://www.teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/a_cannon_from_the_mary_rose|website=teachinghistory100.com|publisher=The British Museum}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naseby musket balls.jpg|thumb|Matchlock musket balls, alleged to have been discovered at Naseby battlefield]]\nThe development of the hand [[culverin]] and [[matchlock]] [[arquebus]] brought about the use of [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] lead balls as projectiles. The original round [[musket]] ball was smaller than the bore of the barrel. It was loaded into the barrel first, just resting upon the powder, and later using some sort of material as a wadding, between the ball and the powder as well as over the ball to keep it in place,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trackofthewolf.com/list/Item.aspx/163/1|title=Precision Shooting Patches for round ball \u2013 Track of the Wolf|website=www.trackofthewolf.com}}</ref> it held the bullet firmly in the barrel and against the powder. (Bullets not firmly on the powder risked exploding the barrel, with the condition known as a \"short start\".)<ref>{{cite web|title=How to load a musket|url=https://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/1836/the_battle/the_weapons/load.html|website=tamu.edu|publisher=The Second Flying Company of Alamo de Parras|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe loading of muskets was, therefore, easy with the old smooth-bore [[Brown Bess]] and similar military muskets. The original muzzle-loading [[rifle]], however, was loaded with a piece of leather or cloth wrapped around the ball, to allow the ball to engage the grooves in the barrel.  Loading was a bit more difficult, particularly when the bore of the barrel was fouled from previous firings. For this reason, and because rifles were not often fitted for a bayonet, early rifles were not generally used for military purposes.\n\nThe first half of the nineteenth century saw a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet. In 1826, [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne]], a French [[infantry]] officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne's method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate.\n\nSquare bullets have origins that almost pre-date civilization and were used by slingers in slings. They were typically made out of copper or lead. The most notable use of square bullet designs was done by [[James Puckle]] and Kyle Tunis who patented them, where they were briefly used in one version of the [[Puckle gun]]. The early use of these in the black-powder era was soon discontinued due to irregular and unpredictable flight patterns.\n\n===Pointed bullets===\n[[File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg#/media/File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg|thumb|left|Delvigne further developed cylindro-spherical (left) and cylindro-conical bullets (middle), which received the bullet grooves developed by [[Tamisier]] for stability]]\n\nDelvigne continued to develop bullet design and by 1830 had started to develop cylindro-conical bullets. His bullet designs were improved by [[Tamisier|Francois Tamisier]] with the addition of \"ball grooves\" which are known as \"[[cannelure]]s\",  these moved the resistance of air behind the center of gravity of the bullet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gibbon, John|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8FEkwTZd9FMC |quote=Gibbon rifles.|title=The Artillerist's Manual|publisher=D.Van Nostrand|year=1860|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8FEkwTZd9FMC/page/n139 125]}}</ref> \n\nTamisier also developed progressive rifling. The rifle grooves were deeper toward the breech, becoming shallower as they progressed toward the muzzle. This causes the bullet to be progressively molded into the grooves which increased range and accuracy.<ref>''Deanes' Manual of the History and Science of Fire-arms'' by John Deane p.237-238 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lIBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA237&dq=Captain+Tamisier]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GZTmKbpqzcC&pg=PA515&dq=Captain+Tamisier#PPA508,M1|title=The United Service Magazine|first=Arthur William Alsager|last=Pollock|date=16 May 2017|publisher=H.

While successful in increasing accuracy it was extremely hard to clean. These improvements were the basis for the development of the Mini\u00e9 Ball.\n\nAmong the first pointed or \"conical\" bullets were those designed by Captain John Norton of the [[British Army]] in 1832. Norton's bullet had a hollow base made of lotus pith that, on firing, expanded under pressure to engage with a barrel's rifling.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rifling: Expanding Bullets and the Mini\u00e9 Rifle|url=http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/05/rifling-expanding-bullets-and-minie.html|website=firearmshistory.blogspot.com|publisher=Firearms History, Technology & Development|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> The British Board of Ordnance rejected it because spherical bullets had been in use for the previous 300 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howey|first1=Allan W.|title=Facts, information and articles about the Mini\u00e9 Ball, a Civil War bullet|url=http://www.historynet.com/minie-ball?PageSpeed=noscript|website=historynet.com|publisher=Civil War Times Magazine|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nRenowned English gunsmith [[William Greener]] invented the Greener bullet in 1836.

It was another improvement of the work done by Delvigne. As designed by Mini\u00e9, the bullet was conical in shape with a hollow cavity in the rear, which was fitted with a small iron cap instead of a wooden plug. When fired, the iron cap would force itself into the hollow cavity at the rear of the bullet, thus expanding the sides of the bullet to grip and engage the rifling. In 1851, the British adopted the Mini\u00e9 ball for their [[British military rifles|702-inch Pattern 1851 Mini\u00e9 rifle]]. In 1855 James Burton, a machinist at the US Armory at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia improved the Mini\u00e9 Ball further by eliminating the metal cup in the bottom of the bullet.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Park Service Museum Collections|url=http://npscollections.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-drawings-of-james-burton-machinist.html|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Rare and Endangered Artifacts|url=https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/top-10-rare-and-endangered-artifacts.htm|website=nps.gov|publisher=nps.gov|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> The Mini\u00e9 ball first saw widespread use in the [[Crimean War]] (1853-56).

The Whitworth bullet was made to fit the grooves of the rifle mechanically. The Whitworth rifle was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866, when it was gradually superseded by Metford's.\n\nIn 1861 W.B. Chace approached President Abraham Lincoln with an improved ball design for muskets. In firing over the Potomac river where the Chace ball and the round ball were alternated Lincoln observed that the Chace design carried a third or more farther fired at the same elevation. Although Lincoln recommended testing it never took place.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bilby|first1=Joe|title=Pedersoli musket, Nessler Balls and RCBS Dies|url=http://www.civilwarguns.com/9910b.html|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=civilwarguns.com|date=1999}}</ref>\n\nAbout 1862 and later, [[W. E. Metford]] carried out an exhaustive series of experiments on bullets and rifling, and invented the important system of light rifling with increasing spiral, and a hardened bullet. The combined result was that in December 1888 the [[Lee\u2013Metford]] small-bore (0[[.303 British|.303]]\", 7.70&nbsp;mm) rifle, Mark I, was finally adopted for the British army.

Colonel [[Eduard Rubin]], director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented the copper-jacketed bullet \u2014 an elongated bullet with a lead core in a copper jacket. It was also small bore (7.5mm and 8mm) and it is the precursor of the 8mm ''Lebel bullet'' adopted for the smokeless powder ammunition of the Mle 1886 [[Lebel rifle]].\n\nThe surface of lead bullets fired at high velocity may melt due to hot gases behind and friction with the bore. Because copper has a higher melting point, and greater [[specific heat capacity]] and hardness, copper-jacketed bullets allow greater muzzle velocities.\n\n[[Image:.303ammunition.jpeg|thumb|[[.303 British|.303 inch]] (7.7 mm) centrefire, [[Full metal jacket bullet|FMJ]] rimmed ammunition]]\nEuropean advances in aerodynamics led to the pointed [[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullet]]. By the beginning of the twentieth century, most world armies had begun to transition to spitzer bullets. These bullets flew for greater distances more accurately and carried more energy with them. Spitzer bullets combined with [[machine gun]]s greatly increased the lethality of the battlefield.\n\nThe latest advancement in bullet shape was the [[External ballistics#General trends in drag or ballistic coefficient|boat tail]], a streamlined base for spitzer bullets. The vacuum created as air moving at high speed passes over the end of a bullet slows the projectile. The streamlined boat tail design reduces this [[form drag]] by allowing the air to flow along the surface of the tapering end. The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as the optimum shape for rifle technology. The first combination spitzer and boat-tail bullet, named Balle \"D\" from its inventor (a lieutenant-colonel Desaleux), was introduced as standard military ammunition in 1901, for the French [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle]].\n\nA [[ballistic tip]] bullet is a hollow-point rifle bullet that has a plastic tip on the end of the bullet itself. This improves [[external ballistics]] by streamlining the bullet, allowing it to cut through the air more easily, and improves [[terminal ballistics]] by allowing the bullet to act as a JHP on impact.\n\nAs a side effect, it also feeds better in weapons that have trouble feeding rounds that are not FMJ rounds.\n\n==Design==\n\n[[Image:Bullet coming from S&W.jpg|thumb|A bullet in mid flight]]\n\nBullet designs have to solve two primary problems. In the barrel, they must first form a seal with the gun's bore. If a strong seal is not achieved, [[gas]] from the propellant charge leaks past the bullet, thus reducing efficiency and possibly accuracy. The bullet must also engage the rifling without damaging or excessively fouling the gun's bore, and without distorting the bullet, which will also reduce accuracy. Bullets must have a surface that forms this seal without excessive friction. These interactions between bullet and bore are termed [[internal ballistics]]. Bullets must be produced to a high standard, as surface imperfections can affect firing accuracy.\n\nThe physics affecting the bullet once it leaves the barrel is termed [[external ballistics]]. The primary factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet's shape and the rotation imparted by the rifling of the gun barrel. Rotational forces stabilize the bullet gyroscopically as well as aerodynamically. Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins. However, a spin rate greater than the optimum value adds more trouble than good, by magnifying the smaller asymmetries or sometimes resulting in the bullet exploding midway in flight. With smooth-bore firearms, a spherical shape was optimum because no matter how it was oriented, it presented a uniform front. These unstable bullets tumbled erratically and provided only moderate accuracy; however, the aerodynamic shape changed little for centuries. Generally, bullet shapes are a compromise between aerodynamics, interior ballistic necessities, and terminal ballistics requirements. Another method of stabilization is to place the center of mass of the bullet as far forward as is practical, which is how the Mini\u00e9 ball and the shuttlecock are designed. This makes the bullet fly front-forward by means of aerodynamics.\n\nSee the articles on [[terminal ballistics]] and/or [[stopping power]] for an overview of how bullet design affects what happens when a bullet impacts with an object. The outcome of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the angle of incidence, and the velocity and physical characteristics of the bullet itself. Bullets are generally designed to penetrate, deform, or break apart. For a given material and bullet, the strike velocity is the primary factor that determines which outcome is achieved.\n\nBullet shapes are many and varied, and an array of them can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet moulds. Mould manufacturers such as RCBS,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcbs.com/default.asp?menu=1&s1=4&s2=9&s3=83 |title=RCBS |publisher=RCBS |accessdate=2012-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326090103/http://www.rcbs.com/default.asp?menu=1&s1=4&s2=9&s3=83 |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}</ref> Paul Jones Moulds, and David Mos offer many different calibers and designs. With a mould, bullets can be made at home for reloading one's own ammunition, where local laws allow. Hand-casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead bullets. Cast and jacketed bullets are also commercially available from numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than casting bullets from bulk lead.\n\n==Propulsion==\n\nPropulsion of the ball can happen via several methods:\n* by using only gunpowder (i.e. as in [[flintlock]] weapons)\n* by using a [[percussion cap]] and gunpowder (i.e. as in [[percussion]] weapons)\n* by using a [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] (which contains [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primer]], gunpowder and bullet in a single package)\n\n==Materials==\n[[Image:Halvmantlad.jpg|thumb|Expanding bullet loaded in a [[6.5\u00d755mm]] before and after expanding. The long base and small expanded diameter show that this is a bullet designed for deep penetration on large game. The bullet in the photo traveled more than halfway through a [[moose]] before coming to rest, performing as designed.]]\n\nBullets for black powder, or muzzle-loading firearms, were classically molded from pure [[lead]]. This worked well for low-speed bullets, fired at velocities of less than 450&nbsp;m/s (1475&nbsp;ft/s). For slightly higher-speed bullets fired in modern firearms, a harder [[alloy]] of lead and tin or [[typesetter]]'s lead (used to mold [[Linotype (alloy)|Linotype]]) works very well. For even higher-speed bullet use, jacketed coated lead bullets are used. The common element in all of these, lead, is widely used because it is very dense, thereby providing a high amount of mass\u2014and thus, [[kinetic energy]]\u2014for a given volume. Lead is also cheap, easy to obtain, easy to work, and melts at a low temperature, which results in comparatively easy fabrication of bullets.\n\n* '''Lead:''' Simple [[Cast bullet|cast]], extruded, [[swaging|swaged]], or otherwise fabricated lead slugs are the simplest form of bullets. At speeds of greater than 300 [[Meter per second|m/s]] (1000&nbsp;ft/s) (common in most handguns), lead is deposited in rifled bores at an ever-increasing rate. Alloying the lead with a small percentage of [[tin]] and/or [[antimony]] serves to reduce this effect, but grows less effective as velocities are increased. A cup made of harder metal, such as copper, placed at the base of the bullet and called a [[gas check]], is often used to decrease lead deposits by protecting the rear of the bullet against melting when fired at higher pressures, but this too does not solve the problem at higher velocities. A modern solution is to powder coat the lead projectile, encasing it in a protective skin, allowing higher velocities to be achieved without lead deposits.\n* '''Jacketed lead:''' Bullets intended for even higher-velocity applications generally have a lead core that is jacketed or plated with [[gilding metal]], [[cupronickel]], [[copper]] alloys, or [[steel]]; a thin layer of harder metal protects the softer lead core when the bullet is passing through the barrel and during flight, which allows delivering the bullet intact to the target. There, the heavy lead core delivers its kinetic energy to the target. [[Full metal jacket bullet|Full metal jacket]] or \"ball\" bullets (cartridges with ball bullets, which despite the name are not spherical, are called ball ammunition) are completely encased in the harder metal jacket, except for the base. Some bullet jackets do not extend to the front of the bullet, to aid expansion and increase lethality; these are called soft point (if the exposed lead tip is solid) or [[hollow point bullet]]s (if a cavity or hole is present). Steel bullets are often plated with copper or other metals for corrosion resistance during long periods of storage. Synthetic jacket materials such as [[nylon]] and [[Teflon]] have been used, with limited success, especially in rifles; however, hollow point bullets with plastic aerodynamic tips have been very successful at both improving accuracy and enhancing expansion. Newer plastic coatings for handgun bullets, such as [[Teflon-coated bullet]]s, are making their way into the market.\n[[File:3CastBullets.png|thumb|Hard cast solid bullet (left), with gas check (center) and lubrication (right).]]\n* '''Solid''' or Monolithic Solid: mono-metal bullets intended for deep penetration in big game animals and slender shaped very-low-drag projectiles for long range shooting are produced out of metals like oxygen free copper and alloys like [[copper]] [[nickel]], [[Tellurium Copper|tellurium copper]] and [[brass]], for example highly machinable UNS C36000 Free-Cutting Brass. Often these projectiles are turned on precision [[Lathe (metal)#CNC lathe / CNC turning center|CNC lathes]]. In the case of solids, and the ruggedness of the game animals on which they are used, e.g., the African buffalo or elephant, expansion is almost entirely relinquished for the necessary penetration. In shotgunning, \"slug\" loads are often solid large single lead projectiles, sometimes with a hollow point, used for deer or wild pig hunting in jurisdictions that do not allow rifles (because a missed slug shot will travel considerably less far than a rifle bullet).\n**'''Fluted:''' In appearance, these are solid bullets with scalloped sides (missing material). The theory is that the flutes produce hydraulic jetting when passing through tissues, creating a wound channel larger than that made by conventional expanding ammunition such as hollowpoints.\n**'''Hard Cast:''' A hard lead alloy intended to reduce fouling of rifling grooves (especially of the [[polygonal rifling]] used in some popular pistols). Benefits include simpler manufacture than jacketed bullets and good performance against hard targets; limitations are an inability to [[Hollow-point bullet#Expansion|mushroom]] and subsequent over-penetration of soft targets.\n* '''[[Blank (cartridge)|Blanks]]:''' Wax, paper, plastic, and other materials are used to simulate live gunfire and are intended only to hold the powder in a blank cartridge and to produce noise, flame and smoke. The \"bullet\" may be captured in a purpose-designed device or it may be allowed to expend what little energy it has in the air. Some blank cartridges are crimped or closed at the end and do not contain any bullet; some are fully loaded cartridges (without bullets) designed to propel rifle grenades. Note that blank cartridges, at short ranges, can be lethal due to the force of the expanding gas \u2013 numerous tragic accidents have occurred with blank cartridges (e.g., the death of actor [[Jon-Erik Hexum]]).\n* '''Practice:''' Made from lightweight materials like rubber, [[Wax bullets|wax]], wood, plastic, or lightweight metal, practice bullets are intended for short-range target work, only. Because of their weight and low velocity, they have limited range.\n* '''Polymer:''' These are metal-polymer composites, generally lighter and higher velocity than a pure metal bullet of the same dimensions. They permit unusual designs that are difficult with conventional casting or lathing.\n* '''Less lethal''', or Less than Lethal: [[Rubber bullet]]s, [[plastic bullet]]s, and [[Flexible baton round|beanbags]] are designed to be [[non-lethal]], for example for use in [[riot]] control. They are generally low velocity and are fired from shotguns, grenade launchers, paint ball guns, or specially designed firearms and air gun devices.\n* '''[[Incendiary ammunition|Incendiary]]:''' These bullets are made with an explosive or flammable mixture in the tip that is designed to ignite on contact with a target. The intent is to ignite fuel or munitions in the target area, thereby adding to the destructive power of the bullet itself.\n* '''[[Exploding bullet|Exploding]]:''' Similar to the incendiary bullet, this type of projectile is designed to explode upon hitting a hard surface, preferably the bone of the intended target. Not to be mistaken for cannon shells or grenades with fuse devices, these bullets have only a cavity filled with a small amount of low explosive depending on the velocity and deformation upon impact to detonate. Exploding bullets have been used on various aircraft machine guns and on anti materiel rifles.\n* '''[[Tracer ammunition|Tracer]]:''' These have a hollow back, filled with a flare material. Usually this is a mixture of [[magnesium]] metal, a [[perchlorate]], and [[strontium]] salts to yield a bright red color, although other materials providing other colors have also sometimes been used. Tracer material burns out after a certain amount of time. Such ammunition is useful to the shooter as a means of learning how to point shoot moving targets with rifles. This type of round is also used by all branches of the United States military in combat environments as a signaling device to friendly forces. Normally it is loaded at a four to one ratio with ball ammunition and is intended to show where the shooter are firing so friendly forces can engage the target as well. The flight characteristics of tracer rounds differ from normal bullets due to their lighter weight.\n* '''[[armor-piercing bullet|Armor-piercing]]:''' Jacketed designs where the core material is a very hard, high-density metal such as [[tungsten]], [[tungsten carbide]], [[depleted uranium]], or [[steel]]. A pointed tip is often used, but a flat tip on the penetrator portion is generally more effective.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hughes | first = David | title = The History and Development of the M16 Rifle and Its Cartridge | publisher = Armory Pub | location = Oceanside | year = 1990 | isbn = 978-0-9626096-0-2 }}</ref>\n* '''Nontoxic shot:''' Steel, [[bismuth]], [[tungsten]], and other exotic bullet alloys prevent release of toxic lead into the environment. Regulations in several countries mandate the use of nontoxic projectiles especially when hunting waterfowl. It has been found that birds swallow small lead shot for their gizzards to grind food (as they would swallow pebbles of similar size), and the effects of lead poisoning by constant grinding of lead pellets against food means lead poisoning effects are magnified. Such concerns apply primarily to shotguns, firing pellets (shot) and not bullets, but there is evidence suggesting that consumption of spent rifle and pistol ammunition is also [[animal lead poisoning|hazardous to wildlife]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Research\u2014Eagles and Lead.|url=http://www.soarraptors.org/leadresearch.html|publisher=SOAR Raptor Foundation}}</ref> Reduction of hazardous substances (RoHS) legislation has also been applied to bullets on occasion to reduce the impact of lead on the environment at [[shooting range]]s. United States Environmental Protection Agency announced that the agency does not have the legal authority to regulate this type of product (lead bullets) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), nor is the agency seeking such authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Federal/Read.aspx?id=6010|title=NRA-ILA :: EPA Denies Ammo Ban Petition|date=11 January 2011|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111073923/http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Federal/Read.aspx?id=6010|archivedate=11 January 2011}}</ref>   With some nontoxic shot, e.g., steel shot, care must be taken to shoot only in shotguns (and with chokes) specifically designed and designated for steel shot; for other, particularly older, shotguns, serious damage to the barrel and chokes can occur. And, because steel is lighter and less dense than lead, larger sized pellets must be used, thus reducing the number of pellets in a given charge of shot and possibly limiting patterns on the target; other formulations, e.g. [[bismuth]], do not present this disability.\n* '''[[Blended-metal bullets|Blended-metal]]:''' Bullets made using cores from powdered metals other than lead with binder or sometimes [[sintering|sintered]].\n* '''[[Frangible bullet|Frangible]]:''' Designed to disintegrate into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration for reasons of range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the shoot-through danger behind the intended target. An example is the [[Glaser Safety Slug]], usually a pistol caliber bullet made from an amalgam of lead shot and a hard (and thus frangible) plastic binder designed to penetrate a human target and release its component shot pellets without exiting the target.\n* '''Multiple impact bullet:''' Bullets that are made of separate slugs that fit together inside the cartridge, and act as a single projectile inside the barrel as they are fired. The projectiles part in flight, but are held in formation by tethers that keep the individual parts of the \"bullet\" from flying too far away from each other. The intention of such ammo is to increase hit chance by giving a shot-like spread to rifled slug firing guns, while maintaining a consistency in shot groupings. Multiple impact bullets may be less stable in flight than conventional solid bullets because of the added aerodynamic drag from the tether line holding the pieces in formation, and each projectile affects the flight of all the others. This may limit the benefit provided by the spread of each bullet at longer ranges.\n{{expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Treaties and prohibitions==\nPoisonous bullets were a subject to an international agreement as early as the [[Strasbourg Agreement (1675)]].\n\nThe [[St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868]] prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite web\n |title = Purposes and Basic Principles of the Law of War\n |first = William H.\n |last = Glover\n |url=http://williamhgloverjd.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/purposes-and-basic-principles-of-the-law-of-war/\n |accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}</ref>The reasoning was that they figured if bullets were more deadly there would be less suffering.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scout.com/military/warrior/Article/9-Weapons-That-are-Banned-From-Modern-War-101453688|title=9 Weapons That are Banned From Modern War|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920075712/http://scout.com/military/warrior/Article/9-Weapons-That-are-Banned-From-Modern-War-101453688|archive-date=2017-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] prohibits certain kinds of ammunition for use by uniformed military personnel against the uniformed military personnel of opposing forces.

Eventually it was discovered that stone would not penetrate stone fortifications, which led to the use of denser metals as projectiles. Hand cannon projectiles developed in a similar manner. The first recorded instance of a metal ball from a hand cannon penetrating armor was in 1425.<ref>{{cite web|title=Important Dates in Gun History|url=http://armscollectors.com/gunhistorydates.htm|website=armscollectors.com|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>  Shot retrieved from the wreck of the ''Mary Rose'' (sunk in 1545, raised in 1982) are of different sizes, and some are stone while others are cast iron.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Cannon from the Mary Rose|url=http://www.teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/a_cannon_from_the_mary_rose|website=teachinghistory100.com|publisher=The British Museum}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naseby musket balls.jpg|thumb|Matchlock musket balls, alleged to have been discovered at Naseby battlefield]]\nThe development of the hand [[culverin]] and [[matchlock]] [[arquebus]] brought about the use of [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] lead balls as projectiles. The original round [[musket]] ball was smaller than the bore of the barrel. It was loaded into the barrel first, just resting upon the powder, and later using some sort of material as a wadding, between the ball and the powder as well as over the ball to keep it in place,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trackofthewolf.com/list/Item.aspx/163/1|title=Precision Shooting Patches for round ball \u2013 Track of the Wolf|website=www.trackofthewolf.com}}</ref> it held the bullet firmly in the barrel and against the powder. (Bullets not firmly on the powder risked exploding the barrel, with the condition known as a \"short start\".)<ref>{{cite web|title=How to load a musket|url=https://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/1836/the_battle/the_weapons/load.html|website=tamu.edu|publisher=The Second Flying Company of Alamo de Parras|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe loading of muskets was, therefore, easy with the old smooth-bore [[Brown Bess]] and similar military muskets. The original muzzle-loading [[rifle]], however, was loaded with a piece of leather or cloth wrapped around the ball, to allow the ball to engage the grooves in the barrel.  Loading was a bit more difficult, particularly when the bore of the barrel was fouled from previous firings. For this reason, and because rifles were not often fitted for a bayonet, early rifles were not generally used for military purposes.\n\nThe first half of the nineteenth century saw a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet. In 1826, [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne]], a French [[infantry]] officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne's method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate.\n\nSquare bullets have origins that almost pre-date civilization and were used by slingers in slings. They were typically made out of copper or lead. The most notable use of square bullet designs was done by [[James Puckle]] and Kyle Tunis who patented them, where they were briefly used in one version of the [[Puckle gun]]. The early use of these in the black-powder era was soon discontinued due to irregular and unpredictable flight patterns.\n\n===Pointed bullets===\n[[File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg#/media/File:Early_cylindrical_bullets.jpg|thumb|left|Delvigne further developed cylindro-spherical (left) and cylindro-conical bullets (middle), which received the bullet grooves developed by [[Tamisier]] for stability]]\n\nDelvigne continued to develop bullet design and by 1830 had started to develop cylindro-conical bullets. His bullet designs were improved by [[Tamisier|Francois Tamisier]] with the addition of \"ball grooves\" which are known as \"[[cannelure]]s\",  these moved the resistance of air behind the center of gravity of the bullet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gibbon, John|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8FEkwTZd9FMC |quote=Gibbon rifles.|title=The Artillerist's Manual|publisher=D.Van Nostrand|year=1860|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8FEkwTZd9FMC/page/n139 125]}}</ref> \n\nTamisier also developed progressive rifling. The rifle grooves were deeper toward the breech, becoming shallower as they progressed toward the muzzle. This causes the bullet to be progressively molded into the grooves which increased range and accuracy.<ref>''Deanes' Manual of the History and Science of Fire-arms'' by John Deane p.237-238 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lIBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA237&dq=Captain+Tamisier]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GZTmKbpqzcC&pg=PA515&dq=Captain+Tamisier#PPA508,M1|title=The United Service Magazine|first=Arthur William Alsager|last=Pollock|date=16 May 2017|publisher=H.

While successful in increasing accuracy it was extremely hard to clean. These improvements were the basis for the development of the Mini\u00e9 Ball.\n\nAmong the first pointed or \"conical\" bullets were those designed by Captain John Norton of the [[British Army]] in 1832. Norton's bullet had a hollow base made of lotus pith that, on firing, expanded under pressure to engage with a barrel's rifling.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rifling: Expanding Bullets and the Mini\u00e9 Rifle|url=http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/05/rifling-expanding-bullets-and-minie.html|website=firearmshistory.blogspot.com|publisher=Firearms History, Technology & Development|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> The British Board of Ordnance rejected it because spherical bullets had been in use for the previous 300 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howey|first1=Allan W.|title=Facts, information and articles about the Mini\u00e9 Ball, a Civil War bullet|url=http://www.historynet.com/minie-ball?PageSpeed=noscript|website=historynet.com|publisher=Civil War Times Magazine|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nRenowned English gunsmith [[William Greener]] invented the Greener bullet in 1836.

It was another improvement of the work done by Delvigne. As designed by Mini\u00e9, the bullet was conical in shape with a hollow cavity in the rear, which was fitted with a small iron cap instead of a wooden plug. When fired, the iron cap would force itself into the hollow cavity at the rear of the bullet, thus expanding the sides of the bullet to grip and engage the rifling. In 1851, the British adopted the Mini\u00e9 ball for their [[British military rifles|702-inch Pattern 1851 Mini\u00e9 rifle]]. In 1855 James Burton, a machinist at the US Armory at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia improved the Mini\u00e9 Ball further by eliminating the metal cup in the bottom of the bullet.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Park Service Museum Collections|url=http://npscollections.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-drawings-of-james-burton-machinist.html|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Rare and Endangered Artifacts|url=https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/top-10-rare-and-endangered-artifacts.htm|website=nps.gov|publisher=nps.gov|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> The Mini\u00e9 ball first saw widespread use in the [[Crimean War]] (1853-56).

The Whitworth bullet was made to fit the grooves of the rifle mechanically. The Whitworth rifle was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866, when it was gradually superseded by Metford's.\n\nIn 1861 W.B. Chace approached President Abraham Lincoln with an improved ball design for muskets. In firing over the Potomac river where the Chace ball and the round ball were alternated Lincoln observed that the Chace design carried a third or more farther fired at the same elevation. Although Lincoln recommended testing it never took place.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bilby|first1=Joe|title=Pedersoli musket, Nessler Balls and RCBS Dies|url=http://www.civilwarguns.com/9910b.html|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=civilwarguns.com|date=1999}}</ref>\n\nAbout 1862 and later, [[W.

The combined result was that in December 1888 the [[Lee\u2013Metford]] small-bore (0[[.303 British|.303]]\", 7.70&nbsp;mm) rifle, Mark I, was finally adopted for the British army.

Colonel [[Eduard Rubin]], director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented the copper-jacketed bullet \u2014 an elongated bullet with a lead core in a copper jacket. It was also small bore (7.5mm and 8mm) and it is the precursor of the 8mm ''Lebel bullet'' adopted for the smokeless powder ammunition of the Mle 1886 [[Lebel rifle]].\n\nThe surface of lead bullets fired at high velocity may melt due to hot gases behind and friction with the bore. Because copper has a higher melting point, and greater [[specific heat capacity]] and hardness, copper-jacketed bullets allow greater muzzle velocities.\n\n[[Image:.303ammunition.jpeg|thumb|[[.303 British|.303 inch]] (7.7 mm) centrefire, [[Full metal jacket bullet|FMJ]] rimmed ammunition]]\nEuropean advances in aerodynamics led to the pointed [[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullet]]. By the beginning of the twentieth century, most world armies had begun to transition to spitzer bullets. These bullets flew for greater distances more accurately and carried more energy with them. Spitzer bullets combined with [[machine gun]]s greatly increased the lethality of the battlefield.\n\nThe latest advancement in bullet shape was the [[External ballistics#General trends in drag or ballistic coefficient|boat tail]], a streamlined base for spitzer bullets. The vacuum created as air moving at high speed passes over the end of a bullet slows the projectile. The streamlined boat tail design reduces this [[form drag]] by allowing the air to flow along the surface of the tapering end. The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as the optimum shape for rifle technology. The first combination spitzer and boat-tail bullet, named Balle \"D\" from its inventor (a lieutenant-colonel Desaleux), was introduced as standard military ammunition in 1901, for the French [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle]].\n\nA [[ballistic tip]] bullet is a hollow-point rifle bullet that has a plastic tip on the end of the bullet itself. This improves [[external ballistics]] by streamlining the bullet, allowing it to cut through the air more easily, and improves [[terminal ballistics]] by allowing the bullet to act as a JHP on impact.\n\nAs a side effect, it also feeds better in weapons that have trouble feeding rounds that are not FMJ rounds.\n\n==Design==\n\n[[Image:Bullet coming from S&W.jpg|thumb|A bullet in mid flight]]\n\nBullet designs have to solve two primary problems. In the barrel, they must first form a seal with the gun's bore. If a strong seal is not achieved, [[gas]] from the propellant charge leaks past the bullet, thus reducing efficiency and possibly accuracy. The bullet must also engage the rifling without damaging or excessively fouling the gun's bore, and without distorting the bullet, which will also reduce accuracy. Bullets must have a surface that forms this seal without excessive friction. These interactions between bullet and bore are termed [[internal ballistics]]. Bullets must be produced to a high standard, as surface imperfections can affect firing accuracy.\n\nThe physics affecting the bullet once it leaves the barrel is termed [[external ballistics]]. The primary factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet's shape and the rotation imparted by the rifling of the gun barrel. Rotational forces stabilize the bullet gyroscopically as well as aerodynamically. Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins. However, a spin rate greater than the optimum value adds more trouble than good, by magnifying the smaller asymmetries or sometimes resulting in the bullet exploding midway in flight. With smooth-bore firearms, a spherical shape was optimum because no matter how it was oriented, it presented a uniform front. These unstable bullets tumbled erratically and provided only moderate accuracy; however, the aerodynamic shape changed little for centuries. Generally, bullet shapes are a compromise between aerodynamics, interior ballistic necessities, and terminal ballistics requirements. Another method of stabilization is to place the center of mass of the bullet as far forward as is practical, which is how the Mini\u00e9 ball and the shuttlecock are designed. This makes the bullet fly front-forward by means of aerodynamics.\n\nSee the articles on [[terminal ballistics]] and/or [[stopping power]] for an overview of how bullet design affects what happens when a bullet impacts with an object. The outcome of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the angle of incidence, and the velocity and physical characteristics of the bullet itself. Bullets are generally designed to penetrate, deform, or break apart. For a given material and bullet, the strike velocity is the primary factor that determines which outcome is achieved.\n\nBullet shapes are many and varied, and an array of them can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet moulds. Mould manufacturers such as RCBS,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcbs.com/default.asp?menu=1&s1=4&s2=9&s3=83 |title=RCBS |publisher=RCBS |accessdate=2012-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326090103/http://www.rcbs.com/default.asp?menu=1&s1=4&s2=9&s3=83 |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}</ref> Paul Jones Moulds, and David Mos offer many different calibers and designs. With a mould, bullets can be made at home for reloading one's own ammunition, where local laws allow. Hand-casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead bullets. Cast and jacketed bullets are also commercially available from numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than casting bullets from bulk lead.\n\n==Propulsion==\n\nPropulsion of the ball can happen via several methods:\n* by using only gunpowder (i.e. as in [[flintlock]] weapons)\n* by using a [[percussion cap]] and gunpowder (i.e. as in [[percussion]] weapons)\n* by using a [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] (which contains [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primer]], gunpowder and bullet in a single package)\n\n==Materials==\n[[Image:Halvmantlad.jpg|thumb|Expanding bullet loaded in a [[6.5\u00d755mm]] before and after expanding. The long base and small expanded diameter show that this is a bullet designed for deep penetration on large game. The bullet in the photo traveled more than halfway through a [[moose]] before coming to rest, performing as designed.]]\n\nBullets for black powder, or muzzle-loading firearms, were classically molded from pure [[lead]]. This worked well for low-speed bullets, fired at velocities of less than 450&nbsp;m/s (1475&nbsp;ft/s). For slightly higher-speed bullets fired in modern firearms, a harder [[alloy]] of lead and tin or [[typesetter]]'s lead (used to mold [[Linotype (alloy)|Linotype]]) works very well. For even higher-speed bullet use, jacketed coated lead bullets are used. The common element in all of these, lead, is widely used because it is very dense, thereby providing a high amount of mass\u2014and thus, [[kinetic energy]]\u2014for a given volume. Lead is also cheap, easy to obtain, easy to work, and melts at a low temperature, which results in comparatively easy fabrication of bullets.\n\n* '''Lead:''' Simple [[Cast bullet|cast]], extruded, [[swaging|swaged]], or otherwise fabricated lead slugs are the simplest form of bullets. At speeds of greater than 300 [[Meter per second|m/s]] (1000&nbsp;ft/s) (common in most handguns), lead is deposited in rifled bores at an ever-increasing rate. Alloying the lead with a small percentage of [[tin]] and/or [[antimony]] serves to reduce this effect, but grows less effective as velocities are increased. A cup made of harder metal, such as copper, placed at the base of the bullet and called a [[gas check]], is often used to decrease lead deposits by protecting the rear of the bullet against melting when fired at higher pressures, but this too does not solve the problem at higher velocities. A modern solution is to powder coat the lead projectile, encasing it in a protective skin, allowing higher velocities to be achieved without lead deposits.\n* '''Jacketed lead:''' Bullets intended for even higher-velocity applications generally have a lead core that is jacketed or plated with [[gilding metal]], [[cupronickel]], [[copper]] alloys, or [[steel]]; a thin layer of harder metal protects the softer lead core when the bullet is passing through the barrel and during flight, which allows delivering the bullet intact to the target. There, the heavy lead core delivers its kinetic energy to the target. [[Full metal jacket bullet|Full metal jacket]] or \"ball\" bullets (cartridges with ball bullets, which despite the name are not spherical, are called ball ammunition) are completely encased in the harder metal jacket, except for the base. Some bullet jackets do not extend to the front of the bullet, to aid expansion and increase lethality; these are called soft point (if the exposed lead tip is solid) or [[hollow point bullet]]s (if a cavity or hole is present). Steel bullets are often plated with copper or other metals for corrosion resistance during long periods of storage. Synthetic jacket materials such as [[nylon]] and [[Teflon]] have been used, with limited success, especially in rifles; however, hollow point bullets with plastic aerodynamic tips have been very successful at both improving accuracy and enhancing expansion. Newer plastic coatings for handgun bullets, such as [[Teflon-coated bullet]]s, are making their way into the market.\n[[File:3CastBullets.png|thumb|Hard cast solid bullet (left), with gas check (center) and lubrication (right).]]\n* '''Solid''' or Monolithic Solid: mono-metal bullets intended for deep penetration in big game animals and slender shaped very-low-drag projectiles for long range shooting are produced out of metals like oxygen free copper and alloys like [[copper]] [[nickel]], [[Tellurium Copper|tellurium copper]] and [[brass]], for example highly machinable UNS C36000 Free-Cutting Brass. Often these projectiles are turned on precision [[Lathe (metal)#CNC lathe / CNC turning center|CNC lathes]]. In the case of solids, and the ruggedness of the game animals on which they are used, e.g., the African buffalo or elephant, expansion is almost entirely relinquished for the necessary penetration. In shotgunning, \"slug\" loads are often solid large single lead projectiles, sometimes with a hollow point, used for deer or wild pig hunting in jurisdictions that do not allow rifles (because a missed slug shot will travel considerably less far than a rifle bullet).\n**'''Fluted:''' In appearance, these are solid bullets with scalloped sides (missing material). The theory is that the flutes produce hydraulic jetting when passing through tissues, creating a wound channel larger than that made by conventional expanding ammunition such as hollowpoints.\n**'''Hard Cast:''' A hard lead alloy intended to reduce fouling of rifling grooves (especially of the [[polygonal rifling]] used in some popular pistols). Benefits include simpler manufacture than jacketed bullets and good performance against hard targets; limitations are an inability to [[Hollow-point bullet#Expansion|mushroom]] and subsequent over-penetration of soft targets.\n* '''[[Blank (cartridge)|Blanks]]:''' Wax, paper, plastic, and other materials are used to simulate live gunfire and are intended only to hold the powder in a blank cartridge and to produce noise, flame and smoke. The \"bullet\" may be captured in a purpose-designed device or it may be allowed to expend what little energy it has in the air. Some blank cartridges are crimped or closed at the end and do not contain any bullet; some are fully loaded cartridges (without bullets) designed to propel rifle grenades. Note that blank cartridges, at short ranges, can be lethal due to the force of the expanding gas \u2013 numerous tragic accidents have occurred with blank cartridges (e.g., the death of actor [[Jon-Erik Hexum]]).\n* '''Practice:''' Made from lightweight materials like rubber, [[Wax bullets|wax]], wood, plastic, or lightweight metal, practice bullets are intended for short-range target work, only. Because of their weight and low velocity, they have limited range.\n* '''Polymer:''' These are metal-polymer composites, generally lighter and higher velocity than a pure metal bullet of the same dimensions. They permit unusual designs that are difficult with conventional casting or lathing.\n* '''Less lethal''', or Less than Lethal: [[Rubber bullet]]s, [[plastic bullet]]s, and [[Flexible baton round|beanbags]] are designed to be [[non-lethal]], for example for use in [[riot]] control. They are generally low velocity and are fired from shotguns, grenade launchers, paint ball guns, or specially designed firearms and air gun devices.\n* '''[[Incendiary ammunition|Incendiary]]:''' These bullets are made with an explosive or flammable mixture in the tip that is designed to ignite on contact with a target. The intent is to ignite fuel or munitions in the target area, thereby adding to the destructive power of the bullet itself.\n* '''[[Exploding bullet|Exploding]]:''' Similar to the incendiary bullet, this type of projectile is designed to explode upon hitting a hard surface, preferably the bone of the intended target. Not to be mistaken for cannon shells or grenades with fuse devices, these bullets have only a cavity filled with a small amount of low explosive depending on the velocity and deformation upon impact to detonate. Exploding bullets have been used on various aircraft machine guns and on anti materiel rifles.\n* '''[[Tracer ammunition|Tracer]]:''' These have a hollow back, filled with a flare material. Usually this is a mixture of [[magnesium]] metal, a [[perchlorate]], and [[strontium]] salts to yield a bright red color, although other materials providing other colors have also sometimes been used. Tracer material burns out after a certain amount of time. Such ammunition is useful to the shooter as a means of learning how to point shoot moving targets with rifles. This type of round is also used by all branches of the United States military in combat environments as a signaling device to friendly forces. Normally it is loaded at a four to one ratio with ball ammunition and is intended to show where the shooter are firing so friendly forces can engage the target as well. The flight characteristics of tracer rounds differ from normal bullets due to their lighter weight.\n* '''[[armor-piercing bullet|Armor-piercing]]:''' Jacketed designs where the core material is a very hard, high-density metal such as [[tungsten]], [[tungsten carbide]], [[depleted uranium]], or [[steel]]. A pointed tip is often used, but a flat tip on the penetrator portion is generally more effective.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hughes | first = David | title = The History and Development of the M16 Rifle and Its Cartridge | publisher = Armory Pub | location = Oceanside | year = 1990 | isbn = 978-0-9626096-0-2 }}</ref>\n* '''Nontoxic shot:''' Steel, [[bismuth]], [[tungsten]], and other exotic bullet alloys prevent release of toxic lead into the environment. Regulations in several countries mandate the use of nontoxic projectiles especially when hunting waterfowl. It has been found that birds swallow small lead shot for their gizzards to grind food (as they would swallow pebbles of similar size), and the effects of lead poisoning by constant grinding of lead pellets against food means lead poisoning effects are magnified. Such concerns apply primarily to shotguns, firing pellets (shot) and not bullets, but there is evidence suggesting that consumption of spent rifle and pistol ammunition is also [[animal lead poisoning|hazardous to wildlife]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Research\u2014Eagles and Lead.|url=http://www.soarraptors.org/leadresearch.html|publisher=SOAR Raptor Foundation}}</ref> Reduction of hazardous substances (RoHS) legislation has also been applied to bullets on occasion to reduce the impact of lead on the environment at [[shooting range]]s. United States Environmental Protection Agency announced that the agency does not have the legal authority to regulate this type of product (lead bullets) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), nor is the agency seeking such authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Federal/Read.aspx?id=6010|title=NRA-ILA :: EPA Denies Ammo Ban Petition|date=11 January 2011|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111073923/http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Federal/Read.aspx?id=6010|archivedate=11 January 2011}}</ref>   With some nontoxic shot, e.g., steel shot, care must be taken to shoot only in shotguns (and with chokes) specifically designed and designated for steel shot; for other, particularly older, shotguns, serious damage to the barrel and chokes can occur. And, because steel is lighter and less dense than lead, larger sized pellets must be used, thus reducing the number of pellets in a given charge of shot and possibly limiting patterns on the target; other formulations, e.g. [[bismuth]], do not present this disability.\n* '''[[Blended-metal bullets|Blended-metal]]:''' Bullets made using cores from powdered metals other than lead with binder or sometimes [[sintering|sintered]].\n* '''[[Frangible bullet|Frangible]]:''' Designed to disintegrate into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration for reasons of range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the shoot-through danger behind the intended target. An example is the [[Glaser Safety Slug]], usually a pistol caliber bullet made from an amalgam of lead shot and a hard (and thus frangible) plastic binder designed to penetrate a human target and release its component shot pellets without exiting the target.\n* '''Multiple impact bullet:''' Bullets that are made of separate slugs that fit together inside the cartridge, and act as a single projectile inside the barrel as they are fired. The projectiles part in flight, but are held in formation by tethers that keep the individual parts of the \"bullet\" from flying too far away from each other. The intention of such ammo is to increase hit chance by giving a shot-like spread to rifled slug firing guns, while maintaining a consistency in shot groupings. Multiple impact bullets may be less stable in flight than conventional solid bullets because of the added aerodynamic drag from the tether line holding the pieces in formation, and each projectile affects the flight of all the others. This may limit the benefit provided by the spread of each bullet at longer ranges.\n{{expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Treaties and prohibitions==\nPoisonous bullets were a subject to an international agreement as early as the [[Strasbourg Agreement (1675)]].\n\nThe [[St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868]] prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite web\n |title = Purposes and Basic Principles of the Law of War\n |first = William H.\n |last = Glover\n |url=http://williamhgloverjd.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/purposes-and-basic-principles-of-the-law-of-war/\n |accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}</ref>The reasoning was that they figured if bullets were more deadly there would be less suffering.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scout.com/military/warrior/Article/9-Weapons-That-are-Banned-From-Modern-War-101453688|title=9 Weapons That are Banned From Modern War|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920075712/http://scout.com/military/warrior/Article/9-Weapons-That-are-Banned-From-Modern-War-101453688|archive-date=2017-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] prohibits certain kinds of ammunition for use by uniformed military personnel against the uniformed military personnel of opposing forces.

After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires. After knowing that [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] refused his wishes, Vishwamitra promises him the impossible. But his [[yajna]] got rejected by Indra and other gods.\n|-\n|8\n|Vishwamitra begins creating alternate heaven for Trishanku when gods dismiss him from Indra's heaven.\n|-\n|9\n|[[B\u1e5bhaspati]] (along with [[Narada]] ) tries to persuade Vishwamitra to abandon creation new heaven for Trishanku which he agrees. However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task. She decides to take help from [[Rati]] and [[Kamadeva|Kamadev]].\n|-\n|12\n|After severe attempts Menaka successfully gained the attention of Vishwamitra and made him fell in love with her. \n|-\n|13\n|Both of them got married and thus Indra task finally got fulfilled. He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle. Harishchandra saves his subject from wild animals.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma. He hands over his entire kingdom to Vishwamitra but when he prepares to leaves for Kashi with his wife and son, Vishwamitra asks for the money promised to him for yajna purpose. Harishchandra asks for a month's time to fulfill the promise. Vishwamitra sends his disciple Nakshatrik to accompany them.\n|-\n|23\n|On his journey to Kashi, Vishwamitra creates many hurdles to deviate Harishchandra from dharma. He creates Mayamuni to misguide Harishchandra from the correct path. Vishwamitra's disciple Nakshatrik also keeps giving a hard time to Harishchandra throughout his journey. Vishwamitra creates a Betaal to scare Harishchandra and his family at night but Harishchandra kills him in a duel. Finally, they reach Kashi and Nakshatrik asks for the promised money. Unable to pay anything, Harishchandra asks for some time but Nakshatrik gives him the choice to back-out from his words as there is no way he can deliver his commitment. Taramati asks his husband to sell her off as a slave so that he can pay the money to Vishwamitra. A reluctant Harishchandra agrees for it.\n|-\n|24\n|A rich brahmin buys Taramati & her son (named Rohita) and gave the asked money to Nakshatrik. But Vishwamitra refuses the money and gives it to Nakshatrik as his wages. Vishwamitra asks his disciple to rigorously test Harishchandra's commitment to dharma. Nakshatrik goes to Harishchandra and asks for his guru's debt. A shocked Harishchandra decides this time to sell himself.\n|-\n|25\n|A rich drunkard ''chandala'' named Veerbahu buys Harishchandra and renames him Veerdas. He deploys him as dom (untouchable) to perform last rites rituals at Ganga Ghat. Veerbahu instructs him to charge a gold coin, a new cloth, and rice for anyone coming for the last rites ritual. While Harishchandra is busy working as a dom, his wife and son face a lot of hardship at their master's place.\n|-\n|26\n|Taramati's master send Rohita to forest along with others for daily chores. Vishwamitra send Nagraj as snake to kill Rohita. He dies in the forest due to snake-bite and his corpse is later discovered by Taramati. Heart-broken Taramati takes the corpse of his son for cremation where she's stopped by none other than his own husband Harishchandra. They are not able to recognize each other initially. As per his master's instruction he can't let anyone do the last rites with the pre-requisite items. Taramati identifies his husband. A mournful Harishchandra still sticks to his dharma and tells his wife to get the items for cremation. Taramati asks her husband to guard their son's corpse while she gets the items from her master.\n|-\n|27\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.

After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires. After knowing that [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] refused his wishes, Vishwamitra promises him the impossible. But his [[yajna]] got rejected by Indra and other gods.\n|-\n|8\n|Vishwamitra begins creating alternate heaven for Trishanku when gods dismiss him from Indra's heaven.\n|-\n|9\n|[[B\u1e5bhaspati]] (along with [[Narada]] ) tries to persuade Vishwamitra to abandon creation new heaven for Trishanku which he agrees. However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task. She decides to take help from [[Rati]] and [[Kamadeva|Kamadev]].\n|-\n|12\n|After severe attempts Menaka successfully gained the attention of Vishwamitra and made him fell in love with her. \n|-\n|13\n|Both of them got married and thus Indra task finally got fulfilled. He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle. Harishchandra saves his subject from wild animals.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma. He hands over his entire kingdom to Vishwamitra but when he prepares to leaves for Kashi with his wife and son, Vishwamitra asks for the money promised to him for yajna purpose. Harishchandra asks for a month's time to fulfill the promise. Vishwamitra sends his disciple Nakshatrik to accompany them.\n|-\n|23\n|On his journey to Kashi, Vishwamitra creates many hurdles to deviate Harishchandra from dharma. He creates Mayamuni to misguide Harishchandra from the correct path. Vishwamitra's disciple Nakshatrik also keeps giving a hard time to Harishchandra throughout his journey. Vishwamitra creates a Betaal to scare Harishchandra and his family at night but Harishchandra kills him in a duel. Finally, they reach Kashi and Nakshatrik asks for the promised money. Unable to pay anything, Harishchandra asks for some time but Nakshatrik gives him the choice to back-out from his words as there is no way he can deliver his commitment. Taramati asks his husband to sell her off as a slave so that he can pay the money to Vishwamitra. A reluctant Harishchandra agrees for it.\n|-\n|24\n|A rich brahmin buys Taramati & her son and gave the asked money to Nakshatrik. But Vishwamitra refuses the money and gives it to Nakshatrik as his wages. Vishwamitra asks his disciple to rigorously test Harishchandra's commitment to dharma. Nakshatrik goes to Harishchandra and asks for his guru's debt. A shocked Harishchandra decides this time to sell himself.\n|-\n|25\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.

Sky Multichannels was a subscription package that gave access not only to Sky's own channels but also those of third party broadcasters.\n\nThe service started on 1 September 1993. It was based on an idea by then CEO [[Sam Chisholm]] and chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]] of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept. The new package included four channels formerly available [[free-to-air]], broadcasting on Astra's satellites, as well as introducing new channels.<ref name=\"fundinguniverse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/British-Sky-Broadcasting-Group-plc-Company-History.html|title=British Sky Broadcasting Group plc|accessdate=10 February 2007|publisher=Funding Universe}}</ref> The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001,<ref name=\"SkyAnalogueClosure\">{{cite web|url=http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/skystory.html|title=How the Sky analogue service was run down in favour of digital....|accessdate=10 February 2007|last=Wathan|first=Chris|publisher=Analoguesat|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010221157/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/skystory.html|archivedate=10 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> due to the expansion of the Sky Digital platform after its launch three years before.

The Guardian; 25 October 1993;</ref>\n\n===Launch of Sky Digital===\nBSkyB's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then. At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded [[Open....]] now called [[Sky Active]], BSkyB competed with the [[ITV Digital|ONdigital]] (later ''ITV Digital'') terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which helped bolster BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.\n\nIn addition to most channels from the Sky Multichannels package, Sky Digital launched with several new channels that were exclusive to the digital offer.\n\nThe switch-over from analogue to digital proceeded relatively quickly. In 1998, there were 6 million 'multichannel' TV homes in the UK (i.e. homes that watch television other than the traditional analogue terrestrial), and over half of these homes watched television using BSkyB's analogue service. BSkyB's digital service surpassed the analogue service in terms of subscribers in late 1999.<ref>http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/tv-research/dso3.pdf</ref>\n\nBy June 2000 the service had 3.6 million subscribers, which gave BSkyB 8.988 million subscribers across all platforms. This substantial growth reflected BSkyB's 34% share of viewers in multi-channel homes (up from 13.4% from 1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/10/104016/reports/ar00.pdf|format=PDF|title=British Sky Broadcasting Group plc Annual Report 2000|website=media.corporate-ir.net}}</ref>\n\nBSkyB's analogue service ended in October 2001, and the digital service would eventually be marketed as just 'Sky'.\n\nBy June 2005, the number of digital subscribers increase to 7.8m, while it produced 38,375 hours of sport in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/publications/fact_book_2005.pdf|title=Error page|work=sky.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927223016/http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/publications/fact_book_2005.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2005, in partnership with [[Vodafone]], [[Sky Mobile TV]] was launched which was the UK's first commercially available mobile TV service.

The target was first announced in August 2004, since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to Sky's direct-to-home service.

ITV Digital failed for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to numerous administrative and technical failures, nervous investors after a large down-turn in the advertising market and the [[dot com crash]], and Sky's aggressive marketing and domination of premium sporting rights.\n\nWhile Sky had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium, thereby making them a competitor by default, Sky was able to join ITV Digital's [[free-to-air]] replacement, [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], in which it holds an equal stake with the [[BBC]], [[ITV plc|ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Arqiva]]. Prior to October 2005, three Sky channels were available on this platform: [[Sky News]], [[Sky3|Sky Three]], and [[Sky Sports News]]. Initially, Sky provided [[Sky Travel]] to the service. However, this was replaced by [[Sky3|Sky Three]] on 31 October 2005, which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV' in 2011.\n\nOn 8 February 2007, Sky announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels.

This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as [[Eutelsat]]'s Eurobird 1 (now [[Eutelsat 33C]]) at 28.5\u00b0E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/Eutelsat-28A.html|title=Eutelsat 28A at 28.5\u00b0E \u2013 LyngSat|work=lyngsat.com}}</ref> The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5\u00b0E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom.\n\nNew Astra satellites joined the position in 2000 and 2001, and the number of channels available to customers increased accordingly. This trend continued with the launch of Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 33C) in 2001. Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering \u2014 However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely.\n\nIt was the country's most popular digital TV service until it was overtaken by [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in April 2007.<ref name=\"Freeview digital overtakes Sky\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1609240/Freeview-digital-overtakes-Sky.html|title=Freeview digital overtakes Sky|work=This is Money}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the migration to Astra 2E, 2F and 2G, Sky was transmitted from the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites located at [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0 east]] ([[Astra 2A|2A]]/[[Astra 2C|2C]]/[[Astra 2E|2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]) and [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat 33C]] satellite at 28.5\u00b0E.\n\nAs of 2019, Astra 2E, 2F and 2G are the sole satellites used by Sky UK;<ref name=\"SatExpat Sky UK satellites\">{{cite web |url=http://en.satexpat.com/tv/uk/sky/ |title=Sky UK \u2013 Frequency and channel list \u2013 Astra 2 UK Spotbeam and Astra 2 European Beam |date=2019-04-23 |accessdate=2019-04-23 }}</ref> a number of services are served via narrow UK-only [[spot beam]]s, the other services downlinked with a Europe-wide footprint.

Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted, some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription (known as free-to-view), some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription, and some are pay-per-view services. To view the encrypted content a [[VideoGuard]] UK equipped receiver (all of which are dedicated to the Sky service, and cannot be used to decrypt other services) needs to be used. Unofficial [[conditional-access module|CAMs]] are now available to view the service, although use of\nthem breaks the user's contract with Sky and invalidates the user's rights to use the card.\n\n===Standard definition broadcasts===\nSky's standard definition broadcasts are in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-compliant [[MPEG-2]], with the [[Sky Cinema]] and [[Sky Box Office]] channels including optional [[Dolby Digital]] soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using [[MPEG-4]] and most of the HD material uses the [[DVB-S2]] standard. Interactive services and 7-day [[EPG]] use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including [[modem]]s for a return path. [[Sky News]], amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-[[video on demand]] interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.\n\n===Digital satellite receivers===\nSky utilises the [[VideoGuard]] pay-TV scrambling system owned by [[NDS Group|NDS]], a [[Cisco Systems]] company. There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] CAMs ([[conditional-access module]]s). Sky has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service. The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others. This extends to the [[Personal video recorder]] (PVR) offering (branded [[Sky+]]).\n\n===Electronic programme guide===\n\n====Technology====\nSky maintains an [[electronic programme guide]] (EPG) which provides information about upcoming programmes and a list of channels. TV channels available on Sky are assigned a three digit [[logical channel number]] which can be entered on a remote control to access the channel and determines in what order channels are listed. Radio channels similarly receive a four digit EPG number (0 prefix + three digits).\n\nThe EPG differs depending on the viewer's location due to limited regional availability of certain channels or conditions relating to their [[must-carry]] status. For example, this ensures that viewers get access to the correct BBC or ITV region or that [[S4C]] gets a prominent listing in Wales.\n\nAll channels are grouped into categories depending on their content. What section of the EPG a channel gets allocated is determined by rules set up by Sky.\n\nSky has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG, with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from [[Ofcom]]. Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28\u00b0 East is entitled to access to Sky's EPG for a fee, ranging from \u00a315\u2013100,000. Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a Sky leased transponder, or actual payment for being carried. However, even in this case, Sky does not carry any control over the channel's content or carriage issues such as picture quality.\n\nIn October 2007, Sky announced that they would not accept new applications to launch channel on their EPG, citing \"very significant memory constraints\" on many of its older digiboxes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/05/bskyb.business|title=Sky to reject new channel applications|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, Sky launched a new EPG dubbed \"Darwin\" for their Sky+HD receivers, offering a more modern, refreshed interface and some improved functionality. Newer SkyQ UHD receivers utilise different hardware, so run a different software stack.\n\n====Numbering system====\nThe EPG numbering is altered frequently when new channels launch or receive new numbers. A few times, the EPG has been substantially altered. For example:\n*In early 2006, most channels received new numbering. This shake-up intended to split up the original ten categories in sixteen. For example, several channels that had been listed under the 'Entertainment' category where split off into a new 'Lifestyle & Culture' category while the 'News & Documentaries' category was split into two. The 'Specialist' category, which had included shopping, dating, gambling, international and adult channels was split into several genres.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/sky-in-epg-shake-up/1022082.article|title=Sky in EPG shake-up|date=31 March 2005|publisher=Broadcast}}</ref>\n*Following the integration of [[Living TV Group]] into [[BSkyB|Sky]] in early 2011, several prominent slots were freed up as many channels were closed down. It was, reported Broadband TV News, the biggest reshuffle in EPG positions for over a decade, with MTV, Comedy Central, Universal Channel, Syfy, News Corporation's FX, and 40 HD channels moving to more prominent places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/21/sky-epg-shake-viewing-habits/ |title=Why Sky EPG Changes Won't Shake Viewing Habits |publisher=Tvgenius.net |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429155735/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/21/sky-epg-shake-viewing-habits/ |archivedate=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Documentaries and other channels moving towards general entertainment programming and many other channel categories being overspilled into other parts of the EPG. Sky reshuffled the channels again on 1 May 2018 which merged the documentaries and entertainment channels making many documentaries move to more prominent slots which had been occupied by time shift and standard definition channels which had been given their own areas in the 200s and 800s with the 800s being also filled with SD channels from other categories.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://storage.sky.com/prod/helpcentre/UK_TV_GUIDE_307748A02_2.pdf |title= Sky UK TV Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Competition==\nOn 12 July 2011, former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] claimed that Sky's largest shareholder \u2013 [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] \u2013 attempted to affect government policy with regards to the [[BBC]] in pursuit of its own commercial interests.<ref name=\"Brown accuses News International of using known criminals\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14120143 \"Brown accuses News International of using 'known criminals,'\"], BBC News, Tuesday 12 July 2011</ref> He went further, in a speech in Parliament on 13 July 2011, stating:\n\n<blockquote>\"Mr James Murdoch, which included his cold assertion that profit not standards was what mattered in the media, underpinned an ever more aggressive News International and Sky agenda under his and Mrs Brooks\u2019 leadership that was brutal in its simplicity. Their aim was to cut the BBC licence fee, to force BBC online to charge for its content, for the BBC to sell off its commercial activities, to open up more national sporting events to bids from Sky and move them away from the BBC, to open up the cable and satellite infrastructure market, and to reduce the power of their regulator, Ofcom.

I believe that the bundling of channels so as to increase the profit and make it impossible for others to participate in the market is anti-competitive. I believe that the way in which the application programming interface\u2014the operating system\u2014has been used has been anti-competitive and that Sky has deliberately set about selling set-top boxes elsewhere, outside areas where they have proper rights. If one visits a flat in Spain where a British person lives, one finds that they mysteriously manage to have a Sky box there even though it is registered to a house in the United Kingdom.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110713/debtext/110713-0004.htm |title=Hansard, House of Commons Debates 13 July 2011:Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for BSkyB (Column 416\u2013417) |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011 |publisher=Parliament.uk}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Virgin Media dispute==\n[[Virgin Media]] (re-branded in 2007 from ''NTL:Telewest'') started to offer a [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) capable set top box, although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel, [[BBC HD]], after the conclusion of the [[ITV HD]] trial.

Discovery stated 'enough is enough' and claimed that Sky is paying less for its channels than it was ten years ago. In that time, Discovery had stated that its viewing share has grown by more than 20%.

It was based on an idea by then CEO [[Sam Chisholm]] and chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]] of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept.

The Guardian; 25 October 1993;</ref>\n\n===Launch of Sky Digital===\nBSkyB's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then. At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded [[Open....]] now called [[Sky Active]], BSkyB competed with the [[ITV Digital|ONdigital]] (later ''ITV Digital'') terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which helped bolster BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.\n\nIn addition to most channels from the Sky Multichannels package, Sky Digital launched with several new channels that were exclusive to the digital offer.\n\nThe switch-over from analogue to digital proceeded relatively quickly. In 1998, there were 6 million 'multichannel' TV homes in the UK (i.e. homes that watch television other than the traditional analogue terrestrial), and over half of these homes watched television using BSkyB's analogue service. BSkyB's digital service surpassed the analogue service in terms of subscribers in late 1999.<ref>http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/tv-research/dso3.pdf</ref>\n\nBy June 2000 the service had 3.6 million subscribers, which gave BSkyB 8.988 million subscribers across all platforms. This substantial growth reflected BSkyB's 34% share of viewers in multi-channel homes (up from 13.4% from 1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/10/104016/reports/ar00.pdf|format=PDF|title=British Sky Broadcasting Group plc Annual Report 2000|website=media.corporate-ir.net}}</ref>\n\nBSkyB's analogue service ended in October 2001, and the digital service would eventually be marketed as just 'Sky'.\n\nBy June 2005, the number of digital subscribers increase to 7.8m, while it produced 38,375 hours of sport in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/publications/fact_book_2005.pdf|title=Error page|work=sky.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927223016/http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/publications/fact_book_2005.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2005, in partnership with [[Vodafone]], [[Sky Mobile TV]] was launched which was the UK's first commercially available mobile TV service.

Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering \u2014 However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely.\n\nIt was the country's most popular digital TV service until it was overtaken by [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in April 2007.<ref name=\"Freeview digital overtakes Sky\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1609240/Freeview-digital-overtakes-Sky.html|title=Freeview digital overtakes Sky|work=This is Money}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the migration to Astra 2E, 2F and 2G, Sky was transmitted from the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites located at [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0 east]] ([[Astra 2A|2A]]/[[Astra 2C|2C]]/[[Astra 2E|2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]) and [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat 33C]] satellite at 28.5\u00b0E.\n\nAs of 2019, Astra 2E, 2F and 2G are the sole satellites used by Sky UK;<ref name=\"SatExpat Sky UK satellites\">{{cite web |url=http://en.satexpat.com/tv/uk/sky/ |title=Sky UK \u2013 Frequency and channel list \u2013 Astra 2 UK Spotbeam and Astra 2 European Beam |date=2019-04-23 |accessdate=2019-04-23 }}</ref> a number of services are served via narrow UK-only [[spot beam]]s, the other services downlinked with a Europe-wide footprint.

Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted, some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription (known as free-to-view), some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription, and some are pay-per-view services. To view the encrypted content a [[VideoGuard]] UK equipped receiver (all of which are dedicated to the Sky service, and cannot be used to decrypt other services) needs to be used. Unofficial [[conditional-access module|CAMs]] are now available to view the service, although use of\nthem breaks the user's contract with Sky and invalidates the user's rights to use the card.\n\n===Standard definition broadcasts===\nSky's standard definition broadcasts are in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-compliant [[MPEG-2]], with the [[Sky Cinema]] and [[Sky Box Office]] channels including optional [[Dolby Digital]] soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using [[MPEG-4]] and most of the HD material uses the [[DVB-S2]] standard. Interactive services and 7-day [[EPG]] use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including [[modem]]s for a return path. [[Sky News]], amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-[[video on demand]] interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.\n\n===Digital satellite receivers===\nSky utilises the [[VideoGuard]] pay-TV scrambling system owned by [[NDS Group|NDS]], a [[Cisco Systems]] company. There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] CAMs ([[conditional-access module]]s). Sky has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service. The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others. This extends to the [[Personal video recorder]] (PVR) offering (branded [[Sky+]]).\n\n===Electronic programme guide===\n\n====Technology====\nSky maintains an [[electronic programme guide]] (EPG) which provides information about upcoming programmes and a list of channels. TV channels available on Sky are assigned a three digit [[logical channel number]] which can be entered on a remote control to access the channel and determines in what order channels are listed. Radio channels similarly receive a four digit EPG number (0 prefix + three digits).\n\nThe EPG differs depending on the viewer's location due to limited regional availability of certain channels or conditions relating to their [[must-carry]] status. For example, this ensures that viewers get access to the correct BBC or ITV region or that [[S4C]] gets a prominent listing in Wales.\n\nAll channels are grouped into categories depending on their content. What section of the EPG a channel gets allocated is determined by rules set up by Sky.\n\nSky has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG, with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from [[Ofcom]]. Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28\u00b0 East is entitled to access to Sky's EPG for a fee, ranging from \u00a315\u2013100,000. Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a Sky leased transponder, or actual payment for being carried. However, even in this case, Sky does not carry any control over the channel's content or carriage issues such as picture quality.\n\nIn October 2007, Sky announced that they would not accept new applications to launch channel on their EPG, citing \"very significant memory constraints\" on many of its older digiboxes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/05/bskyb.business|title=Sky to reject new channel applications|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, Sky launched a new EPG dubbed \"Darwin\" for their Sky+HD receivers, offering a more modern, refreshed interface and some improved functionality. Newer SkyQ UHD receivers utilise different hardware, so run a different software stack.\n\n====Numbering system====\nThe EPG numbering is altered frequently when new channels launch or receive new numbers. A few times, the EPG has been substantially altered. For example:\n*In early 2006, most channels received new numbering. This shake-up intended to split up the original ten categories in sixteen. For example, several channels that had been listed under the 'Entertainment' category where split off into a new 'Lifestyle & Culture' category while the 'News & Documentaries' category was split into two. The 'Specialist' category, which had included shopping, dating, gambling, international and adult channels was split into several genres.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/sky-in-epg-shake-up/1022082.article|title=Sky in EPG shake-up|date=31 March 2005|publisher=Broadcast}}</ref>\n*Following the integration of [[Living TV Group]] into [[BSkyB|Sky]] in early 2011, several prominent slots were freed up as many channels were closed down. It was, reported Broadband TV News, the biggest reshuffle in EPG positions for over a decade, with MTV, Comedy Central, Universal Channel, Syfy, News Corporation's FX, and 40 HD channels moving to more prominent places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/21/sky-epg-shake-viewing-habits/ |title=Why Sky EPG Changes Won't Shake Viewing Habits |publisher=Tvgenius.net |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429155735/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/21/sky-epg-shake-viewing-habits/ |archivedate=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Documentaries and other channels moving towards general entertainment programming and many other channel categories being overspilled into other parts of the EPG. Sky reshuffled the channels again on 1 May 2018 which merged the documentaries and entertainment channels making many documentaries move to more prominent slots which had been occupied by time shift and standard definition channels which had been given their own areas in the 200s and 800s with the 800s being also filled with SD channels from other categories.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://storage.sky.com/prod/helpcentre/UK_TV_GUIDE_307748A02_2.pdf |title= Sky UK TV Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Competition==\nOn 12 July 2011, former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] claimed that Sky's largest shareholder \u2013 [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] \u2013 attempted to affect government policy with regards to the [[BBC]] in pursuit of its own commercial interests.<ref name=\"Brown accuses News International of using known criminals\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14120143 \"Brown accuses News International of using 'known criminals,'\"], BBC News, Tuesday 12 July 2011</ref> He went further, in a speech in Parliament on 13 July 2011, stating:\n\n<blockquote>\"Mr James Murdoch, which included his cold assertion that profit not standards was what mattered in the media, underpinned an ever more aggressive News International and Sky agenda under his and Mrs Brooks\u2019 leadership that was brutal in its simplicity. Their aim was to cut the BBC licence fee, to force BBC online to charge for its content, for the BBC to sell off its commercial activities, to open up more national sporting events to bids from Sky and move them away from the BBC, to open up the cable and satellite infrastructure market, and to reduce the power of their regulator, Ofcom.

I believe that the bundling of channels so as to increase the profit and make it impossible for others to participate in the market is anti-competitive. I believe that the way in which the application programming interface\u2014the operating system\u2014has been used has been anti-competitive and that Sky has deliberately set about selling set-top boxes elsewhere, outside areas where they have proper rights. If one visits a flat in Spain where a British person lives, one finds that they mysteriously manage to have a Sky box there even though it is registered to a house in the United Kingdom.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110713/debtext/110713-0004.htm |title=Hansard, House of Commons Debates 13 July 2011:Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for BSkyB (Column 416\u2013417) |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011 |publisher=Parliament.uk}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Virgin Media dispute==\n[[Virgin Media]] (re-branded in 2007 from ''NTL:Telewest'') started to offer a [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) capable set top box, although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel, [[BBC HD]], after the conclusion of the [[ITV HD]] trial.
