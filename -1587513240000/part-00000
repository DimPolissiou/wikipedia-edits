The novel tackles the issues of abortion and racism as they were in late 1960s America.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nDr. John Berry, the protagonist, is a pathologist working in Boston during the 1960s, a time when [[Abortion in the United States|abortion was illegal in the United States]]. The story opens with an introduction of the various requirements and challenges of the medical profession during the era. Subsequently, Dr. Berry is notified that his friend, an [[obstetrician]] named Arthur Lee, has been arrested and accused of performing an illegal abortion that led to the death of Karen Randall, a member of a prominent Boston medical dynasty. Berry does not believe the allegations, but the situation is further complicated by the fact that Lee is already well-known within the medical community as an abortion provider and that Berry has in the past helped Lee disguise medical samples to hide the fact that Lee's [[dilation and curettage]] patients were pregnant.\n\nAfter visiting his friend in jail, Berry sets out to prove Lee's innocence. He investigates the personal life of the dead woman, creating an accurate portrait of her past, psychology, and character. During his search, which lasts several days, vandals attack Lee's home. The protagonist's knowledge of medicine and law are helpful in overcoming various barriers in his search, including a hostile police captain and bribes from the scion of the Randall family itself: Karen's father, a well-established (though mediocre) doctor.\n\nEventually, with the aid of an unscrupulous lawyer named Wilson, Berry is able to obtain solid evidence showing Karen Randall's uncle (who had already performed three previous abortions for her) to be the culprit. Nonetheless, Berry is troubled by this conclusion and continues his investigation despite Wilson's displeasure. Eventually, he discovers that Karen's drug-dealing friends, Roman and Angela, performed the botched abortion, but Berry is attacked and sent to the hospital before he can reveal his discovery. Subsequently, Berry's attacker, who turns out to be Karen's African-American boyfriend, is also brought in an ambulance, dead after a fatal fall. The actual abortionist attempts to commit suicide. Berry forces her to confess in the hospital by threatening her with what she believes is an excruciatingly painful dose of [[Nalorphine]] (but is actually water).\n\nBerry continues to be suspicious about Karen's boyfriend's death, and ultimately forces one of his old friends and colleagues (the uncle of the woman who did Karen's abortion) to admit to his involvement before turning him in to the police. However, despite being proven innocent, Lee's reputation has been ruined, and he decides to move to California. The novel ends with several appendices describing some lesser-known aspects of the medical profession and a postscript discussing current problems in medicine, including abortion.\n\n==Background==\nCrichton had published several novels under the pseudonym John Lange but felt since this one was more serious than the Lange books it needed to come out under a different name.

It is an [[obstacle race]] over the distance of the [[3000 metres]], which derives its name from the [[horse racing steeplechase]].\n\n==Rules==\nIt is one of the track events in the [[Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[World Championships in Athletics]]; it is also an event recognized by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF).<ref name=IAAF>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/middlelong/3000-metres-steeplechase|title=3000 metres steeplechase|publisher=International Association of Athletics Federations|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> The obstacles for the men are {{convert|914|mm|in}} high, and for the women {{convert|762|mm|in}}.\n\nThe water jump consists of a barrier followed by a pit of water with a landing area defined as follows: The pit is 3.66m (12 feet) square. The pit's forward-direction measurement starts from the approach edge of the barrier and ends at the point where the water jump slope reaches the flat surface of the steeple pathway. Rulebook language simply but clearly says \"The water jump, including the hurdle, shall be 3.66m in length.\" Pits have an upward slope; the water is deeper near the barrier and is within 2&nbsp;cm of ground level at the departure end. That slope begins approximately {{cvt|30|cm}} forward of the barrier at which point the water is {{cvt|70|cm}} deep.\n\nThe length of the race is usually {{convert|3000|m|ft}}; junior and some [[Masters athletics|masters]] events are {{convert|2000|m|ft}}, as women's events used to be. The circuit has four ordinary barriers and one water jump. During the course of the race, each runner must clear a total of 28 ordinary barriers and seven water jumps.  This entails seven complete laps after starting with a fraction of a lap run without barriers.  The water jump is located on the back turn, either inside the inner lane or outside the outer lane.  If it is on the outside, then each of the seven laps is longer than the standard 400&nbsp;m, and the starting point is on the home straight.  If the water jump is on the inside, each lap is shorter than 400&nbsp;m, the starting point is on the back straight, so the water jump and barrier in the home straight are bypassed in the first half lap at the start.\n\n[[File:Prekazka.svg|thumb|right|400px|The dimension of an obstacle]]\n\nUnlike those used in [[hurdling]], steeplechase barriers do not fall over if hit, and rules allow an athlete to negotiate the barrier by any means, so many runners step on top of them. Four barriers are spaced around the track on level ground, and a fifth barrier at the top of the second turn (fourth barrier in a complete lap from the finish line) is the water jump. The slope of the water jump rewards runners with more jumping ability, because a longer jump results in a shallower landing in the water.\n\n==All-time top 25 steeplechase runners==\n{{see also|3000

common distance for the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] in [[track and field]]. It is an [[obstacle race]] over the distance of the [[3000 metres]], which derives its name from the [[horse racing steeplechase]].\n\n==Rules==\nIt is one of the track events in the [[Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[World Championships in Athletics]]; it is also an event recognized by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF).<ref name=IAAF>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/middlelong/3000-metres-steeplechase|title=3000 metres steeplechase|publisher=International Association of Athletics Federations|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> The obstacles for the men are {{convert|914|mm|in}} high, and for the women {{convert|762|mm|in}}.\n\nThe water jump consists of a barrier followed by a pit of water with a landing area defined as follows: The pit is 3.66m (12 feet) square. The pit's forward-direction measurement starts from the approach edge of the barrier and ends at the point where the water jump slope reaches the flat surface of the steeple pathway. Rulebook language simply but clearly says \"The water jump, including the hurdle, shall be 3.66m in length.\" Pits have an upward slope; the water is deeper near the barrier and is within 2&nbsp;cm of ground level at the departure end. That slope begins approximately {{cvt|30|cm}} forward of the barrier at which point the water is {{cvt|70|cm}} deep.\n\nThe length of the race is usually {{convert|3000|m|ft}}; junior and some [[Masters athletics|masters]] events are {{convert|2000|m|ft}}, as women's events used to be. The circuit has four ordinary barriers and one water jump. During the course of the race, each runner must clear a total of 28 ordinary barriers and seven water jumps.  This entails seven complete laps after starting with a fraction of a lap run without barriers.  The water jump is located on the back turn, either inside the inner lane or outside the outer lane.  If it is on the outside, then each of the seven laps is longer than the standard 400&nbsp;m, and the starting point is on the home straight.  If the water jump is on the inside, each lap is shorter than 400&nbsp;m, the starting point is on the back straight, so the water jump and barrier in the home straight are bypassed in the first half lap at the start.\n\n[[File:Prekazka.svg|thumb|right|400px|The dimension of an obstacle]]\n\nUnlike those used in [[hurdling]], steeplechase barriers do not fall over if hit, and rules allow an athlete to negotiate the barrier by any means, so many runners step on top of them. Four barriers are spaced around the track on level ground, and a fifth barrier at the top of the second turn (fourth barrier in a complete lap from the finish line) is the water jump. The slope of the water jump rewards runners with more jumping ability, because a longer jump results in a shallower landing in the water.\n\n==All-time top 25 steeplechase runners==\n{{see also|3000

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the [[industrial rock]] and [[electro-industrial]] genres. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by [[cEvin Key]] (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band [[Images in Vogue]], Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist [[Nivek Ogre]] (Kevin Ogilvie).\n\nOver the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included [[Dwayne Goettel]] (1986\u20131995), [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] (long-time associate, producer, and \"unofficial\" fourth member until 1996), [[Mark Walk]] (2003\u2013present), and a number of guests, including [[Bill Leeb]] (1985\u20131986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), [[Al Jourgensen]] (1989), [[Danny Carey]] (2004), and many others.\n\nAfter the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label [[Nettwerk]], anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP ''[[Remission (Skinny Puppy album)|Remission]]'' in 1984 to their 1992 album ''[[Last Rights (album)|Last Rights]]'', Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated [[cult following]],<ref name=\"Chartattack 2001-07-20\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans|title=Doomsday Comes For Skinny Puppy Fans|accessdate=16 May 2007|publisher=[[Chartattack]]|date=20 July 2001|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607101127/http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans|archivedate=7 June 2011}}</ref> fusing elements of [[industrial music|industrial]], [[funk music|funk]],\n[[noise music|noise]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[electro music|electro]], and rock music and making innovative use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as [[chemical warfare]] and [[animal testing]].\n\nIn 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] and relocating to [[Malibu, California]], where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, ''[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]'' (1996). Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. Key and Ogre, already active in [[List of Skinny Puppy side projects|a number of other projects]], went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the [[Doomsday Festival]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with producer Mark Walk, they released their ninth album, ''[[The Greater Wrong of the Right]]'' (2004), which was followed by the release of the albums ''[[Mythmaker]]'' (2007) and ''[[HanDover]]'' (2011). In 2013, they released their twelfth album, ''[[Weapon (album)|Weapon]]'', which was inspired by allegations that their music had been used for torture in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and first releases (1982\u20131985)===\nSkinny Puppy formed in 1982 as a side project for Kevin Crompton in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.<ref name=\"Reed (2013) p. 172\">{{harvnb|Reed|2013|p=172}}</ref> Crompton was dissatisfied with the pop direction of the band he was in, [[Images in Vogue]], and began Skinny Puppy with the intention of doing something more compelling and experimental.<ref name=IiVbio>{{cite web|last1=Mercer|first1=Laurie|title=Images in Vogue Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/images-in-vogue-mn0000910004|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701221852/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/images-in-vogue-mn0000910004|archivedate=1 July 2016}}</ref> Images in Vogue had become a popular act in [[Vancouver]], achieving several radio hits<ref name=\"GeoStraight\">{{cite web|last1=Lucas|first1=John|title=From the Vault: A Vancouver Classic by Images in Vogue|url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/612136/vault-vancouver-classic-images-vogue|website=The Georgia Straight|publisher=straight.com|accessdate=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916211327/http://www.straight.com/blogra/612136/vault-vancouver-classic-images-vogue|archivedate=16 September 2016}}</ref> and opening for groups such as [[Duran Duran]], [[Depeche Mode]], and [[Roxy Music]].<ref name=\"PNTinterview\">{{cite web|last1=Burnsilver|first1=Glenn|title=Skinny Puppy's Music Was Used for Torture, So They Invoiced the Government|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/skinny-puppys-music-was-used-for-torture-so-they-invoiced-the-government-6588359|website=Phoenix New Times|publisher=phoenixnewtimes.com|accessdate=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716204958/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/skinny-puppys-music-was-used-for-torture-so-they-invoiced-the-government-6588359|archivedate=16 July 2016}}</ref> Crompton had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in Images in Vogue; however, when Images in Vogue relocated to [[Toronto]], Crompton made Skinny Puppy his full-time project.<ref name=\"IIV\">{{cite web|url=http://imagesinvogue.ca/history.html|title=A Short History|publisher=The Official Images in Vogue Site|accessdate=27 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216221832/http://imagesinvogue.ca/history.html |archivedate=16 February 2006}}</ref> Crompton had already created the name for the project and recorded several songs when he asked Kevin Graham Ogilvie to join.

Key would continue to drum for Images in Vogue until the group relocated to Toronto in 1985.<ref name=\"Barclay et al (2011) p. 507\" /> Key's concept behind Skinny Puppy came from the group's first song ever recorded, \"K-9\". The idea, according to Key, was to create music which explored \"life as seen through a dog's eyes\".<ref name=\"Barclay et al (2011) p. 507\" /><ref name=Gilmore /> Skinny Puppy also incorporated the use of \"B-grade horror movie visuals\", including fake blood and props, into their live performances.{{sfn|Barclay et al.|2011|p= 510}} Key justified these \"shock gore\" antics with the following:\n\n<blockquote>What we're presenting isn't much different from what [the audience] is subjected to in everyday life.

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the [[industrial rock]] and [[electro-industrial]] genres. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by [[cEvin Key]] (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band [[Images in Vogue]], Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist [[Nivek Ogre]] (Kevin Ogilvie). \n\nOver the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included [[Dwayne Goettel]] (1986\u20131995), [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] (long-time associate, producer, and \"unofficial\" fourth member until 1996), [[Mark Walk]] (2003\u2013present), and a number of guests, including [[Bill Leeb]] (1985\u20131986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), [[Al Jourgensen]] (1989), [[Danny Carey]] (2004), and many others.\n\nAfter the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label [[Nettwerk]], anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP ''[[Remission (Skinny Puppy album)|Remission]]'' in 1984 to their 1992 album ''[[Last Rights (album)|Last Rights]]'', Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated [[cult following]],<ref name=\"Chartattack 2001-07-20\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans|title=Doomsday Comes For Skinny Puppy Fans|accessdate=16 May 2007|publisher=[[Chartattack]]|date=20 July 2001|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607101127/http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans|archivedate=7 June 2011}}</ref> fusing elements of [[industrial music|industrial]], [[funk music|funk]],\n[[noise music|noise]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[electro music|electro]], and rock music and making innovative use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as [[chemical warfare]] and [[animal testing]].\n\nIn 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] and relocating to [[Malibu, California]], where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, ''[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]'' (1996). Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. Key and Ogre, already active in [[List of Skinny Puppy side projects|a number of other projects]], went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the [[Doomsday Festival]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with producer Mark Walk, they released their ninth album, ''[[The Greater Wrong of the Right]]'' (2004), which was followed by the release of the albums ''[[Mythmaker]]'' (2007) and ''[[HanDover]]'' (2011). In 2013, they released their twelfth album, ''[[Weapon (album)|Weapon]]'', which was inspired by allegations that their music had been used for torture in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and first releases (1982\u20131985)===\nSkinny Puppy formed in 1982 as a side project for Kevin Crompton in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.<ref name=\"Reed (2013) p. 172\">{{harvnb|Reed|2013|p=172}}</ref> Crompton was dissatisfied with the pop direction of the band he was in, [[Images in Vogue]], and began Skinny Puppy with the intention of doing something more compelling and experimental.<ref name=IiVbio>{{cite web|last1=Mercer|first1=Laurie|title=Images in Vogue Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/images-in-vogue-mn0000910004|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701221852/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/images-in-vogue-mn0000910004|archivedate=1 July 2016}}</ref> Images in Vogue had become a popular act in [[Vancouver]], achieving several radio hits<ref name=\"GeoStraight\">{{cite web|last1=Lucas|first1=John|title=From the Vault: A Vancouver Classic by Images in Vogue|url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/612136/vault-vancouver-classic-images-vogue|website=The Georgia Straight|publisher=straight.com|accessdate=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916211327/http://www.straight.com/blogra/612136/vault-vancouver-classic-images-vogue|archivedate=16 September 2016}}</ref> and opening for groups such as [[Duran Duran]], [[Depeche Mode]], and [[Roxy Music]].<ref name=\"PNTinterview\">{{cite web|last1=Burnsilver|first1=Glenn|title=Skinny Puppy's Music Was Used for Torture, So They Invoiced the Government|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/skinny-puppys-music-was-used-for-torture-so-they-invoiced-the-government-6588359|website=Phoenix New Times|publisher=phoenixnewtimes.com|accessdate=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716204958/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/skinny-puppys-music-was-used-for-torture-so-they-invoiced-the-government-6588359|archivedate=16 July 2016}}</ref> Crompton had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in Images in Vogue; however, when Images in Vogue relocated to [[Toronto]], Crompton made Skinny Puppy his full-time project.<ref name=\"IIV\">{{cite web|url=http://imagesinvogue.ca/history.html|title=A Short History|publisher=The Official Images in Vogue Site|accessdate=27 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216221832/http://imagesinvogue.ca/history.html |archivedate=16 February 2006}}</ref> Crompton had already created the name for the project and recorded several songs when he asked Kevin Graham Ogilvie to join.

Key would continue to drum for Images in Vogue until the group relocated to Toronto in 1985.<ref name=\"Barclay et al (2011) p. 507\" /> Key's concept behind Skinny Puppy came from the group's first song ever recorded, \"K-9\".

Jimmy asks Mike for details about why Mike has been protecting him, but Mike hangs up. Jimmy tells Kim the truth about his desert trek with Mike. Kim and Jimmy check into a downtown hotel for their safety.\n\nMike tells Gus that Lalo and Nacho went to Lalo's [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] home. Gus tells Mike he has sent assassins after Lalo and suggests Nacho can help them. Lalo and Nacho arrive at Lalo's house, an expansive hacienda located within a large, walled compound, and are warmly greeted by family and friends. Nacho receives a call telling him to open Lalo's back gate at 3 a.m.\n\nKim ignores Jimmy's request to remain at the hotel and visits the courthouse. She meets with the public defender and accepts 20 pending felony cases ''pro bono''. She tells Howard she quit Schweikart and Cokely. Howard tells Kim about Jimmy's recent harassment and assumes Jimmy is behind Kim's decision. Kim laughs at Howard, says she is insulted by the notion that she cannot decide for herself, and tells Howard he does not understand Jimmy. Howard angrily tells her that Chuck knew Jimmy better than anyone else.\n\nLalo prepares Nacho for his first meeting with Don Eladio. At the meeting, Lalo explains that Nacho is associated with Tuco and will manage the Salamanca drug business while Lalo is in Mexico. Eladio is impressed with Nacho's plans to expand the Salamanca territory and gives his blessing.\n\nJimmy goes to Mike's house and demands that Mike explain why Mike has been aiding him. Mike reveals that Lalo will be killed that night, and Jimmy informs Kim. Kim, still angered by Howard's comments, proposes a forced resolution of the Sandpiper case by sabotaging Howard, which would enable Jimmy to receive his seven-figure share of the settlement.
