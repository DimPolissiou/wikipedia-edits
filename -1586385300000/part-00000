When Horty wins a company athletic contest, Simeon's prize is a ticket to [[Southampton]] to see the sailing of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.\n\nThe night before the ''Titanic'' departs, Horty meets a beautiful young woman named Marie, who explains that she is a chambermaid aboard the ''Titanic''.

Whether or not she succeeds is ambiguous, and she is gone when Horty awakes. Attending the departure of the Titanic, Horty spots a photographer taking a picture of Marie, and asks the photographer for the photo.\n\nUpon returning home, Horty finds that he has been promoted, but this good news is dampened by rumors of an affair between his wife, Zoe, and the foundry owner, Simeon. A bitter and jealous Horty visits a local bar to drown his sorrows. Drunk, he tells friends and co-workers about the lovely chambermaid he met in Southampton, earning him free drinks and tips. Following the sinking of the Titanic, Horty's tales become increasingly erotic, and the viewer is never sure what is truth and what is fantasy.\n\nHorty catches the attention of a traveling entertainer named Zeppe. Zeppe offers Horty the chance to escape his dismal dreary life. Horty agrees and begins to work with Zeppe, converting his story into a play. One night, Zoe attends the play; later, Horty explains his tale as a work of fiction. However, Horty's story becomes more elaborate and romantic attracting a larger audience for each re-telling steadily driving a wedge between him and his wife. Eventually Zoe demands a part in the performance, playing the role of Marie poignantly fighting against the waves after the ''Titanic'' sinks.

He also felt that \"the set pieces are bound to pale in comparison to those in [James Cameron's film] ''Titanic''.\"<ref name=Deseret/>\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Goya Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] 1997<ref name=BoxOffice/>\n* [[Goya Award for Costume Design]] 1997<ref name=BoxOffice/>\n* [[Golden Pyramid]] 1997, Bigas Luna\n* Best Director 1997, [[Cairo International Film Festival]], Bigas Luna\n* [[CEC Award]] for Best Screenplay, adapted, 1997, Bigas Luna, Cuca Canals\n* [[Turia Award]] for Best Actress 1998, Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=BoxOffice>{{cite news |title= The Chambermaid on the Titanic |author= Kim Williamson |url= http://www.boxoffice.com/reviews/theatrical/2008-08-the-chambermaid-on-the-titanic |newspaper= Box Office Magazine |date= 14 August 1998 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dallas>{{cite news |title= A night to remember |author= Bill Gallo |url= http://www.dallasobserver.com/1998-09-17/film/a-night-to-remember/ |newspaper= Dallas Observer |date= 17 September 1998 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Deseret>{{cite news |title= Chambermaid, The |author= Jeff Vice |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700002113/Chambermaid-The.html |newspaper= Deseret News |date= 9 October 1998 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news |title= A Sensual Story the Heart Tells the Head |author= Stephen Holden |url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A04E7DE133AF937A2575BC0A96E958260 |newspaper= New York Times |date= 14 August 1998 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Metro>{{cite news |title= Mythic Romance |author= Richard von Busack |url= http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.03.98/chambermaid-9835.html |newspaper= Metro |date= 3\u20139 September 1998 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Phoenix>{{cite news |title= Chambermaid cleans up on the Titanic |author= Peter Keough |url= http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archives/1998/documents/00525400.htm |newspaper= The Phoenix |date= 27 August 1998 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Rotten>{{rotten-tomatoes|id=chambermaid_on_the_titanic|title=The Chambermaid on the Titanic}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=SFChronicle>{{cite news |title= More Legendary Romance on Titanic `Chambermaid' looks at power of fantasies |author= Mick LaSalle |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/09/04/DD40419.DTL#ixzz1Pj7laoqt |newspaper= San Francisco Chronicle |date= 4 September 1998 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0129923|La Femme de chambre du Titanic}}\n* [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117912385?refcatid=31 Review in Variety]\n\n{{Bigas Luna}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chambermaid On The Titanic}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films about RMS Titanic]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1912]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bigas Luna]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alberto Iglesias]]\n", "name_user": "Jmg38", "label": "safe", "comment": "7-to-9-year-old redlinks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chambermaid_on_the_Titanic"}

Within the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the five hindrances are identified as obstacles to [[samatha]] (tranquility) meditation. Contemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] teachers identify the five hindrances as obstacles to [[Mindfulness|mindfulness meditation]].\n\nThe five hindrances are:{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}{{sfn|Wallace|2006|pp=158-159}}<ref group=web name=b2001/>{{dead link|date=August 2018}}<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n# Sensory desire (''[[k\u0101ma]]<nowiki>cchanda</nowiki>''): the particular type of wanting that seeks for happiness through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling.\n# Ill-will (''vy\u0101p\u0101da''; also spelled ''by\u0101p\u0101da''):  all kinds of thought related to wanting to reject; feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness.\n# Sloth-and-torpor (''[[th\u012bna]]-[[middha]]''): heaviness of body and dullness of mind which drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression.\n# Restlessness-and-worry (''[[uddhacca]]-[[kukkucca]]''): the inability to calm the mind.\n# Doubt (''[[vicikicch\u0101]]''): lack of conviction or trust.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Within the Buddhist traditions===\nThe five hindrances are identified in the major Buddhist traditions of [[Theravada Buddhism]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], as well in the contemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] tradition. But the hindrances are presented differently within these different traditions, depending upon the way each tradition teaches the practice of meditation.\n\n;Contemporary Insight Meditation:\nContemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] teacher [[Gil Fronsdal]] describes the hindrances as \"a very important list of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental states]] that have a big impact on meditation practice and people\u2019s daily lives.\" Fronsdal emphasizes that it is important not to see the hindrances as personal failings. All human beings have them. A big part of mindfulness meditation is to learn about these hindrances in order to become free of them. Therefore, Fronsdal states, the goal is to not dismiss them, but to study them and understand them really well.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}\n\nContemporary teacher [[Jack Kornfield]] described the five hindrances as \"difficult energies which arise in the mind and in one's life as a part of meditation practice.\"<ref group=web name=k1>[http://www.caringawareness.com/community/VolIII/Books/JK_Hindrances2.html The Five Hindrances-2 by Jack Kornfield] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026134307/http://www.caringawareness.com/community/VolIII/Books/JK_Hindrances2.html |date=2012-10-26 }}</ref>\n\n;Theravada tradition:\nContemporary Theravada scholar Nina van Gorkom states: \"The hindrances are obstructions, overwhelming the mind, weakening insight.[...] The hindrances obstruct the development of what is wholesome.\"<ref group=web name=nina1>[https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/cetasikas/d/doc2873.html Different Groups Of Defilements Part II, Nina van Gorkom]</ref>\n\nWithin the Theravada tradition, the five hindrances are identified specifically as obstacles to the [[jh\u0101na]]s (stages of concentration) within meditation. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher [[Ajahn Brahmavamso]] states:<ref group=web name=b2001>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Gt5hSX0EGjkJ:www.dhammatalks.net/Books7/Ajahn_Brahm_Five_Hindrances.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjae0cxvWrUHJDKcwEZcvBx4XgEqWqqmk_0Y_nRqvACIxXjxwSh7pyCY00KOO0JW9DiKrPR_9XuNq-fZGUsqJbloC4xwLgZMfjltOqWSP8_bWvrksc_a5tjxJ9Acqea1jHfR3dm&sig=AHIEtbRsGoEAn-GXCI-LWctEQin1flxZtg The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Brahmavamso (2001)]</ref>\n:The deliberate idea of overcoming these five hindrances is important because it is the five hindrances that block the door to both the jh\u0101nas, and wisdom. It\u2019s the five hindrances that fuel [[avijj\u0101]]. The Buddha said that they\u2019re the nutriments, the food of delusion.\n\nAjahn Brahmavamso emphasizes that any obstacle that arises in meditation can be identified as one of the five hindrances; he states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n:Any problem which arises in meditation will be one of these Five Hindrances, or a combination. So, if one experiences any difficulty, use the scheme of the Five Hindrances as a 'check list' to identify the main problem. Then you will know the appropriate remedy, apply it carefully, and go beyond the obstacle into deeper meditation. When the Five Hindrances are fully overcome, there is no barrier between the meditator and the bliss of Jhana. Therefore, the certain test that these Five Hindrances are really overcome is the ability to access Jhana.\n\n;Mahayana tradition:\nWithin the Mahayana tradition, the five hindrances are typically identified as obstacles to [[samatha]] meditation (also referred to as tranquility meditation).{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}\n\n===Overcoming the hindrances===\nAll of the Buddhist traditions emphasize that the hindrances are overcome by investigating and understanding them. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher [[Ajahn Sumedho]] states:<ref group=web>[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/sumedho/fivehind.html The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Sumedho]</ref>\n: In meditation one develops an understanding of the Five Hindrances -- how, when one of them is present, you investigate it, you understand it, you accept its presence and you learn how to deal with it. Sometimes you can just tell it to go away and it goes; sometimes you just have to allow it to be there till it wears out.\n\nContemporary Insight Meditation teacher Gil Fronsdal emphasizes that to be a good student of the hindrances, you must be very patient with them and not be dismissive of them. When they arise, you must stop for them. Fronsdal states that a bumper sticker for this type of training could be \u201cI stop for the hindrances.\u201d You don't indulge them, Fronsdal states, you become interested and study them.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}\n\nThe Insight Meditation tradition teaches the RAIN formula for investigating the hindrances:<ref group=web>[http://insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/FiveHindrances.pdf Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation: The Five Hindrances (study notes)]</ref><ref group=web name=brach>[http://www.tarabrach.com/howtomeditate.html How to Meditate: A Guide to Formal Sitting Practice, by Tara Brach]</ref>\n\n* R: Recognize it.\n* A: Accept it.\n* I: Investigate it, be curious. What is it like?\n* N: Non-identification. This is just a passing process that comes and goes, not who we are.\n\n==The five hindrances individually==\n\n===1. Sensory desire (kamacchanda) ===\nThe hindrance of sensory desire (''kamacchanda'') is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on the pleasures of the five senses.\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso (1999) states: \"Sensory desire refers to that particular type of wanting that seeks for happiness through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling. It specifically excludes any aspiration for happiness through the sixth sense of mind alone. In its extreme form, sensory desire is an obsession to find pleasure in such things as sexual intimacy, good food or fine music. But it also includes the desire to replace irritating or even painful five-sense experiences with pleasant ones, i.e. the desire for sensory comfort.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1>[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebmed051.htm The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Brahmavamso (1999)]</ref>\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso (2001) states: \"[...] k\u0101ma chanda are anything from the extremes of lust to just being concerned with how the body is doing. Thinking about the letter that you have to write afterwards, about the rain pattering on your roof, about your kut\u012b [monk's hut], or what needs to be built next, or where you are going to next, that\u2019s all in the k\u0101maloka, the world of the senses, that\u2019s all k\u0101ma chanda. It\u2019s also k\u0101ma vitakka, or the thoughts about those things, about family, about health, about coming here, going there, and thoughts about words.<ref group=web name=b2001/>{{dead link|date=June 2016}}\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"This term alludes to the mind's tendency to latch on to something that attracts it--a thought, a visual object, or a particular emotion. When we allow the mind to indulge in such attractions, we lose our concentration. So we need to apply mindfulness and be aware of how the mind operates; we don't necessarily have to suppress all these things arising in the mind, but we should take notice of them and see how the mind behaves, how it automatically grabs onto this and that.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}\n\n;Analogy\nThe hindrance of sensory desire is compared to taking out a loan \u2013 any pleasure one experiences through these five senses must be repaid through the unpleasantness of separation or loss which invariably follow when the pleasure is used up. There is also interest to be repaid on the loan. Thus, the Buddha said that the pleasure is small compared to the suffering repaid.<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Antidote\nIn order to overcome the hindrance of sensory desire (''kamacchanda''), the meditator must first apply mindfulness and recognize that the hindrance is present.{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}<ref group=web name=cards1>[http://bodhicards.com/FIVE_HINDRANCES.html Five Hindrances Bodhi Cards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831220653/http://bodhicards.com/FIVE_HINDRANCES.html |date=August 31, 2013 }}</ref> Then one must look at the hindrance, analyze it, make it the object of our meditation, experience it fully. The meditator can then apply specific techniques such as contemplating the impermanence of the pleasant desire.<ref group=web name=cards1/>\n \nAjahn Brahmavamso emphasizes the technique of letting go of concern for the body and the five senses completely; he states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n:In meditation, one transcends sensory desire for the period by letting go of concern for this body and its five sense activity. Some imagine that the five senses are there to serve and protect the body, but the truth is that the body is there to serve the five senses as they play in the world ever seeking delight. Indeed, the Lord Buddha once said, \"The five senses ARE the world\" and to leave the world, to enjoy the other worldly bliss of Jhana, one must give up for a time ALL concern for the body and its five senses.\n\n;Etymology\nKamacchanda can be compared to giving your approval for ''[[k\u0101ma]]''-based thoughts and emotions to remain in your mind. It is allowing these thoughts to occupy your mind. Ajahn Brahmavamso explains:<ref group=web name=b2001/>\n:In the P\u0101li term ''k\u0101ma chanda'', ''chanda'' is what you have to do if you cannot attend a meeting of the community of monks, and you want to give approval and agreement to what\u2019s happening there, you give your ''chanda'' to go ahead in your absence. It\u2019s agreement, approval, consent, and it\u2019s much more subtle than mere desire. This means that you are buying into, giving in to this, you want it, you approve of it, and you allow it to happen. In the same way that we have ''chanda'' in the Vinaya, we have that ''k\u0101ma chanda''. It\u2019s as if you give your approval for the sensory world to be in your consciousness, in your mind, you accept it, approve of it, and you play with it, that\u2019s all ''chanda''. It\u2019s letting it completely occupy the mind, and it\u2019s much more subtle than just mere desire. The k\u0101ma part of ''k\u0101ma chanda'', that\u2019s all that is comprised in k\u0101maloka, the world of the five senses, which goes from the hell realms, the animal realms, the ghost realms, the human realm, and the Deva realms, to everything that is concerned with those k\u0101maloka realms. ''K\u0101ma Chanda'' is acceptance, agreement, and consent for that world to occupy you.\n\n===2. Ill will (vyapada) ===\nThe hindrance of ill will (''vyapada'') is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on anger, resentment, hostility, bitterness, etc.\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Ill will refers to the desire to punish, hurt or destroy. It includes sheer hatred of a person, or even a situation, and it can generate so much energy that it is both seductive and addictive. At the time, it always appears justified for such is its power that it easily corrupts our ability to judge fairly. It also includes ill will towards oneself, otherwise known as guilt, which denies oneself any possibility of happiness. In meditation, ill will can appear as dislike towards the meditation object itself, rejecting it so that one's attention is forced to wander elsewhere.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"The second hindrance is ''ill will''; it is the opposite of the first hindrance, being brought about by aversion rather than attraction. Ill will refers to all kinds of thought related to wanting to reject, feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness. When they arise, we should take note of them, not necessarily suppressing them, but seeing how they arise.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}\n\n;Analogy\nThe hindrance of ill will is compared to being sick. Just as sickness denies one the freedom and happiness of health, so ill will denies one the freedom and happiness of peace.<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Antidote\nThe antidote to the hindrance of ill will (''vyapada'') is meditation on loving kindness (metta). Ajahn Brahmavamso states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n:Ill will is overcome by applying Metta, loving kindness. When it is ill will towards a person, Metta teaches one to see more in that person than all that which hurts you, to understand why that person hurt you (often because they were hurting intensely themselves), and encourages one to put aside one's own pain to look with compassion on the other. But if this is more than one can do, Metta to oneself leads one to refuse to dwell in ill will to that person, so as to stop them from hurting you further with the memory of those deeds. Similarly, if it is ill will towards oneself, Metta sees more than one's own faults, can understand one's own faults, and finds the courage to forgive them, learn from their lesson and let them go. Then, if it is ill will towards the meditation object (often the reason why a meditator cannot find peace) Metta embraces the meditation object with care and delight. For example, just as a mother has a natural Metta towards her child, so a meditator can look on their breath, say, with the very same quality of caring attention. Then it will be just as unlikely to lose the breath through forgetfulness as it is unlikely for a mother to forget her baby in the shopping mall, and it would be just as improbable to drop the breath for some distracting thought as it is for a distracted mother to drop her baby! When ill will is overcome, it allows lasting relationships with other people, with oneself and, in meditation, a lasting, enjoyable relationship with the meditation object, one that can mature into the full embrace of absorption.\n\n===3. Sloth-torpor (thina-middha)===\n{{see also|th\u012bna|middha}}\n\nSloth-torpor is a dull, morbid state that is characterized by unwieldiness, lack of energy, and opposition to wholesome activity.\n\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"When this hindrance is present, we lose our focus in meditation. We may not be agitated in any perceptible way, but there is no mental clarity. We gradually become more and more drowsy, and then eventually go to sleep.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Sloth and torpor refers to that heaviness of body and dullness of mind which drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression. [...] In meditation, it causes weak and intermittent mindfulness which can even lead to falling asleep in meditation without even realising it!\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"The mind has two main functions, 'doing' and 'knowing'. The way of meditation is to calm the 'doing' to complete tranquility while maintaining the 'knowing'. Sloth and torpor occur when one carelessly calms both the 'doing' and the 'knowing', unable to distinguish between them.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Sloth and torpor is an unpleasant state of body and mind, too stiff to leap into the bliss of Jhana and too blinded to spot any insights. In short, it is a complete waste of precious time.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Analogy:\nThe hindrance of sloth-torpor is compared to being imprisoned in a cramped, dark cell, unable to move freely in the bright sunshine outside.<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Antidote:\nAjahn Brahmavamso states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n: \"Sloth and torpor is overcome by rousing energy. Energy is always available but few know how to turn on the switch, as it were. Setting a goal, a reasonable goal, is a wise and effective way to generate energy, as is deliberately developing interest in the task at hand. A young child has a natural interest, and consequent energy, because its world is so new. Thus, if one can learn to look at one's life, or one's meditation, with a 'beginner's mind' one can see ever new angles and fresh possibilities which keep one distant from sloth and torpor, alive and energetic. Similarly, one can develop delight in whatever one is doing by training one's perception to see the beautiful in the ordinary, thereby generating the interest which avoids the half-death that is sloth and torpor. [...] Sloth and torpor is a common problem which can creep up and smother one slowly. A skilful meditator keeps a sharp look-out for the first signs of sloth and torpor and is thus able to spot its approach and take evasive action before it's too late. Like coming to a fork in a road, one can take that mental path leading away from sloth and torpor.\"\n\nTraleg Kyabgon states: \"When this happens, instead of persisting with the meditation, it is better to try to refresh ourselves by getting up and going for a walk or washing our face, after which we return to our meditation.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}\n\n===4. Restlessness-worry (uddhacca-kukkucca)===\n{{see also|uddhacca|kukkucca}}\n\nThe hindrance of restlessness-worry (''uddhacca-kukkucca'') refers to a mind that is agitated and unable to settle down.\n\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Restlessness [uddhacca] refers to a mind which is like a monkey, always swinging on to the next branch, never able to stay long with anything. It is caused by the fault-finding state of mind which cannot be satisfied with things as they are, and so has to move on to the promise of something better, forever just beyond. [...] Remorse [kukkucca] refers to a specific type of restlessness which is the karmic effect of one's misdeeds.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"The fourth hindrance is ''restlessness and worry'', which refers to all the mental activities that go on in our mind due to its restless nature.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}\n* Gil Fronsdal states: \"The discomfort of restlessness creates an outward looking [tendency] \u2013 what can I do to fix this? What can I do to settle this? [...] So the challenge in restlessness is how to turn towards it and be present for it and engage it.\"<ref group=web name=gil01>[http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1808/ ''The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry'' audio talk by Gil Fronsdal]</ref>\n\n;Analogy:\nRestlessness (''uddhacca'') is compared to being a slave, continually having to jump to the orders of a tyrannical boss who always demands perfection and so never lets one stop.<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Antidote:\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n** Restlessness [uddhacca] is overcome by developing contentment, which is the opposite of fault-finding. One learns the simple joy of being satisfied with little, rather than always wanting more. One is grateful for this moment, rather than picking out its deficiencies. For instance, in meditation restlessness is often the impatience to move quickly on to the next stage. The fastest progress, though is achieved by those who are content with the stage they are on now. It is the deepening of that contentment that ripens into the next stage. \n** Remorse [kukkucca] refers to a specific type of restlessness which is the kammic effect of one's misdeeds. The only way to overcome remorse, the restlessness of a bad conscience, is to purify one's virtue and become kind, wise and gentle. It is virtually impossible for the immoral or the self-indulgent to make deep progress in meditation.\n* Gil Fronsdal states: \"[There are] a variety of ways to engage restlessness, be present for it. [...] [One is] learning, reflecting, meditating and contemplating what the nature of restlessness is. [...] There might be a really good cause for you to be restless. [...] Maybe you haven't paid your taxes in ten years. [...] [In this case] you don't need meditation, you need to pay your taxes. You don't use meditation to run away from the real issues of your life. [...] Sometimes what's needed is to really look and understand are there root causes for being restless.\"<ref group=web name=gil01/>\n\n===5. Doubt (vicikicch\u0101)===\n{{see also|vicikicch\u0101}}\n\nThe hindrance of doubt (''vicikicch\u0101'') refers to doubt about one's ability to understand and implement the meditation instructions, as well as about the teacher and Buddhist teachings in general.\n\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Doubt refers to the disturbing inner questions at a time when one should be silently moving deeper. Doubt can question one's own ability 'Can I do This?,' or question the method 'Is this the right way?,' or even question the meaning 'What is this?.' It should be remembered that such questions are obstacles to meditation because they are asked at the wrong time and thus become an intrusion, obscuring one's clarity.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"When we meditate in the presence of this hindrance, we have a constant nagging feeling: 'How do I know what I am doing is right? How do I know if this thing really works and if I am not just wasting my time? How do I know what the Buddhist teachings say is true? How do I know if that what the meditation teachers have taught me is right and that they are not deluded?'\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}\n\n;Analogy:\nDoubt is compared to being lost in a desert, not recognising any landmarks.\n\n;Antidote:\nAjahn Brahmavamso states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Such doubt is overcome by gathering clear instructions, having a good map, so that one can recognise the subtle landmarks in the unfamiliar territory of deep meditation and so know which way to go. Doubt in one's ability is overcome by nurturing self-confidence with a good teacher. A meditation teacher is like a coach who convinces the sports team that they can succeed.\n* The end of doubt, in meditation, is described by a mind which has full trust in the silence, and so doesn't interfere with any inner speech. Like having a good chauffeur, one sits silently on the journey out of trust in the driver.\n\n==Mental factors that counteract the five hindrances==\nB. Alan Wallace identifies five mental factors that counteract the five hindrances, according to the Theravada tradition:{{sfn|Wallace|2006|pp=158-159}}\n# ''Coarse examination ([[vitakka]])'' counteracts sloth-torpor (lethargy and drowsiness)\n# ''Precise investigation ([[vic\u0101ra]])'' counteracts doubt (uncertainty)\n# ''Well-being ([[p\u012bti]])'' counteracts ill-will (malice)\n# ''Bliss ([[sukha]])'' counteracts restlessness-worry (excitation and anxiety)\n# ''Single-pointed attention ([[ekaggat\u0101]])'' counteracts sensory desire\n\nThese five counteracting factors arise during the first [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism#Stages of jh\u0101na|jh\u0101na]] (stage of concentration).\n\n==In Pali Literature==\n\n===In the Pali Canon===\nIn the [[Pali Canon]]'s [[Samyutta Nikaya]], several discourses juxtapose the five hindrances with the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''bojjhanga'').{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For example, in [[Samyutta Nikaya]] chapter 46, ''Bojjhanga-samyutta'', discourses 46.31 through 46.40 are based on this juxtaposition (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1589-94).}}  For instance, according to [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.37, [[the Buddha]] stated:\n:\"[[Bhikkhu]]s, there are these five obstructions, hindrances, corruptions of the mind, weakeners of wisdom.  What five? Sensual desire... ill will... sloth and torpor ... restlessness and remorse... doubt....\n:\"There are, bhikkhus, these seven factors of enlightenment, which are nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation.

[W]hen these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country.

The Vimuttimagga further distinguishes that \"sloth\" refers to mental states while \"torpor\" refers to physical states resultant from food or time or mental states; if torpor results from food or time, then one diminishes it through energy; otherwise, one removes it with meditation.  In addition, the Vimuttimagga identifies four types of doubt: \n* doubt regarding [[anatta|self]] is a hindrance to [[samatha|tranquility]];\n* doubt regarding the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[tiloka|three worlds]] is a hindrance to [[vipassana|insight]];\n* doubt regarding the [[Triple Gem]] is a hindrance to both tranquility and insight;\n* doubt regarding places and people is a hindrance to \"non-doctrinal\" things;\n* doubt regarding the [[Tipitaka|Discourses]] is a hindrance to solitude.<ref>Upatissa ''et al.''

But the hindrances are presented differently within these different traditions, depending upon the way each tradition teaches the practice of meditation.\n\n;Contemporary Insight Meditation:\nContemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] teacher [[Gil Fronsdal]] describes the hindrances as \"a very important list of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental states]] that have a big impact on meditation practice and people\u2019s daily lives.\" Fronsdal emphasizes that it is important not to see the hindrances as personal failings. All human beings have them. A big part of mindfulness meditation is to learn about these hindrances in order to become free of them. Therefore, Fronsdal states, the goal is to not dismiss them, but to study them and understand them really well.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}\n\nContemporary teacher [[Jack Kornfield]] described the five hindrances as \"difficult energies which arise in the mind and in one's life as a part of meditation practice.\"<ref group=web name=k1>[http://www.caringawareness.com/community/VolIII/Books/JK_Hindrances2.html The Five Hindrances-2 by Jack Kornfield] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026134307/http://www.caringawareness.com/community/VolIII/Books/JK_Hindrances2.html |date=2012-10-26 }}</ref>\n\n;Theravada tradition:\nContemporary Theravada scholar Nina van Gorkom states: \"The hindrances are obstructions, overwhelming the mind, weakening insight.[...] The hindrances obstruct the development of what is wholesome.\"<ref group=web name=nina1>[https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/cetasikas/d/doc2873.html Different Groups Of Defilements Part II, Nina van Gorkom]</ref>\n\nWithin the Theravada tradition, the five hindrances are identified specifically as obstacles to the [[jh\u0101na]]s (stages of concentration) within meditation. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher [[Ajahn Brahmavamso]] states:<ref group=web name=b2001>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Gt5hSX0EGjkJ:www.dhammatalks.net/Books7/Ajahn_Brahm_Five_Hindrances.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjae0cxvWrUHJDKcwEZcvBx4XgEqWqqmk_0Y_nRqvACIxXjxwSh7pyCY00KOO0JW9DiKrPR_9XuNq-fZGUsqJbloC4xwLgZMfjltOqWSP8_bWvrksc_a5tjxJ9Acqea1jHfR3dm&sig=AHIEtbRsGoEAn-GXCI-LWctEQin1flxZtg The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Brahmavamso (2001)]</ref>\n:The deliberate idea of overcoming these five hindrances is important because it is the five hindrances that block the door to both the jh\u0101nas, and wisdom. It\u2019s the five hindrances that fuel [[avijj\u0101]]. The Buddha said that they\u2019re the nutriments, the food of delusion.\n\nAjahn Brahmavamso emphasizes that any obstacle that arises in meditation can be identified as one of the five hindrances; he states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n:Any problem which arises in meditation will be one of these Five Hindrances, or a combination. So, if one experiences any difficulty, use the scheme of the Five Hindrances as a 'check list' to identify the main problem. Then you will know the appropriate remedy, apply it carefully, and go beyond the obstacle into deeper meditation. When the Five Hindrances are fully overcome, there is no barrier between the meditator and the bliss of Jhana. Therefore, the certain test that these Five Hindrances are really overcome is the ability to access Jhana.\n\n;Mahayana tradition:\nWithin the Mahayana tradition, the five hindrances are typically identified as obstacles to [[samatha]] meditation (also referred to as tranquility meditation).{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}\n\n===Overcoming the hindrances===\nAll of the Buddhist traditions emphasize that the hindrances are overcome by investigating and understanding them. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher [[Ajahn Sumedho]] states:<ref group=web>[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/sumedho/fivehind.html The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Sumedho]</ref>\n: In meditation one develops an understanding of the Five Hindrances -- how, when one of them is present, you investigate it, you understand it, you accept its presence and you learn how to deal with it. Sometimes you can just tell it to go away and it goes; sometimes you just have to allow it to be there till it wears out.\n\nContemporary Insight Meditation teacher Gil Fronsdal emphasizes that to be a good student of the hindrances, you must be very patient with them and not be dismissive of them. When they arise, you must stop for them. Fronsdal states that a bumper sticker for this type of training could be \u201cI stop for the hindrances.\u201d You don't indulge them, Fronsdal states, you become interested and study them.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}\n\nThe Insight Meditation tradition teaches the RAIN formula for investigating the hindrances:<ref group=web>[http://insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/FiveHindrances.pdf Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation: The Five Hindrances (study notes)]</ref><ref group=web name=brach>[http://www.tarabrach.com/howtomeditate.html How to Meditate: A Guide to Formal Sitting Practice, by Tara Brach]</ref>\n\n* R: Recognize it.\n* A: Accept it.\n* I: Investigate it, be curious. What is it like?\n* N: Non-identification. This is just a passing process that comes and goes, not who we are.\n\n==The five hindrances individually==\n\n===1. Sensory desire (kamacchanda) ===\nThe hindrance of sensory desire (''kamacchanda'') is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on the pleasures of the five senses.\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso (1999) states: \"Sensory desire refers to that particular type of wanting that seeks for happiness through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling. It specifically excludes any aspiration for happiness through the sixth sense of mind alone. In its extreme form, sensory desire is an obsession to find pleasure in such things as sexual intimacy, good food or fine music. But it also includes the desire to replace irritating or even painful five-sense experiences with pleasant ones, i.e. the desire for sensory comfort.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1>[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebmed051.htm The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Brahmavamso (1999)]</ref>\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso (2001) states: \"[...] k\u0101ma chanda are anything from the extremes of lust to just being concerned with how the body is doing. Thinking about the letter that you have to write afterwards, about the rain pattering on your roof, about your kut\u012b [monk's hut], or what needs to be built next, or where you are going to next, that\u2019s all in the k\u0101maloka, the world of the senses, that\u2019s all k\u0101ma chanda. It\u2019s also k\u0101ma vitakka, or the thoughts about those things, about family, about health, about coming here, going there, and thoughts about words.<ref group=web name=b2001/>{{dead link|date=June 2016}}\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"This term alludes to the mind's tendency to latch on to something that attracts it--a thought, a visual object, or a particular emotion. When we allow the mind to indulge in such attractions, we lose our concentration. So we need to apply mindfulness and be aware of how the mind operates; we don't necessarily have to suppress all these things arising in the mind, but we should take notice of them and see how the mind behaves, how it automatically grabs onto this and that.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}\n\n;Analogy\nThe hindrance of sensory desire is compared to taking out a loan \u2013 any pleasure one experiences through these five senses must be repaid through the unpleasantness of separation or loss which invariably follow when the pleasure is used up. There is also interest to be repaid on the loan. Thus, the Buddha said that the pleasure is small compared to the suffering repaid.<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Antidote\nIn order to overcome the hindrance of sensory desire (''kamacchanda''), the meditator must first apply mindfulness and recognize that the hindrance is present.{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}<ref group=web name=cards1>[http://bodhicards.com/FIVE_HINDRANCES.html Five Hindrances Bodhi Cards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831220653/http://bodhicards.com/FIVE_HINDRANCES.html |date=August 31, 2013 }}</ref> Then one must look at the hindrance, analyze it, make it the object of our meditation, experience it fully. The meditator can then apply specific techniques such as contemplating the impermanence of the pleasant desire.<ref group=web name=cards1/>\n \nAjahn Brahmavamso emphasizes the technique of letting go of concern for the body and the five senses completely; he states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n:In meditation, one transcends sensory desire for the period by letting go of concern for this body and its five sense activity. Some imagine that the five senses are there to serve and protect the body, but the truth is that the body is there to serve the five senses as they play in the world ever seeking delight. Indeed, the Lord Buddha once said, \"The five senses ARE the world\" and to leave the world, to enjoy the other worldly bliss of Jhana, one must give up for a time ALL concern for the body and its five senses.\n\n;Etymology\nKamacchanda can be compared to giving your approval for ''[[k\u0101ma]]''-based thoughts and emotions to remain in your mind. It is allowing these thoughts to occupy your mind. Ajahn Brahmavamso explains:<ref group=web name=b2001/>\n:In the P\u0101li term ''k\u0101ma chanda'', ''chanda'' is what you have to do if you cannot attend a meeting of the community of monks, and you want to give approval and agreement to what\u2019s happening there, you give your ''chanda'' to go ahead in your absence. It\u2019s agreement, approval, consent, and it\u2019s much more subtle than mere desire. This means that you are buying into, giving in to this, you want it, you approve of it, and you allow it to happen. In the same way that we have ''chanda'' in the Vinaya, we have that ''k\u0101ma chanda''. It\u2019s as if you give your approval for the sensory world to be in your consciousness, in your mind, you accept it, approve of it, and you play with it, that\u2019s all ''chanda''. It\u2019s letting it completely occupy the mind, and it\u2019s much more subtle than just mere desire. The k\u0101ma part of ''k\u0101ma chanda'', that\u2019s all that is comprised in k\u0101maloka, the world of the five senses, which goes from the hell realms, the animal realms, the ghost realms, the human realm, and the Deva realms, to everything that is concerned with those k\u0101maloka realms. ''K\u0101ma Chanda'' is acceptance, agreement, and consent for that world to occupy you.\n\n===2. Ill will (vyapada) ===\nThe hindrance of ill will (''vyapada'') is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on anger, resentment, hostility, bitterness, etc.\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Ill will refers to the desire to punish, hurt or destroy. It includes sheer hatred of a person, or even a situation, and it can generate so much energy that it is both seductive and addictive. At the time, it always appears justified for such is its power that it easily corrupts our ability to judge fairly. It also includes ill will towards oneself, otherwise known as guilt, which denies oneself any possibility of happiness. In meditation, ill will can appear as dislike towards the meditation object itself, rejecting it so that one's attention is forced to wander elsewhere.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"The second hindrance is ''ill will''; it is the opposite of the first hindrance, being brought about by aversion rather than attraction. Ill will refers to all kinds of thought related to wanting to reject, feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness. When they arise, we should take note of them, not necessarily suppressing them, but seeing how they arise.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}\n\n;Analogy\nThe hindrance of ill will is compared to being sick. Just as sickness denies one the freedom and happiness of health, so ill will denies one the freedom and happiness of peace.<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Antidote\nThe antidote to the hindrance of ill will (''vyapada'') is meditation on loving kindness (metta). Ajahn Brahmavamso states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n:Ill will is overcome by applying Metta, loving kindness. When it is ill will towards a person, Metta teaches one to see more in that person than all that which hurts you, to understand why that person hurt you (often because they were hurting intensely themselves), and encourages one to put aside one's own pain to look with compassion on the other. But if this is more than one can do, Metta to oneself leads one to refuse to dwell in ill will to that person, so as to stop them from hurting you further with the memory of those deeds. Similarly, if it is ill will towards oneself, Metta sees more than one's own faults, can understand one's own faults, and finds the courage to forgive them, learn from their lesson and let them go. Then, if it is ill will towards the meditation object (often the reason why a meditator cannot find peace) Metta embraces the meditation object with care and delight. For example, just as a mother has a natural Metta towards her child, so a meditator can look on their breath, say, with the very same quality of caring attention. Then it will be just as unlikely to lose the breath through forgetfulness as it is unlikely for a mother to forget her baby in the shopping mall, and it would be just as improbable to drop the breath for some distracting thought as it is for a distracted mother to drop her baby! When ill will is overcome, it allows lasting relationships with other people, with oneself and, in meditation, a lasting, enjoyable relationship with the meditation object, one that can mature into the full embrace of absorption.\n\n===3. Sloth-torpor (thina-middha)===\n{{see also|th\u012bna|middha}}\n\nSloth-torpor is a dull, morbid state that is characterized by unwieldiness, lack of energy, and opposition to wholesome activity.\n\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"When this hindrance is present, we lose our focus in meditation. We may not be agitated in any perceptible way, but there is no mental clarity. We gradually become more and more drowsy, and then eventually go to sleep.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Sloth and torpor refers to that heaviness of body and dullness of mind which drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression. [...] In meditation, it causes weak and intermittent mindfulness which can even lead to falling asleep in meditation without even realising it!\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"The mind has two main functions, 'doing' and 'knowing'. The way of meditation is to calm the 'doing' to complete tranquility while maintaining the 'knowing'. Sloth and torpor occur when one carelessly calms both the 'doing' and the 'knowing', unable to distinguish between them.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Sloth and torpor is an unpleasant state of body and mind, too stiff to leap into the bliss of Jhana and too blinded to spot any insights. In short, it is a complete waste of precious time.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Analogy:\nThe hindrance of sloth-torpor is compared to being imprisoned in a cramped, dark cell, unable to move freely in the bright sunshine outside.<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Antidote:\nAjahn Brahmavamso states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n: \"Sloth and torpor is overcome by rousing energy. Energy is always available but few know how to turn on the switch, as it were. Setting a goal, a reasonable goal, is a wise and effective way to generate energy, as is deliberately developing interest in the task at hand. A young child has a natural interest, and consequent energy, because its world is so new. Thus, if one can learn to look at one's life, or one's meditation, with a 'beginner's mind' one can see ever new angles and fresh possibilities which keep one distant from sloth and torpor, alive and energetic. Similarly, one can develop delight in whatever one is doing by training one's perception to see the beautiful in the ordinary, thereby generating the interest which avoids the half-death that is sloth and torpor. [...] Sloth and torpor is a common problem which can creep up and smother one slowly. A skilful meditator keeps a sharp look-out for the first signs of sloth and torpor and is thus able to spot its approach and take evasive action before it's too late. Like coming to a fork in a road, one can take that mental path leading away from sloth and torpor.\"\n\nTraleg Kyabgon states: \"When this happens, instead of persisting with the meditation, it is better to try to refresh ourselves by getting up and going for a walk or washing our face, after which we return to our meditation.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}\n\n===4. Restlessness-worry (uddhacca-kukkucca)===\n{{see also|uddhacca|kukkucca}}\n\nThe hindrance of restlessness-worry (''uddhacca-kukkucca'') refers to a mind that is agitated and unable to settle down.\n\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Restlessness [uddhacca] refers to a mind which is like a monkey, always swinging on to the next branch, never able to stay long with anything. It is caused by the fault-finding state of mind which cannot be satisfied with things as they are, and so has to move on to the promise of something better, forever just beyond. [...] Remorse [kukkucca] refers to a specific type of restlessness which is the kammic effect of one's misdeeds.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"The fourth hindrance is ''restlessness and worry'', which refers to all the mental activities that go on in our mind due to its restless nature.\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}\n* Gil Fronsdal states: \"The discomfort of restlessness creates an outward looking [tendency] \u2013 what can I do to fix this? What can I do to settle this? [...] So the challenge in restlessness is how to turn towards it and be present for it and engage it.\"<ref group=web name=gil01>[http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1808/ ''The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry'' audio talk by Gil Fronsdal]</ref>\n\n;Analogy:\nRestlessness (''uddhacca'') is compared to being a slave, continually having to jump to the orders of a tyrannical boss who always demands perfection and so never lets one stop.<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n\n;Antidote:\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n** Restlessness [uddhacca] is overcome by developing contentment, which is the opposite of fault-finding. One learns the simple joy of being satisfied with little, rather than always wanting more. One is grateful for this moment, rather than picking out its deficiencies. For instance, in meditation restlessness is often the impatience to move quickly on to the next stage. The fastest progress, though is achieved by those who are content with the stage they are on now. It is the deepening of that contentment that ripens into the next stage. \n** Remorse [kukkucca] refers to a specific type of restlessness which is the kammic effect of one's misdeeds. The only way to overcome remorse, the restlessness of a bad conscience, is to purify one's virtue and become kind, wise and gentle. It is virtually impossible for the immoral or the self-indulgent to make deep progress in meditation.\n* Gil Fronsdal states: \"[There are] a variety of ways to engage restlessness, be present for it. [...] [One is] learning, reflecting, meditating and contemplating what the nature of restlessness is. [...] There might be a really good cause for you to be restless. [...] Maybe you haven't paid your taxes in ten years. [...] [In this case] you don't need meditation, you need to pay your taxes. You don't use meditation to run away from the real issues of your life. [...] Sometimes what's needed is to really look and understand are there root causes for being restless.\"<ref group=web name=gil01/>\n\n===5. Doubt (vicikicch\u0101)===\n{{see also|vicikicch\u0101}}\n\nThe hindrance of doubt (''vicikicch\u0101'') refers to doubt about one's ability to understand and implement the meditation instructions, as well as about the teacher and Buddhist teachings in general.\n\n* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: \"Doubt refers to the disturbing inner questions at a time when one should be silently moving deeper. Doubt can question one's own ability 'Can I do This?,' or question the method 'Is this the right way?,' or even question the meaning 'What is this?.' It should be remembered that such questions are obstacles to meditation because they are asked at the wrong time and thus become an intrusion, obscuring one's clarity.\"<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Traleg Kyabgon states: \"When we meditate in the presence of this hindrance, we have a constant nagging feeling: 'How do I know what I am doing is right? How do I know if this thing really works and if I am not just wasting my time? How do I know what the Buddhist teachings say is true? How do I know if that what the meditation teachers have taught me is right and that they are not deluded?'\"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}\n\n;Analogy:\nDoubt is compared to being lost in a desert, not recognising any landmarks.\n\n;Antidote:\nAjahn Brahmavamso states:<ref group=web name=brahma1/>\n* Such doubt is overcome by gathering clear instructions, having a good map, so that one can recognise the subtle landmarks in the unfamiliar territory of deep meditation and so know which way to go. Doubt in one's ability is overcome by nurturing self-confidence with a good teacher. A meditation teacher is like a coach who convinces the sports team that they can succeed.\n* The end of doubt, in meditation, is described by a mind which has full trust in the silence, and so doesn't interfere with any inner speech. Like having a good chauffeur, one sits silently on the journey out of trust in the driver.\n\n==Mental factors that counteract the five hindrances==\nB. Alan Wallace identifies five mental factors that counteract the five hindrances, according to the Theravada tradition:{{sfn|Wallace|2006|pp=158-159}}\n# ''Coarse examination ([[vitakka]])'' counteracts sloth-torpor (lethargy and drowsiness)\n# ''Precise investigation ([[vic\u0101ra]])'' counteracts doubt (uncertainty)\n# ''Well-being ([[p\u012bti]])'' counteracts ill-will (malice)\n# ''Bliss ([[sukha]])'' counteracts restlessness-worry (excitation and anxiety)\n# ''Single-pointed attention ([[ekaggat\u0101]])'' counteracts sensory desire\n\nThese five counteracting factors arise during the first [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism#Stages of jh\u0101na|jh\u0101na]] (stage of concentration).\n\n==In Pali Literature==\n\n===In the Pali Canon===\nIn the [[Pali Canon]]'s [[Samyutta Nikaya]], several discourses juxtapose the five hindrances with the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''bojjhanga'').{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For example, in [[Samyutta Nikaya]] chapter 46, ''Bojjhanga-samyutta'', discourses 46.31 through 46.40 are based on this juxtaposition (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1589-94).}}  For instance, according to [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.37, [[the Buddha]] stated:\n:\"[[Bhikkhu]]s, there are these five obstructions, hindrances, corruptions of the mind, weakeners of wisdom.  What five? Sensual desire... ill will... sloth and torpor ... restlessness and remorse... doubt....\n:\"There are, bhikkhus, these seven factors of enlightenment, which are nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation.

[W]hen these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security.\"<ref>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html Thanissaro (1997).]</ref>{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Some correlate each individual hindrance with its sequentially matched metaphor, so that covetness is likened to being in debt, having ill will to sickness, sloth and torpor to imprisonment, having restlessness and anxiety to slavery, and doubt to traveling through uncertain terrain.}}\n\nSimilarly, in the ''Sa{{IAST|\u1e45}}g\u0101rava Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.55), the Buddha compares sensual desire with looking for a clear reflection in water mixed with [[lac]], turmeric and dyes; ill will with boiling water; sloth-and-torpor with water covered with plants and algae; restlessness-and-worry with wind-churned water; and, doubt with water that is \"turbid, unsettled, muddy, placed in the dark.\"<ref>Bodhi (2000), pp. 1611-15; Walshe (1985), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-60 sutta 60], pp. 73-75.</ref>\n\n===From post-canonical Pali literature===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0\" align=\"right\"\n|-\n! \n! method of<br />suppression\n! path   of<br />eradication\n|-\n! sensual<br />desire\n| first [[jhana]] based<br />on [[Patikulamanasikara|bodily foulness]]\n| [[Anagami|nonreturning]] or<br />[[arahantship]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Upatissa ''et al.''

The Vimuttimagga further distinguishes that \"sloth\" refers to mental states while \"torpor\" refers to physical states resultant from food or time or mental states; if torpor results from food or time, then one diminishes it through energy; otherwise, one removes it with meditation.  In addition, the Vimuttimagga identifies four types of doubt: \n* doubt regarding [[anatta|self]] is a hindrance to [[samatha|tranquility]];\n* doubt regarding the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[tiloka|three worlds]] is a hindrance to [[vipassana|insight]];\n* doubt regarding the [[Triple Gem]] is a hindrance to both tranquility and insight;\n* doubt regarding places and people is a hindrance to \"non-doctrinal\" things;\n* doubt regarding the [[Tipitaka|Discourses]] is a hindrance to solitude.<ref>Upatissa ''et al.''

The series is currently in its fifth iteration (or generation, according to the manufacturer), the first of which was introduced in 1989, making the Discovery the first new model series since the launch of the [[Range Rover Classic|1970 Range Rover]] \u2013 on which it was based \u2013 and only the third new product line since the conception of the Land Rover (vehicle and brand) by [[Rover Company|Rover]] in 1948. The model is sometimes called influential, as one of the first to market a true off-road capable [[family car]].<ref name=Telegraph/>\n\nThe initial Discovery was essentially created as a more affordable [[Fork (software development)|design fork]] of the standard wheelbase Range Rover of the time. Although positioned below the latter in the company's line-up, the vehicle was both longer and higher, offered more room in the back, and optionally also more seats. Space utilization became more sophisticated in later iterations, but the series keeps offering seats for seven occupants. \n\nThe second Discovery (1998) was called the Series II, and though featuring an extended rear body, was otherwise an updated face-lift, which carried on the 100 inch wheelbase (2.54 m) frame and rigid, live front and rear axles of the original Range Rover into 2004.\n\nThe third iteration \u2013 succeeding the ''series I'' and ''II'' in 2004 - was either titled the '''Discovery 3''' or simply '''LR3''' (in North America and The Middle East). This was the first all-original design for the Discovery. Although it followed the 2002 third generation Range Rover, also switching to fully independent suspension, it still received a separate, but integrated body and frame (IBF) structure. The fourth iteration, as of 2009 \u2013 like the series II, was again mainly an update of the new generation \u2013 marketed as the '''Discovery 4''', or Land Rover '''LR4''' for North American and Middle Eastern markets.\n\nThe fifth iteration of the Discovery, introduced in 2017, no longer sports a numeric suffix. Unlike the previous two generations, it now benefits from a unitized body structure, making it lighter than its predecessor.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== First generation ==\n\n=== {{anchor|Series I|1}} Discovery Series I (1989\u20131998) ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Series I\n| image = {{Photomontage |photo1a=1994 Land Rover Discovery 3-door wagon (23045379742) (cropped).jpg |photo2a=1993 Land Rover Discovery TDi 2.5 Front.jpg |size=260 |spacing=2 |color=#FFFFFF | border=0 |text_background=#FFFFFF) |foot_montage=The Discovery was introduced as a 3-door [[family car]] in 1989, but a 5-door (below) was quickly added in 1990.}}\n| caption = \n| aka = [[Honda Crossroad]] (Japan)\n| production = 1989\u20131998\n| assembly = United Kingdom: [[Solihull]] ([[Solihull plant]])\n| body_style = 3-door [[estate car|estate]]<br />3-door van<br />5-door estate\n| engine = 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Rover T-Series engine|T-Series]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]] (petrol)<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Land Rover engines#200Tdi|200Tdi]]'' I4-[[turbocharger|T]] (diesel; 1989\u201394)<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Land Rover engines#300Tdi|300Tdi]]'' I4-T (diesel; 1994\u201398)<br />3.5&nbsp;L [[Rover V8 engine#3.5 L|Rover V8]] (petrol)<br />3.9&nbsp;L Rover V8 (petrol)<br />4.0&nbsp;L Rover V8 (petrol)\n| transmission = 4-speed [[ZF 4HP22 transmission|ZF ''4HP22'']] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|100.0|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|178.7|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|70.6|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|77.4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| designer = Dave Evans, Mike Sampson, Richard Bartlam, Mike Brogan, Mehmet Ozoturk, Alan Sheppard and George Thompson (1987) <ref>{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=James|title=Land Rover Discovery: 25 Years of the Family 4 x 4|year=2014|publisher=The Crowood Press UK|isbn=1847976891}}</ref><br>Alan Sheppard (1994 Update: 1992)\n}}\n\nThe Discovery Series I was conspicuously presented during the 1989 Frankfurt Motor Show, and introduced to market in the United Kingdom in October that year,<ref name=LRSA>[https://www.landroversanantonio.com/history-of-the-land-rover-discovery/ History of the Land Rover Discovery: Release \u2013 Land Rover San Antonio]</ref> after the vehicle had been developed under the internal code-name \"Project Jay\".<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news |title=30 years of the Land Rover Discovery \u2013 celebrating Britain's unsung design icon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/land-rover/the-story-of-the-land-rover-discovery-in-pictures/ |accessdate=9 December 2019 |agency=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]].co.uk}}</ref> The new model was strongly based on the more upmarket [[Range Rover Classic|Range Rover]], using the same chassis, suspension and 4WD-system,<ref name=LRSA/> and a derivative body design \u2013 especially the four-door copied much of the more expensive Range Rover's body structure. However, with smaller engines available, just two side doors at introduction, and other cost-reductions, the new Discovery was priced more affordably, for a larger, more middle-class market segment, intended to counter the Japanese competition at the time. The Discovery was Land Rover's first model, that was positioned as a [[family car]], designed to be both fully off-road capable, and suitable as a daily driver for any family, even offering more luggage space, and optionally more seats than the Range Rover. The mk. I Discovery remains the only model offered as a three-door, and was the only one available with a [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]] until 2017.<ref name=LRSA/>\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1992 Land Rover Discovery tdi 3-door (Portugal), rear left.jpg | caption1 = Pre-facelift 1992 Tdi three-door (Portugal)\n| image2 = 1993 Land Rover Discovery TDi 2.5 Rear.jpg | caption2 = Pre-facelift 1993 Discovery V8i five-door (UK)\n}}\n\nAt launch, the Discovery was only available as a three-door model, but the five-door version followed the next year, in 1990. Both were fitted with five seats, with the option to have two [[jump seat]]s fitted in the boot. Compared to the Range Rover, the Discovery was given a slightly longer rear, which was further extended on the series II. In order to make room for optional third row jump seats, the spare wheel had to move to the outside of the car, fitted to a side-swinging rear door, instead of the Range Rover's split tailgate. The roof of the rear section of the car was raised, to create sufficient headroom in the third row. Combined with a safari side window cluster, this gave the Discovery its own distinct look and profile.\n\nLand Rover employed an external consultancy, [[Sir Terence Conran|Conran Design Group]], to design the interior. They were instructed to ignore current car interior design and position the vehicle as a 'lifestyle accessory'. Their interior incorporated a number of original features, although some ideas shown on the original interior mock-ups (constructed inside a Range Rover bodyshell at Conran's workshops) were left on the shelf, such as a custom sunglasses holder built into the centre of the steering wheel. The design was unveiled to critical acclaim, and won a British Design Award in 1989.\n\nThe original transmission was a dual-ratio five-speed manual with drive via a [[transfer case]] with a lockable centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]].<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\">{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=C20C84BE98EFD61ECA257125001A1397 |title=Land Rover Discovery (Discovery Mk1) |work=GoAuto |access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitially \u2013 and regardless of exterior color choice \u2013 much of the interior in all Discovery's was trimmed in light 'Sonar Blue' upholstery and plastic, with magazine holders above the windscreen, hand-holds for rear passengers incorporated into the head restraints of the front seats, remote radio controls on the instrument cluster, twin removable sunroof panels (including a special zip-up storage bag behind the rear seats) and a Land Rover-branded cloth fabric holdall in the front centre console for oddments storage that could be removed from the vehicle and worn as a handbag using a supplied shoulder strap (relatively few of these bags have survived, making them collectable items). Despite such features, the interior's basic structure was the same as the Range Rover and virtually all the switchgear and instruments came from other [[Rover Group]] cars such as the [[Austin Maestro|Maestro]] and [[Austin Montego|Montego]]. Similarly, the Discovery utilised several Range Rover body panels, as well as headlights from the [[LDV Pilot|Freight Rover]] van and taillights from the Maestro van. The latter would continue to bear the [[Austin Rover]] 'chevron' logo on their lenses until production of the first generation Discovery ended in 1998, ten years after Austin Rover ceased to exist.\n\nThe designers of the original model had been forced to economise and use the \"parts bin\" of the \n-then parent company, Rover. The 200 series used the basic body shell structure from the Range Rover, door handles from the [[Morris Marina]], tail lights from the [[Austin Maestro]] van, and interior switchgear and instrumentation from [[Austin Rover Group|Rover's]] surplus parts.\n\nIn 1992, the Discovery received several additions and improvements. The interior was offered in a more traditional beige as well as the distinctive (but controversial) light blue, an [[automatic gearbox]] was made available on 200Tdi models, new colours were added to the range (and the large 'compass and mountain' side decals worn by early Discoveries to disguise wavy panel fit around the rear three quarter windows were no longer fitted) and the 'SE' pack (incorporating alloy wheels, front driving lights, roof bars and a special range of metallic paints) was introduced as an option. A two-seater, three-door Discovery Commercial version, lacking rear-side windows, was later offered by Land Rover Special Vehicles also known as SVO (Special Vehicles Operations).\n\nBefore 1994, the Discovery was available with either the 2.5-litre 200 [[Turbo Direct Injection|Tdi]] engine or the 3.5-litre [[Rover V8 engine|Rover V8]]. Early V8 engines used a twin [[SU carburettor]] system, switching to [[Lucas 14CUX]] fuel injection in 1990. A 2.0-litre petrol engine from the Rover stable was briefly available in a model known as the 2.0-litre Mpi [[Straight-4|I4]]. This was intended to attract fleet managers, since UK (and Italian) tax laws benefitted vehicles under 2.0&nbsp;litres. A combination of changes in taxation and lack of power for such a heavy vehicle led to the demise of this engine, despite its fitting to several Discoveries supplied to the [[British Royal family]]. One of these was notably driven by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] around [[Windsor Great Park]], in his position as [[Park Ranger]].\n\nThe transmission was a permanent four-wheel drive system, with a high and low range transfer box, [[locking differential|locking]] centre [[differential (automotive)|differential]] at the [[transfer case|transfer box]]. Similarly to the rest of the Land Rover range, the handbrake acts on the transmission at the back of the transfer box, therefore locking the rear prop shaft or both front and rear prop shafts if the central differential lock is engaged.\n\nIn Australia, the Series I launched in April 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&make=Land%20Rover&model=Discovery |title=Land Rover Discovery \u2013 Used Car Research |work=GoAuto |access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref> available only as a three-door estate in 3.5-litre V8i guise with {{convert|115|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} and coupled with a five-speed [[manual gearbox]].<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/> In October 1991, Land Rover launched the five-door body variant in base V8i and luxury HL versions.<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/> Both featured central locking, electric windows, headlight washers and heated door mirrors, with the HL adding alloy wheels, air conditioning, driving lights and an improved audio system.<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/> Furthermore, the Tdi engine became available, rated at {{convert|83|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|265|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/> In early-1993, a four-speed automatic option was added to the Australian range and the HL was discontinued.<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/>\n\n;1994 update\n{{multiple image | align = | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1996 Land Rover Discovery V8i 5-door wagon (2015-12-07) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1996 Land Rover Discovery V8i 5-door wagon (2015-12-07) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Land Rover Discovery V8i five-door (Australia)\n}}\n\nIn 1994, many changes were made to the Discovery. It reached some markets as the \"Discovery 2\"; the 200Tdi and 3.5&nbsp;L V8 engines were replaced with the 2.5&nbsp;L 300Tdi 4-cylinder and 3.9-litre Rover V8 engines. The 300Tdi introduced a Bosch electronic emissions control for certain models and markets. At around this time, a stronger R380 gearbox was fitted to all manual models. The newer models featured larger headlamps and a second set of rear lights in the bumper. The new rear lights had their wiring configuration changed several times to meet real or expected European safety legislation. Some vehicles were left with an arrangement where the vulnerable bumper contains the only working direction-indicator lights; other examples have these lights duplicated in the traditional rear pillar location.\n\n;North America\nThe 1994 model year marked the first year that the Land Rover Discovery was sold in the United States. Airbags were incorporated into the design of the 1994 model to meet the requirements of US motor vehicle safety regulations, though they were not fitted as standard in all markets. All North American specification (NAS) models were fitted with the 3.9-litre V8 from the [[Range Rover]] SE models, and later models saw a change to the 4.0-litre version of the engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto.consumerguide.com/auto/used/reviews/full/index.cfm/id/2190/ |title=1994\u20131998 Land Rover Discovery: Overview \u2013 Consumer Guide Automotive |publisher=Auto.consumerguide.com |accessdate=14 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061225050206/http://auto.consumerguide.com/auto/used/reviews/full/index.cfm/id/2190/ |archivedate=25 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTechnically speaking, the 1996-98 US models with 4.0-litre engines had the same displacement as the 3.9-litre engines fitted to the earlier 1994-95 US models; the differences between the engines involved improvements to the block rigidity and pistons, and a change from the Lucas 14CUX engine management to the distributor-less Generic Engine Management System (\"GEMS\"). In earlier 3.9-litre US engines, the fuel injection computer (14CUX) did not control the ignition, which was instead controlled by a traditional system with an ignition coil and distributor made by Lucas. The GEMS system was developed jointly by Lucas and [[SAGEM]]; it controlled both spark timing and fuel injection. Unlike the earlier systems fitted to Rover V8 engines, GEMS was made [[On-Board Diagnostics#OBD-II|OBD-II]] compliant. This change was largely driven by the federal requirement (starting in 1996) for vehicles sold in the United States to meet the OBD-II specification.\n\n;Other versions\n[[File:1994 Honda Crossroad (8627437970).jpg|thumb|1994 Honda Crossroad (Japan)]]\n\nIn Japan, a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] version of the Discovery I was offered, called the [[Honda Crossroad]]. The [[Rover (car)|Rover]] companies had a cross-holding relationship with [[Honda]] UK since the early-1980s. The relationship ended after Rover was taken over by German carmaker [[BMW]] in 1994. (Honda revived the nameplate 'Crossroad' in another small sport utility vehicle in 2007.)\n\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], local tax laws meant that the first ever example of a Discovery Commercial (van) was launched there in 1991. A revised version was launched in 1993, shortly after the UK market example of late-1992. The Irish examples have formed the basis of the Discovery's success and high sales there, as commercials are on a much lower tax band.\n\n;Special editions\n* '''Country Life''' ''(Switzerland, 1991)'': The Country Life was a five-door V8i Discovery with special interior trim, including a leather-wrapped [[Nardi (carmaker)|Nardi]] steering wheel, wood door and console trim, and identifying decals.

The Trophy was only available with the 300Tdi engine.<ref name=\"taylorj\"/>\n* '''Esquire''' ''(Germany, 1998)'': Like the Trophy, the Esquire was equipped with twin airbags, air conditioning, and alloy wheels, but it was also standardised with ABS and the interior was trimmed with wood and leather.<ref name=\"taylorj\"/>\n\n=== {{anchor|Series II|L318|2}} Discovery Series II (L318; 1998\u20132004) ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Series II (L318)\n| image = 1998 Land Rover Discovery II V8 5-door wagon (2010-07-21) 01.jpg\n| caption = 1998\u20132002 Land Rover Discovery II V8\n| production = 1998\u20132004\n| assembly = United Kingdom: [[Solihull]] ([[Solihull plant]])<br />Jordan: [[Aqaba]] ([[Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant|Aqaba plant]])<br />Malaysia: [[Shah Alam]] (AMI, [[Swedish Motor Assemblies|SMA]])<ref name=\"Land Rover Discovery II Malaysia 2001\">{{cite web |url=http://autoworld.com.my/news/2001/07/24/Land-Rover-Malaysia-Sets-Up-Website/ |title=Land Rover Malaysia Sets Up Website |publisher=autoworld.com.my |date=24 July 2001 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103646/http://autoworld.com.my/news/2001/07/24/Land-Rover-Malaysia-Sets-Up-Website/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n| body_style = 5-door [[estate car|estate]]\n| engine = 4.0&nbsp;L [[Rover V8 engine#3.9/4.0|Rover V8]] (petrol)<br />4.6&nbsp;L [[Rover V8 engine#4.6|Rover V8]] (petrol)<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Land Rover engines#Td5|Td5]]'' [[straight-five engine|I5]] (diesel)\n| transmission = 4-speed automatic<br />5-speed manual\n| wheelbase = {{convert|100.0|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|185.2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|76.4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|74.4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{convert|4543|-|4895|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| sp = uk\n| designer = Mike Sampson (1995, 1996)\n}}\n\nThe Series II Discovery debuted in autumn 1998. Land Rover promoted that the Discovery Series&nbsp;II had been modified with 720 'differences'. The interior and exterior were reworked to be less utilitarian, but it was still clearly an evolution of the Series&nbsp;I. Every body panel had been altered, except the outer skin on the rear doors. The rear body was extended to improve load space, and to now accommodate full-size adults on all seven seats on the SE7 option, as well as make them all forward facing,<ref>[https://dustrunnersauto.com/land-rover-discovery-ii/ Land Rover Discovery II: 8 Reasons to Buy One Today \u2013 Dust Runners Automotive Journal]</ref><ref>[https://nl.ifixit.com/Wiki/The_History_of_Land_Rover_-_Small_Beginnings-Big_Results The History of Land Rover \u2013 iFixit]</ref> but at the expense of added rear overhang, which slightly reduced the car's departure angle, when off-roading.\n\nThe Discovery mk.&nbsp;II was the last Land Rover product to use an evolution of the original 1970 Range Rover underpinnings \u2013 with its extended, {{convert|185|in|m|2|abbr=on}} long, four-door body still riding on the same, relatively short {{convert|100|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase, ladder-frame chassis, combined with live axles front and rear, into the year 2004.\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1998 Land Rover Discovery II V8 5-door wagon (2010-07-21) 02.jpg \n| caption1 = Pre-facelift Discovery II V8 (GB)\n| image2 = Land Rover Discovery front 20081201.jpg \n| caption2 = Facelift Discovery II Td5\n| image3 = 2002-2004 Land Rover Discovery (MY03) Td5 5-door wagon (2011-10-25).jpg \n| caption3 = Facelift Discovery II Td5\n}}\n\nChanges to the diesel-engined models saw the 2,495&nbsp;cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected [[straight-five engine]]) introduced, in line with the updated Defender models. This electronically managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than it's 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the [[Rover L-Series engine|Rover L-series]] passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948&nbsp;cc [[V8 engine|V8]] petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross bolted caps, different connecting rods, and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year, Discovery II they changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the 4.0 continued as the only V8 option offered in the UK).\n\nACE ([[Active Cornering Enhancement]], an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cars-data.com/en/technical-terms/ace-active-cornering-enhancement.html|title=Active Cornering Enhancement - ACE|website=Cars-Data.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>A pair of accelerometers are used to detect the angle of body lean and to instruct the ACE computer to counteract these movements by applying pressure to the vehicle's torsion bars via actuators which are hydraulically controlled. On the Land Rover Discovery, the ACE system can counteract up 1 g of lateral acceleration in less than a tenth of a second, thus helping the vehicle become more stable and responsive during hard cornering. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European type-approval for seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.\n\nThe locking center differential was still fitted until early-2001, although the linkage to operate it was not attached, as Land Rover believed that the [[traction control system|traction control]] and newly developed [[Hill Descent Control system|Hill Descent Control]] would render it redundant. The actual locking mechanism was removed in early-2001, before being fully reinstated (with linkage) in 2004. Whilst the traction control system worked very effectively, it did not offer the same level of control and smooth operation as the vehicles fitted with the differential lock. Customer demand saw the diff lock controls fully reinstated as a cost option only (standard on top of range HSE/SE vehicles) on UK and Irish models, and aftermarket kits are offered by several vendors for those vehicles which were produced with the lock, but not the linkage.\n\nThe US version was available in three trim levels: S, SE, LT and HSE, the SE, LT and HSE having a seven-seat option, SE7, LT7 and HSE7.\n\nThe \"facelift\" models are easily identified by new \"pocketed\" headlamps (which matched the Range Rover and facelifted Freelander models) as well as redesigned turn and brake lamps on the rear of the vehicle. The indicators were moved from the bumper to the high side fixtures. The earlier Series II models could in turn be easily distinguished from the original Discovery by the position of those stop light fixtures above the window-line (earlier models had them below), and by the replacement of paddle door handles with the current sort. The Series II also differs slightly in dimensions.\n\nA small number of Discovery II Commercial models were produced by Land Rover Special Vehicles, this time based on the five-door bodyshell but with the windows rendered opaque to give van-like appearance and security. Normal vehicles were exported to Republic of Ireland, where the rear-side windows were smashed and rear seats were destroyed in the presence of a Revenue official, to offer a model that avoided the Vehicle Registration Tax (saving approximately 40%).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The UK Commercials came with rear self-levelling suspension as standard (an option that has in the main been deleted from these vehicles in subsequent ownership due to reliability issues.)\n\nIn the final production run of the Discovery II, only two models were offered for sale in the UK market, the 'base' Pursuit, which still retained a high level of equipment as standard, and the top specification Landmark, which offered an all-leather interior, twin sunroofs, Active Cornering Enhancement, six-disc CD player, and a heated windscreen. The final vehicles left the production lines in late-May 2004 to make way for the all new Discovery 3 (LR3) models.\n\n== {{anchor|L319}} Second generation (L319) ==\n\n=== {{anchor|Discovery 3|3}} Discovery 3 / LR3 (2004\u20132009) ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Discovery 3 (L319)\n| image = 2004 Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 HSE 2.7 Front.jpg\n| caption = Pre-facelift Land Rover Discovery TDV6 HSE \n| aka = Land Rover LR3 (North America & Middle East)\n| production = June 2004\u20132009\n| assembly = United Kingdom: [[Solihull]] ([[Solihull plant]])<br />Jordan: [[Aqaba]] ([[Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant|Aqaba plant]])\n| designer = Andy Wheel (2000)\n| body_style = 5-door [[estate car|estate]]\n| related = [[Range Rover Sport]]\n| engine = 4.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Ford ''Cologne'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] (petrol)<br />4.4&nbsp;L ''[[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#4.4 L|AJ41]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (petrol)<br />2.7&nbsp;L ''[[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17#2.7D/TDV6/HDi|AJD]]'' V6-[[turbocharger|T]] (diesel)\n| transmission = 6-speed manual<br />6-speed automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|113.6|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|190.9|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|75.4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = 2005\u20132006: {{convert|74.1|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}<br />2007\u20132009: {{convert|74.5|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{convert|5333|-|5426|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| sp = uk\n}}\n\nOn 2 April 2004, Land Rover introduced the Discovery 3, marketed as the LR3 in North America and The Middle East. It retained the key features of the Discovery, such as the stepped roofline and steeply raked windscreen. The LR3 name was chosen for North American and Middle Eastern markets due to negative quality associations with the Discovery name and (according to Land Rover) a preference in the American market for alpha-numeric model designations \u2013 the second generation [[Land Rover Freelander|Freelander]] was also re-designated for the North American and Middle Eastern market as the LR2.\n\nLand Rover developed a body construction method for the Discovery 3, marketed as Integrated Body Frame (IBF). The engine bay and passenger compartment are built as a monocoque, then mated to a basic [[Ladder frame|ladder-frame chassis]] for the gearbox and suspension. Land Rover claims IBF combines the virtues of monocoque and ladder-frame \u2013 though it makes for a heavier vehicle than a monocoque construction, compromising performance and agility somewhat but adding strength, toughness and adaptability.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 2004 Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 HSE 2.7 Rear.jpg | caption1 = Pre\u2013facelift Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 HSE\n| image2 = 2008-2009 Land Rover Discovery 3 (MY09) TDV6 SE wagon (2010-09-23) 01.jpg\n| image3 = 2008-2009 Land Rover Discovery 3 (MY09) TDV6 SE wagon (2010-09-23) 02.jpg \n| caption3 = Facelift Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 SE.

Like the Range Rover L322, this is an [[air suspension]] system, enabling ride-height adjustment by simply pumping up or deflating the air bags. The vehicle can be raised to provide ground clearance when off-road, but lowered at high speeds to improve handling. Land Rover developed 'cross-linked' [[air suspension]]. When needed, the suspension mimics the action of a beam axle (as one wheel drops, the other rises). If the chassis of the vehicle contacts the ground when the suspension was at its 'off-road' height, the system senses the reduction in load on the air springs and raises the vehicle an extra inch. In the UK and European markets, a coil-spring independent suspension system was offered on the base model. This model was unique in the range by having only five seats and only being available with the 2.7-litre diesel engine. This model lacked the Terrain Response system.\n\nThe engines used in the Discovery 3 were all taken from Land Rover's sister company at the time, [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]. A [[Ford]]/[[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn|PSA]]-developed 2.7-litre, {{convert|195|hp|abbr=on}}, 440&nbsp;Nm [[V6 engine|V6]] [[diesel engine]] (the [[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17|TdV6]]) was intended to be the biggest seller in Europe. For the US market and as the high-performance option elsewhere, a 4.4-litre petrol [[V8 engine|V8]] of {{convert|300|hp|abbr=on}} was chosen. A {{convert|216|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0-litre [[SOHC]] [[Ford Cologne V6 engine|Ford V6 petrol engine]] was available in North America and Australia.\n\nThe gearboxes on the Discovery 3 were also all-new. For the diesel engine, a six-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard. As an option, and as standard on the V8 engine, a six-speed [[automatic transmission]] was available. Both came with a two-speed transfer box and permanent four-wheel-drive. A computer controlled progressively locking central differential ensured traction was retained in tough conditions. A similar differential was available on the rear axle to aid traction.\n\nThe Discovery 3 was fitted with multiple electronic traction control systems. Hill Descent Control (HDC) prevented vehicle 'runaways' when descending steep gradients and 4-wheel Electronic Traction Control (4ETC) prevented wheel spin in low-traction conditions. An on-road system, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), prevented skidding when steering and braking at speed. The vehicle also featured the 'Terrain Response' system. Previously, off-road driving had been a skill that many drivers found daunting. A wide-ranging knowledge of the vehicle was needed to be able to select the correct gear, transfer ratio, various differential systems and master various techniques required for tackling steep hills, deep water and other tough terrain. Terrain Response attempted to take away as many of the difficulties as possible. The driver selected a terrain type (\"Sand\", \"Grass, Gravel & Snow\", \"Mud & Ruts\" and \"Rock Crawl\") on a dial in the cab of the vehicle. The on-board computer systems then select the correct gearbox settings, adjust the suspension height, adjust the differential lock settings and even alter the throttle response of the engine suitable for the terrain. For example, in \"Rock Crawl\", the suspension is raised to its maximum height and set to allow maximum wheel articulation, the differentials are locked, the driver is prompted to switch to Low Range, and the throttle response is altered to provide low-speed control. In \"Sand\" mode, the traction control system is 'primed' to be more sensitive to wheelspin, the differentials are partly locked, and the throttle response is re-mapped to produce high power outputs with short pedal movement. The driver retained some manual control over the off-road systems, being able to select the Transfer Box ratio and the suspension height manually, although use of the Terrain Response system is needed to allow full use of the vehicles' capabilities.\n\nAs well as new mechanical and electronic systems, the Discovery 3 introduced a new design to the interior and exterior of the vehicle. The Discovery 3 was able to have a fresh, [[minimalist]] style. The interior featured a flexible seven-seat layout. Passengers in the rearmost row now entered through the rear side doors, instead of the tailgate as in previous versions. The driver benefitted from a DVD [[Automotive navigation system|navigation system]], including some optional features like [[Bluetooth]] telephony in later models. Like the [[Range Rover]], this audio, information & entertainment (\"infotainment\") system in the Discovery 3 adopted an electronics architecture whereby the system's distributed control units pass information and audio amongst one another and throughout the vehicle via optical links based on the MOST (or, [[Media Oriented Systems Transport]]) fibre-optic automotive networking standard (informally called the \"MOST-bus\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mostcooperation.com/f/core/frontend/http/http.php?id=%2Fpublications%2Fbrochures_newsletters%2Flatest%2Findex.html&lang=1&popup=0.1.1.159110%21159110.1.5.159119%21159119.1.2.178238%21178238.1.1.170172%21170172.2.2.178242%21178242.2.2.178199-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518011042/http://www.mostcooperation.com/f/core/frontend/http/http.php?id=%2Fpublications%2Fbrochures_newsletters%2Flatest%2Findex.html&lang=1&popup=0.1.1.159110%21159110.1.5.159119%21159119.1.2.178238%21178238.1.1.170172%21170172.2.2.178242%21178242.2.2.178199-1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 May 2009 |title=MOST Cooperation |publisher=MOST Cooperation |accessdate=12 November 2011 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2010}}. The system's navigation functions were unique to Land Rover because, in addition to the typical road map navigation, benefits included an off-road navigation and four-wheel drive information mode. When in four-wheel drive information mode, the screen showed a [[schematic]] of the vehicle, displaying the amount of suspension movement, angle the front wheels were steering, the status of the locking differentials and icons showing which mode the Terrain Response was in, and what gear was selected on automatic versions.\n\nThe vehicle was lauded by the press, with the Terrain Response system, improved on-road dynamics, and interior design receiving particular praise. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] of the BBC's ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' motoring show drove one to the top of [[Cnoc an Fhreiceadain]], a {{convert|307|m|ft|abbr=on}} mountain near Tongue in northern Scotland, where no vehicle had previously reached. [[Richard Hammond]], presenter of Top Gear, praised it as the \"Best 4X4 of all time\". In Australia, the vehicle was awarded \"4WD of the Year\" by the 4WD Press.\n\nIn 2006, Land Rover used the Discovery 3 in its [[G4 challenge]], alongside the [[Range Rover Sport]]. The vehicles used were all in standard mechanical form, except for the fitment of additional Land Rover off-road equipment.\n\nThe first all-new model placement since the Freelander, the Range Rover Sport is based on the Discovery 3 platform, rather than on the larger Range Rover.\n\nA 2008\u20132009 facelifted model of the Discovery 3 offered a [[Harman Kardon|Harman/Kardon]] stereo system upgrade, six-CD changer, clear side indicator lights, and body-colour bumpers.\n\nA driverless version of the LR3 finished 4th in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2007)|DARPA Urban Challenge]].<ref name=\"firstCarnagie\">{{cite news |url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/11/darpa-names-win.html |work=Wired |first=Michael |last=Belfiore |title=Carnegie Takes First in DARPA's Urban Challenge |date=4 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Discovery 4|4}} Discovery 4 / LR4 (2009\u20132016) ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Discovery 4 (L319)\n| image = 2012 Land Rover Discovery 4 (L319 MY12) TDV6 wagon (2015-08-07) 01.jpg\n| caption = Pre-facelift Land Rover Discovery 4\n| aka = Land Rover LR4 (North America & Middle East)\n| production = 2009\u20132016\n| assembly = United Kingdom: [[Solihull]] ([[Solihull plant]])<br />Jordan: [[Aqaba]] ([[Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant|Aqaba plant]])\n| designer = [[Gerry McGovern]] (2007)\n| body_style = 5-door [[estate car|estate]]\n| related = [[Range Rover Sport]]\n| engine = 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#AJ126|AJ126]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]-[[supercharger|S]] (petrol)<br />5.0&nbsp;L ''[[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#AJ133|AJ133]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (petrol)<br />2.7&nbsp;L ''[[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17#2.7D/TDV6/HDi|AJD]]'' V6-[[turbocharger|T]] (diesel)<br />3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17#3.0D/TDV6/SDV6/HDi|AJD]]'' V6-T (diesel) \n| transmission = 6-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] manual<br />6-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] automatic<br />8-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2885|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4838|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|2022|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (mirrors folded)\n| height = {{convert|1970|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (including roof rails)\n| weight = {{convert|5282|-|5695|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n}}\n\nThe Discovery 4 (called the LR4 in North America and The Middle East) is an updated version of the Discovery 3.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reicars.com/land-rover-discovery-2016-model/ |title=Land Rover Discovery Model |publisher=ReiCars.com |access-date=8 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201215703/http://reicars.com/land-rover-discovery-2016-model/ |archive-date=1 February 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nUsing the same Integrated Body Frame structure, the new Discovery has altered front and rear light units and a restyled front grille and bumper to adopt the same smoother, rounder style as also adopted for the 2010 [[Range Rover]] and [[Range Rover Sport]].<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.5</ref> The Discovery 4 also retains the body-coloured wheel arches and bumpers as the late Discovery 3s (early D3s had black plastic trim).

The D4 receives two engines from [[Jaguar Land Rover]]'s ''Gen III'' range. The [[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17#AJ-V6D Gen III|TDV6 Gen III]] is a 3.0-litre development of the 2.7-litre engine used in the D3. The new version features advanced twin-sequential [[turbocharger]]s where a [[Variable geometry turbocharger]] is used at low engine speeds, with a second standard turbo is brought online at higher engine speeds.<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.14</ref> Two versions of the 3.0-litre diesel are offered. Fuel economy was improved over the previous generation diesel while power, torque and diesel NVH were improved significantly. This system provides greater output than the older engine, with {{convert|241|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} whilst reducing {{CO2}} emissions by 10&nbsp;percent when first introduced and in 2014 increased to {{convert|188|kW|hp|abbr=on}}. The Gen III version of the [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#AJ-V8 Gen III|V8 petrol engine]] (available in markets outside the UK such as North America, Russia, Japan, Australia, and some EU countries) is now a 5-litre unit with [[Gasoline direct injection|Direct Petrol Injection]] developing {{convert|385|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}.<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.14 + p.34</ref>\n\nAn improved version of the [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] six-speed automatic/sequential gearbox was incorporated and in 2012(2014 in the US) was further improved including a change to 8 speeds. It includes taller gearing to take advantage of the new engines' greater torque output and an updated lock-up system to further reduce fuel consumption. Other technical changes include the fitting of the more powerful brakes from the [[Range Rover Sport]] and thicker [[Sway bar|anti-roll bars]] to improve on-road handling. The Stability Control System now includes a programme that detects the onset of [[understeer]] and applies the brakes. The Discovery 4 retains its predecessor's [[independent suspension|fully independent]] [[air suspension]] with cross-linking when off-road and the twin-range transfer gearbox with an electronic infinitely variable locking centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]].<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.22 + p.23</ref> As before, a similar locking rear differential is available. The Terrain Response system remains but with two new features \u2013 the 'Sand' mode incorporates a new traction control mode to prevent loss of traction when starting off and stopping in soft sand, and the 'Rock Crawl' mode gains a feature that applies gentle brake pressure at low (less than walking pace) speeds to improve grip and stability on slick rock. The system is also 'retuned' to account for the new engines and gearboxes with their different torque characteristics. Other new electronic systems include Trailer Stability Assist which can adjust the throttle and brakes to prevent a dangerously swaying trailer.<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.17</ref>\n\nThe 2.7-litre TDV6 engine was available in Europe on the basic 2.7 GS passenger and 2010 Commercial ranges. Unlike the Discovery 3 base model, this was equipped with air suspension and the Terrain Response system. The automatic gearbox was an option on this model. The 3.0-litre Gen III model (only with automatic gearbox) is also available in the GS trim level.\n\nThe Discovery 4 also features a redesigned interior (in keeping with the new styles introduced elsewhere in the LR range for 2010). The instrument cluster is updated with redesigned analogue speedometer and [[tachometer]] gauges for improved clarity. The analogue temperature/fuel gauges of the previous model and the electronic information display are replaced by a single [[Thin-film transistor|TFT]] screen capable of displaying information in a variety of modes and formats. The interior also has a new centre console, which includes redesigned and simplified switches and controls.<ref name=\"Land Rover D4 brochure, p.6\">Land Rover D4 brochure, p.6</ref> The Discovery also has a new seat design and a wider range of available interior materials \u2013 some previously only seen in Range Rover models. The stated aim of the interior redesign was to lift the vehicle upmarket, with higher-spec models now aimed at the luxury and executive markets.<ref name=\"Land Rover D4 brochure, p.6\"/>\n\nThe car gains some electronic systems from the [[Range Rover]] lineup, such as the optional 'Surround Camera System' \u2013 a series of cameras located in the front bumper, door mirrors, and rear tailgate handle which can display their images on the centre console screen to improve visibility (although the image quality of this system was downgraded by Land Rover around 2014). Other electronic systems are intended to improve efficiency \u2013 the engines feature a 'Smart' [[alternator]] that only charges the battery when engine load is low, thus helping to reduce fuel consumption when the engine is working harder.<ref>Land Rover Discovery brochure, p.15</ref>\n\nThe Discovery 4 was unveiled in the summer of 2009 and went on sale in the United Kingdom on 1 September that year. A Commercial van variant was released in the UK at the same time using the 2.7 engine and offered in GS and XS trim levels. In the Republic of Ireland a Commercial van was offered from 1 January 2010 based on the XE 2.7 manual and HSE 3.0 auto engines.\n\nAn armoured Discovery with B6 ballistic level of protection was announced in 2010. It offers numerous safety features designed to protect the occupants, including protection from grenades and small arms fire. The vehicle is indistinguishable from the standard LR4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.governmentbusiness.co.uk/content/view/282/23/ |title=Jaguar and Land Rover Armoured Vehicles |publisher=Governmentbusiness.co.uk |accessdate=3 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723113658/http://www.governmentbusiness.co.uk/content/view/282/23/ |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Discovery 4/LR4 Sentinel\">{{cite web |title=Discovery 4 Sentinel |url=http://www.securitysystems-tech.com/files/securitysystems/supplier_docs/Armoured%20-%20Discovery.pdf |work=Security Systems Tech |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2011 model year announced late 2010, the 2.7-litre engine was dropped and two versions of the 3.0-litre engine were made available \u2013 one called the TDV6 and one called the SDV6 (the latter offering 245&nbsp;bhp).\n\nFor the 2012 model year, diesel models in Europe came with the new eight-speed auto gearbox with steering wheel paddle controls and a circular dial selector that raises upon startup. The SDV6 engine was uprated to {{convert|255|bhp|abbr=on}} whilst both diesel engines featured reduced emissions for European models. During 2012 the HSE Luxury special edition was announced, featuring enhanced trim levels, and available in Europe and North American markets.<ref>Land Rover D4 Brochure 2012 Europe</ref>\n\nIn Ireland, 2012 saw the introduction of a new five-seat version of the Discovery 4 classified as an N1 Commercial vehicle, therefore attracting lower VRT rates. There is also a new two-seat Commercial on the same rules. All Irish models came with the lower emissions TDV6 engine. In 2014, an enhanced version of the unique-to-Ireland five-seater commercial utility went on sale which included almost all top-of-the-range features for a lower price. This vehicle is now the top selling Discovery in Ireland due to the fact that it attracts low road tax ({{\u20ac|333}} per year) and VAT can be reclaimed.\n\nFor 2013, models received a style freshening, new badging, new fuel stretching technology, improved audio systems and a new range of driver assistance, comfort and safety features. The 2014 Discovery comes with a standard [[ZF 8HP transmission]], and in some markets can be supplied with a one-speed transfer case (replacing the two speed transfer case). 2014 also marks the first use of a {{convert|2995|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} supercharged six cylinder engine, replacing the previous V6 and V8 offerings.\n\nIn a January 2011 comparison test by ''Car and Driver'', the Land Rover LR4 came in fourth place out of five cars behind the [[Audi Q7]], [[BMW X5]], and [[Acura MDX]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/acura-mdx-vs-audi-q7-bmw-x5-land-rover-lr4-lexus-gx460-comparison-test |title=Acura MDX vs. Audi Q7 3.0T, BMW X5 xDrive35i, Land Rover LR4 HSE, Lexus GX460}}</ref> However, it has always won the ''Auto Express'' categories of Best Large SUV and Best Towcar since it was launched in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://media.jaguarlandrover.com|title=JLR Corporate Homepage International |website=media.jaguarlandrover.com|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nTo celebrate 25 years of the Land Rover Discovery, a special edition of 1800 (?) vehicles was produced in 2014 marked as the XXV, and featured a number of unique details including light grey (Cirrus) XXV-embossed Windsor leather seats, special grill sets, and almost every extra and expansion pack available. A number of these were exported in silver grey and the darker causeway grey for UK markets.\n\nA major milestone in Land Rover Discovery's history came when the one millionth example built rolled off the Solihull production line in March 2012. This vehicle, along with two similar examples, was driven from Solihull to Beijing, China in a replication of a 1950s expedition. During this expedition, G459&nbsp;WAC, a pre-production Discovery 1 (which was subsequently converted into an amphibious vehicle) joined in the celebrations when the expedition visited [[Lake Geneva]]. The expedition concluded with the actual Millionth Discovery appearing at the Beijing Motor Show. This vehicle subsequently returned to go on permanent exhibition at the [[British Motor Industry Heritage Trust]] centre at Gaydon, Warwickshire, England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.jaguarlandrover.com/en-in/land-rover/news/2012/02/lr_d4_journey_of_discovery_launch_290212/ |title=Land Rover Launches Journey of Discovery |publisher=Newsroom.jaguarlandrover.com |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n;Engines\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Type/code!!Power, torque at rpm\n|-\n!colspan=4|Petrol engines\n|-\n|5.0 L V8||2009 (MY2010)-2013||{{convert|4999|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V8 32v ([[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#AJ133|AJ133]])||{{convert|375|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500, {{convert|510|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,500\n|-\n|3.0 L SCV6||2014\u2013||{{convert|2995|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 supercharged ([[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine#AJ126|AJ126]])||{{convert|340|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500, {{convert|460|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,500\u20135,000\n|-\n!colspan=4|Diesel engines\n|-\n|2.7 L TDV6||2009\u20132010||{{convert|2720|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 single turbo ([[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17]])||{{convert|190|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000, {{convert|440|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1,900\n|-\n|3.0 L TDV6||2011\u20132013 ||{{convert|2993|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 twin turbo (Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT20)||{{convert|211|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000, {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,000\n|-\n|3.0 L SDV6||2009\u20132011 ||{{convert|2993|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 twin turbo (Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT20)||{{convert|245|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000, {{convert|600|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,000\n|-\n|3.0 L SDV6||2011\u20132013||{{convert|2993|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 twin turbo (Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT20)||{{convert|258|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000, {{convert|600|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,000\n|}\n\n;Transmissions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Type/code\n|-\n!colspan=4|Petrol engines\n|-\n|5.0 L V8||2009\u20132013||ZF 6HP28 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|3.0 L SCV6||2014\u2013||ZF 8-speed automatic\n|-\n!colspan=4|Diesel engines\n|-\n|2.7 L TDV6||2009\u20132010||ZF S6-53 6-speed manual, ZF 6HP26 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|3.0 L TDV6||2009\u20132013||ZF 6HP28 automatic\n|-\n|3.0 L SDV6||2012\u20132016||ZF 8HP28 automatic\n|}\n\n==  {{anchor|Discovery 5}}{{anchor|L462}} Third generation (L462;

In profile, the exterior design is also very similar to the small [[Land Rover Discovery Sport|Discovery Sport]] model. In contrast to previous Discovery models, the third-generation has a much more rounded shape, eschewing the traditional angular design. The tail lights have changed from a vertical orientation to horizontal, and the third-row side glass no longer blends into the roof glass. The tailgate is no longer horizontally split and has been replaced with a conventional top hinged tailgate made from composite. The roof is still stepped over the third row, though it is now largely cosmetic in comparison to the previous models and the roof now has a strong taper to the back. The interior closely follows that from other contemporary Land Rover models, while continuing the 3-row tradition of the Discovery.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\nThe new Discovery 5 incorporates several changes over its predecessors. For the first time, the Discovery is based around Land Rover's aluminium architecture, first introduced on the Range Rover (L405). The use of aluminium chassis and body panels gives a weight loss of up to 480&nbsp;kg over its predecessor. This weight loss combined with a new aerodynamic design, a 17 percent lower {{cd|link=yes}}, achieves a fuel efficiency improvement over previous Discovery generations. The new Discovery is offered with a combination of [[V6 engine|V6]] petrol and diesel engines. All Discovery 5s are equipped with a standard 8 speed automatic transmission. An available option package adds a two speed transfer case (low range gearbox) and the option of an actively locking rear differential. Coil springs are now standard on base trim models, while air suspension is still offered as an option.\n\nLand Rover also introduces Terrain Response 2 on the Discovery 5. Similarly to the first generation of Terrain Response, Terrain Response 2 constantly monitors wheel slip, wheel speed, angle of approach or departure, and the suspension's compression or rebound to adjust the anti-lock braking system, throttle response, differentials and traction control systems. The driver can select modes for snow, grass, gravel, mud ruts, sand, or rock crawling by the spin of a dial on the centre console. Terrain Response 2 also introduces a new 'Auto' mode that allows the vehicles computer to select the most appropriate mode on its own.\n\nThe Discovery 5 is the first Discovery to be built on a unibody chassis, unlike its predecessors which were built body on frame. This allows the vehicle to have higher torsional rigidity with less weight. According to the automotive press{{who|date=July 2017}}, the latest generation has a higher wading depth (up to {{convert|35.6|in|cm}}), improved ground clearance and a more comfortable ride while traversing adverse terrain.\n\n== Derivatives and specialist versions ==\n[[File:Discovery 4 Sentinel at DSEi 2015.JPG|thumb|left|Discovery 4 Sentinel at DSEi 2015]]\n[[File:Supacat's LRV 400 Mk2 is based on the Discovery 4.JPG|thumb|right|Supacat's LRV 400 Mk2 is based on the Discovery 4]]\n[[File:Land Rover Discovery 5, IAA 2017, Frankfurt (1Y7A3088).jpg|thumb|Discovery SVX]]\n[[File:MSU Carabinieri Land Rover Discovery 4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]-[[Multinational Specialized Unit|MSU]] [[Carabinieri]] Discovery 4 equipped for [[Riot control|CRC]] in [[Kosovo]].]]\n\n\n[[Supacat]], part of [[Supacat|SC Group]], offer two vehicles based on a modified Discovery 4 platforms. The Specialist Utility Vehicle 600 (SUV 600) is a production standard Land Rover Discovery 4 that is converted to 6x6 or 6x4 configuration for use in the emergency services and wider utility sectors. The Light Reconnaissance Vehicle 400 (LRV 400) is an open lightweight 4x4 vehicle of the [[Land Rover Defender]] class. The LRV 400 was developed based on a combination of market research and customer feedback from the 2011-unveiling of a proof-of-concept closed cab variant. Development of the LRV 400 continues, the latest Mk2 shown publicly for the first time at [[DSEI]] 2015 (15\u201318 September). The most significant design change for the Mk2 is a switch of the automotive platform to the Land Rover Discovery 4 rather than the off-road racer platform previously offered.<ref name=\"LRV 400 Mk2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.w54.biz/showthread.php?61-All-Terrain-and-High-Mobility-Vehicles/page109 |title=Supacat Unveils Latest LRV 400 Recon Vehicle |accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nLand Rover offered an armoured version of the Discovery 4, the Sentinel. Protected to Level B6 (defined in accordance with [[European Standard]] EN1063 BR6 (glazing) and EN1522 and certified by [[QinetiQ]]), according to Jaguar Land Rover the Discovery 4 Sentinel is almost indistinguishable from the non-armoured Discovery 4.

A special edition model has been released. Celebratory events are taking place across the world. Despite Brexit sales continue to hold steady although down on previous years. The new JLR plant in Slovakia has the capacity to produce up to 300,000 Discovery units per year. In Ireland the Discovery range, including the Commercial, has now been fully aligned with that of the UK.\n\n== Worldwide sales ==\n\nAs of 1 January 2017, some 1,200,000 Discovery models had been sold in total since launch in 1989.\n\nTotal sales are for 2009 and onward, excluding sales prior to that year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; clear:center; margin:0em 0em 1em 1em; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The series is currently in its fifth iteration (or generation, according to the manufacturer), the first of which was introduced in 1989, making the Discovery the first new model series since the launch of the [[Range Rover Classic|1970 Range Rover]] \u2013 on which it was based \u2013 and only the third new product line since the conception of the Land Rover (vehicle and brand) by [[Rover Company|Rover]] in 1948. The model is sometimes called influential, as one of the first to market a true off-road capable [[family car]].<ref name=Telegraph/>\n\nThe initial Discovery was essentially created as a more affordable [[Fork (software development)|design fork]] of the standard wheelbase Range Rover of the time. Although positioned below the latter in the company's line-up, the vehicle was both longer and higher, offered more room in the back, and optionally also more seats. Space utilization became more sophisticated in later iterations, but the series keeps offering seats for seven occupants. \n\nThe second Discovery (1998) was called the Series II, and though featuring an extended rear body, was otherwise an updated face-lift, which carried on the 100 inch wheelbase (2.54 m) frame and rigid, live front and rear axles of the original Range Rover into 2004.\n\nThe third iteration \u2013 succeeding the ''series I'' and ''II'' in 2004 - was either titled the '''Discovery 3''' or simply '''LR3''' (in North America and The Middle East). This was the first all-original design for the Discovery. Although it followed the 2002 third generation Range Rover, also switching to fully independent suspension, it still received a separate, but integrated body and frame (IBF) structure. The fourth iteration, as of 2009 \u2013 like the series II, was again mainly an update of the new generation \u2013 marketed as the '''Discovery 4''', or Land Rover '''LR4''' for North American and Middle Eastern markets.\n\nThe fifth iteration of the Discovery, introduced in 2017, no longer sports a numeric suffix. Unlike the previous two generations, it now benefits from a unitized body structure, making it lighter than its predecessor.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== First generation ==\n\n=== {{anchor|Series I|1}} Discovery Series I (1989\u20131998) ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Series I\n| image = {{Photomontage |photo1a=1994 Land Rover Discovery 3-door wagon (23045379742) (cropped).jpg |photo2a=1993 Land Rover Discovery TDi 2.5 Front.jpg |size=260 |spacing=2 |color=#FFFFFF | border=0 |text_background=#FFFFFF) |foot_montage=The Discovery was introduced as a 3-door [[family car]] in 1989, but a 5-door (below) was quickly added in 1990.}}\n| caption = \n| aka = [[Honda Crossroad]] (Japan)\n| production = 1989\u20131998\n| assembly = United Kingdom: [[Solihull]] ([[Solihull plant]])\n| body_style = 3-door [[estate car|estate]]<br />3-door van<br />5-door estate\n| engine = 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Rover T-Series engine|T-Series]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]] (petrol)<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Land Rover engines#200Tdi|200Tdi]]'' I4-[[turbocharger|T]] (diesel; 1989\u201394)<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Land Rover engines#300Tdi|300Tdi]]'' I4-T (diesel; 1994\u201398)<br />3.5&nbsp;L [[Rover V8 engine#3.5 L|Rover V8]] (petrol)<br />3.9&nbsp;L Rover V8 (petrol)<br />4.0&nbsp;L Rover V8 (petrol)\n| transmission = 4-speed [[ZF 4HP22 transmission|ZF ''4HP22'']] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|100.0|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|178.7|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|70.6|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|77.4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| designer = Dave Evans, Mike Sampson, Richard Bartlam, Mike Brogan, Mehmet Ozoturk, Alan Sheppard and George Thompson (1987) <ref>{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=James|title=Land Rover Discovery: 25 Years of the Family 4 x 4|year=2014|publisher=The Crowood Press UK|isbn=1847976891}}</ref><br>Alan Sheppard (1994 Update: 1992)\n}}\n\nThe Discovery Series I was conspicuously presented during the 1989 Frankfurt Motor Show, and introduced to market in the United Kingdom in October that year,<ref name=LRSA>[https://www.landroversanantonio.com/history-of-the-land-rover-discovery/ History of the Land Rover Discovery: Release \u2013 Land Rover San Antonio]</ref> after the vehicle had been developed under the internal code-name \"Project Jay\".<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news |title=30 years of the Land Rover Discovery \u2013 celebrating Britain's unsung design icon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/land-rover/the-story-of-the-land-rover-discovery-in-pictures/ |accessdate=9 December 2019 |agency=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]].co.uk}}</ref> The new model was strongly based on the more upmarket [[Range Rover Classic|Range Rover]], using the same chassis, suspension and 4WD-system,<ref name=LRSA/> and a derivative body design \u2013 especially the four-door copied much of the more expensive Range Rover's body structure. However, with smaller engines available, just two side doors at introduction, and other cost-reductions, the new Discovery was priced more affordably, for a larger, more middle-class market segment, intended to counter the Japanese competition at the time. The Discovery was Land Rover's first model, that was positioned as a [[family car]], designed to be both fully off-road capable, and suitable as a daily driver for any family, even offering more luggage space, and optionally more seats than the Range Rover. The mk. I Discovery remains the only model offered as a three-door, and was the only one available with a [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]] until 2017.<ref name=LRSA/>\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1992 Land Rover Discovery tdi 3-door (Portugal), rear left.jpg | caption1 = Pre-facelift 1992 Tdi three-door (Portugal)\n| image2 = 1993 Land Rover Discovery TDi 2.5 Rear.jpg | caption2 = Pre-facelift 1993 Discovery V8i five-door (UK)\n}}\n\nAt launch, the Discovery was only available as a three-door model, but the five-door version followed the next year, in 1990. Both were fitted with five seats, with the option to have two [[jump seat]]s fitted in the boot. Compared to the Range Rover, the Discovery was given a slightly longer rear, which was further extended on the series II. In order to make room for optional third row jump seats, the spare wheel had to move to the outside of the car, fitted to a side-swinging rear door, instead of the Range Rover's split tailgate. The roof of the rear section of the car was raised, to create sufficient headroom in the third row. Combined with a safari side window cluster, this gave the Discovery its own distinct look and profile.\n\nLand Rover employed an external consultancy, [[Sir Terence Conran|Conran Design Group]], to design the interior. They were instructed to ignore current car interior design and position the vehicle as a 'lifestyle accessory'. Their interior incorporated a number of original features, although some ideas shown on the original interior mock-ups (constructed inside a Range Rover bodyshell at Conran's workshops) were left on the shelf, such as a custom sunglasses holder built into the centre of the steering wheel. The design was unveiled to critical acclaim, and won a British Design Award in 1989.\n\nThe original transmission was a dual-ratio five-speed manual with drive via a [[transfer case]] with a lockable centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]].<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\">{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=C20C84BE98EFD61ECA257125001A1397 |title=Land Rover Discovery (Discovery Mk1) |work=GoAuto |access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitially \u2013 and regardless of exterior color choice \u2013 much of the interior in all Discovery's was trimmed in light 'Sonar Blue' upholstery and plastic, with magazine holders above the windscreen, hand-holds for rear passengers incorporated into the head restraints of the front seats, remote radio controls on the instrument cluster, twin removable sunroof panels (including a special zip-up storage bag behind the rear seats) and a Land Rover-branded cloth fabric holdall in the front centre console for oddments storage that could be removed from the vehicle and worn as a handbag using a supplied shoulder strap (relatively few of these bags have survived, making them collectable items). Despite such features, the interior's basic structure was the same as the Range Rover and virtually all the switchgear and instruments came from other [[Rover Group]] cars such as the [[Austin Maestro|Maestro]] and [[Austin Montego|Montego]]. Similarly, the Discovery utilised several Range Rover body panels, as well as headlights from the [[LDV Pilot|Freight Rover]] van and taillights from the Maestro van. The latter would continue to bear the [[Austin Rover]] 'chevron' logo on their lenses until production of the first generation Discovery ended in 1998, ten years after Austin Rover ceased to exist.\n\nThe designers of the original model had been forced to economise and use the \"parts bin\" of the \n-then parent company, Rover. The 200 series used the basic body shell structure from the Range Rover, door handles from the [[Morris Marina]], tail lights from the [[Austin Maestro]] van, and interior switchgear and instrumentation from [[Austin Rover Group|Rover's]] surplus parts.\n\nIn 1992, the Discovery received several additions and improvements. The interior was offered in a more traditional beige as well as the distinctive (but controversial) light blue, an [[automatic gearbox]] was made available on 200Tdi models, new colours were added to the range (and the large 'compass and mountain' side decals worn by early Discoveries to disguise wavy panel fit around the rear three quarter windows were no longer fitted) and the 'SE' pack (incorporating alloy wheels, front driving lights, roof bars and a special range of metallic paints) was introduced as an option. A two-seater, three-door Discovery Commercial version, lacking rear-side windows, was later offered by Land Rover Special Vehicles also known as SVO (Special Vehicles Operations).\n\nBefore 1994, the Discovery was available with either the 2.5-litre 200 [[Turbo Direct Injection|Tdi]] engine or the 3.5-litre [[Rover V8 engine|Rover V8]]. Early V8 engines used a twin [[SU carburettor]] system, switching to [[Lucas 14CUX]] fuel injection in 1990. A 2.0-litre petrol engine from the Rover stable was briefly available in a model known as the 2.0-litre Mpi [[Straight-4|I4]]. This was intended to attract fleet managers, since UK (and Italian) tax laws benefitted vehicles under 2.0&nbsp;litres. A combination of changes in taxation and lack of power for such a heavy vehicle led to the demise of this engine, despite its fitting to several Discoveries supplied to the [[British Royal family]]. One of these was notably driven by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] around [[Windsor Great Park]], in his position as [[Park Ranger]].\n\nThe transmission was a permanent four-wheel drive system, with a high and low range transfer box, [[locking differential|locking]] centre [[differential (automotive)|differential]] at the [[transfer case|transfer box]]. Similarly to the rest of the Land Rover range, the handbrake acts on the transmission at the back of the transfer box, therefore locking the rear prop shaft or both front and rear prop shafts if the central differential lock is engaged.\n\nIn Australia, the Series I launched in April 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&make=Land%20Rover&model=Discovery |title=Land Rover Discovery \u2013 Used Car Research |work=GoAuto |access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref> available only as a three-door estate in 3.5-litre V8i guise with {{convert|115|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} and coupled with a five-speed [[manual gearbox]].<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/> In October 1991, Land Rover launched the five-door body variant in base V8i and luxury HL versions.<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/> Both featured central locking, electric windows, headlight washers and heated door mirrors, with the HL adding alloy wheels, air conditioning, driving lights and an improved audio system.<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/> Furthermore, the Tdi engine became available, rated at {{convert|83|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|265|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/> In early-1993, a four-speed automatic option was added to the Australian range and the HL was discontinued.<ref name=\"GoAuto Series I\"/>\n\n;1994 update\n{{multiple image | align = | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1996 Land Rover Discovery V8i 5-door wagon (2015-12-07) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1996 Land Rover Discovery V8i 5-door wagon (2015-12-07) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Land Rover Discovery V8i five-door (Australia)\n}}\n\nIn 1994, many changes were made to the Discovery. It reached some markets as the \"Discovery 2\"; the 200Tdi and 3.5&nbsp;L V8 engines were replaced with the 2.5&nbsp;L 300Tdi 4-cylinder and 3.9-litre Rover V8 engines. The 300Tdi introduced a Bosch electronic emissions control for certain models and markets. At around this time, a stronger R380 gearbox was fitted to all manual models. The newer models featured larger headlamps and a second set of rear lights in the bumper. The new rear lights had their wiring configuration changed several times to meet real or expected European safety legislation. Some vehicles were left with an arrangement where the vulnerable bumper contains the only working direction-indicator lights; other examples have these lights duplicated in the traditional rear pillar location.\n\n;North America\nThe 1994 model year marked the first year that the Land Rover Discovery was sold in the United States. Airbags were incorporated into the design of the 1994 model to meet the requirements of US motor vehicle safety regulations, though they were not fitted as standard in all markets. All North American specification (NAS) models were fitted with the 3.9-litre V8 from the [[Range Rover]] SE models, and later models saw a change to the 4.0-litre version of the engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto.consumerguide.com/auto/used/reviews/full/index.cfm/id/2190/ |title=1994\u20131998 Land Rover Discovery: Overview \u2013 Consumer Guide Automotive |publisher=Auto.consumerguide.com |accessdate=14 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061225050206/http://auto.consumerguide.com/auto/used/reviews/full/index.cfm/id/2190/ |archivedate=25 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTechnically speaking, the 1996-98 US models with 4.0-litre engines had the same displacement as the 3.9-litre engines fitted to the earlier 1994-95 US models; the differences between the engines involved improvements to the block rigidity and pistons, and a change from the Lucas 14CUX engine management to the distributor-less Generic Engine Management System (\"GEMS\"). In earlier 3.9-litre US engines, the fuel injection computer (14CUX) did not control the ignition, which was instead controlled by a traditional system with an ignition coil and distributor made by Lucas. The GEMS system was developed jointly by Lucas and [[SAGEM]]; it controlled both spark timing and fuel injection. Unlike the earlier systems fitted to Rover V8 engines, GEMS was made [[On-Board Diagnostics#OBD-II|OBD-II]] compliant. This change was largely driven by the federal requirement (starting in 1996) for vehicles sold in the United States to meet the OBD-II specification.\n\n;Other versions\n[[File:1994 Honda Crossroad (8627437970).jpg|thumb|1994 Honda Crossroad (Japan)]]\n\nIn Japan, a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] version of the Discovery I was offered, called the [[Honda Crossroad]]. The [[Rover (car)|Rover]] companies had a cross-holding relationship with [[Honda]] UK since the early-1980s. The relationship ended after Rover was taken over by German carmaker [[BMW]] in 1994. (Honda revived the nameplate 'Crossroad' in another small sport utility vehicle in 2007.)\n\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], local tax laws meant that the first ever example of a Discovery Commercial (van) was launched there in 1991. A revised version was launched in 1993, shortly after the UK market example of late-1992. The Irish examples have formed the basis of the Discovery's success and high sales there, as commercials are on a much lower tax band.\n\n;Special editions\n* '''Country Life''' ''(Switzerland, 1991)'': The Country Life was a five-door V8i Discovery with special interior trim, including a leather-wrapped [[Nardi (carmaker)|Nardi]] steering wheel, wood door and console trim, and identifying decals.

Land Rover promoted that the Discovery Series&nbsp;II had been modified with 720 'differences'. The interior and exterior were re-worked to be less utilitarian, but it was still clearly an evolution of the Series&nbsp;I. Every body panel had been altered, except the outer skin on the rear doors. The rear body was extended to improve load space, and to now accommodate full-size adults on all seven seats on the SE7 option, as well as make them all forward facing,<ref>[https://dustrunnersauto.com/land-rover-discovery-ii/ Land Rover Discovery II: 8 Reasons to Buy One Today \u2013 Dust Runners Automotive Journal]</ref><ref>[https://nl.ifixit.com/Wiki/The_History_of_Land_Rover_-_Small_Beginnings-Big_Results The History of Land Rover \u2013 iFixit]</ref> but at the expense of added rear overhang, which slightly reduced the car's departure angle, when off-roading.\n\nThe Discovery mk.&nbsp;II was the last Land Rover product to use an evolution of the original 1970 Range Rover underpinnings \u2013 with its extended, {{convert|185|in|m|2|abbr=on}} long, four-door body still riding on the same, relatively short {{convert|100|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase, ladder-frame chassis, combined with live axles front and rear, into the year 2004.\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1998 Land Rover Discovery II V8 5-door wagon (2010-07-21) 02.jpg \n| caption1 = Pre-facelift Discovery II V8 (GB)\n| image2 = Land Rover Discovery front 20081201.jpg \n| caption2 = Facelift Discovery II Td5\n| image3 = 2002-2004 Land Rover Discovery (MY03) Td5 5-door wagon (2011-10-25).jpg \n| caption3 = Facelift Discovery II Td5\n}}\n\nChanges to the diesel-engined models saw the 2,495&nbsp;cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected [[straight-five engine]]) introduced, in line with the updated Defender models. This electronically managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than it's 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the [[Rover L-Series engine|Rover L-series]] passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948&nbsp;cc [[V8 engine|V8]] petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross bolted caps, different connecting rods, and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year, Discovery II they changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the 4.0 continued as the only V8 option offered in the UK).\n\nACE ([[Active Cornering Enhancement]], an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cars-data.com/en/technical-terms/ace-active-cornering-enhancement.html|title=Active Cornering Enhancement - ACE|website=Cars-Data.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>A pair of accelerometers are used to detect the angle of body lean and to instruct the ACE computer to counteract these movements by applying pressure to the vehicle's torsion bars via actuators which are hydraulically controlled. On the Land Rover Discovery, the ACE system can counteract up 1 g of lateral acceleration in less than a tenth of a second, thus helping the vehicle become more stable and responsive during hard cornering. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European type-approval for seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.\n\nThe locking center differential was still fitted until early-2001, although the linkage to operate it was not attached, as Land Rover believed that the [[traction control system|traction control]] and newly developed [[Hill Descent Control system|Hill Descent Control]] would render it redundant. The actual locking mechanism was removed in early-2001, before being fully reinstated (with linkage) in 2004. Whilst the traction control system worked very effectively, it did not offer the same level of control and smooth operation as the vehicles fitted with the differential lock. Customer demand saw the diff lock controls fully reinstated as a cost option only (standard on top of range HSE/SE vehicles) on UK and Irish models, and aftermarket kits are offered by several vendors for those vehicles which were produced with the lock, but not the linkage.\n\nThe US version was available in three trim levels: S, SE, LT and HSE, the SE, LT and HSE having a seven-seat option, SE7, LT7 and HSE7.\n\nThe \"facelift\" models are easily identified by new \"pocketed\" headlamps (which matched the Range Rover and facelifted Freelander models) as well as redesigned turn and brake lamps on the rear of the vehicle. The indicators were moved from the bumper to the high side fixtures. The earlier Series II models could in turn be easily distinguished from the original Discovery by the position of those stop light fixtures above the window-line (earlier models had them below), and by the replacement of paddle door handles with the current sort. The Series II also differs slightly in dimensions.\n\nA small number of Discovery II Commercial models were produced by Land Rover Special Vehicles, this time based on the five-door bodyshell but with the windows rendered opaque to give van-like appearance and security. Normal vehicles were exported to Republic of Ireland, where the rear-side windows were smashed and rear seats were destroyed in the presence of a Revenue official, to offer a model that avoided the Vehicle Registration Tax (saving approximately 40%).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The UK Commercials came with rear self-levelling suspension as standard (an option that has in the main been deleted from these vehicles in subsequent ownership due to reliability issues.)\n\nIn the final production run of the Discovery II, only two models were offered for sale in the UK market, the 'base' Pursuit, which still retained a high level of equipment as standard, and the top specification Landmark, which offered an all-leather interior, twin sunroofs, Active Cornering Enhancement, six-disc CD player, and a heated windscreen. The final vehicles left the production lines in late-May 2004 to make way for the all new Discovery 3 (LR3) models.\n\n== {{anchor|L319}} Second generation (L319) ==\n\n=== {{anchor|Discovery 3|3}} Discovery 3 / LR3 (2004\u20132009) ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Discovery 3 (L319)\n| image = 2004 Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 HSE 2.7 Front.jpg\n| caption = Pre-facelift Land Rover Discovery TDV6 HSE \n| aka = Land Rover LR3 (North America & Middle East)\n| production = June 2004\u20132009\n| assembly = United Kingdom: [[Solihull]] ([[Solihull plant]])<br />Jordan: [[Aqaba]] ([[Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant|Aqaba plant]])\n| designer = Andy Wheel (2000)\n| body_style = 5-door [[estate car|estate]]\n| related = [[Range Rover Sport]]\n| engine = 4.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|Ford ''Cologne'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] (petrol)<br />4.4&nbsp;L ''[[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#4.4 L|AJ41]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (petrol)<br />2.7&nbsp;L ''[[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17#2.7D/TDV6/HDi|AJD]]'' V6-[[turbocharger|T]] (diesel)\n| transmission = 6-speed manual<br />6-speed automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|113.6|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|190.9|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width = {{convert|75.4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = 2005\u20132006: {{convert|74.1|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}<br />2007\u20132009: {{convert|74.5|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{convert|5333|-|5426|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| sp = uk\n}}\n\nOn 2 April 2004, Land Rover introduced the Discovery 3, marketed as the LR3 in North America and The Middle East. It retained the key features of the Discovery, such as the stepped roofline and steeply raked windscreen. The LR3 name was chosen for North American and Middle Eastern markets due to negative quality associations with the Discovery name and (according to Land Rover) a preference in the American market for alpha-numeric model designations \u2013 the second generation [[Land Rover Freelander|Freelander]] was also re-designated for the North American and Middle Eastern market as the LR2.\n\nLand Rover developed a body construction method for the Discovery 3, marketed as Integrated Body Frame (IBF). The engine bay and passenger compartment are built as a monocoque, then mated to a basic [[Ladder frame|ladder-frame chassis]] for the gearbox and suspension. Land Rover claims IBF combines the virtues of monocoque and ladder-frame \u2013 though it makes for a heavier vehicle than a monocoque construction, compromising performance and agility somewhat but adding strength, toughness and adaptability.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 2004 Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 HSE 2.7 Rear.jpg | caption1 = Pre\u2013facelift Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 HSE\n| image2 = 2008-2009 Land Rover Discovery 3 (MY09) TDV6 SE wagon (2010-09-23) 01.jpg\n| image3 = 2008-2009 Land Rover Discovery 3 (MY09) TDV6 SE wagon (2010-09-23) 02.jpg \n| caption3 = Facelift Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 SE.

Like the Range Rover L322, this is an [[air suspension]] system, enabling ride-height adjustment by simply pumping up or deflating the air bags. The vehicle can be raised to provide ground clearance when off-road, but lowered at high speeds to improve handling. Land Rover developed 'cross-linked' [[air suspension]]. When needed, the suspension mimics the action of a beam axle (as one wheel drops, the other rises). If the chassis of the vehicle contacts the ground when the suspension was at its 'off-road' height, the system senses the reduction in load on the air springs and raises the vehicle an extra inch. In the UK and European markets, a coil-spring independent suspension system was offered on the base model. This model was unique in the range by having only five seats and only being available with the 2.7-litre diesel engine. This model lacked the Terrain Response system.\n\nThe engines used in the Discovery 3 were all taken from Land Rover's sister company at the time, [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]. A [[Ford]]/[[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn|PSA]]-developed 2.7-litre, {{convert|195|hp|abbr=on}}, 440&nbsp;Nm [[V6 engine|V6]] [[diesel engine]] (the [[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17|TdV6]]) was intended to be the biggest seller in Europe. For the US market and as the high-performance option elsewhere, a 4.4-litre petrol [[V8 engine|V8]] of {{convert|300|hp|abbr=on}} was chosen. A {{convert|216|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0-litre [[SOHC]] [[Ford Cologne V6 engine|Ford V6 petrol engine]] was available in North America and Australia.\n\nThe gearboxes on the Discovery 3 were also all-new. For the diesel engine, a six-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard. As an option, and as standard on the V8 engine, a six-speed [[automatic transmission]] was available. Both came with a two-speed transfer box and permanent four-wheel-drive. A computer controlled progressively locking central differential ensured traction was retained in tough conditions. A similar differential was available on the rear axle to aid traction.\n\nThe Discovery 3 was fitted with multiple electronic traction control systems. Hill Descent Control (HDC) prevented vehicle 'runaways' when descending steep gradients and 4-wheel Electronic Traction Control (4ETC) prevented wheel spin in low-traction conditions. An on-road system, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), prevented skidding when steering and braking at speed. The vehicle also featured the 'Terrain Response' system. Previously, off-road driving had been a skill that many drivers found daunting. A wide-ranging knowledge of the vehicle was needed to be able to select the correct gear, transfer ratio, various differential systems and master various techniques required for tackling steep hills, deep water and other tough terrain. Terrain Response attempted to take away as many of the difficulties as possible. The driver selected a terrain type (\"Sand\", \"Grass, Gravel & Snow\", \"Mud & Ruts\" and \"Rock Crawl\") on a dial in the cab of the vehicle. The on-board computer systems then select the correct gearbox settings, adjust the suspension height, adjust the differential lock settings and even alter the throttle response of the engine suitable for the terrain. For example, in \"Rock Crawl\", the suspension is raised to its maximum height and set to allow maximum wheel articulation, the differentials are locked, the driver is prompted to switch to Low Range, and the throttle response is altered to provide low-speed control. In \"Sand\" mode, the traction control system is 'primed' to be more sensitive to wheelspin, the differentials are partly locked, and the throttle response is re-mapped to produce high power outputs with short pedal movement. The driver retained some manual control over the off-road systems, being able to select the Transfer Box ratio and the suspension height manually, although use of the Terrain Response system is needed to allow full use of the vehicles' capabilities.\n\nAs well as new mechanical and electronic systems, the Discovery 3 introduced a new design to the interior and exterior of the vehicle. The Discovery 3 was able to have a fresh, [[minimalist]] style. The interior featured a flexible seven-seat layout. Passengers in the rearmost row now entered through the rear side doors, instead of the tailgate as in previous versions. The driver benefitted from a DVD [[Automotive navigation system|navigation system]], including some optional features like [[Bluetooth]] telephony in later models. Like the [[Range Rover]], this audio, information & entertainment (\"infotainment\") system in the Discovery 3 adopted an electronics architecture whereby the system's distributed control units pass information and audio amongst one another and throughout the vehicle via optical links based on the MOST (or, [[Media Oriented Systems Transport]]) fibre-optic automotive networking standard (informally called the \"MOST-bus\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mostcooperation.com/f/core/frontend/http/http.php?id=%2Fpublications%2Fbrochures_newsletters%2Flatest%2Findex.html&lang=1&popup=0.1.1.159110%21159110.1.5.159119%21159119.1.2.178238%21178238.1.1.170172%21170172.2.2.178242%21178242.2.2.178199-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518011042/http://www.mostcooperation.com/f/core/frontend/http/http.php?id=%2Fpublications%2Fbrochures_newsletters%2Flatest%2Findex.html&lang=1&popup=0.1.1.159110%21159110.1.5.159119%21159119.1.2.178238%21178238.1.1.170172%21170172.2.2.178242%21178242.2.2.178199-1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 May 2009 |title=MOST Cooperation |publisher=MOST Cooperation |accessdate=12 November 2011 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2010}}. The system's navigation functions were unique to Land Rover because, in addition to the typical road map navigation, benefits included an off-road navigation and four-wheel drive information mode. When in four-wheel drive information mode, the screen showed a [[schematic]] of the vehicle, displaying the amount of suspension movement, angle the front wheels were steering, the status of the locking differentials and icons showing which mode the Terrain Response was in, and what gear was selected on automatic versions.\n\nThe vehicle was lauded by the press, with the Terrain Response system, improved on-road dynamics, and interior design receiving particular praise. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] of the BBC's ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' motoring show drove one to the top of [[Cnoc an Fhreiceadain]], a {{convert|307|m|ft|abbr=on}} mountain near Tongue in northern Scotland, where no vehicle had previously reached. [[Richard Hammond]], presenter of Top Gear, praised it as the \"Best 4X4 of all time\". In Australia, the vehicle was awarded \"4WD of the Year\" by the 4WD Press.\n\nIn 2006, Land Rover used the Discovery 3 in its [[G4 challenge]], alongside the [[Range Rover Sport]]. The vehicles used were all in standard mechanical form, except for the fitment of additional Land Rover off-road equipment.\n\nThe first all-new model placement since the Freelander, the Range Rover Sport is based on the Discovery 3 platform, rather than on the larger Range Rover.\n\nA 2008\u20132009 facelifted model of the Discovery 3 offered a [[Harman Kardon|Harman/Kardon]] stereo system upgrade, six-CD changer, clear side indicator lights, and body-colour bumpers.\n\nA driverless version of the LR3 finished 4th in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2007)|DARPA Urban Challenge]].<ref name=\"firstCarnagie\">{{cite news |url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/11/darpa-names-win.html |work=Wired |first=Michael |last=Belfiore |title=Carnegie Takes First in DARPA's Urban Challenge |date=4 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Discovery 4|4}} Discovery 4 / LR4 (2009\u20132016) ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Discovery 4 (L319)\n| image = 2012 Land Rover Discovery 4 (L319 MY12) TDV6 wagon (2015-08-07) 01.jpg\n| caption = Pre-facelift Land Rover Discovery 4\n| aka = Land Rover LR4 (North America & Middle East)\n| production = 2009\u20132016\n| assembly = United Kingdom: [[Solihull]] ([[Solihull plant]])<br />Jordan: [[Aqaba]] ([[Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant|Aqaba plant]])\n| designer = [[Gerry McGovern]] (2007)\n| body_style = 5-door [[estate car|estate]]\n| related = [[Range Rover Sport]]\n| engine = 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#AJ126|AJ126]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]-[[supercharger|S]] (petrol)<br />5.0&nbsp;L ''[[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#AJ133|AJ133]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (petrol)<br />2.7&nbsp;L ''[[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17#2.7D/TDV6/HDi|AJD]]'' V6-[[turbocharger|T]] (diesel)<br />3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17#3.0D/TDV6/SDV6/HDi|AJD]]'' V6-T (diesel) \n| transmission = 6-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] manual<br />6-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] automatic<br />8-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2885|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4838|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|2022|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (mirrors folded)\n| height = {{convert|1970|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (including roof rails)\n| weight = {{convert|5282|-|5695|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n}}\n\nThe Discovery 4 (called the LR4 in North America and The Middle East) is an updated version of the Discovery 3.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reicars.com/land-rover-discovery-2016-model/ |title=Land Rover Discovery Model |publisher=ReiCars.com |access-date=8 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201215703/http://reicars.com/land-rover-discovery-2016-model/ |archive-date=1 February 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nUsing the same Integrated Body Frame structure, the new Discovery has altered front and rear light units and a restyled front grille and bumper to adopt the same smoother, rounder style as also adopted for the 2010 [[Range Rover]] and [[Range Rover Sport]].<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.5</ref> The Discovery 4 also retains the body-coloured wheel arches and bumpers as the late Discovery 3s (early D3s had black plastic trim).

The D4 receives two engines from [[Jaguar Land Rover]]'s ''Gen III'' range. The [[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17#AJ-V6D Gen III|TDV6 Gen III]] is a 3.0-litre development of the 2.7-litre engine used in the D3. The new version features advanced twin-sequential [[turbocharger]]s where a [[Variable geometry turbocharger]] is used at low engine speeds, with a second standard turbo is brought online at higher engine speeds.<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.14</ref> Two versions of the 3.0-litre diesel are offered. Fuel economy was improved over the previous generation diesel while power, torque and diesel NVH were improved significantly. This system provides greater output than the older engine, with {{convert|241|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} whilst reducing {{CO2}} emissions by 10&nbsp;percent when first introduced and in 2014 increased to {{convert|188|kW|hp|abbr=on}}. The Gen III version of the [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#AJ-V8 Gen III|V8 petrol engine]] (available in markets outside the UK such as North America, Russia, Japan, Australia, and some EU countries) is now a 5-litre unit with [[Gasoline direct injection|Direct Petrol Injection]] developing {{convert|385|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}.<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.14 + p.34</ref>\n\nAn improved version of the [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] six-speed automatic/sequential gearbox was incorporated and in 2012(2014 in the US) was further improved including a change to 8 speeds. It includes taller gearing to take advantage of the new engines' greater torque output and an updated lock-up system to further reduce fuel consumption. Other technical changes include the fitting of the more powerful brakes from the [[Range Rover Sport]] and thicker [[Sway bar|anti-roll bars]] to improve on-road handling. The Stability Control System now includes a programme that detects the onset of [[understeer]] and applies the brakes. The Discovery 4 retains its predecessor's [[independent suspension|fully independent]] [[air suspension]] with cross-linking when off-road and the twin-range transfer gearbox with an electronic infinitely variable locking centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]].<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.22 + p.23</ref> As before, a similar locking rear differential is available. The Terrain Response system remains but with two new features \u2013 the 'Sand' mode incorporates a new traction control mode to prevent loss of traction when starting off and stopping in soft sand, and the 'Rock Crawl' mode gains a feature that applies gentle brake pressure at low (less than walking pace) speeds to improve grip and stability on slick rock. The system is also 'retuned' to account for the new engines and gearboxes with their different torque characteristics. Other new electronic systems include Trailer Stability Assist which can adjust the throttle and brakes to prevent a dangerously swaying trailer.<ref>Land Rover D4 brochure, p.17</ref>\n\nThe 2.7-litre TDV6 engine was available in Europe on the basic 2.7 GS passenger and 2010 Commercial ranges. Unlike the Discovery 3 base model, this was equipped with air suspension and the Terrain Response system. The automatic gearbox was an option on this model. The 3.0-litre Gen III model (only with automatic gearbox) is also available in the GS trim level.\n\nThe Discovery 4 also features a redesigned interior (in keeping with the new styles introduced elsewhere in the LR range for 2010). The instrument cluster is updated with redesigned analogue speedometer and [[tachometer]] gauges for improved clarity. The analogue temperature/fuel gauges of the previous model and the electronic information display are replaced by a single [[Thin-film transistor|TFT]] screen capable of displaying information in a variety of modes and formats. The interior also has a new centre console, which includes redesigned and simplified switches and controls.<ref name=\"Land Rover D4 brochure, p.6\">Land Rover D4 brochure, p.6</ref> The Discovery also has a new seat design and a wider range of available interior materials \u2013 some previously only seen in Range Rover models. The stated aim of the interior redesign was to lift the vehicle upmarket, with higher-spec models now aimed at the luxury and executive markets.<ref name=\"Land Rover D4 brochure, p.6\"/>\n\nThe car gains some electronic systems from the [[Range Rover]] lineup, such as the optional 'Surround Camera System' \u2013 a series of cameras located in the front bumper, door mirrors, and rear tailgate handle which can display their images on the centre console screen to improve visibility (although the image quality of this system was downgraded by Land Rover around 2014).

A Commercial van variant was released in the UK at the same time using the 2.7 engine and offered in GS and XS trim levels. In the Republic of Ireland a Commercial van was offered from 1 January 2010 based on the XE 2.7 manual and HSE 3.0 auto engines.\n\nAn armoured Discovery with B6 ballistic level of protection was announced in 2010. It offers numerous safety features designed to protect the occupants, including protection from grenades and small arms fire. The vehicle is indistinguishable from the standard LR4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.governmentbusiness.co.uk/content/view/282/23/ |title=Jaguar and Land Rover Armoured Vehicles |publisher=Governmentbusiness.co.uk |accessdate=3 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723113658/http://www.governmentbusiness.co.uk/content/view/282/23/ |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Discovery 4/LR4 Sentinel\">{{cite web |title=Discovery 4 Sentinel |url=http://www.securitysystems-tech.com/files/securitysystems/supplier_docs/Armoured%20-%20Discovery.pdf |work=Security Systems Tech |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2011 model year announced late 2010, the 2.7-litre engine was dropped and two versions of the 3.0-litre engine were made available \u2013 one called the TDV6 and one called the SDV6 (the latter offering 245&nbsp;bhp).\n\nFor the 2012 model year, diesel models in Europe came with the new eight-speed auto gearbox with steering wheel paddle controls and a circular dial selector that raises upon startup. The SDV6 engine was uprated to {{convert|255|bhp|abbr=on}} whilst both diesel engines featured reduced emissions for European models. During 2012 the HSE Luxury special edition was announced, featuring enhanced trim levels, and available in Europe and North American markets.<ref>Land Rover D4 Brochure 2012 Europe</ref>\n\nIn Ireland, 2012 saw the introduction of a new five-seat version of the Discovery 4 classified as an N1 Commercial vehicle, therefore attracting lower VRT rates. There is also a new two-seat Commercial on the same rules. All Irish models came with the lower emissions TDV6 engine. In 2014, an enhanced version of the unique-to-Ireland five-seater commercial utility went on sale which included almost all top-of-the-range features for a lower price. This vehicle is now the top selling Discovery in Ireland due to the fact that it attracts low road tax ({{\u20ac|333}} per year) and VAT can be reclaimed.\n\nFor 2013, models received a style freshening, new badging, new fuel stretching technology, improved audio systems and a new range of driver assistance, comfort and safety features. The 2014 Discovery comes with a standard [[ZF 8HP transmission]], and in some markets can be supplied with a one-speed transfer case (replacing the two speed transfer case). 2014 also marks the first use of a {{convert|2995|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} supercharged six cylinder engine, replacing the previous V6 and V8 offerings.\n\nIn a January 2011 comparison test by ''Car and Driver'', the Land Rover LR4 came in fourth place out of five cars behind the [[Audi Q7]], [[BMW X5]], and [[Acura MDX]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/acura-mdx-vs-audi-q7-bmw-x5-land-rover-lr4-lexus-gx460-comparison-test |title=Acura MDX vs. Audi Q7 3.0T, BMW X5 xDrive35i, Land Rover LR4 HSE, Lexus GX460}}</ref> However, it has always won the ''Auto Express'' categories of Best Large SUV and Best Towcar since it was launched in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://media.jaguarlandrover.com|title=JLR Corporate Homepage International |website=media.jaguarlandrover.com|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nTo celebrate 25 years of the Land Rover Discovery, a special edition of 1800 (?) vehicles was produced in 2014 marked as the XXV, and featured a number of unique details including light grey (Cirrus) XXV-embossed Windsor leather seats, special grill sets, and almost every extra and expansion pack available. A number of these were exported in silver grey and the darker causeway grey for UK markets.\n\nA major milestone in Land Rover Discovery's history came when the one millionth example built rolled off the Solihull production line in March 2012. This vehicle, along with two similar examples, was driven from Solihull to Beijing, China in a replication of a 1950s expedition. During this expedition, G459&nbsp;WAC, a pre-production Discovery 1 (which was subsequently converted into an amphibious vehicle) joined in the celebrations when the expedition visited [[Lake Geneva]]. The expedition concluded with the actual Millionth Discovery appearing at the Beijing Motor Show. This vehicle subsequently returned to go on permanent exhibition at the [[British Motor Industry Heritage Trust]] centre at Gaydon, Warwickshire, England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.jaguarlandrover.com/en-in/land-rover/news/2012/02/lr_d4_journey_of_discovery_launch_290212/ |title=Land Rover Launches Journey of Discovery |publisher=Newsroom.jaguarlandrover.com |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n;Engines\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Type/code!!Power, torque at rpm\n|-\n!colspan=4|Petrol engines\n|-\n|5.0 L V8||2009 (MY2010)-2013||{{convert|4999|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V8 32v ([[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#AJ133|AJ133]])||{{convert|375|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500, {{convert|510|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,500\n|-\n|3.0 L SCV6||2014\u2013||{{convert|2995|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 supercharged ([[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine#AJ126|AJ126]])||{{convert|340|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500, {{convert|460|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,500\u20135,000\n|-\n!colspan=4|Diesel engines\n|-\n|2.7 L TDV6||2009\u20132010||{{convert|2720|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 single turbo ([[Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17]])||{{convert|190|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000, {{convert|440|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1,900\n|-\n|3.0 L TDV6||2011\u20132013 ||{{convert|2993|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 twin turbo (Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT20)||{{convert|211|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000, {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,000\n|-\n|3.0 L SDV6||2009\u20132011 ||{{convert|2993|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 twin turbo (Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT20)||{{convert|245|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000, {{convert|600|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,000\n|-\n|3.0 L SDV6||2011\u20132013||{{convert|2993|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} V6 twin turbo (Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT20)||{{convert|258|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000, {{convert|600|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,000\n|}\n\n;Transmissions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Type/code\n|-\n!colspan=4|Petrol engines\n|-\n|5.0 L V8||2009\u20132013||ZF 6HP28 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|3.0 L SCV6||2014\u2013||ZF 8-speed automatic\n|-\n!colspan=4|Diesel engines\n|-\n|2.7 L TDV6||2009\u20132010||ZF S6-53 6-speed manual, ZF 6HP26 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|3.0 L TDV6||2009\u20132013||ZF 6HP28 automatic\n|-\n|3.0 L SDV6||2012\u20132016||ZF 8HP28 automatic\n|}\n\n==  {{anchor|Discovery 5}}{{anchor|L462}} Third generation (L462;

In profile, the exterior design is also very similar to the small [[Land Rover Discovery Sport|Discovery Sport]] model. In contrast to previous Discovery models, the third-generation has a much more rounded shape, eschewing the traditional angular design. The tail lights have changed from a vertical orientation to horizontal, and the third-row side glass no longer blends into the roof glass. The tailgate is no longer horizontally split and has been replaced with a conventional top hinged tailgate made from composite. The roof is still stepped over the third row, though it is now largely cosmetic in comparison to the previous models and the roof now has a strong taper to the back. The interior closely follows that from other contemporary Land Rover models, while continuing the 3-row tradition of the Discovery.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\nThe new Discovery 5 incorporates several changes over its predecessors. For the first time, the Discovery is based around Land Rover's aluminium architecture, first introduced on the Range Rover (L405). The use of aluminium chassis and body panels gives a weight loss of up to 480&nbsp;kg over its predecessor. This weight loss combined with a new aerodynamic design, a 17 percent lower {{cd|link=yes}}, achieves a fuel efficiency improvement over previous Discovery generations. The new Discovery is offered with a combination of [[V6 engine|V6]] petrol and diesel engines. All Discovery 5s are equipped with a standard 8 speed automatic transmission. An available option package adds a two speed transfer case (low range gearbox) and the option of an actively locking rear differential. Coil springs are now standard on base trim models, while air suspension is still offered as an option.\n\nLand Rover also introduces Terrain Response 2 on the Discovery 5. Similarly to the first generation of Terrain Response, Terrain Response 2 constantly monitors wheel slip, wheel speed, angle of approach or departure, and the suspension's compression or rebound to adjust the anti-lock braking system, throttle response, differentials and traction control systems. The driver can select modes for snow, grass, gravel, mud ruts, sand, or rock crawling by the spin of a dial on the centre console. Terrain Response 2 also introduces a new 'Auto' mode that allows the vehicles computer to select the most appropriate mode on its own.\n\nThe Discovery 5 is the first Discovery to be built on a unibody chassis, unlike its predecessors which were built body on frame. This allows the vehicle to have higher torsional rigidity with less weight. According to the automotive press{{who|date=July 2017}}, the latest generation has a higher wading depth (up to {{convert|35.6|in|cm}}), improved ground clearance and a more comfortable ride while traversing adverse terrain.\n\n== Derivatives and specialist versions ==\n[[File:Discovery 4 Sentinel at DSEi 2015.JPG|thumb|left|Discovery 4 Sentinel at DSEi 2015]]\n[[File:Supacat's LRV 400 Mk2 is based on the Discovery 4.JPG|thumb|right|Supacat's LRV 400 Mk2 is based on the Discovery 4]]\n[[File:Land Rover Discovery 5, IAA 2017, Frankfurt (1Y7A3088).jpg|thumb|Discovery SVX]]\n[[File:MSU Carabinieri Land Rover Discovery 4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]-[[Multinational Specialized Unit|MSU]] [[Carabinieri]] Discovery 4 equipped for [[Riot control|CRC]] in [[Kosovo]].]]\n\n\n[[Supacat]], part of [[Supacat|SC Group]], offer two vehicles based on a modified Discovery 4 platforms.

The Light Reconnaissance Vehicle 400 (LRV 400) is an open lightweight 4x4 vehicle of the [[Land Rover Defender]] class. The LRV 400 was developed based on a combination of market research and customer feedback from the 2011-unveiling of a proof-of-concept closed cab variant. Development of the LRV 400 continues, the latest Mk2 shown publicly for the first time at [[DSEI]] 2015 (15\u201318 September). The most significant design change for the Mk2 is a switch of the automotive platform to the Land Rover Discovery 4 rather than the off-road racer platform previously offered.<ref name=\"LRV 400 Mk2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.w54.biz/showthread.php?61-All-Terrain-and-High-Mobility-Vehicles/page109 |title=Supacat Unveils Latest LRV 400 Recon Vehicle |accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nLand Rover offered an armoured version of the Discovery 4, the Sentinel. Protected to Level B6 (defined in accordance with [[European Standard]] EN1063 BR6 (glazing) and EN1522 and certified by [[QinetiQ]]), according to Jaguar Land Rover the Discovery 4 Sentinel is almost indistinguishable from the non-armoured Discovery 4.

Originally introduced in 1989, the Mk3 represented the biggest change to the Fiesta since the [[Ford Fiesta (first generation)|original car]] was introduced in 1976. In addition to the 3-door [[hatchback]] and [[panel van]] versions that had formed the Fiesta range, a 5-door hatchback was also added. The Fiesta Mk3 was replaced by the '''[[Ford Fiesta (fourth generation)|Fiesta Mk4]]''' in 1995, but remained on sale until early 1997. The Mk4 was a major restyle of the Mk3, but had the same chassis.\n\nThe Fiesta Mk3 also spawned a high-cube panel van version in 1991, the '''[[Ford Courier#Europe (1991\u20132002)|Courier]]''', and also shared its platform with the '''[[Ford Ka|Ka]]''' of 1996, which was derived from the Fiesta Mk4.\n\n==History==\nThe third generation Fiesta, codenamed ''BE-13'' was unveiled at the end of 1988 and officially went on sale in February of the following year with UK sales commencing in April.  The car was based on a new platform ditching the old car's rear beam axle for a semi-independent torsion beam arrangement and looked radically different, addressing the principal weakness of the [[Ford Fiesta (second generation)|previous generation]] \u2013 the lack of a 5-door derivative, something that was by then available in its major rivals such as the [[Fiat Uno]], [[Peugeot 205]] and [[Opel Corsa]]/[[Vauxhall Nova]].

Originally introduced in 1989, the Mk3 represented the biggest change to the Fiesta since the [[Ford Fiesta (first generation)|original car]] was introduced in 1976. In addition to the 3-door [[hatchback]] and [[panel van]] versions that had formed the Fiesta range, a 5-door hatchback was also added. The Fiesta Mk3 was replaced by the '''[[Ford Fiesta (fourth generation)|Fiesta Mk4]]''' in 1995, but remained on sale until early 1997. The Mk4 was a major restyle of the Mk3, but had the same chassis.\n\nThe Fiesta Mk3 also spawned a high-cube panel van version in 1991, the '''[[Ford Courier#Europe (1991\u20132002)|Courier]]''', and also shared its platform with the '''[[Ford Ka|Ka]]''' of 1996, which was derived from the Fiesta Mk4.\n\n==History==\nThe third generation Fiesta, codenamed ''BE-13'' was unveiled at the end of 1988 and officially went on sale in February of the following year with UK sales commencing in April.  The car was based on a new platform ditching the old car's rear beam axle for a semi-independent torsion beam arrangement and looked radically different, addressing the principal weakness of the [[Ford Fiesta (second generation)|previous generation]] \u2013 the lack of a 5-door derivative, something that was by then available in its major rivals such as the [[Fiat Uno]], [[Peugeot 205]] and [[Opel Corsa]]/[[Vauxhall Nova]].  The other main change was to the running gear \u2013 the improved [[Ford HCS engine|HCS (High Compression Swirl)]] version of the [[Ford Kent engine|Kent]]/[[Ford Valencia engine|Valencia]] powerplant. The [[Ford CVH engine|CVH]] units from the second generation were carried over largely unmodified.  The [[Ford LT engine|LT]] diesel engine was enlarged to a 1.8L capacity.  \n\nThis model had the longest production life of any Fiesta to date, achieved the highest yearly sales of any Fiesta in the early 1990s \u2013 achieving a sales volume of 1 million units inside the first two years of production.

Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of \"sorcerer\" witches and \"supernatural\" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.<ref>P\u00f3cs 1999 pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\n====Violence related to accusations====\nBelief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger for serious forms of [[violence]], including [[murder]].

Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as \"a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more \"traditional\" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205\u2013206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to \"any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic\".<ref>[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.</ref> Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' \"refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism\".<ref>[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].</ref> Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.<ref>[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.</ref>\n\n==== Stregheria ====\n{{Main|Stregheria}}\nModern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}</ref>\n\nThe ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===\n{{main|Satanism and Witchcraft}}\nSatanists are not affiliated with wicca <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofsatan.com/faq-occultism-wicca-voodoo/|title=F.A.Q.

The Church of Satan practices Lesser Magic and Greater Magic. Lesser Magic is the practice of manipulating those around you, often through persuasion and appearance. In this way, magic represents the influence of yourself and the people around you, and celebrates social interaction. Lesser magic amounts to more of a daily practice than a ritual, it's 'spells' amounting to influencing the world around you. Greater Magic is closer to what people think of when they hear witchcraft. Greater Magic is ritualistic magic. Greater Magic is intended to be an emotional release and personal discovery for the participants, but it involves the more ritualistic aspects of magic, including lighting candles, chanting spells, having an altar, and the like. Greater Magic also aims to have all actively participate. Even when practiced in a bigger group setting, this religious practice is not listening to a religious leader, but rather partaking in the ritual itself on a personal and individualistic level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofsatan.com/ritual-in-satanists-life/|title=On the Role of Ritual in the Life of a Satanist|website=Church of Satan|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe Satanic Temple was founded by Lucien Greaves in 2013.

Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while \"gnosis\" referred to knowledge, and \"[[Wicca]]\" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that \"the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]\". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.<ref>''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L.

It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.\n\nHowever, some of the rabbis practiced \"magic\" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah II|Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the \"magic\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than \"unclean\" forces) than as witchcraft.\n\nJudaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9\u201310) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).\n\nJudaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.\n\n==== Islam ====\n{{See also|Islam and astrology}}\nDivination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}</ref> Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460|title = MAGIC}}</ref> and explicitly forbid its practice.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-4-other-beliefs-and-practices|title=Chapter 4: Other Beliefs and Practices|date=2012-08-09|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Sihr'' translates from [[Arabic]] as black magic.

Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion.

''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.</ref> \n\n==== Spells ====\nPagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.\n</ref> One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.</ref> Botanicals should be gathered, \"During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right.\"<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\">Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.</ref>\n\nSpells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\"/> Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.</ref> To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.\n</ref> Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.</ref>\n\nDemonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606\u2013631|doi=10.1017/S0010417503000276}}</ref> Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple\u2014one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.</ref>\n\nWhile these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.<ref>Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.\n</ref> The western concept of an \"evil eye\" or a \"hex\" was translated to Russia as a \"spoiler\".<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.</ref> A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler. The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.<ref>Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.\n</ref>\n\n==== Societal view of witchcraft ====\nThe dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a \"whisperer\" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).<ref>\nChristine D. Worobec, 1995. \"Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages.\" Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).</ref>\n\nIronically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers \u2013 but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThe history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual's self is often deemed as \"feminine\" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192\u2013194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}</ref>\n\n==== Witchcraft trials ====\n[[File:\"A true and just recorde of the information\"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|upright|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]\n\nWitchcraft trials frequently occurred in seventeenth-century Russia, although the \"[[Witch trials in the early modern period|great witch-hunt]]\" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominantly Western European phenomenon. However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called \"witch hysteria.\" This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.

Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them \"brought back\", but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and they were either burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough these two methods of [[torture]] were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century. Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present. In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.<ref>\nZguta, 1187.</ref> By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts\u2014astrology, fortune telling, and divination\u2014became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\">Zguta, 1191.</ref>\n\nTsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547\u20131584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\"/> Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.<ref>Zguta, 1193.</ref> Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565\u20131572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles. Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598\u20131613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.<ref>Zguta, 1193\u201394.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]], seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the groundwork, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.<ref>Zguta, 1195.</ref> Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.<ref>Zguta, 1196.</ref> Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.\n\n== Witches in art ==\nWitches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a \"witch-craze\" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.<ref>Simons, Patricia. \"THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART.\" Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1\u20138.</ref>\n\n''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the \"protectress of childbirth and fertility\" while Herodias symbolized \"unbridled sensuality\". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).<ref>Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).</ref>\n  \nOne of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.<ref>Stumpel, Jeroen. \u201cThe Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in D\u00fcrer's \u2018Four Witches.\u2019\u201d Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143\u2013160., https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.</ref>\n  \nD\u00fcrer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as \"[sucking] the blood of newborn infants\"<ref name=\":1\" />) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as \"practitioners of witchcraft and magic\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSubsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an \"earthly alliance\" had taken place between Satan's female minions who \"conspired to destroy Christendom\".<ref name=\":12\">Hoak, Dale. \"THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE.\" ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nAnother significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was D\u00fcrer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.<ref name=\":12\" />Another important artist whose art represented the witches was [[Francisco Goya]] with the series \"Black paintings\" and artists whose contemporary art represents the witches is [[Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier]] who is part of the generation of Basque sculptors who have preserved these beliefs until the XXI century. .The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their \"flight-inducing [powers]\". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Neoshamanism ]]\n* [[Modern paganism]]\n* [[Kitchen witch]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Referenced works ==\n* [[Alan Macfarlane]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/Witchcraft_in_Tudor_and_Stuart_England.html?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England''], Psychology Press, 1999 (orig. 1970) \n* ''[[University of Kansas]] Publications in Anthropology'', No. 5 = John M Janzen and Wyatt MacGaffey: ''An Anthology of Kongo Religion: Primary Texts from Lower Za\u00efre''.

Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of \"sorcerer\" witches and \"supernatural\" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.<ref>P\u00f3cs 1999 pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\n====Violence related to accusations====\nBelief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger for serious forms of [[violence]], including [[murder]].

The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals.

The Church of Satan practices Lesser Magic and Greater Magic. Lesser Magic is the practice of manipulating those around you, often through persuasion and appearance. In this way, magic represents the influence of yourself and the people around you, and celebrates social interaction. Lesser magic amounts to more of a daily practice than a ritual, it's 'spells' amounting to influencing the world around you. Greater Magic is closer to what people think of when they hear witchcraft. Greater Magic is ritualistic magic. Greater Magic is intended to be an emotional release and personal discovery for the participants, but it involves the more ritualistic aspects of magic, including lighting candles, chanting spells, having an altar, and the like. Greater Magic also aims to have all actively participate. Even when practiced in a bigger group setting, this religious practice is not listening to a religious leader, but rather partaking in the ritual itself on a personal and individualistic level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofsatan.com/ritual-in-satanists-life/|title=On the Role of Ritual in the Life of a Satanist|website=Church of Satan|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe Satanic Temple was founded by Lucien Greaves in 2013.

In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmake\u00eda'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}}, \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning \"poisoner\", and on this basis, claimed that \"witch\" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.<ref>Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.</ref> His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans.

The word in most New Testament translations is \"sorcerer\"/\"sorcery\" rather than \"witch\"/\"witchcraft\".\n\n==== Judaism ====\n{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\n[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.\n\nHowever, some of the rabbis practiced \"magic\" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah II|Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the \"magic\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than \"unclean\" forces) than as witchcraft.\n\nJudaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9\u201310) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).\n\nJudaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.\n\n==== Islam ====\n{{See also|Islam and astrology}}\nDivination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}</ref> Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460|title = MAGIC}}</ref> and explicitly forbid its practice.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-4-other-beliefs-and-practices|title=Chapter 4: Other Beliefs and Practices|date=2012-08-09|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Sihr'' translates from [[Arabic]] as black magic.

In the course of \"exorcisms\", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.<ref>Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children].

Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of \"The Grateful foxes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes \u2013 Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or \"hereditary witches\".<ref>Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\n{{Main|Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi Arabia]] continues to use the [[death penalty]] for [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|sorcery]] and witchcraft.<ref name= Miethe>{{cite book |title=Punishment: a comparative historical perspective |last=Miethe |first=Terance D. |author2=Lu, Hong |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-60516-8 |page=63}}</ref> In 2006 [[Fawza Falih|Fawza Falih Muhammad Ali]] was condemned to death for practicing witchcraft.<ref>\"Pleas for condemned Saudi 'witch'\", 14 February 2008 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7244579.stm BBC NEWS]</ref> There is no legal definition of sorcery in Saudi, but in 2007 an Egyptian pharmacist working there was accused, convicted, and executed.

The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe \"[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]\" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers.

There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.<ref>Kathleen Kamerick, \"Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500.\" ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.</ref>\n\nThe records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536\u20131736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law.

Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}</ref>\n\nA singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else.

''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.</ref> \n\n==== Spells ====\nPagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.\n</ref> One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.</ref> Botanicals should be gathered, \"During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right.\"<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\">Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.</ref>\n\nSpells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\"/> Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.</ref> To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.\n</ref> Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.</ref>\n\nDemonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606\u2013631|doi=10.1017/S0010417503000276}}</ref> Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple\u2014one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.</ref>\n\nWhile these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.<ref>Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.\n</ref> The western concept of an \"evil eye\" or a \"hex\" was translated to Russia as a \"spoiler\".<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.</ref> A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler. The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.<ref>Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.\n</ref>\n\n==== Societal view of witchcraft ====\nThe dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a \"whisperer\" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).<ref>\nChristine D. Worobec, 1995. \"Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages.\" Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).</ref>\n\nIronically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers \u2013 but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThe history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual's self is often deemed as \"feminine\" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192\u2013194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}</ref>\n\n==== Witchcraft trials ====\n[[File:\"A true and just recorde of the information\"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|upright|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]\n\nWitchcraft trials frequently occurred in seventeenth-century Russia, although the \"[[Witch trials in the early modern period|great witch-hunt]]\" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominantly Western European phenomenon. However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called \"witch hysteria.\" This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community. Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.<ref>\n\nRussell Zguta, \"Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia,\" American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.</ref> Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.<ref>Zguta, 1190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|upright|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: \" [so she must be a witch]\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://archive.org/details/inquisitionunmas02puig|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}</ref>]]\n\nThe sentence for an individual who was found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, as well as in previous centuries, typically included either [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]] or being tested with the \"[[Trial by ordeal#Cold water|ordeal of cold water]]\" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\">Zguta, 1189.</ref> The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but it was also used as a method of truth in Russia both prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy. Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them \"brought back\", but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and they were either burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough these two methods of [[torture]] were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century. Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present. In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.<ref>\nZguta, 1187.</ref> By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts\u2014astrology, fortune telling, and divination\u2014became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\">Zguta, 1191.</ref>\n\nTsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547\u20131584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\"/> Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.<ref>Zguta, 1193.</ref> Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565\u20131572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles. Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598\u20131613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.<ref>Zguta, 1193\u201394.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]], seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the groundwork, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.<ref>Zguta, 1195.</ref> Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.<ref>Zguta, 1196.</ref> Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.\n\n== Witches in art ==\nWitches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a \"witch-craze\" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.<ref>Simons, Patricia. \"THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART.\" Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1\u20138.</ref>\n\n''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the \"protectress of childbirth and fertility\" while Herodias symbolized \"unbridled sensuality\". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).<ref>Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).</ref>\n  \nOne of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.<ref>Stumpel, Jeroen. \u201cThe Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in D\u00fcrer's \u2018Four Witches.\u2019\u201d Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143\u2013160., https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.</ref>\n  \nD\u00fcrer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as \"[sucking] the blood of newborn infants\"<ref name=\":1\" />) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as \"practitioners of witchcraft and magic\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSubsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an \"earthly alliance\" had taken place between Satan's female minions who \"conspired to destroy Christendom\".<ref name=\":12\">Hoak, Dale. \"THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE.\" ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nAnother significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was D\u00fcrer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.<ref name=\":12\" />Another important artist whose art represented the witches was [[Francisco Goya]] with the series \"Black paintings\" and artists whose contemporary art represents the witches is [[Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier]] who is part of the generation of Basque sculptors who have preserved these beliefs until the XXI century. .The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their \"flight-inducing [powers]\". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Neoshamanism ]]\n* [[Modern paganism]]\n* [[Kitchen witch]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Referenced works ==\n* [[Alan Macfarlane]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/Witchcraft_in_Tudor_and_Stuart_England.html?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England''], Psychology Press, 1999 (orig. 1970) \n* ''[[University of Kansas]] Publications in Anthropology'', No. 5 = John M Janzen and Wyatt MacGaffey: ''An Anthology of Kongo Religion: Primary Texts from Lower Za\u00efre''.

The 1.2&nbsp;L SOHC petrol engine was carried over, with an upgraded Bharat Stage-IV compliant catalytic converter.\n\nIn 2012, Tata Motors introduced a high-end version of the car, the Indigo eCS VX, featuring anti-lock braking system (ABS) with electric brake-force distribution (EBD), electrically-adjustable outside rear-view mirrors (E-ORVMs), side repeaters mounted on the ORVMs, and 14-inch alloy wheels.\n\nIn 2013, the company introduced a more pronounced design refresh of the car, featuring redesigned body panels, chrome-inserts on the front-grille, trunk-lid, and front fog-lamp accents; smoked double-barreled headlamp housing, \"Sahara Beige\" fabric upholstery, dual-tone interiors with jet-black and beige tones, a newer 4-spoke steering wheel, and a 2-DIN audio system head-unit, with Bluetooth pairing for smartphones, for hands-free voice calls. The company also introduced variants with factory-fitted CNG kits, called the Indigo eCS e-Max.

With a budget of $140 million, it is [[List of most expensive animated films#Traditionally animated films|the most expensive traditionally animated film ever made]].\n\nThe film was co-written, co-produced and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], who had [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the concept for the film at the same time that they pitched another Disney animated feature, ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989). ''Treasure Planet'' features the voices of [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Martin Short]],  [[Roscoe Lee Browne]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Patrick McGoohan]] (in his final film role). The musical score was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], while a couple of songs were written and performed by [[John Rzeznik]]. Despite generally positive critical reception from most critics and audiences praising the imaginative sci-fi visuals, animation, storyline, action scenes, voice performances, and music score, [[box office bomb|it failed at the box office]], costing $140 million to create while earning $38 million in the United States and Canada and just shy of $110 million worldwide.<ref name=\"bomojo\"/> It was nominated for the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the planet Montressor, a young [[Jim Hawkins (character)#Disney version|Jim Hawkins]] is enchanted by stories of the legendary [[Space pirate|pirate]] [[Captain Flint|Captain Nathaniel Flint]] and his ability to appear from nowhere, raid passing ships, and disappear in order to hide the loot on the mysterious \"Treasure Planet\". Twelve years later, having been abandoned by his father when he was still young, Jim has grown into an aloof and isolated troublemaker. He reluctantly helps his mother Sarah run the family's Benbow Inn, and derives amusement from \"Alponian solar cruising\", [[skysurfing]] atop a rocket-powered sailboard.\n\nOne day, a spaceship crashes near the inn. The dying pilot, [[Billy Bones]], gives Jim a [[sphere]] and tells him to \"beware the [[cyborg]]\". After this, a gang of pirates raid and burn the inn to the ground. Jim, his mother, and their dog-like friend Dr. Delbert Doppler flee. At Doppler's study, Jim finds that the sphere is a holographic projector containing a star map that leads to the location of Treasure Planet. Despite Sarah's reluctance, Jim and Doppler decide to travel to Treasure Planet in order to gain the funds to rebuild the inn.\n\nDoppler commissions a ship called the RLS ''Legacy'', on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the feline Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined [[Chief Mate|first mate]], Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent down to work in the galley, where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship.\n\nDuring the voyage, the ship encounters a [[supernova]]. Jim, while securing lifelines of all crew members, saves Silver from falling just in time. The supernova then devolves into a [[black hole]] and Mr. Arrow is shortly sucked into it. The burst of shock waves and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless [[insectoid]] crew member named Scroop.\n\nAs the ship reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears the crew and soon discovers they are indeed pirates led by Silver, and a [[mutiny]] erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia and Morph abandon the ship, but Morph has left the map behind. Thinking Jim has the map, Silver targets to kill Jim, but hesitates, allowing them to escape. The fugitives are shot down during their escape, injuring Amelia.\n\nWhile exploring Treasure Planet's forests, the fugitives meet [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)#Other media|B.E.N.]], an abandoned navigational robot, who has literally lost his primary memory and invites them to his place for shelter. The pirates corner the group there; using a back-door, Jim, B.E.N. and Morph return to the ship in an attempt to recover the map. Scroop attacks them but gets drifted into space. They obtain the map, but upon returning they are caught by Silver, who already captured Doppler and Amelia.\n\nSilver forces Jim to use the map, directing them to a portal that opens on any location in the [[universe]], which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal to the center of Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a [[space station]] built eons ago that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint had rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. The planet soon begins to fall apart. Not wanting to go empty-handed, Silver attempts to escape on a boat loaded with treasure, but eventually lets it go to save Jim. The survivors escape to the ship, but it gets damaged and is unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the ship towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the crew safely clear the destruction.\n\nJim finds Silver has snuck below decks to escape. He allows him to go, and Silver asks him to keep Morph, as well as providing him some part of the treasure he managed to save before the planet exploded to rebuild the Benbow Inn, believing Jim will \"rattle the stars\". Amelia offers Jim a recommendation to Interstellar Academy before he returns to the spaceport to reunite with his mother. Sometime later, a party is hosted at the rebuilt inn; Doppler and Amelia have married and had children of their own, and Jim has become a military cadet. Jim looks into the skies and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]], an adolescent pining for adventure.\n**Austin Majors as Young Jim Hawkins\n* [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]] as [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], a cyborg who leads the mutiny on the RLS ''Legacy''.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Dr. Delbert Doppler, an anthropomorphic dog, and astronomer.

The \"mentor figures\" for Jim Hawkins in the novel were Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, whom John Musker described as \"one is more comic and the other's very straight\"; these two characters were fused into Dr. Doppler.

To ensure \"solidity\" in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affect the final character, citing Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" />\n\nWhen asked if they drew inspiration from the previous film adaptations of ''Treasure Island'' for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to \"clear his mind of stereotypes\", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor [[Wallace Beery]], whom he \"loved because of the way he talked out of the side of his mouth.\" For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited [[James Dean]] as an important reference because \"there was a whole attitude, a posture\" wherein \"you felt the pain and the youthful innocence\", and he also cited the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' because \"there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes.\"<ref name=\"p9keaneandripa\">{{cite web|title=TREASURE PLANET Q&A with animators JOHN KEANE & JOHN RIPA |publisher=Phase 9 Entertainment |year=2005 |url=http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq&a-glenkeane&johnripa1.shtml |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113020003/http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq%26a-glenkeane%26johnripa1.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-13}}</ref>\n\nAnimators also used [[maquette]]s, small statues of the characters in the film, as references throughout the animation process. Character sculptor Kent Melton mentioned that the first Disney film to use maquettes was ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and that this paved the way to the formation of an entire department devoted to character sculpting. Keane noted that maquettes are not just supposed to be \"like a mannequin in a store\", but rather has to be \"something that tells you [the character's] personality\" and that maquettes also helped inspire the way actors would portray their roles.<ref name=\"maquettes\">{{cite video | people =Kent Melton, Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: Maquettes | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe animators took ''Deep Canvas'', a technology which they had initially developed for ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), and came up with a process they called \"Virtual Sets,\" wherein they created entire 360 [[Degree (angle)|degree]] sets before they began staging the scenes.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" /> They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a \"painted image with depth perception\" and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film.<ref name=\"techtreasure\" /> In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of [[Captain Hook]] from [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|''Peter Pan'']] and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.<ref>{{cite video | people =Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The \"Hook\" Test | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Animation === <!--Some SPER by [[Special:Contributions/Lizley|Lizley]]-->\nOne of the film's goals was to blend different mediums of animation into one film to have such a seamless finish to the point you could not tell the difference between what was two-dimensional hand drawing or computer-generated 3D animations and environments. For the animation of the Treasure Plant, there are three main elements that were essential to the production of this film. The traditional 2D character animation that Disney is known for, three-dimensional character animation, and the computer-generated or CG environments.\n\n===Audio===\nThis \"70/30 Law\" of \"70% traditional and 30% sci-fi\" was not only applied to the visual designs for the film, but also for the sound effects and music. Sound designer [[Dane Davis]] mentioned that he and his team \"scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms\" in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to \"avoid sounding slick or sci-fi\". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried \"affected his comedy\", and \"the last thing you want to do in a story like this is affect performances\".<ref name=\"sound\">{{cite web|last=Droney |first=Maureen |title=Avast and Away! |work=Mix Magazine |date=January 1, 2003 |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |accessdate=2008-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326043304/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |archivedate=March 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe music from the film is largely orchestral in nature, although it includes two moderately successful pop singles (\"[[I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)|I'm Still Here]]\" and \"Always Know Where You Are\") from [[The Goo Goo Dolls]] [[frontman]] [[John Rzeznik]] and British pop-rock group, [[BBMak]].

With a budget of $140 million, it is [[List of most expensive animated films#Traditionally animated films|the most expensive traditionally animated film ever made]].\n\nThe film was co-written, co-produced and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], who had [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the concept for the film at the same time that they pitched another Disney animated feature, ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989). ''Treasure Planet'' features the voices of [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Martin Short]],  [[Roscoe Lee Browne]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Patrick McGoohan]] (in his final film role). The musical score was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], while a couple of songs were written and performed by [[John Rzeznik]]. Despite generally positive critical reception from most critics and audiences praising the imaginative sci-fi visuals, animation, storyline, action scenes, voice performances, and music score, [[box office bomb|it failed at the box office]], costing $140 million to create while earning $38 million in the United States and Canada and just shy of $110 million worldwide.<ref name=\"bomojo\"/> It was nominated for the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the planet Montressor, a young [[Jim Hawkins (character)#Disney version|Jim Hawkins]] is enchanted by stories of the legendary [[Space pirate|pirate]] [[Captain Flint|Captain Nathaniel Flint]] and his ability to appear from nowhere, raid passing ships, and disappear in order to hide the loot on the mysterious \"Treasure Planet\". Twelve years later, having been abandoned by his father when he was still young, Jim has grown into an aloof and isolated troublemaker. He reluctantly helps his mother Sarah run the family's Benbow Inn, and derives amusement from \"Alponian solar cruising\", [[skysurfing]] atop a rocket-powered sailboard.\n\nOne day, a spaceship crashes near the inn. The dying pilot, [[Billy Bones]], gives Jim a [[sphere]] and tells him to \"beware the [[cyborg]]\". After this, a gang of pirates raid and burn the inn to the ground. Jim, his mother, and their dog-like friend Dr. Delbert Doppler flee. At Doppler's study, Jim finds that the sphere is a holographic projector containing a star map that leads to the location of Treasure Planet. Despite Sarah's reluctance, Jim and Doppler decide to travel to Treasure Planet in order to gain the funds to rebuild the inn.\n\nDoppler commissions a ship called the RLS ''Legacy'', on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the feline Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined [[Chief Mate|first mate]], Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent down to work in the galley, where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship.\n\nDuring the voyage, the ship encounters a [[supernova]]. Jim, while securing lifelines of all crew members, saves Silver from falling just in time. The supernova then devolves into a [[black hole]] and Mr. Arrow is shortly sucked into it. The burst of shock waves and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless [[insectoid]] crew member named Scroop.\n\nAs the ship reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears the crew and soon discovers they are indeed pirates led by Silver, and a [[mutiny]] erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia and Morph abandon the ship, but Morph has left the map behind. Thinking Jim has the map, Silver targets to kill Jim, but hesitates, allowing them to escape. The fugitives are shot down during their escape, injuring Amelia.\n\nWhile exploring Treasure Planet's forests, the fugitives meet [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)#Other media|B.E.N.]], an abandoned navigational robot, who has literally lost his primary memory and invites them to his place for shelter. The pirates corner the group there; using a back-door, Jim, B.E.N. and Morph return to the ship in an attempt to recover the map. Scroop attacks them but gets drifted into space. They obtain the map, but upon returning they are caught by Silver, who already captured Doppler and Amelia.\n\nSilver forces Jim to use the map, directing them to a portal that opens on any location in the [[universe]], which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal to the center of Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a [[space station]] built eons ago that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint had rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. The planet soon begins to fall apart. Not wanting to go empty-handed, Silver attempts to escape on a boat loaded with treasure, but eventually lets it go to save Jim. The survivors escape to the ship, but it gets damaged and is unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the ship towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the crew safely clear the destruction.\n\nJim finds Silver has snuck below decks to escape. He allows him to go, and Silver asks him to keep Morph, as well as providing him some part of the treasure he managed to save before the planet exploded to rebuild the Benbow Inn, believing Jim will \"rattle the stars\". Amelia offers Jim a recommendation to Interstellar Academy before he returns to the spaceport to reunite with his mother. Sometime later, a party is hosted at the rebuilt inn; Doppler and Amelia have married and had children of their own, and Jim has become a military cadet. Jim looks into the skies and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]], an adolescent pining for adventure.\n**Austin Majors as Young Jim Hawkins\n* [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]] as [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], a cyborg who leads the mutiny on the RLS ''Legacy''.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Dr. Delbert Doppler, an anthropomorphic dog, and astronomer.

The \"mentor figures\" for Jim Hawkins in the novel were Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, whom John Musker described as \"one is more comic and the other's very straight\"; these two characters were fused into Dr. Doppler. Clements also mentions that though the father-son relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver was present \"to some degree\" in the book, they wanted to emphasize it more in the film.<ref name=\"white\" />\n\n[[Terry Rossio]], who worked on the script, later argued the filmmakers made a crucial mistake turning Jim Hawkins too old. \"''Treasure Island'', the book, is a boy's adventure, about a young cabin boy who matches wits with a crew of bloodthirsty pirates. All of the key scenes are made more dramatic by the fact that it's a young kid who is in danger... ''Treasure Planet'' made the kid into a young man.

Wyeth titled ''One More Step, Mr. Hands'' for a 1911 publication of ''[[Treasure Island]]''. This type of illustration, which was described by the film crew as \"classic storybook illustration,\" was the basis for ''Treasure Planet'''s overall look.]]\nWhile designing for ''Treasure Planet'', the crew operated on rule they call the \"70/30 Law\" (an idea that art director Andy Gaskill has credited to Ron Clements), which meant that the overall look of the film's artwork should be 70% traditional and 30% sci-fi.<ref>{{cite video | people =Andy Gaskill, Ian Gooding | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The 70/30 Law | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref> The overall look of ''Treasure Planet'' was based on the art style promoted by illustrators associated with the [[Brandywine School|Brandywine School of Illustration]] (such as [[Howard Pyle]] and [[N.C.

To ensure \"solidity\" in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affect the final character, citing Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" />\n\nWhen asked if they drew inspiration from the previous film adaptations of ''Treasure Island'' for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to \"clear his mind of stereotypes\", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor [[Wallace Beery]], whom he \"loved because of the way he talked out of the side of his mouth.\" For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited [[James Dean]] as an important reference because \"there was a whole attitude, a posture\" wherein \"you felt the pain and the youthful innocence\", and he also cited the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' because \"there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes.\"<ref name=\"p9keaneandripa\">{{cite web|title=TREASURE PLANET Q&A with animators JOHN KEANE & JOHN RIPA |publisher=Phase 9 Entertainment |year=2005 |url=http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq&a-glenkeane&johnripa1.shtml |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113020003/http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq%26a-glenkeane%26johnripa1.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-13}}</ref>\n\nAnimators also used [[maquette]]s, small statues of the characters in the film, as references throughout the animation process. Character sculptor Kent Melton mentioned that the first Disney film to use maquettes was ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and that this paved the way to the formation of an entire department devoted to character sculpting. Keane noted that maquettes are not just supposed to be \"like a mannequin in a store\", but rather has to be \"something that tells you [the character's] personality\" and that maquettes also helped inspire the way actors would portray their roles.<ref name=\"maquettes\">{{cite video | people =Kent Melton, Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: Maquettes | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe animators took ''Deep Canvas'', a technology which they had initially developed for ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), and came up with a process they called \"Virtual Sets,\" wherein they created entire 360 [[Degree (angle)|degree]] sets before they began staging the scenes.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" /> They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a \"painted image with depth perception\" and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film.<ref name=\"techtreasure\" /> In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of [[Captain Hook]] from [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|''Peter Pan'']] and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.<ref>{{cite video | people =Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The \"Hook\" Test | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\nOne of the film's goals was to blend different mediums of animation into one film to have such a seamless finish to the point you could not tell the difference between what was two-dimensional hand drawing or computer-generated 3D animations and environments. For the animation of the Treasure Plant, there are three main elements that were essential to the production of this film. The traditional 2D character animation that Disney is known for, three-dimensional character animation, and the computer-generated or CG environments.\n\n===Audio===\nThis \"70/30 Law\" of \"70% traditional and 30% sci-fi\" was not only applied to the visual designs for the film, but also for the sound effects and music. Sound designer [[Dane Davis]] mentioned that he and his team \"scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms\" in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to \"avoid sounding slick or sci-fi\". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried \"affected his comedy\", and \"the last thing you want to do in a story like this is affect performances\".<ref name=\"sound\">{{cite web|last=Droney |first=Maureen |title=Avast and Away! |work=Mix Magazine |date=January 1, 2003 |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |accessdate=2008-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326043304/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |archivedate=March 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe music from the film is largely orchestral in nature, although it includes two moderately successful pop singles (\"[[I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)|I'm Still Here]]\" and \"Always Know Where You Are\") from [[The Goo Goo Dolls]] [[frontman]] [[John Rzeznik]] and British pop-rock group, [[BBMak]].

It is a continuation of the [[Nissan Bluebird]] line, which began in 1957.\n\nThe Altima has historically been larger, more powerful, and more luxurious than the [[Nissan Sentra]] but less so than the [[Nissan Maxima]]. The first through fourth generation cars were manufactured exclusively in the United States and officially sold in North and South America, along with the Middle East and Australia. For other markets, Nissan sold a related mid-size sedan called the [[Nissan Teana]] which was between the Altima and Maxima in terms of size. In 2013, the Teana became a rebadged version of the fifth generation Altima.\n\nThe name \"Altima\" was originally applied to a top trim line of the [[Nissan Leopard]] for the Japanese market in 1986,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/HERITAGE/leopard_turbo_200xs.html|title=Nissan - Heritage Collection - Leopard Turbo 200XS-II|website=www.nissan-global.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> and then to the [[Nissan Laurel]] [[mid-size car]] sold in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] before 1992. In 1992, Nissan discontinued the [[Nissan Stanza|Stanza]] which was a [[Nissan Bluebird]] clone, replacing it with the US-built Altima, while remaining a [[compact car]]. The first Altima was produced in June 1992, as a 1993 model. All Altimas were built in [[Smyrna, Tennessee]], until June 2004, when Nissan's [[Canton, Mississippi]] plant also began producing the model to meet high demand.\n\nIts competitors for the mid-size car segment include the [[Honda Accord]], [[Toyota Camry]], [[Mazda6]], [[Hyundai Sonata]], [[Kia Optima]], [[Subaru Legacy]], [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] (about to be discontinued in 2020), [[Chevrolet Malibu]] and the [[Volkswagen Passat (NMS)]].\n\n==First generation (U13, 1993\u20131997){{anchor|U13}}==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| assembly = {{ubl |United States: [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] |Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]]}}\n| aka = Nissan Stanza Altima (1992\u20131993)<br />[[Nissan Bluebird#U13 Series|Nissan Bluebird (U13)]]\n| image = 1st-Nissan-Altima.jpg\n| production = June 1992\u2013June 1997\n| model_years = 1993-1997\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n| engine = 2.4 L ''[[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|103.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|180.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|67.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| height = {{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| designer = Allan Flowers (1988)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/business/company-news-nissan-is-said-to-plan-new-us-production.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Nissan Is Said to Plan New U.S. Production|first=Doron P.

Initially, the car's official name was \"Stanza Altima,\" which appears on the early owners manuals. 1993 models can be seen with a sticker reading \"Stanza\" in small lettering to the right of the ALTIMA emblem on the trunk lid.<ref name=\"Stanza Altima Project 1989\">{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Doron P.|title=COMPANY NEWS; Nissan Is Said to Plan New U.S. Production|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/business/company-news-nissan-is-said-to-plan-new-us-production.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=October 8, 2012|date=1989-03-31}}</ref>\n\nAll Altima models used Nissan's {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]] [[straight-4]] [[DOHC]] engine mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic (acceleration performance: 9.4 seconds 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h) with automatic and 8.2 with manual). (By contrast, the Japanese top trim package Bluebird SSS could be had with Nissan's [[SR20DET]] engine and all-wheel-drive.) Suspension was composed of struts with stabilizer bars at both ends and was noted for providing sporty, satisfying handling (plus a firm ride and moderate road noise); all wheels were 15-inches. Being one of the bigger compact cars, the Altima could seat four adults fairly comfortably, though its body was too narrow for five. Trim lines consisted of the stripped XE, mid-line GXE, sporty SE, and luxury GLE. Some options included a gold emblem package, molded mud guards, and a pin stripe. All models had small cup holders under the radio and a small glovebox which were improved in the 1998 redesign.\n\nThe base XE (rare) had manual windows. The mid-line GXE had power windows, a power retracting antenna, pass thru rear armrest, a digital clock in dash (became optional on 1995 models), and color matched plastic speaker grilles for the rear 6-inch speakers. The XE and GXE models only had the fixed intermittent wiper switch.\n\nIn addition to the GXE features, the SE had a stiffer suspension, fog lights, 3 leg mount <!-- see elsewhere in comment on 2 leg\"--> rear spoiler (1993 models with a clear LED brake light), side skirts (no upper side moldings), and sport seats (plus a standard sunroof in 1994\u20131995). It also had 4-wheel disc brakes, which came on the other trim lines when antilock brakes were ordered.\n\nThe GLE's enhancements included a digital [[automotive head-up display]] (1993 and 1994 only), which displayed speed in MPH or KM/H, turn signals, and various warning lights on a unique mirrored patch made into the windshield. The 1989 to 1994 Maxima and 240SX had similar technology but only showed speed. Other features included a coin holder built into the fuse panel cover (1993 and 1994 only), adjustable lumbar support on the front seats, automatic digital climate control, keyless entry with alarm (optional), floor mats, color matched side mirrors, cornering lights, sunroof, and a higher-powered six-speaker cassette/CD stereo which included 6X9 rear speakers with black metal \"active speaker\" grilles, metal color matched \"active speaker\" grilles for the front door speakers (1993 and 1994 only), and a pair of A pillar tweeters all powered by two factory amps mounted underneath the rear deck. For 1997 it gave up all of the above in exchange for standard leather (previously optional). All SE and GLE models had alloy wheels and variable intermittent wipers.\n\n1993 Altimas came with a rosewood colored dash trim and only had a driver's side airbag coupled with automatic shoulder belts (the center console was slimmer to accommodate the lap belts). The 1994 Altima gained a darker burl wood dash trim, a flush mount passenger airbag and regular seat belts. 1993 and 1994 models came with chrome inner door handles standard with an auto door lock/unlock feature on the passenger side. For 1995, the inner door handles were changed to color matched plastic, and a plug replaced where the passenger auto door lock/unlock feature was. 1993 and 1994 models also had a slim {{frac|1|1|2}} armrest lid, however, if an optional leather armrest was selected, it brought the height up to about {{convert|4.5|in}}. For 1995, all the armrest lids were thicker and about {{convert|4.5|in}} tall. The 1995 model year (introduced 1994) also brought a new [[Window blind|venetian blind]]-like grille, new taillights (red and clear), and a new 2 leg mount spoiler<!--\"two-leg\"? or w/your hyphen, what is: \"new 2 leg mount spoiler\" (quote from Nissan)? see elsewhere \"3 leg\"--> with a red LED brake light for the SE. Some other changes included the removal of the rear speaker grilles for a flat rear deck, a cheaper cloth interior, a plastic cover replacing the rear ashtray, and the digital in dash clock was now optional. For the 1995.5 model year in March 1995, a raised mount passenger airbag with a new inflator was introduced in post-March 3, 1995 production. 1996 brought new wheel covers for base models. During the 1997 model year the GXE gained a new \"Limited Edition\" package including alloy wheels, keyless entry, alarm, floor mats, and a Limited Edition sticker on each side near the front wheels. The majority of final-year Altima models were dubbed \"1997.5\" models, signifying the added crash protection necessary to meet 1997 side-impact standards.<ref>https://jeysnk.blogspot.com/2019/07/Android-versions-with-names.html{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Second generation (L30, 1998\u20132001){{anchor|L30}}==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| assembly = {{ubl |United States: [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] |Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]]}}\n| image = 2nd-Nissan-Altima.jpg\n| production = July 1997-July 2001\n| model_years = 1998\u20132001\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n| engine = 2.4 L ''[[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (150\u2013155 hp)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|103.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|185.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2000\u201301)<br />{{convert|183.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| width = {{convert|69.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 5-speed manual<br />4-speed automatic\n| related = [[Nissan Bluebird U14]]<br/>[[Nissan Quest]](V41)<br/>[[Mercury Villager]]\n| designer = Doug Wilson (1994)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_55392/title_Nissans-Stunning-New-350Z-Sports-Coupe-Arrives-in-Australia/newsarticle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714190007/http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_55392/title_Nissans-Stunning-New-350Z-Sports-Coupe-Arrives-in-Australia/newsarticle.html |archivedate=2014-07-14 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe second generation (chassis model L30) was an American market-only version, again styled by Nissan's California design center under Doug Wilson through 1994 (design freeze in 1995). A new interior (by Diane Allen) brought a revised glove box and cup holders, a folding back seat (except on XE), and depowered airbags. The Japanese Domestic Markets Nissan Bluebird U14 has different front and rear ends, and slightly narrower width dimensions to comply with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]].\n\nWhile total volume remained identical at {{convert|108|cuft|m3}}, most felt it was distributed better and resulted in a slightly roomier-feeling cabin. On the downside, many were let down by the new model's plainer styling and cheapened interior; some also felt the gas pedal was now too lightly sprung.\n\nTrim lines were the stripped XE, volume-selling GXE, sporty SE, and luxury-trimmed GLE. The SE can be distinguished by its body-color grille, fog lights, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, and white-faced gauges. In this generation of Altima, all GLEs had leather seats standard.\n\n[[File:00-01 Nissan Altima SE.jpg|200px|thumb|left|MY2000\u20132001 Nissan Altima SE]]\n[[File:1999 Nissan Altima GXE rear 5.20.18.jpg|200px|thumb|left|MY1998\u20131999 Nissan Altima rear]]\nFor 1999 the uplevel cassette/CD stereo got a new faceplate, GXE and SE models gained variable intermittent wipers, and GLEs gained standard alloy wheels.\nThe majority of changes came for the 2000 model year. The engine increased in power from 150 to 160 horsepower   with 4-way sparks, while it also improved the 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time from 8.7 to 8.4 seconds. Gearing and final drive ratios were shortened on both transmissions, stabilizer bars were thickened, and the steering was firmed up. SE and GLE models also upgraded to 16-inch wheels with lower-profile tires, new Monroe struts with \"acceleration-sensitive strut valving\", and a front strut tower brace for sportier handling (all optional on GXE). The Altima grew slightly longer and got a deeper front grille, one-piece headlamps with integrated turn signals and standard low-speed cornering lamps, all-red taillights, and plastic trim on the deck lid. Inside were new front seats with a driver's height adjuster, cup holders for the rear seat (automatic transmission models only), revised seat cloth, a new instrument panel with digital odometer, a new rear window antenna, and the keyless entry fob now included a trunk release. Side [[airbag]]s were newly standard on GLE and available on GXE and SE. For 2001, the Altima GXE again gained a Limited Edition package: power driver's seat, keyless entry with alarm and floor mats.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Third generation (L31, 2002\u20132006){{anchor|L31}}==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Third generation\n|image=02-04 Nissan Altima 2.5S.jpg\n|platform=[[Nissan FF-L platform]]\n|assembly={{ubl |United States: [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] |United States: [[Canton, Mississippi]] (beginning in 2003) |Japan: [[Kanda, Fukuoka]]}}\n|production=August 2001\u2013September 2006\n|model_years=2002\u20132006\n|layout=[[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n|engine=2.5 L ''[[Nissan QR engine#QR25DE|QR25DE]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} <br />3.5 L ''[[Nissan VQ engine#VQ35DE|VQ35DE]]'' [[V6]] (240\u2013250 Hp)   <br />3.5 L ''[[Nissan VQ engine#VQ35DE|VQ35DE]]'' [[V6]] (260 Hp) SE-R\n|wheelbase={{convert|110.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length={{convert|192.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2005\u201306)<br />{{convert|191.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2001\u201304)\n|width={{convert|70.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height={{convert|57.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|body_style=4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n|transmission={{ubl |5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] |6-speed manual SE-R |4-speed automatic |5-speed ''[[Aisin AF33 transmission|AF33]]''[[manumatic]] 3.5 SE / 3.5 SL / 3.5 SE-R only}}\n|related=[[Nissan Maxima]]<br />[[Nissan Murano]]<br />[[Nissan Quest]]<br />[[Nissan Teana]]<br />[[Renault Samsung SM5]]<br />[[Renault Samsung SM7]]\n|designer=[[Jerry Hirshberg]] (1999)<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/30/automobiles/autos-on-friday-design-a-last-chord-from-nissan-s-rocker-designer-spokesman.html</ref>\n}}\n\nThe third-generation Altima (chassis model L31) debuted for the 2002 model year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/nissan/altima/2002/|title=2002 Nissan Altima Review|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=2009-09-28}}</ref> It was the first mass-market product built on Nissan's new [[Nissan FF-L platform|FF-L platform]], which was unique to North America and had no equivalent model in Japan.

Some also found the steering too light and or abrupt, and the turning circle too wide due to its elongated wheelbase.\n\n===Mechanical issues===\nThe 2002 2.5L Altimas had major excessive oil consumption issues causing potential catastrophic engine failures. Some cases were because of owner neglect and other cases involved the [[catalytic converter]] failing, forcing foreign objects back into the exhaust manifold. Most reports were received after the vehicle is beyond 100,000 miles and more than eight years old (beyond any warranties) and most of the reports had only to do with the 2002\u20132003 model ranges.\n\nIn April 2015 a [[class action]] lawsuit was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] on behalf of all Nissan Altima owners of 2002 through 2006 model years. The lawsuit originally alleged that Nissan manufactured those model years with defective  floorboards on both the driver and passenger side of the vehicle but was dismissed by a judge in January 2016. The resulting premature rust was extensive and generally happened out of warranty. The real cause was that the front mudguards were not high enough and there was no stoneguard applied to the metal plates underneath the vehicle. Other car makes from other car manufacturers have also experienced the same problem to a lesser extent.  Nissan changed the design of the floorboards for the 4th generation and thus the problem did not reoccur again from MY2007 onwards.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.classlawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nissan-Rusted-Floorboards-Class-Action-Complaint.pdf | title= Nissan Rusted Floorboards Class Action Complaint| website= classlawgroup.com | first= | last= | publisher= | date= May 2015 | accessdate= }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Fourth generation (L32A 2007\u20132012, D32 \"Coupe\" 2008\u20132013){{anchor|L32}}==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fourth generation\n|image = 07-08 Nissan Altima 3.5SE.jpg\n|production = September 27, 2006\u2013April 2012 (sedan)<br/>2007-2013 (coupe)\n|model_years=2007\u20132012 (sedan)<br />2008\u20132013 (coupe)\n|assembly={{ubl |United States: [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] |United States: [[Canton, Mississippi]] }}\n|layout=[[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n|platform=[[Nissan D platform]]\n|related=[[Nissan Maxima|Nissan Maxima (A35)]]<br />[[Nissan Teana#Second generation (J32; 2009\u20132013)|Nissan Teana (J32)]]<br />[[Nissan Murano|Nissan Murano (Z51)]]<br />[[Nissan Quest|Nissan Quest (E52)]]<br />[[Renault Laguna#Third generation|Renault Laguna III]]<br />[[Renault Latitude]]<br />[[Renault Samsung SM5|Renault Samsung SM5 (L43)]]<br />[[Renault Samsung SM7#Second generation (L47)|Renault Samsung SM7 (L47)]]\n|engine=2.5 L ''[[Nissan QR engine#QR25DE|QR25DE]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.5 / 2.5 S<br />3.5 L ''[[Nissan VQ engine#VQ35DE|VQ35DE]]'' [[V6]] {{Convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SR<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nissanusa.com/altima/specifications.html?next=vlptrim.specs |title=2011 Nissan Altima Sedan, Hybrid Vehicle Specs Nissan USA |publisher=Nissan USA |accessdate=2010-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630154549/http://www.nissanusa.com/altima/specifications.html?next=vlptrim.specs |archive-date=2011-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|transmission=6-speed manual<br />[[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] (Ratios: 2.371\u20130.439)\n|wheelbase={{convert|109.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br />{{convert|105.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)\n|length={{convert|189.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2006\u201309 sedan)<br />{{convert|190.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 sedan)<br/>{{convert|182.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2007\u201309 coupe)<br/>{{convert|180.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 coupe)\n|width={{convert|70.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan & coupe)<br />{{convert|69.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (hybrid)\n|body_style=4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[coupe]]\n|height={{convert|57.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br />{{convert|58.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 four-cylinder sedans)<br />{{convert|55.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2007\u201309 coupe)<br />{{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 coupe)<br />{{convert|58.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2007\u201309 hybrid)<br />{{convert|58.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 hybrid)\n|weight={{convert|1442|-|1447|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (2.5L)<br />{{convert|1492|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (3.5L)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autos.aol.com/cars-Nissan-Altima-2009/available-trims/ |title=2009 Nissan Altima |publisher=AOL |date= |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref>\n|designer=Ajay Panchal, Takashi Noguchi (sedan: 2004)<br>Toshiyuki Abe (coupe: 2005)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD565468S1/en|title=Surface configuration of a vehicle body, toy, and/or replica|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n\n[[File:NISSAN ALTIMA 3.5 SE rear.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-facelift Nissan Altima 3.5 SE sedan]]\nThe fourth generation Nissan Altima (chassis model L32A) was announced at the 2006 [[New York Auto Show]] on April 12, 2006. It was the first vehicle to use the smaller [[Nissan D platform]], with a new front and upgraded rear suspension. The wheelbase is {{convert|1|in|mm|sing=on}} shorter than the third generation Altima, but interior space was mostly unchanged. The Maxima and [[Nissan Murano|Murano]] also used this new platform starting with the 2009 models. As with the previous generation, it shares much of its mechanicals and platform with the [[Nissan Teana#Second generation (J32; 2009\u20132013)|Nissan Teana]] which is built for different market conditions in Asia.\n\nThe fourth generation Altima used revised versions of the engines from the third generation model. The VQ35DE 3.5 L [[V6 engine]] produces {{Convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|258|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, and the QR25DE 2.5 [[Liter|L]] [[straight-4]] produces {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissannews.com/nissan/2007vehicles/altima/specs.shtml|title=2007 Altima Specifications|publisher=Nissan|accessdate=2009-12-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409075442/http://www.nissannews.com/nissan/2007vehicles/altima/specs.shtml|archivedate=2010-04-09}}</ref> A 6-speed manual is standard, and a [[continuously variable transmission]] replaced the traditional automatic as the optional transmission.\n\nThis generation Altima came packaged with, for its time, new technology such as a standard [[Smart Key]] (referred to as the \"Nissan Intelligent Key\"), along with available [[Bluetooth]] capability for cell phones, and a parking camera. The dashboard was designed with larger buttons for easy readability and a total of eight cup holders, two in front of the center console, two in the rear armrest, and one 20-ounce cup holder in each door. Several hidden compartments were added as well as doubling the glove compartment space to {{convert|0.46|cuft|L}}. For 2008, all Altima models received ABS with electronic brake-force distribution.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/nissan/altima/2008/|title=2008 Nissan Altima Review|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=2009-09-28}}</ref>\n\nFor 2008, a new base model, named the '''2.5''', became available as a more affordable version of the Altima. To save costs, the '''2.5''' did not include a factory radio, however prewiring for an aftermarket [[head unit]], four front door and dashboard-mounted factory speakers, and a factory A/M-F/M radio antenna all came preinstalled. Other cost-saving measures on the '''2.5''' included the deletion of features such as the door handle-mounted touch sensors for the [[Nissan]] Intelligent Key system (keyless entry and push-button ignition were still included), the ability to lower or raise the power windows from the keyless entry remote, some of the standard cup holders, the overhead sunglass storage compartment, and the carpeted trim on the inside of rear trunk lid. The '''2.5''' models also did not include '''2.5''' lettering on the rear trunk lid of the vehicle. Features such as [[air conditioning]] with a single-zone manual climate control, a split-folding rear bench seat, [[Velour]] cloth seat trim, keyless entry, and a push-button ignition were still included as standard equipment on the base '''2.5''' model.\n\n===Facelift===\n[[File:2010 Nissan Altima 3.5SE -- 05-05-2010.jpg|thumb|left|Facelift Nissan Altima 3.5SR sedan]]\nIn 2009 for the 2010 model year, the Nissan Altima was facelifted with a new front fascia, hood, and headlights, as well as new wheels and interior materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20090930/CARNEWS/909309987 |title=2010 Nissan Altima gets light updates |publisher=AutoWeek |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref> Electronic stability control, previously only offered as part of an option package on V6 models and unavailable with 4-cylinder engines, is now standard on all Altima trims including 4 cylinder models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cars.about.com/od/nissan/gr/10_altima.htm |title=2010 Nissan Altima - Test drive and new car review - 2010 Nissan Altima |publisher=Cars.about.com |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref>  The CVT had been made standard by this point for all trims; the manual was dropped for the 2011 model year.

Nissan estimates the 2.5-liter fuel economy to be 27 city/38 hwy and the 3.5-liter [[V6]] at 22 city/30 hwy thanks to its refined [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] that has been lightened by 8&nbsp;lbs. Most of the major mechanical components of this generation Altima are carried over.<ref name=Edmunds>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/nissan/altima/2013/#fullreview |title=2013 Nissan Altima |date=Jun 19, 2012 |publisher=Edmunds }}</ref> Much of the exterior styling seems to draw familiar traits from the [[Nissan Maxima]].<ref name=Edmunds/> The Special Edition and the 2016 facelift both have an interior that is similar to the Murano, the Maxima, and the Rogue. For the first time, a [[manual transmission]] is not available.\n\nDespite the larger size of the Altima compared to the previous model, the new Altima weighs about 120 pounds less. The Altima continues to be the lightest midsize sedan in its class; this is mostly due to its efficient use of high strength steel and aluminum in areas such as the trunk, hood, and roof. The front end shares the same new corporate grille as the 2012 Versa with more angular headlights than the Versa's rounded ones. It draws many styling influences from \"[[coke bottle styling]]\", an appearance that was popular during the 1960s and 1970s, a return to an appearance Nissan used during that time.\n\nNissan offers the Altima in five different trims; 2.5, 2.5 S, 2.5 SV, 2.5 SL, and 3.5 SL. 3.5 S and 3.5 SV were discontinued for the 2015 model year. Alongside the L33 Altima sedan, the previous-generation L32 Altima coupe will continue on sale.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The coupe will only be offered with the ''[[Nissan QR engine#QR25DE|QR25DE]]'' 2.5-Liter four-cylinder rated at {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque mated with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]]. The 6-speed [[manual transmission]] is no longer available in the Altima Sedan due to slow sales. The SL model, which was once an equipment package for the Altima 2.5 S, is now a separate model. In addition, the base '''2.5''' model, which previously featured prewiring for an aftermarket [[head unit]] to be installed, an A/M-F/M radio antenna, and front door and dashboard-mounted speakers, received an A/M-F/M radio with a single-disc CD/MP3 player, auxiliary audio input, and [[Bluetooth]] hands-free phone system as standard equipment (as before, no rear speakers were included in the package).\n\n[[File:2013-2015 Nissan Altima (L33) ST sedan (2018-11-29) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Altima ST (Australia; pre-facelift)]]\n[[File:Nissan Altima 2.5SV interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]\nProduction started in late May 2012 and the car went on sale in June in the United States, and August of the same year in Canada. The Altima will also be on sale in various other markets (existing or new), particularly the Middle East where it replaces the fourth generation L32A models, and the Australian market for the first time sometime next year, replacing the [[Nissan Teana|Nissan Maxima J32 (Teana)]]. In China and other Asian markets, the L33 Nissan Altima will be the third generation of Nissan Teana. The L33 Altima was discontinued in Australia and New Zealand on 5 April 2017, alongside the [[Nissan Sylphy#B17|B17 Sylphy-based Pulsar sedan]], to focus on the sports cars, SUVs and pickup trucks in those markets.\n\nThe Nissan Altima Coupe was discontinued due to slow sales after the 2013 model year, which means Nissan will only focus on the sedan model for the Altima while the hybrid and coupe are discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/the-2014-nissan-lineup-charting-the-changes|title=The 2014 Nissan Lineup: Charting the Changes|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Advanced Drive-Assist Display was added in 2013.\n\nModel year 2016 saw the return of the SR performance model.

This was a series of three comparison tests involving mid-size sedans. In this particular test, four cars were tested. It consisted of the all new Ford Fusion and Honda Accord as well as the Nissan Altima. The Volkswagen Passat is included in the test as it won the first round of mid-sized sedan comparison.

It is stated that the Altima is good in almost everything with only minor deficiencies. It drives well, entertaining on twisty roads, has comfortable seats and remains quiet on highways. It is the least expensive but doesn't feel like it.

This also meant that all Altima models now came standard with a five-inch color display audio system, rear-mounted speakers, and Intelligent Key Access for all four doors, all of which were not available on the 2.5 trim level. The 2018 2.5 S trim also gains an optional Convenience Package, which adds a power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat and a remote start system for an additional $390.00 over the base car.

A new model, which is expected to debut during the [[New York Auto Show#2018|2018 New York Auto Show]] as an early 2019 model, has been seen testing.

The new \"base\" model of the Altima became the 2.5 S, which includes a higher level of standard equipment than the model it replaces, such as a NissanConnect five-inch (5.0\") color LCD radio (A/M-F/M radio, single-disc CD/MP3 player, [[Bluetooth]] [[A2DP]] Streaming Audio, USB port, 3.5-millimeter (3.5mm) auxiliary audio input jack, Nissan Rear-View Monitor System (rear-view backup camera system), and limited mobile app compatibility), a six-speaker audio system (now including rear speakers), and touch sensors for the Intelligent Key system on all door handles. The 3.5 SR model was also deleted for 2018, leaving the 3.5 SL as the only Nissan Altima model equipped with a [[V6]] engine. The 3.5 SL model also gains a standard NissanConnect seven-inch (7.0\") touch-screen infotainment system featuring [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]]. This was previously optional equipment on the 2017 Nissan Altima 3.5 SL model. Even with the 2.5 model now discontinued, 2018 pricing for the Nissan Altima has increased only by $760.00, up to $23,260 from $22,500 in 2017.\n\nThe facelifted Teana was launched in China in July 2016 and in Thailand in November 2018.\n\n===Motorsports===\n[[File:Nissan Altima of Simona de Silvestro (2017).JPG|thumb|The Nissan Altima L33 of [[Simona de Silvestro]] at the [[2017 Clipsal 500 Adelaide]]]]\nIn 2012, [[Kelly Racing]] announced that it would enter four custom Nissan Altima race cars into the [[2013 International V8 Supercars Championship]].

It is a continuation of the [[Nissan Bluebird]] line, which began in 1957.\n\nThe Altima has historically been larger, more powerful, and more luxurious than the [[Nissan Sentra]] but less so than the [[Nissan Maxima]]. The first through fourth generation cars were manufactured exclusively in the United States and officially sold in North and South America, along with the Middle East and Australia. For other markets, Nissan sold a related mid-size sedan called the [[Nissan Teana]] which was between the Altima and Maxima in terms of size. In 2013, the Teana became a rebadged version of the fifth generation Altima.\n\nThe name \"Altima\" was originally applied to a top trim line of the [[Nissan Leopard]] for the Japanese market in 1986,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/HERITAGE/leopard_turbo_200xs.html|title=Nissan - Heritage Collection - Leopard Turbo 200XS-II|website=www.nissan-global.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> and then to the [[Nissan Laurel]] [[mid-size car]] sold in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] before 1992. In 1992, Nissan discontinued the [[Nissan Stanza|Stanza]] which was a [[Nissan Bluebird]] clone, replacing it with the US-built Altima, while remaining a [[compact car]]. The first Altima was produced in June 1992, as a 1993 model. All Altimas were built in [[Smyrna, Tennessee]], until June 2004, when Nissan's [[Canton, Mississippi]] plant also began producing the model to meet high demand.\n\nIts competitors for the mid-size car segment include the [[Honda Accord]], [[Toyota Camry]], [[Mazda6]], [[Hyundai Sonata]], [[Kia Optima]], [[Subaru Legacy]], [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] (about to be discontinued in 2020), [[Chevrolet Malibu]] and the [[Volkswagen Passat (NMS)]].\n\n==First generation (U13, 1993\u20131997){{anchor|U13}}==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| assembly = {{ubl |United States: [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] |Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]]}}\n| aka = Nissan Stanza Altima (1992\u20131993)<br />[[Nissan Bluebird#U13 Series|Nissan Bluebird (U13)]]\n| image = 1st-Nissan-Altima.jpg\n| production = June 1992\u2013June 1997\n| model_years = 1993-1997\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n| engine = 2.4 L ''[[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|103.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|180.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|67.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| height = {{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| designer = Allan Flowers (1988)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/business/company-news-nissan-is-said-to-plan-new-us-production.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Nissan Is Said to Plan New U.S. Production|first=Doron P.

Initially, the car's official name was \"Stanza Altima,\" which appears on the early owners manuals. 1993 models can be seen with a sticker reading \"Stanza\" in small lettering to the right of the ALTIMA emblem on the trunk lid.<ref name=\"Stanza Altima Project 1989\">{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Doron P.|title=COMPANY NEWS; Nissan Is Said to Plan New U.S. Production|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/business/company-news-nissan-is-said-to-plan-new-us-production.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=October 8, 2012|date=1989-03-31}}</ref>\n\nAll Altima models used Nissan's {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]] [[straight-4]] [[DOHC]] engine mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic (acceleration performance: 9.4 seconds 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h) with automatic and 8.2 with manual). (By contrast, the Japanese top trim package Bluebird SSS could be had with Nissan's [[SR20DET]] engine and all-wheel-drive.) Suspension was composed of struts with stabilizer bars at both ends and was noted for providing sporty, satisfying handling (plus a firm ride and moderate road noise); all wheels were 15-inches. Being one of the bigger compact cars, the Altima could seat four adults fairly comfortably, though its body was too narrow for five. Trim lines consisted of the stripped XE, mid-line GXE, sporty SE, and luxury GLE. Some options included a gold emblem package, molded mud guards, and a pin stripe. All models had small cup holders under the radio and a small glovebox which were improved in the 1998 redesign.\n\nThe base XE (rare) had manual windows. The mid-line GXE had power windows, a power retracting antenna, pass thru rear armrest, a digital clock in dash (became optional on 1995 models), and color matched plastic speaker grilles for the rear 6-inch speakers. The XE and GXE models only had the fixed intermittent wiper switch.\n\nIn addition to the GXE features, the SE had a stiffer suspension, fog lights, 3 leg mount <!-- see elsewhere in comment on 2 leg\"--> rear spoiler (1993 models with a clear LED brake light), side skirts (no upper side moldings), and sport seats (plus a standard sunroof in 1994\u20131995). It also had 4-wheel disc brakes, which came on the other trim lines when antilock brakes were ordered.\n\nThe GLE's enhancements included a digital [[automotive head-up display]] (1993 and 1994 only), which displayed speed in MPH or KM/H, turn signals, and various warning lights on a unique mirrored patch made into the windshield. The 1989 to 1994 Maxima and 240SX had similar technology but only showed speed. Other features included a coin holder built into the fuse panel cover (1993 and 1994 only), adjustable lumbar support on the front seats, automatic digital climate control, keyless entry with alarm (optional), floor mats, color matched side mirrors, cornering lights, sunroof, and a higher-powered six-speaker cassette/CD stereo which included 6X9 rear speakers with black metal \"active speaker\" grilles, metal color matched \"active speaker\" grilles for the front door speakers (1993 and 1994 only), and a pair of A pillar tweeters all powered by two factory amps mounted underneath the rear deck. For 1997 it gave up all of the above in exchange for standard leather (previously optional). All SE and GLE models had alloy wheels and variable intermittent wipers.\n\n1993 Altimas came with a rosewood colored dash trim and only had a driver's side airbag coupled with automatic shoulder belts (the center console was slimmer to accommodate the lap belts). The 1994 Altima gained a darker burl wood dash trim, a flush mount passenger airbag and regular seat belts. 1993 and 1994 models came with chrome inner door handles standard with an auto door lock/unlock feature on the passenger side. For 1995, the inner door handles were changed to color matched plastic, and a plug replaced where the passenger auto door lock/unlock feature was. 1993 and 1994 models also had a slim {{frac|1|1|2}} armrest lid, however, if an optional leather armrest was selected, it brought the height up to about {{convert|4.5|in}}. For 1995, all the armrest lids were thicker and about {{convert|4.5|in}} tall. The 1995 model year (introduced 1994) also brought a new [[Window blind|venetian blind]]-like grille, new taillights (red and clear), and a new 2 leg mount spoiler<!--\"two-leg\"? or w/your hyphen, what is: \"new 2 leg mount spoiler\" (quote from Nissan)? see elsewhere \"3 leg\"--> with a red LED brake light for the SE. Some other changes included the removal of the rear speaker grilles for a flat rear deck, a cheaper cloth interior, a plastic cover replacing the rear ashtray, and the digital in dash clock was now optional. For the 1995.5 model year in March 1995, a raised mount passenger airbag with a new inflator was introduced in post-March 3, 1995 production. 1996 brought new wheel covers for base models. During the 1997 model year the GXE gained a new \"Limited Edition\" package including alloy wheels, keyless entry, alarm, floor mats, and a Limited Edition sticker on each side near the front wheels. The majority of final-year Altima models were dubbed \"1997.5\" models, signifying the added crash protection necessary to meet 1997 side-impact standards.<ref>https://jeysnk.blogspot.com/2019/07/Android-versions-with-names.html{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Second generation (L30, 1998\u20132001){{anchor|L30}}==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| assembly = {{ubl |United States: [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] |Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]]}}\n| image = 2nd-Nissan-Altima.jpg\n| production = July 1997-July 2001\n| model_years = 1998\u20132001\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n| engine = 2.4 L ''[[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (150\u2013155 hp)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|103.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|185.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2000\u201301)<br />{{convert|183.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| width = {{convert|69.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 5-speed manual<br />4-speed automatic\n| related = [[Nissan Bluebird U14]]<br/>[[Nissan Quest]](V41)<br/>[[Mercury Villager]]\n| designer = Doug Wilson (1994)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_55392/title_Nissans-Stunning-New-350Z-Sports-Coupe-Arrives-in-Australia/newsarticle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714190007/http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_55392/title_Nissans-Stunning-New-350Z-Sports-Coupe-Arrives-in-Australia/newsarticle.html |archivedate=2014-07-14 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe second generation (chassis model L30) was an American market-only version, again styled by Nissan's California design center under Doug Wilson through 1994 (design freeze in 1995). A new interior (by Diane Allen) brought a revised glove box and cup holders, a folding back seat (except on XE), and depowered airbags. The Japanese Domestic Markets Nissan Bluebird U14 has different front and rear ends, and slightly narrower width dimensions to comply with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]].\n\nWhile total volume remained identical at {{convert|108|cuft|m3}}, most felt it was distributed better and resulted in a slightly roomier-feeling cabin. On the downside, many were let down by the new model's plainer styling and cheapened interior; some also felt the gas pedal was now too lightly sprung.\n\nTrim lines were the stripped XE, volume-selling GXE, sporty SE, and luxury-trimmed GLE. The SE can be distinguished by its body-color grille, fog lights, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, and white-faced gauges. In this generation of Altima, all GLEs had leather seats standard.\n\n[[File:00-01 Nissan Altima SE.jpg|200px|thumb|left|MY2000\u20132001 Nissan Altima SE]]\n[[File:1999 Nissan Altima GXE rear 5.20.18.jpg|200px|thumb|left|MY1998\u20131999 Nissan Altima rear]]\nFor 1999 the uplevel cassette/CD stereo got a new faceplate, GXE and SE models gained variable intermittent wipers, and GLEs gained standard alloy wheels.\nThe majority of changes came for the 2000 model year. The engine increased in power from 150 to 160 horsepower   with 4-way sparks, while it also improved the 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time from 8.7 to 8.4 seconds. Gearing and final drive ratios were shortened on both transmissions, stabilizer bars were thickened, and the steering was firmed up. SE and GLE models also upgraded to 16-inch wheels with lower-profile tires, new Monroe struts with \"acceleration-sensitive strut valving\", and a front strut tower brace for sportier handling (all optional on GXE). The Altima grew slightly longer and got a deeper front grille, one-piece headlamps with integrated turn signals and standard low-speed cornering lamps, all-red taillights, and plastic trim on the deck lid.

Some also found the steering too light and or abrupt, and the turning circle too wide due to its elongated wheelbase.\n\n===Mechanical issues===\nThe 2002 2.5L Altimas had major excessive oil consumption issues causing potential catastrophic engine failures. Some cases were because of owner neglect and other cases involved the [[catalytic converter]] failing, forcing foreign objects back into the exhaust manifold. Most reports were received after the vehicle is beyond 100,000 miles and more than eight years old (beyond any warranties) and most of the reports had only to do with the 2002\u20132003 model ranges.\n\nIn April 2015 a [[class action]] lawsuit was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] on behalf of all Nissan Altima owners of 2002 through 2006 model years. The lawsuit originally alleged that Nissan manufactured those model years with defective  floorboards on both the driver and passenger side of the vehicle but was dismissed by a judge in January 2016. The resulting premature rust was extensive and generally happened out of warranty. The real cause was that the front mudguards were not high enough and there was no stoneguard applied to the metal plates underneath the vehicle. Other car makes from other car manufacturers have also experienced the same problem to a lesser extent.  Nissan changed the design of the floorboards for the 4th generation and thus the problem did not reoccur again from MY2007 onwards.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.classlawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nissan-Rusted-Floorboards-Class-Action-Complaint.pdf | title= Nissan Rusted Floorboards Class Action Complaint| website= classlawgroup.com | first= | last= | publisher= | date= May 2015 | accessdate= }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Fourth generation (L32A 2007\u20132012, D32 \"Coupe\" 2008\u20132013){{anchor|L32}}==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fourth generation\n|image = 07-08 Nissan Altima 3.5SE.jpg\n|production = September 27, 2006\u2013April 2012 (sedan)<br/>2007-2013 (coupe)\n|model_years=2007\u20132012 (sedan)<br />2008\u20132013 (coupe)\n|assembly={{ubl |United States: [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] |United States: [[Canton, Mississippi]] }}\n|layout=[[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n|platform=[[Nissan D platform]]\n|related=[[Nissan Maxima|Nissan Maxima (A35)]]<br />[[Nissan Teana#Second generation (J32; 2009\u20132013)|Nissan Teana (J32)]]<br />[[Nissan Murano|Nissan Murano (Z51)]]<br />[[Nissan Quest|Nissan Quest (E52)]]<br />[[Renault Laguna#Third generation|Renault Laguna III]]<br />[[Renault Latitude]]<br />[[Renault Samsung SM5|Renault Samsung SM5 (L43)]]<br />[[Renault Samsung SM7#Second generation (L47)|Renault Samsung SM7 (L47)]]\n|engine=2.5 L ''[[Nissan QR engine#QR25DE|QR25DE]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.5 / 2.5 S<br />3.5 L ''[[Nissan VQ engine#VQ35DE|VQ35DE]]'' [[V6]] {{Convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SR<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nissanusa.com/altima/specifications.html?next=vlptrim.specs |title=2011 Nissan Altima Sedan, Hybrid Vehicle Specs Nissan USA |publisher=Nissan USA |accessdate=2010-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630154549/http://www.nissanusa.com/altima/specifications.html?next=vlptrim.specs |archive-date=2011-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|transmission=6-speed manual<br />[[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] (Ratios: 2.371\u20130.439)\n|wheelbase={{convert|109.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br />{{convert|105.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)\n|length={{convert|189.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2006\u201309 sedan)<br />{{convert|190.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 sedan)<br/>{{convert|182.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2007\u201309 coupe)<br/>{{convert|180.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 coupe)\n|width={{convert|70.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan & coupe)<br />{{convert|69.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (hybrid)\n|body_style=4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[coupe]]\n|height={{convert|57.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br />{{convert|58.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 four-cylinder sedans)<br />{{convert|55.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2007\u201309 coupe)<br />{{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 coupe)<br />{{convert|58.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2007\u201309 hybrid)<br />{{convert|58.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (2009\u201312 hybrid)\n|weight={{convert|1442|-|1447|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (2.5L)<br />{{convert|1492|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (3.5L)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autos.aol.com/cars-Nissan-Altima-2009/available-trims/ |title=2009 Nissan Altima |publisher=AOL |date= |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref>\n|designer=Ajay Panchal, Takashi Noguchi (sedan: 2004)<br>Toshiyuki Abe (coupe: 2005)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD565468S1/en|title=Surface configuration of a vehicle body, toy, and/or replica|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n\n[[File:NISSAN ALTIMA 3.5 SE rear.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-facelift Nissan Altima 3.5 SE sedan]]\nThe fourth generation Nissan Altima (chassis model L32A) was announced at the 2006 [[New York Auto Show]] on April 12, 2006. It was the first vehicle to use the smaller [[Nissan D platform]], with a new front and upgraded rear suspension. The wheelbase is {{convert|1|in|mm|sing=on}} shorter than the third generation Altima, but interior space was mostly unchanged. The Maxima and [[Nissan Murano|Murano]] also used this new platform starting with the 2009 models. As with the previous generation, it shares much of its mechanicals and platform with the [[Nissan Teana#Second generation (J32; 2009\u20132013)|Nissan Teana]] which is built for different market conditions in Asia.\n\nThe fourth generation Altima used revised versions of the engines from the third generation model. The VQ35DE 3.5 L [[V6 engine]] produces {{Convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|258|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, and the QR25DE 2.5 [[Liter|L]] [[straight-4]] produces {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissannews.com/nissan/2007vehicles/altima/specs.shtml|title=2007 Altima Specifications|publisher=Nissan|accessdate=2009-12-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409075442/http://www.nissannews.com/nissan/2007vehicles/altima/specs.shtml|archivedate=2010-04-09}}</ref> A 6-speed manual is standard, and a [[continuously variable transmission]] replaced the traditional automatic as the optional transmission.\n\nThis generation Altima came packaged with, for its time, new technology such as a standard [[Smart Key]] (referred to as the \"Nissan Intelligent Key\"), along with available [[Bluetooth]] capability for cell phones, and a parking camera. The dashboard was designed with larger buttons for easy readability and a total of eight cup holders, two in front of the center console, two in the rear armrest, and one 20-ounce cup holder in each door. Several hidden compartments were added as well as doubling the glove compartment space to {{convert|0.46|cuft|L}}.

To save costs, the '''2.5''' did not include a factory radio, however prewiring for an aftermarket [[head unit]], four front door and dashboard-mounted factory speakers, and a factory A/M-F/M radio antenna all came preinstalled. Other cost-saving measures on the '''2.5''' included the deletion of features such as the door handle-mounted touch sensors for the [[Nissan]] Intelligent Key system (keyless entry and push-button ignition were still included), the ability to lower or raise the power windows from the keyless entry remote, some of the standard cup holders, the overhead sunglass storage compartment, and the carpeted trim on the inside of rear trunk lid. The '''2.5''' models also did not include '''2.5''' lettering on the rear trunk lid of the vehicle. Features such as [[air conditioning]] with a single-zone manual climate control, a split-folding rear bench seat, [[Velour]] cloth seat trim, keyless entry, and a push-button ignition were still included as standard equipment on the base '''2.5''' model.\n\n===Facelift===\n[[File:2010 Nissan Altima 3.5SE -- 05-05-2010.jpg|thumb|left|Facelift Nissan Altima 3.5SR sedan]]\nIn 2009 for the 2010 model year, the Nissan Altima was facelifted with a new front fascia, hood, and headlights, as well as new wheels and interior materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20090930/CARNEWS/909309987 |title=2010 Nissan Altima gets light updates |publisher=AutoWeek |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref> Electronic stability control, previously only offered as part of an option package on V6 models and unavailable with 4-cylinder engines, is now standard on all Altima trims including 4 cylinder models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cars.about.com/od/nissan/gr/10_altima.htm |title=2010 Nissan Altima - Test drive and new car review - 2010 Nissan Altima |publisher=Cars.about.com |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref>  The CVT had been made standard by this point for all trims; the manual was dropped for the 2011 model year.

For the first time, a [[manual transmission]] is not available.\n\nDespite the larger size of the Altima compared to the previous model, the new Altima weighs about 120 pounds less. The Altima continues to be the lightest midsize sedan in its class; this is mostly due to its efficient use of high strength steel and aluminum in areas such as the trunk, hood, and roof. The front end shares the same new corporate grille as the 2012 Versa with more angular headlights than the Versa's rounded ones. It draws many styling influences from \"[[coke bottle styling]]\", an appearance that was popular during the 1960s and 1970s, a return to an appearance Nissan used during that time.\n\nNissan offers the Altima in five different trims; 2.5, 2.5 S, 2.5 SV, 2.5 SL, and 3.5 SL. 3.5 S and 3.5 SV were discontinued for the 2015 model year. Alongside the L33 Altima sedan, the previous-generation L32 Altima coupe will continue on sale.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The coupe will only be offered with the ''[[Nissan QR engine#QR25DE|QR25DE]]'' 2.5-Liter four-cylinder rated at {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque mated with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]]. The 6-speed [[manual transmission]] is no longer available in the Altima Sedan due to slow sales. The SL model, which was once an equipment package for the Altima 2.5 S, is now a separate model. In addition, the base '''2.5''' model, which previously featured prewiring for an aftermarket [[head unit]] to be installed, an A/M-F/M radio antenna, and front door and dashboard-mounted speakers, received an A/M-F/M radio with a single-disc CD/MP3 player, auxiliary audio input, and [[Bluetooth]] hands-free phone system as standard equipment (as before, no rear speakers were included in the package).\n\n[[File:2013-2015 Nissan Altima (L33) ST sedan (2018-11-29) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Altima ST (Australia; pre-facelift)]]\n[[File:Nissan Altima 2.5SV interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]\nProduction started in late May 2012 and the car went on sale in June in the United States, and August of the same year in Canada. The Altima will also be on sale in various other markets (existing or new), particularly the Middle East where it replaces the fourth generation L32A models, and the Australian market for the first time sometime next year, replacing the [[Nissan Teana|Nissan Maxima J32 (Teana)]]. In China and other Asian markets, the L33 Nissan Altima will be the third generation of Nissan Teana. The L33 Altima was discontinued in Australia and New Zealand on 5 April 2017, alongside the [[Nissan Sylphy#B17|B17 Sylphy-based Pulsar sedan]], to focus on the sports cars, SUVs and pickup trucks in those markets.\n\nThe Nissan Altima Coupe was discontinued due to slow sales after the 2013 model year, which means Nissan will only focus on the sedan model for the Altima while the hybrid and coupe are discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/the-2014-nissan-lineup-charting-the-changes|title=The 2014 Nissan Lineup: Charting the Changes|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Advanced Drive-Assist Display was added in 2013.\n\nModel year 2016 saw the return of the SR performance model.

The 3.5 SR model was also deleted for 2018, leaving the 3.5 SL as the only Nissan Altima model equipped with a [[V6]] engine. The 3.5 SL model also gains a standard NissanConnect seven-inch (7.0\") touch-screen infotainment system featuring [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]]. This was previously optional equipment on the 2017 Nissan Altima 3.5 SL model.

An '''Edition One''' Special Edition model will be offered exclusively to buyers who choose to preorder their all-new Altima. The Edition One trim, based on the all-new 2019 Nissan Altima '''Platinum Turbo''', will be produced in limited numbers, and will offer features that will not be offered on any other all-new 2019 Nissan Altima models, such as nineteen-inch (19\") dark gray-finished aluminum-alloy wheels, 'Edition One' exterior badging, illuminated interior door sill kick plates, a rear spoiler, external ground lighting, and unique 'Edition One'-embroidered premium carpeted floor mats. The Edition One will only be available in three exterior colors: Scarlet Ember Tintcoat, Super Black, or Pearl White Tricoat. Nissan will also provide a complimentary gift to buyers who preorder the all-new 2019 Nissan Altima Edition One: either an [[Amazon Echo Dot]] with a [[Bose SoundLink]] Revolve [[Bluetooth]] Wireless Speaker and a 1-Year [[Amazon Prime]] Subscription, an [[Apple Watch]] Series 3, or an [[Amazon Echo Show]] and a 1-Year Amazon Prime Subscription. Finally, special complimentary concierge services will be provided to those who preorder the vehicle. Nissan's sister luxury vehicle brand, [[Infiniti]], offered a similar incentive for those who preordered the all-new second-generation 2019 [[Infiniti QX50]] compact crossover SUV, though no special edition model was offered to those buyers. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nissanusa.com/cars/2019-altima/edition-one/ | title=Introducing the 2019 Nissan Altima Edition ONE Luxury Sedan}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the special edition '''Edition One''', 2019 Nissan Altima buyers could also preorder any other trim level.\n\nAll Altima trim levels come equipped with standard features such as the [[Nissan]] Safety Shield suite of driver assistance technologies, a \"D\"-ring sport steering wheel, the Adaptive Driver Assist Display, the NissanConnect 8.0 touchscreen infotainment system with [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], USB and auxiliary audio inputs, and AroundViewMonitor multi-angle camera system, [[Nissan]] Intelligent Key system with push-button ignition, split-folding rear bench seats, and a remote vehicle starter system. All models include a naturally-aspirated, 2.5L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine that has been carried over from the previous-generation Altima, but has been improved for increased performance and fuel efficiency. '''SR''' and '''Platinum''' models also offer the turbocharged 2.0L '''VC Turbo''' (Variable Compression Turbocharged) Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine (the '''Platinum'''-based '''Edition One''' features the '''VC Turbo''' engine as standard equipment), although only the base engine is available with [[All Wheel Drive]] (AWD), which is also available on the Altima for the first time (the AWD Altima competes directly with the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] and [[Subaru Legacy]] midsize sedans, which both also offer AWD).
