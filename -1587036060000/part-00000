Once a [[Puritan]] stronghold, Boston changed dramatically in the 19th century with the arrival of European [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]]. The Irish dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]]. Their arrival transformed Boston from an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city into one that has become progressively more diverse. The [[Yankee]]s hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction. In the 1840s and 50s, the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant [[Know Nothing]] movement targeted Irish Catholics in Boston. In the 1860s, many Irish immigrants fought for [[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]] in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism helped to dispel much of the prejudice against them.<!--<ref>O'Connor (1995), Ch. 3.</ref>-->\n\n<!--Even to the present day, Boston still commands the largest percentage of Irish-descended people of any city in the United States. - IS THIS STILL TRUE? -->With an expanding population, group loyalty, and block-by-block political organization, the Irish took political control of the city, leaving the Yankees in charge of finance, business, and higher education. The Irish left their mark on the region in a number of ways: in still heavily Irish neighborhoods such as [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] and [[South Boston]]; in the name of the local basketball team, the [[Boston Celtics]]; in the iconic Irish-American political family, the [[Kennedys]]; in a large number of prominent local politicians, such as [[James Michael Curley]]; and in the establishment of Catholic [[Boston College]] as a rival to [[Harvard]].<!--<ref>O'Connor (1995), Ch. 9.</ref>-->\n\n==History==\n\n===Early America===\n\nThe Irish have been in Boston since colonial times, when they arrived as [[indentured servants]], merchants, sailors, or tradesmen. According to historian James Cullen, a large number of Irish immigrants arrived as early as 1654, on the ship Goodfellow, and were \"sold\" into indentured servitude \"to such of the inhabitants as needed them.\"<ref>Cullen (1889), p. 23.</ref>\n\nMost of the early arrivals were [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Presbyterians from Ulster]] who came seeking relief from high rents, repressive taxes, and other pressures. Wary of Boston's Anglo-Saxon [[Puritans]], who were hostile to the Irish, many moved to the outer fringes of the Bay Colony and founded towns such as [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]] and [[Belfast, Maine|Belfast]] in Maine, and [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]] and [[Derry, New Hampshire|Derry]] in New Hampshire. The few Irish [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] who settled in the Boston area had to convert or hide their identity, since Catholicism was outlawed.<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 3-5</ref> Other Irish immigrants may have come to Boston involuntarily, after being kidnapped by pirates.<ref>Cullen (1889), p. 24.</ref> The ''[[Boston News-Letter]]'' announced an auction of Irish boys in 1730, and women convicts deported from Belfast were sold in Boston in 1749.<ref>Byrne (2008) p. 551.</ref> Conflation of such immigrants, indentures, and convicts has given rise to the [[Irish slaves myth]].\n\nOn March 17, 1737, after a particularly harsh winter, a group of Irish Protestants met in Boston to organize the [[Charitable Irish Society of Boston|Charitable Irish Society]]. Its mission was to provide loans and other assistance to Irish immigrants who were elderly, sick, or in need. The gathering was the first known observance of [[St. Patrick's Day]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Still in existence, the society is the oldest Irish organization in North America.<ref>Quinlin (2013), pp. 7-8.</ref>\n\nOnce the Irish had proved their loyalty by fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War]], they were more welcome in Boston and better able to assimilate&mdash;provided, of course, that they were Protestants. According to historian Michael J. O'Brien, hundreds of Irish Americans fought in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].<ref>O'Brien (1919), pp. 210, 224.</ref> One son of Irish immigrants, [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]], served under [[George Washington]] and became a brigadier general. According to local legend, Sullivan used \"Saint Patrick\" as the official password when he led Colonial troops into town following the British evacuation of Boston in 1776. Boston still celebrates the event each year on [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|Evacuation Day]], which coincides with [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States|Saint Patrick's Day]]. Sullivan's brother, [[James Sullivan (governor)|James Sullivan]], was elected governor of Massachusetts in 1807.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:1857 ConstitutionWharf Boston byWinslowHomer Ballous.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Irish immigrants arriving at [[Port of Boston|Constitution Wharf]], Boston, 1857]]\n\nA wave of Irish immigration to Boston started in the 1820s. Initially most of the newcomers were Protestants, but increasingly they were joined by Catholics. From the start, there were problems. The \"[[papists]]\" were seen as both a spiritual and a political threat, and the locals reacted accordingly. Gangs of militant Protestants roamed the streets of Irish neighborhoods, damaging property and even destroying several houses. Preachers railed from the pulpit against the \"blasphemy\" and \"idolatry\" of Roman Catholicism, and local newspapers fanned the flames by printing anti-Catholic propaganda, filled with wild conspiracy theories about the [[Jesuits]].<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 43-45.</ref>\n\nOn July 11, 1837, a company of Yankee firemen returning from a call met with an Irish funeral procession on Broad Street. What started as a street brawl escalated into an all-out riot when a fireman sounded the emergency alarm, summoning all of the fire engines in Boston. Local Yankee and Irish Americans came running to join the fight, bearing sticks, stones, bricks, and [[wikt:cudgel|cudgels]]. Some 800 men were involved in the actual fighting and at least 10,000 gathered in the street to cheer them on. The riot ended when the mayor called in the [[National Lancers]] and the state militia. Remarkably, no one was killed. Three Irishmen, and none of the firemen, received jail sentences. The incident became known as the [[Broad Street Riot]].<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 48-49.</ref>\n\n====Famine years====\n[[File:Irish Famine Memorial - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boston Irish Famine Memorial]]]]\nThe [[Port of Boston]] was a major center of immigration during the [[Great Irish Famine]] (1845\u20131852). By 1850, the Irish were the largest ethnic group in Boston. Most of the immigrants during this period were poor, unskilled laborers from rural backgrounds who settled in the slums of the [[North End, Boston|North End]], the [[South Cove, Boston|South Cove]], and [[Fort Hill, Boston|Fort Hill]]. Many were not only destitute but weakened by [[1847 North American typhus epidemic|typhus]] contracted on the [[coffin ships]] that had brought them. To contain the health risk, a quarantine hospital and [[almshouse]] were built on [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], where hundreds of immigrants died and were buried in unmarked graves.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Boston Irish Reporter |title=For many famine Irish, Deer Island proved their only glimpse of America |last1=Stevens |first1=Peter F. |date=March 1, 2013 |url=http://www.bostonirish.com/history/many-famine-irish-deer-island-proved-their-only-glimpse-america }}</ref> To make matters worse, a [[cholera]] epidemic swept through Boston in 1849. The North End poor, living in crowded, unsanitary conditions on the waterfront, were the hardest hit; over 500 Irish were killed.<ref>Ryan (1979), pp. 2-3.</ref> Boston health inspectors described a typical Irish slum as \"a perfect hive of human beings, without comforts and mostly without common necessaries; in many cases huddled together like brutes, without regard to age or sex or sense of decency.\"<ref name=\"famine\">{{cite web |website=The History Place |title=Irish Potato Famine: Gone to America |url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/famine/america.htm}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany Irish women became domestic servants; by 1860, two-thirds of the servants in Boston were Irish.<ref>Byrne (2008) p. 552.</ref> Most Irish men worked in construction, in quarries, or on the docks. Irish laborers helped build up the business district behind [[Faneuil Hall]], built townhouses on [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], cleared land for [[North Station]], and filled in the [[South End, Boston|South End]]; others worked on the waterfront as fish cutters and stevedores.<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 37.</ref>\n\nA notable exception was [[Andrew Carney]]. Born into poverty in [[County Cavan]], Ireland, he trained as a tailor's apprentice, then moved to Boston in 1816 and opened a successful tailoring business. Carney & Sleeper, Clothier, was one of the first shops to offer \"ready-made\" suits. After selling the business, Carney retired from tailoring and went on to a career in finance and a legacy of philanthropy. He co-founded the [[First National Bank of Boston]] and the [[John Hancock Insurance|John Hancock Insurance Company]]; funded the Church of the Immaculate Conception in the South End, and several Catholic orphanages; helped found [[Boston College]]; and in 1863 founded [[Carney Hospital]], where, he insisted, \"the sick without distinction of creed, color or nation shall be received and cared for.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Dorchester Reporter |last1=Stevens |first1=Peter F. |title=One of God's Best Noblemen |date=April 29, 2015 |url=http://www.dotnews.com/2015/one-god-s-best-noble-men }}</ref> This policy was relatively enlightened at a time when [[Boston City Hospital]] was refusing to admit Jewish patients.<ref>Ryan (1979), p. 165.</ref>\n\nAnother influential figure was Thomas F. Ring<!-- (1841-1898)-->, president of the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul|St. Vincent de Paul Society]] and the Catholic Union of Boston. A Boston native of Irish descent, Ring worked for his family's paper export business and was a leading member of several charitable organizations.<ref>{{cite web |website=ArchiveGrid |title=Thomas F. Ring Papers |url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/33256834}}</ref> Ring was also involved in the founding, in 1870, of the Union Institution for Savings, which provided loans to Catholics who were turned away by other banks.<ref>Cullen (1889), pp. 403-404.</ref> Other successful Irish businessmen included Christopher Blake, who started a large furniture factory in [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]]; Patrick Maguire, founder of ''The Republic'', a weekly political journal; and Dennis Hern, founder of a telegram service that employed 400 messengers.<ref>Cullen (1889), pp. 408-409, 413, 419.</ref>\n\nThe [[Boston Irish Famine Memorial]] was erected at the corner of Washington and School Streets, on the [[Freedom Trail]], in 1998. One bronze sculpture depicts a starving woman, looking up to the heavens as if to ask \"Why?\", while her children cling to her. A second sculpture shows the figures hopeful as they land in Boston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/famine/ |title=Boston Irish Famine Memorial |publisher=Boston.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>\n\n====The Know Nothings====\n\n[[File:Nativist, anti-Catholic flyer.jpg|thumb|Nativist, anti-Catholic paper published in Boston ca. 1854]] In the 1840s and 50s, increasing [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] and [[anti-Catholic]] sentiment gave rise to the [[Know Nothing]] movement, formally known as the American Party. The Know Nothings gained a large following in Boston with their program of \"Temperance, Liberty, and Protestantism\". In 1847 they held a mass rally in the crowded Irish neighborhood of Fort Hill; residents, forewarned by the clergy and urged to keep the peace, stayed indoors that day.<ref>Cullen (1889), pp. 74-75.</ref>\n\nIn 1854 the Know Nothings took control of the [[Massachusetts legislature]].<!--elected in 1854, took office in 1855--><ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 76.</ref> Among other things, they passed laws barring Catholics from being buried in public cemeteries, denying church officials any control over church property, and requiring children to read from the Protestant Bible (the [[King James Version]]) in public schools. They formed a Nunnery Committee that raided Catholic schools and convents on trumped-up pretexts.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 77, 80.</ref> The [[Boston Police Department]]'s first Irish officer, Barney McGinniskin, was fired that year without cause,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Boston Globe |title=Erin go Barney |date=March 15, 2011 |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/03/15/boston_celebrates_first_irish_police_officer_in_us/}}</ref> and on Independence Day, the newly constructed St. Gregory's Church in Dorchester was burned to the ground by Know Nothing rioters.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Dorchester Reporter |title=St. Gregory's 150th is full of meaning beyond the church itself |date=October 4, 2012 |url=http://www.dotnews.com/columns/2012/editorial-st-gregory-s-150th-full-meaning-beyond-church-itself}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Jewish Veteran |title=A Resume of Intolerant Movements |page=92 |volume=7-9 |date=1940 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGzxAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA92-IA17 }}</ref>\n\nIn Boston's public schools, Catholic children were required to say Protestant prayers and sing Protestant hymns, and their history books were written from an anti-Catholic point of view.<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 80.</ref> In 1859, a Catholic boy who refused to recite the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments was severely beaten, leading to the [[Eliot School rebellion|Eliot School Rebellion]]. Over 300 boys withdrew from the school, prompting St. Mary's Parish to create a primary school to educate them.<ref>Ryan (1979), p. 59.</ref>\n\n====Civil War====\n[[File:Massachusetts Fighting Ninth.jpg|thumb|left|[[9th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|Massachusetts 9th Regiment]] at Camp Cass, Virginia, 1861]]\nAlthough Boston was an important center of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], most Irish immigrants were strongly opposed to blacks and to abolitionists. Historian Brian Kelly says, \"Though they were neither consistent stalwarts of the northern war effort nor pure-and-simple dupes of the slavocracy, the Irish were capable both of ardent support and sacrifices for the Union cause and of vicious hatred for the \"n*****s\" and his/her abolitionist sympathizers.\"<ref>Brian Kelly, \"Ambiguous Loyalties: The Boston Irish, Slavery, and the Civil War.\" ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'' 24.2 (1996): 165+, quoting  p 168. [http://www.westfield.ma.edu/historical-journal/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kelly-combined.pdf online]</ref> Many fought for [[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]], including Colonel [[Thomas Cass (colonel)|Thomas Cass]], who commanded an Irish regiment, the [[9th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|Fighting Ninth]]; and [[Patrick Robert Guiney]], who fought in over thirty engagements. [[Mary O'Connell|Sister Mary Anthony O'Connell]] served as a nurse on the front lines, where she was known as the \"Angel of the Battlefield\". Irish Bostonians also contributed to the war effort by working in the Watertown arsenal and the iron foundries of South Boston, or in the shipyards, building warships for the navy. There was some resistance to the draft in 1863, but nothing like the [[New York City draft riots]]. The critical factor among the Irish, according to Kelly, was the powerful role of the Catholic Church. He states:\n:The basic conservatism of the Catholic hierarchy, which had previously led it to attack abolitionists for challenging the existing social order was, after Sumter, turned against the Confederacy....Lay Catholics, according to the Church, were to answer the Union call to arms, not out of anti-slavery zeal, but out of \"loyal submission to legitimate rule.\"<ref>Kelly, p 191.</ref>\n\nBy 1870, Boston had 250,000 residents, 56,900 of whom were Irish.<ref>Byrne (2008), p. 552.</ref> Around this time several powerful Irish [[Political boss|ward bosses]] appeared on the scene, including [[Martin Lomasney]] in the [[West End, Boston|West End]], [[John F. Fitzgerald]] in the North End, and [[P. J. Kennedy]] in [[East Boston]].<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 290.</ref> Though often depicted as ruthless and corrupt, ward bosses provided much-needed aid to their neighbors. As Lomasney put it, \"The great mass of people are interested in only three things&mdash;food, clothing, and shelter. A politician in a district like mine sees to it that his people get these things.\" This approach to politics, known as the [[patronage system]], helped the Irish climb out of poverty. Early in Lomasney's career, he and his brother Joseph founded the Hendricks Club. The Hendricks began as a social club and gathering place, but later turned into the center of Lomasney's [[political machine]]. It was from here that he began to provide social services, charity, and shelter for poor immigrants. In return, he was able to drum up votes and support for candidates of his choosing. Partly through his influence, Boston elected its first Irish mayor, [[Hugh O'Brien]], in 1884.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 119, 121-122, 141.</ref>\n\nAs Irish Americans began to gain political power, there was a resurgence of anti-Catholic nativism. Groups such as the [[American Protective Association]] (APA), the [[Immigration Restriction League]], and Loyal Women of American Liberty were active in Boston.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 153, 156.</ref> The APA introduced legislation aimed at disaccrediting local Catholic schools, while other groups focused on purging Catholics from the School Committee. Area Catholics responded by founding as many Catholic schools (such as St. Augustine's in South Boston, founded in 1895) as their limited resources allowed.<ref>Ryan (1979), pp. 60-65.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the century, the city's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants; the Irish dominated [[South Boston]] and [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].<ref>Whyte (1939), p. 631.</ref><!--Not the best citation, but this is common knowledge-->\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Suffragist Margaret Foley 150016v.jpg|thumb|[[Margaret Foley (suffragist)|Margaret Foley]] (right) and another suffragist distribute the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'', 1913]]\nIn the early 20th century, Boston's Irish Americans were successful in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics and the [[American labor movement|labor movement]], yet were relatively slow to break into business and the [[professions]]. This was only partly due to discrimination against them, although that was certainly a factor. For cultural reasons, they gravitated to modest positions offering job security and pensions rather than high-risk business ventures. Many became schoolteachers, police officers, firefighters, nurses, librarians, custodians, and clerks. Historian Dennis P. Ryan calls them \"occupationally nearsighted\".<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 223-224; Ryan (1979), p. 80.</ref>\n\nFew Irish women in Boston were active in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffrage movement]], which was dominated by upper-class women. [[Margaret Foley (suffragist)|Margaret Foley]] of Dorchester was a rare exception. Known for confronting anti-suffrage candidates at political rallies, she was nicknamed the \"Grand Heckler\". Most working-class women were more interested in labor issues: [[Mary Kenney O'Sullivan]] helped found the [[Women's Trade Union League]] in 1903, and was a leader of the [[Lawrence textile strike]] in 1912; [[Julia O'Connor]] led a successful telephone operators' strike in 1919 that paralyzed telephone service across [[New England]] for six days.<ref>{{cite web |website=Boston Women's Heritage Trail |title=Back Bay West |url=http://bwht.org/2009/04/}}</ref> That same year, the [[Boston Police Strike|Boston Police went on strike]] for better wages and working conditions. Most of the officers who subsequently lost their jobs were Irish Catholics, while most of those who condemned the strikers were \"old-line Protestant Yankees\". Many of the [[strikebreakers]] were students at [[Harvard University]].<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 192.</ref>\n\nDuring this period the Irish often clashed with [[Italian Americans in Boston|Italians]], despite the fact that the vast majority of both groups shared a common religion and political party. Thousands of Irish immigrants who had settled in Boston's North End in the 19th century, displacing the Yankee residents, were crowded out by Italians in the early 20th century. The two groups were in competition for jobs as well as housing, and there were cultural differences, including different styles of Catholic worship, that caused additional friction. For a time, in some Irish parishes, Italians were forced to attend [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in the basement.<ref>Ryan (1979), pp. 169-171; Whyte (1939) pp. 626, 629</ref>\n====Leading politicians====\nThe most prominent figure in Boston politics early in the 20th century was [[John F. Fitzgerald]], a man so well known for his charming personality that he was nicknamed \"Honey Fitz\". During his two terms as mayor, Fitzgerald made major improvements to the Port of Boston, an investment that brought increased traffic from Europe. Perhaps more significantly, in his later years he taught his grandchildren how to succeed in politics. One of them, [[John F. Kennedy]], would go on to become the 35th president of the United States.\n\nFitzgerald was succeeded as mayor by another charismatic Irish American, [[James Michael Curley]]. Fatherless at the age of ten, Curley left school to help support his family while his mother scrubbed floors in downtown office buildings. He had a natural flair for public speaking, which he deliberately honed, studying the speeches of famous orators in the [[Boston Public Library]]. By 1900 he was Boston's youngest ward boss. He went on to serve three terms in Congress, four terms as mayor, and a term as Governor of Massachusetts. He also spent time in prison for fraud. The city's elites saw him as unforgivably corrupt, but he was well loved by Boston's poor. During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], he enlarged Boston City Hospital, expanded the [[MBTA subway|subway system]], funded projects to improve the roads and bridges, and improved the neighborhoods with beaches and bathhouses, playgrounds and parks, public schools and libraries. Among the many local legends about Curley, perhaps the most telling is his ordering long-handled mops for the cleaning women at City Hall so they would not have to be on their knees.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 179-195, 204-205</ref> According to City Councilman [[Fred Langone]], Curley was more popular with the newer immigrants, such as Italians and Jews, than he was with the [[Lace curtain and shanty Irish|lace curtain Irish]] of [[Jamaica Plain, Boston|Jamaica Plain]], [[West Roxbury, Boston|West Roxbury]], and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]].<ref>Langone (1994), p. 8.</ref>\n\nHistorian James M. O'Toole has argued: \n:Surely there has been no more flamboyant political personality  than James Michael Curley, who dominated politics in Boston for half a century. Whether as incumbent or as candidate, he was always there: alderman, congressman, mayor, governor. People loved him or hated him,  but they could not ignore him. He mastered the politics of ethnic and class warfare by defining a manichaean world of \"us\" versus \"them\"....He presided over state and city during the challenge of the Depression, leaving behind impressive monuments in stone and public works. In the end, he even managed to enter American political mythology, remembered as much in his fictional incarnations as for his real life.<ref>James M. O'Toole. \"Review\" in ''The New England Quarterly'' 66#3 (1993) pp. 500-502 </ref>\n\nUrban historian [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] has argued that:\n:Curley was among the best-known and most colorful of the big-city, paternalistic bosses, Irish, Catholic, and Democratic....Capitalizing on Irish-American resentment against the Republican, Harvard-educated Brahmans who dominated Boston's social and economic life, Curley like to think of himself as \"Mayor of the Poor\"....Curley helped immigrants to adjust to urban life by finding them jobs, easing their troubles with the law, building them playgrounds and public baths, and attending their weddings and wakes.... Because his feuds with fellow Irish chieftains like John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, Patrick Kennedy, and Martin Lomasney were legendary, he tried as mayor to centralize patronage and make the ward healer obsolete. During the depression he used federal relief and work projects as a tool of his political ambitions. But Curley never built a really solid organization in Boston and never enjoyed the power or statewide influence of other well-known urban bosses. <ref>Kenneth T. Jackson, \"Curley, James Michael,\" in John A. Garraty, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Biography'' (1974) pp 246-247.</ref>\n====Depression and World War II====\n\n\nDuring [[World War II]], there was an outbreak of [[antisemitic]] violence in Boston. Jewish residents, businesses, and synagogues were frequent targets of what would now be called [[hate crimes]]: gangs of mostly Irish Catholic youths, incited by [[Father Coughlin]] and the [[Christian Front (United States)|Christian Front]], roamed the streets of Jewish neighborhoods, vandalizing property and assaulting residents. Several victims were seriously injured with [[Baton (law enforcement)|blackjacks]] and [[brass knuckles]]. Boston's predominantly Irish police, politicians, and clergy were of little help, and the local press largely ignored the problem.<ref>Norwood (2003), p. 233; O'Connor (1995), p. 204.</ref><ref>{{cite web |ref=harv |last1=Goldstein |first1=Jenny |title=Transcending Boundaries: Boston's Catholics and Jews, 1929\u20131965 |website=Boston College Center for Christian-Jewish Learning |date=2001 |url=http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/research_sites/cjl/texts/cjrelations/resources/articles/goldstein.htm }}</ref> Mayor Curley once proudly proclaimed Boston \"the strongest Coughlin city in the world.\" Another Irish Catholic, [[Frances Sweeney]], led protests against the Christian Front and similar groups.<ref>Currier (1944), p. 427.</ref>\n\nDespite Coughlin's popularity with Boston's Irish Catholics, South Boston residents overwhelmingly voted against [[William Lemke]], Coughlin's candidate in the 1936 presidential election.<ref>Stack, quoted in O'Connor (1981), p. 650.</ref>\n\n====Exodus to the suburbs====\n[[File:Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn.jpg|thumb|left|Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] and Mayor [[Raymond L. Flynn]], ca. 1984.]]\n\nBoston's politics changed after the war. [[New Deal]] legislation and federal programs such as the [[G.I. Bill]] made the local patronage system obsolete. Mayor [[John Hynes (politician)|John Hynes]] got along better with business leaders than Curley had, while [[Cardinal Cushing]] reached out to other religious communities. The election of president [[John F. Kennedy]] was a source of great pride to Boston's Irish Americans, and marked a turning point in their \"political consciousness\". A succession of Irish mayors&mdash;Hynes, [[John F. Collins]], and [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]]&mdash;pushed urban renewal projects that contributed to [[gentrification]]. As immigrant families assimilated and their children moved to the suburbs, Boston's neighborhoods began to lose their ethnic identities.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 212, 216, 226-227.</ref>\n\nIrish Americans in Boston responded with alarm to news reports of the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], some raising funds for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. IRA supporters in the U.S. tended to be politically far to the right of the IRA members themselves. In the early 1970s [[Bernadette Devlin]] offended IRA supporters in Boston when she said she felt more comfortable with black people in Roxbury than she did with the Irish in South Boston.<ref>{{cite web |website=PBS |title=The IRA and Sinn Fein: America and the Conflict |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ira/reports/america.html }}</ref> Boston's Irish Catholics tended to be [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], with little interest in the [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights]], [[anti-Vietnam War]], and [[feminist]] movements.<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 293.</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, many of Boston's Irish-American residents became embroiled in the [[Boston busing desegregation|busing controversy]]. To combat the ''[[de facto]]'' segregation of Boston's public schools, federal judge [[W. Arthur Garrity Jr.]] ruled that students must be bused between predominantly white and black areas of the city. [[South Boston High School]] was the site of many of the most vocal and violent protests.<ref>{{cite web |website=WBUR News |title='It Was Like A War Zone': Busing in Boston |date=September 4, 2014 |url=http://www.wbur.org/news/2014/09/05/boston-busing-anniversary }}</ref> Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] supported Garrity's ruling, while [[Ray Flynn]], then serving on the state legislature representing South Boston, opposed it. The plan ultimately led to an increase in the [[High school dropouts|dropout]] rate and a wave of [[white flight]] to the suburbs and private schools. Meanwhile, local crime boss [[Whitey Bulger]] took advantage of the chaos and tightened his grip on South Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schusterinstituteinvestigations.org/southies-lost-generation |website=Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University |last1=MacDonald |authorlink=Michael Patrick MacDonald |first1=Michael Patrick |title=Whitey Bulger, Boston Busing, and Southie's Lost Generation |date=2014}}</ref> Irish American public figures were prominent on both sides of the issue, and surveys during the 1960s and 1970s found Irish Americans divided on the issue.

The Catholic Church with its tradition of [[pastoral care]] played an especially important role in the lives of the poor. While Protestant and secular charitable organizations offered various forms of assistance, they often discriminated or [[Proselytism|proselytized]]. To avoid this, Catholics built orphanages (the St. Vincent Female Orphan Asylum and the Home for Destitute Catholic Children), homes for wayward teens (House of the Angel Guardian and House of the Good Shepherd), a foundling home (St. Mary's Infant Asylum), two homeless shelters ([[Working Boys Home]] and Working Girls' Home), and a Catholic hospital (Carney Hospital). The Catholic [[St. Vincent de Paul Society]] offered food, shelter, clothing, and counseling. One parish, St. Francis de Sales in Charlestown, issued food stamps.<ref>Ryan (1979) pp. 4-13.</ref> In response to bias and proselytism in Protestant-dominated schools, Boston's Irish Catholics built Catholic schools. By 1917, they had established 29 elementary schools, four high schools, four academies, and one college ([[Boston College]]).<ref>Ryan (1979), p. 77.</ref>\n\nThe first New England native to be ordained to the Catholic priesthood was [[John Thayer (priest)|John Thayer]], a Boston-born [[Congregationalist]] minister who converted to Catholicism in 1783. Thayer started the first Catholic congregation in Boston in 1790, ministering to French and Irish immigrants; eventually he moved to [[Limerick, Ireland]], where he lived the rest of his life. The first church built in Boston for Catholics was the [[Holy Cross Church, Boston|Holy Cross Church]] on Franklin Street, designed by [[Charles Bulfinch]] and built in 1803; it was demolished in 1862 and replaced by the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross (Boston)|Holy Cross Cathedral]].

Once a [[Puritan]] stronghold, Boston changed dramatically in the 19th century with the arrival of European [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]]. The Irish dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]]. Their arrival transformed Boston from an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city into one that has become progressively more diverse. The [[Yankee]]s hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction. In the 1840s and 50s, the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant [[Know Nothing]] movement targeted Irish Catholics in Boston. In the 1860s, many Irish immigrants fought for [[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]] in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism helped to dispel much of the prejudice against them.<!--<ref>O'Connor (1995), Ch. 3.</ref>-->\n\n<!--Even to the present day, Boston still commands the largest percentage of Irish-descended people of any city in the United States. - IS THIS STILL TRUE? -->With an expanding population, group loyalty, and block-by-block political organization, the Irish took political control of the city, leaving the Yankees in charge of finance, business, and higher education. The Irish left their mark on the region in a number of ways: in still heavily Irish neighborhoods such as [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] and [[South Boston]]; in the name of the local basketball team, the [[Boston Celtics]]; in the iconic Irish-American political family, the [[Kennedys]]; in a large number of prominent local politicians, such as [[James Michael Curley]]; and in the establishment of Catholic [[Boston College]] as a rival to [[Harvard]].<!--<ref>O'Connor (1995), Ch. 9.</ref>-->\n\n==History==\n\n===Early America===\n\nThe Irish have been in Boston since colonial times, when they arrived as [[indentured servants]], merchants, sailors, or tradesmen. According to historian James Cullen, a large number of Irish immigrants arrived as early as 1654, on the ship Goodfellow, and were \"sold\" into indentured servitude \"to such of the inhabitants as needed them.\"<ref>Cullen (1889), p. 23.</ref>\n\nMost of the early arrivals were [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Presbyterians from Ulster]] who came seeking relief from high rents, repressive taxes, and other pressures. Wary of Boston's Anglo-Saxon [[Puritans]], who were hostile to the Irish, many moved to the outer fringes of the Bay Colony and founded towns such as [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]] and [[Belfast, Maine|Belfast]] in Maine, and [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]] and [[Derry, New Hampshire|Derry]] in New Hampshire. The few Irish [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] who settled in the Boston area had to convert or hide their identity, since Catholicism was outlawed.<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 3-5</ref> Other Irish immigrants may have come to Boston involuntarily, after being kidnapped by pirates.<ref>Cullen (1889), p. 24.</ref> The ''[[Boston News-Letter]]'' announced an auction of Irish boys in 1730, and women convicts deported from Belfast were sold in Boston in 1749.<ref>Byrne (2008) p. 551.</ref> Conflation of such immigrants, indentures, and convicts has given rise to the [[Irish slaves myth]].\n\nOn March 17, 1737, after a particularly harsh winter, a group of Irish Protestants met in Boston to organize the [[Charitable Irish Society of Boston|Charitable Irish Society]]. Its mission was to provide loans and other assistance to Irish immigrants who were elderly, sick, or in need. The gathering was the first known observance of [[St. Patrick's Day]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Still in existence, the society is the oldest Irish organization in North America.<ref>Quinlin (2013), pp. 7-8.</ref>\n\nOnce the Irish had proved their loyalty by fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War]], they were more welcome in Boston and better able to assimilate&mdash;provided, of course, that they were Protestants. According to historian Michael J. O'Brien, hundreds of Irish Americans fought in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].<ref>O'Brien (1919), pp. 210, 224.</ref> One son of Irish immigrants, [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]], served under [[George Washington]] and became a brigadier general. According to local legend, Sullivan used \"Saint Patrick\" as the official password when he led Colonial troops into town following the British evacuation of Boston in 1776. Boston still celebrates the event each year on [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|Evacuation Day]], which coincides with [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States|Saint Patrick's Day]]. Sullivan's brother, [[James Sullivan (governor)|James Sullivan]], was elected governor of Massachusetts in 1807.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:1857 ConstitutionWharf Boston byWinslowHomer Ballous.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Irish immigrants arriving at [[Port of Boston|Constitution Wharf]], Boston, 1857]]\n\nA wave of Irish immigration to Boston started in the 1820s. Initially most of the newcomers were Protestants, but increasingly they were joined by Catholics. From the start, there were problems. The \"[[papists]]\" were seen as both a spiritual and a political threat, and the locals reacted accordingly. Gangs of militant Protestants roamed the streets of Irish neighborhoods, damaging property and even destroying several houses. Preachers railed from the pulpit against the \"blasphemy\" and \"idolatry\" of Roman Catholicism, and local newspapers fanned the flames by printing anti-Catholic propaganda, filled with wild conspiracy theories about the [[Jesuits]].<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 43-45.</ref>\n\nOn July 11, 1837, a company of Yankee firemen returning from a call met with an Irish funeral procession on Broad Street. What started as a street brawl escalated into an all-out riot when a fireman sounded the emergency alarm, summoning all of the fire engines in Boston. Local Yankee and Irish Americans came running to join the fight, bearing sticks, stones, bricks, and [[wikt:cudgel|cudgels]]. Some 800 men were involved in the actual fighting and at least 10,000 gathered in the street to cheer them on. The riot ended when the mayor called in the [[National Lancers]] and the state militia. Remarkably, no one was killed. Three Irishmen, and none of the firemen, received jail sentences. The incident became known as the [[Broad Street Riot]].<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 48-49.</ref>\n\n====Famine years====\n[[File:Irish Famine Memorial - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boston Irish Famine Memorial]]]]\nThe [[Port of Boston]] was a major center of immigration during the [[Great Irish Famine]] (1845\u20131852). By 1850, the Irish were the largest ethnic group in Boston. Most of the immigrants during this period were poor, unskilled laborers from rural backgrounds who settled in the slums of the [[North End, Boston|North End]], the [[South Cove, Boston|South Cove]], and [[Fort Hill, Boston|Fort Hill]]. Many were not only destitute but weakened by [[1847 North American typhus epidemic|typhus]] contracted on the [[coffin ships]] that had brought them. To contain the health risk, a quarantine hospital and [[almshouse]] were built on [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], where hundreds of immigrants died and were buried in unmarked graves.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Boston Irish Reporter |title=For many famine Irish, Deer Island proved their only glimpse of America |last1=Stevens |first1=Peter F. |date=March 1, 2013 |url=http://www.bostonirish.com/history/many-famine-irish-deer-island-proved-their-only-glimpse-america }}</ref> To make matters worse, a [[cholera]] epidemic swept through Boston in 1849. The North End poor, living in crowded, unsanitary conditions on the waterfront, were the hardest hit; over 500 Irish were killed.<ref>Ryan (1979), pp. 2-3.</ref> Boston health inspectors described a typical Irish slum as \"a perfect hive of human beings, without comforts and mostly without common necessaries; in many cases huddled together like brutes, without regard to age or sex or sense of decency.\"<ref name=\"famine\">{{cite web |website=The History Place |title=Irish Potato Famine: Gone to America |url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/famine/america.htm}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany Irish women became domestic servants; by 1860, two-thirds of the servants in Boston were Irish.<ref>Byrne (2008) p. 552.</ref> Most Irish men worked in construction, in quarries, or on the docks. Irish laborers helped build up the business district behind [[Faneuil Hall]], built townhouses on [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], cleared land for [[North Station]], and filled in the [[South End, Boston|South End]]; others worked on the waterfront as fish cutters and stevedores.<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 37.</ref>\n\nA notable exception was [[Andrew Carney]]. Born into poverty in [[County Cavan]], Ireland, he trained as a tailor's apprentice, then moved to Boston in 1816 and opened a successful tailoring business. Carney & Sleeper, Clothier, was one of the first shops to offer \"ready-made\" suits. After selling the business, Carney retired from tailoring and went on to a career in finance and a legacy of philanthropy. He co-founded the [[First National Bank of Boston]] and the [[John Hancock Insurance|John Hancock Insurance Company]]; funded the Church of the Immaculate Conception in the South End, and several Catholic orphanages; helped found [[Boston College]]; and in 1863 founded [[Carney Hospital]], where, he insisted, \"the sick without distinction of creed, color or nation shall be received and cared for.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Dorchester Reporter |last1=Stevens |first1=Peter F. |title=One of God's Best Noblemen |date=April 29, 2015 |url=http://www.dotnews.com/2015/one-god-s-best-noble-men }}</ref> This policy was relatively enlightened at a time when [[Boston City Hospital]] was refusing to admit Jewish patients.<ref>Ryan (1979), p. 165.</ref>\n\nAnother influential figure was Thomas F. Ring<!-- (1841-1898)-->, president of the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul|St. Vincent de Paul Society]] and the Catholic Union of Boston. A Boston native of Irish descent, Ring worked for his family's paper export business and was a leading member of several charitable organizations.<ref>{{cite web |website=ArchiveGrid |title=Thomas F. Ring Papers |url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/33256834}}</ref> Ring was also involved in the founding, in 1870, of the Union Institution for Savings, which provided loans to Catholics who were turned away by other banks.<ref>Cullen (1889), pp. 403-404.</ref> Other successful Irish businessmen included Christopher Blake, who started a large furniture factory in [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]]; Patrick Maguire, founder of ''The Republic'', a weekly political journal; and Dennis Hern, founder of a telegram service that employed 400 messengers.<ref>Cullen (1889), pp. 408-409, 413, 419.</ref>\n\nThe [[Boston Irish Famine Memorial]] was erected at the corner of Washington and School Streets, on the [[Freedom Trail]], in 1998. One bronze sculpture depicts a starving woman, looking up to the heavens as if to ask \"Why?\", while her children cling to her. A second sculpture shows the figures hopeful as they land in Boston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/famine/ |title=Boston Irish Famine Memorial |publisher=Boston.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>\n\n====The Know Nothings====\n\n[[File:Nativist, anti-Catholic flyer.jpg|thumb|Nativist, anti-Catholic paper published in Boston ca. 1854]] In the 1840s and 50s, increasing [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] and [[anti-Catholic]] sentiment gave rise to the [[Know Nothing]] movement, formally known as the American Party. The Know Nothings gained a large following in Boston with their program of \"Temperance, Liberty, and Protestantism\". In 1847 they held a mass rally in the crowded Irish neighborhood of Fort Hill; residents, forewarned by the clergy and urged to keep the peace, stayed indoors that day.<ref>Cullen (1889), pp. 74-75.</ref>\n\nIn 1854 the Know Nothings took control of the [[Massachusetts legislature]].<!--elected in 1854, took office in 1855--><ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 76.</ref> Among other things, they passed laws barring Catholics from being buried in public cemeteries, denying church officials any control over church property, and requiring children to read from the Protestant Bible (the [[King James Version]]) in public schools. They formed a Nunnery Committee that raided Catholic schools and convents on trumped-up pretexts.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 77, 80.</ref> The [[Boston Police Department]]'s first Irish officer, Barney McGinniskin, was fired that year without cause,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Boston Globe |title=Erin go Barney |date=March 15, 2011 |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/03/15/boston_celebrates_first_irish_police_officer_in_us/}}</ref> and on Independence Day, the newly constructed St. Gregory's Church in Dorchester was burned to the ground by Know Nothing rioters.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Dorchester Reporter |title=St. Gregory's 150th is full of meaning beyond the church itself |date=October 4, 2012 |url=http://www.dotnews.com/columns/2012/editorial-st-gregory-s-150th-full-meaning-beyond-church-itself}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Jewish Veteran |title=A Resume of Intolerant Movements |page=92 |volume=7-9 |date=1940 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGzxAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA92-IA17 }}</ref>\n\nIn Boston's public schools, Catholic children were required to say Protestant prayers and sing Protestant hymns, and their history books were written from an anti-Catholic point of view.<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 80.</ref> In 1859, a Catholic boy who refused to recite the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments was severely beaten, leading to the [[Eliot School rebellion|Eliot School Rebellion]]. Over 300 boys withdrew from the school, prompting St. Mary's Parish to create a primary school to educate them.<ref>Ryan (1979), p. 59.</ref>\n\n====Civil War====\n[[File:Massachusetts Fighting Ninth.jpg|thumb|left|[[9th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|Massachusetts 9th Regiment]] at Camp Cass, Virginia, 1861]]\nAlthough Boston was an important center of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], most Irish immigrants were strongly opposed to blacks and to abolitionists. Historian Brian Kelly says, \"Though they were neither consistent stalwarts of the northern war effort nor pure-and-simple dupes of the slavocracy, the Irish were capable both of ardent support and sacrifices for the Union cause and of vicious hatred for the \"n*****s\" and his/her abolitionist sympathizers.\"<ref>Brian Kelly, \"Ambiguous Loyalties: The Boston Irish, Slavery, and the Civil War.\" ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'' 24.2 (1996): 165+, quoting  p 168. [http://www.westfield.ma.edu/historical-journal/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kelly-combined.pdf online]</ref> Many fought for [[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]], including Colonel [[Thomas Cass (colonel)|Thomas Cass]], who commanded an Irish regiment, the [[9th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|Fighting Ninth]]; and [[Patrick Robert Guiney]], who fought in over thirty engagements. [[Mary O'Connell|Sister Mary Anthony O'Connell]] served as a nurse on the front lines, where she was known as the \"Angel of the Battlefield\". Irish Bostonians also contributed to the war effort by working in the Watertown arsenal and the iron foundries of South Boston, or in the shipyards, building warships for the navy. There was some resistance to the draft in 1863, but nothing like the [[New York City draft riots]]. The critical factor among the Irish, according to Kelly, was the powerful role of the Catholic Church. He states:\n:The basic conservatism of the Catholic hierarchy, which had previously led it to attack abolitionists for challenging the existing social order was, after Sumter, turned against the Confederacy....Lay Catholics, according to the Church, were to answer the Union call to arms, not out of anti-slavery zeal, but out of \"loyal submission to legitimate rule.\"<ref>Kelly, p 191.</ref>\n\nBy 1870, Boston had 250,000 residents, 56,900 of whom were Irish.<ref>Byrne (2008), p. 552.</ref> Around this time several powerful Irish [[Political boss|ward bosses]] appeared on the scene, including [[Martin Lomasney]] in the [[West End, Boston|West End]], [[John F. Fitzgerald]] in the North End, and [[P. J. Kennedy]] in [[East Boston]].<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 290.</ref> Though often depicted as ruthless and corrupt, ward bosses provided much-needed aid to their neighbors. As Lomasney put it, \"The great mass of people are interested in only three things&mdash;food, clothing, and shelter. A politician in a district like mine sees to it that his people get these things.\" This approach to politics, known as the [[patronage system]], helped the Irish climb out of poverty. Early in Lomasney's career, he and his brother Joseph founded the Hendricks Club. The Hendricks began as a social club and gathering place, but later turned into the center of Lomasney's [[political machine]]. It was from here that he began to provide social services, charity, and shelter for poor immigrants. In return, he was able to drum up votes and support for candidates of his choosing. Partly through his influence, Boston elected its first Irish mayor, [[Hugh O'Brien]], in 1884.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 119, 121-122, 141.</ref>\n\nAs Irish Americans began to gain political power, there was a resurgence of anti-Catholic nativism. Groups such as the [[American Protective Association]] (APA), the [[Immigration Restriction League]], and Loyal Women of American Liberty were active in Boston.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 153, 156.</ref> The APA introduced legislation aimed at disaccrediting local Catholic schools, while other groups focused on purging Catholics from the School Committee. Area Catholics responded by founding as many Catholic schools (such as St. Augustine's in South Boston, founded in 1895) as their limited resources allowed.<ref>Ryan (1979), pp. 60-65.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the century, the city's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants; the Irish dominated [[South Boston]] and [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].<ref>Whyte (1939), p. 631.</ref><!--Not the best citation, but this is common knowledge-->\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Suffragist Margaret Foley 150016v.jpg|thumb|[[Margaret Foley (suffragist)|Margaret Foley]] (right) and another suffragist distribute the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'', 1913]]\nIn the early 20th century, Boston's Irish Americans were successful in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics and the [[American labor movement|labor movement]], yet were relatively slow to break into business and the [[professions]]. This was only partly due to discrimination against them, although that was certainly a factor. For cultural reasons, they gravitated to modest positions offering job security and pensions rather than high-risk business ventures. Many became schoolteachers, police officers, firefighters, nurses, librarians, custodians, and clerks. Historian Dennis P. Ryan calls them \"occupationally nearsighted\".<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 223-224; Ryan (1979), p. 80.</ref>\n\nFew Irish women in Boston were active in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffrage movement]], which was dominated by upper-class women. [[Margaret Foley (suffragist)|Margaret Foley]] of Dorchester was a rare exception. Known for confronting anti-suffrage candidates at political rallies, she was nicknamed the \"Grand Heckler\". Most working-class women were more interested in labor issues: [[Mary Kenney O'Sullivan]] helped found the [[Women's Trade Union League]] in 1903, and was a leader of the [[Lawrence textile strike]] in 1912; [[Julia O'Connor]] led a successful telephone operators' strike in 1919 that paralyzed telephone service across [[New England]] for six days.<ref>{{cite web |website=Boston Women's Heritage Trail |title=Back Bay West |url=http://bwht.org/2009/04/}}</ref> That same year, the [[Boston Police Strike|Boston Police went on strike]] for better wages and working conditions. Most of the officers who subsequently lost their jobs were Irish Catholics, while most of those who condemned the strikers were \"old-line Protestant Yankees\". Many of the [[strikebreakers]] were students at [[Harvard University]].<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 192.</ref>\n\nDuring this period the Irish often clashed with [[Italian Americans in Boston|Italians]], despite the fact that the vast majority of both groups shared a common religion and political party. Thousands of Irish immigrants who had settled in Boston's North End in the 19th century, displacing the Yankee residents, were crowded out by Italians in the early 20th century. The two groups were in competition for jobs as well as housing, and there were cultural differences, including different styles of Catholic worship, that caused additional friction. For a time, in some Irish parishes, Italians were forced to attend [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in the basement.<ref>Ryan (1979), pp. 169-171; Whyte (1939) pp. 626, 629</ref>\n====Leading politicians====\nThe most prominent figure in Boston politics early in the 20th century was [[John F. Fitzgerald]], a man so well known for his charming personality that he was nicknamed \"Honey Fitz\". During his two terms as mayor, Fitzgerald made major improvements to the Port of Boston, an investment that brought increased traffic from Europe. Perhaps more significantly, in his later years he taught his grandchildren how to succeed in politics. One of them, [[John F. Kennedy]], would go on to become the 35th president of the United States.\n\nFitzgerald was succeeded as mayor by another charismatic Irish American, [[James Michael Curley]]. Fatherless at the age of ten, Curley left school to help support his family while his mother scrubbed floors in downtown office buildings. He had a natural flair for public speaking, which he deliberately honed, studying the speeches of famous orators in the [[Boston Public Library]]. By 1900 he was Boston's youngest ward boss. He went on to serve three terms in Congress, four terms as mayor, and a term as Governor of Massachusetts. He also spent time in prison for fraud. The city's elites saw him as unforgivably corrupt, but he was well loved by Boston's poor. During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], he enlarged Boston City Hospital, expanded the [[MBTA Subway|subway system]], funded projects to improve the roads and bridges, and improved the neighborhoods with beaches and bathhouses, playgrounds and parks, public schools and libraries. Among the many local legends about Curley, perhaps the most telling is his ordering long-handled mops for the cleaning women at City Hall so they would not have to be on their knees.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 179-195, 204-205</ref> According to City Councilman [[Fred Langone]], Curley was more popular with the newer immigrants, such as Italians and Jews, than he was with the [[Lace curtain and shanty Irish|lace curtain Irish]] of [[Jamaica Plain, Boston|Jamaica Plain]], [[West Roxbury, Boston|West Roxbury]], and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]].<ref>Langone (1994), p. 8.</ref>\n\nHistorian James M. O'Toole has argued: \n:Surely there has been no more flamboyant political personality  than James Michael Curley, who dominated politics in Boston for half a century. Whether as incumbent or as candidate, he was always there: alderman, congressman, mayor, governor. People loved him or hated him,  but they could not ignore him. He mastered the politics of ethnic and class warfare by defining a manichaean world of \"us\" versus \"them\"....He presided over state and city during the challenge of the Depression, leaving behind impressive monuments in stone and public works. In the end, he even managed to enter American political mythology, remembered as much in his fictional incarnations as for his real life.<ref>James M. O'Toole. \"Review\" in ''The New England Quarterly'' 66#3 (1993) pp. 500-502 </ref>\n\nUrban historian [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] has argued that:\n:Curley was among the best-known and most colorful of the big-city, paternalistic bosses, Irish, Catholic, and Democratic....Capitalizing on Irish-American resentment against the Republican, Harvard-educated Brahmans who dominated Boston's social and economic life, Curley like to think of himself as \"Mayor of the Poor\"....Curley helped immigrants to adjust to urban life by finding them jobs, easing their troubles with the law, building them playgrounds and public baths, and attending their weddings and wakes.... Because his feuds with fellow Irish chieftains like John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, Patrick Kennedy, and Martin Lomasney were legendary, he tried as mayor to centralize patronage and make the ward healer obsolete. During the depression he used federal relief and work projects as a tool of his political ambitions. But Curley never built a really solid organization in Boston and never enjoyed the power or statewide influence of other well-known urban bosses. <ref>Kenneth T. Jackson, \"Curley, James Michael,\" in John A. Garraty, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Biography'' (1974) pp 246-247.</ref>\n====Depression and World War II====\n\n\nDuring [[World War II]], there was an outbreak of [[antisemitic]] violence in Boston. Jewish residents, businesses, and synagogues were frequent targets of what would now be called [[hate crimes]]: gangs of mostly Irish Catholic youths, incited by [[Father Coughlin]] and the [[Christian Front (United States)|Christian Front]], roamed the streets of Jewish neighborhoods, vandalizing property and assaulting residents. Several victims were seriously injured with [[Baton (law enforcement)|blackjacks]] and [[brass knuckles]]. Boston's predominantly Irish police, politicians, and clergy were of little help, and the local press largely ignored the problem.<ref>Norwood (2003), p. 233; O'Connor (1995), p. 204.</ref><ref>{{cite web |ref=harv |last1=Goldstein |first1=Jenny |title=Transcending Boundaries: Boston's Catholics and Jews, 1929\u20131965 |website=Boston College Center for Christian-Jewish Learning |date=2001 |url=http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/research_sites/cjl/texts/cjrelations/resources/articles/goldstein.htm }}</ref> Mayor Curley once proudly proclaimed Boston \"the strongest Coughlin city in the world.\" Another Irish Catholic, [[Frances Sweeney]], led protests against the Christian Front and similar groups.<ref>Currier (1944), p. 427.</ref>\n\nDespite Coughlin's popularity with Boston's Irish Catholics, South Boston residents overwhelmingly voted against [[William Lemke]], Coughlin's candidate in the 1936 presidential election.<ref>Stack, quoted in O'Connor (1981), p. 650.</ref>\n\n====Exodus to the suburbs====\n[[File:Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn.jpg|thumb|left|Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] and Mayor [[Raymond L. Flynn]], ca. 1984.]]\n\nBoston's politics changed after the war. [[New Deal]] legislation and federal programs such as the [[G.I. Bill]] made the local patronage system obsolete. Mayor [[John Hynes (politician)|John Hynes]] got along better with business leaders than Curley had, while [[Cardinal Cushing]] reached out to other religious communities. The election of president [[John F. Kennedy]] was a source of great pride to Boston's Irish Americans, and marked a turning point in their \"political consciousness\". A succession of Irish mayors&mdash;Hynes, [[John F. Collins]], and [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]]&mdash;pushed urban renewal projects that contributed to [[gentrification]]. As immigrant families assimilated and their children moved to the suburbs, Boston's neighborhoods began to lose their ethnic identities.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 212, 216, 226-227.</ref>\n\nIrish Americans in Boston responded with alarm to news reports of the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], some raising funds for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. IRA supporters in the U.S. tended to be politically far to the right of the IRA members themselves. In the early 1970s [[Bernadette Devlin]] offended IRA supporters in Boston when she said she felt more comfortable with black people in Roxbury than she did with the Irish in South Boston.<ref>{{cite web |website=PBS |title=The IRA and Sinn Fein: America and the Conflict |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ira/reports/america.html }}</ref> Boston's Irish Catholics tended to be [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], with little interest in the [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights]], [[anti-Vietnam War]], and [[feminist]] movements.<ref>O'Connor (1995), p. 293.</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, many of Boston's Irish-American residents became embroiled in the [[Boston busing desegregation|busing controversy]]. To combat the ''[[de facto]]'' segregation of Boston's public schools, federal judge [[W. Arthur Garrity Jr.]] ruled that students must be bused between predominantly white and black areas of the city. [[South Boston High School]] was the site of many of the most vocal and violent protests.<ref>{{cite web |website=WBUR News |title='It Was Like A War Zone': Busing in Boston |date=September 4, 2014 |url=http://www.wbur.org/news/2014/09/05/boston-busing-anniversary }}</ref> Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] supported Garrity's ruling, while [[Ray Flynn]], then serving on the state legislature representing South Boston, opposed it. The plan ultimately led to an increase in the [[High school dropouts|dropout]] rate and a wave of [[white flight]] to the suburbs and private schools. Meanwhile, local crime boss [[Whitey Bulger]] took advantage of the chaos and tightened his grip on South Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schusterinstituteinvestigations.org/southies-lost-generation |website=Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University |last1=MacDonald |authorlink=Michael Patrick MacDonald |first1=Michael Patrick |title=Whitey Bulger, Boston Busing, and Southie's Lost Generation |date=2014}}</ref> Irish American public figures were prominent on both sides of the issue, and surveys during the 1960s and 1970s found Irish Americans divided on the issue. Although many Irish Americans opposed busing, as a group they were more sympathetic to the aims of the civil rights movement than most other white ethnic groups in the country.<ref>Meagher (2007), pp. 638-639.</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston (GLIB) was barred from marching in the city-sponsored [[South Boston#St. Patrick's Day Parade|St. Patrick's Day parade]] in South Boston.

The Catholic Church with its tradition of [[pastoral care]] played an especially important role in the lives of the poor. While Protestant and secular charitable organizations offered various forms of assistance, they often discriminated or [[Proselytism|proselytized]]. To avoid this, Catholics built orphanages (the St. Vincent Female Orphan Asylum and the Home for Destitute Catholic Children), homes for wayward teens (House of the Angel Guardian and House of the Good Shepherd), a foundling home (St. Mary's Infant Asylum), two homeless shelters ([[Working Boys Home]] and Working Girls' Home), and a Catholic hospital (Carney Hospital). The Catholic [[St. Vincent de Paul Society]] offered food, shelter, clothing, and counseling. One parish, St. Francis de Sales in Charlestown, issued food stamps.<ref>Ryan (1979) pp. 4-13.</ref> In response to bias and proselytism in Protestant-dominated schools, Boston's Irish Catholics built Catholic schools. By 1917, they had established 29 elementary schools, four high schools, four academies, and one college ([[Boston College]]).<ref>Ryan (1979), p. 77.</ref>\n\nThe first New England native to be ordained to the Catholic priesthood was [[John Thayer (priest)|John Thayer]], a Boston-born [[Congregationalist]] minister who converted to Catholicism in 1783. Thayer started the first Catholic congregation in Boston in 1790, ministering to French and Irish immigrants; eventually he moved to [[Limerick, Ireland]], where he lived the rest of his life. The first church built in Boston for Catholics was the [[Holy Cross Church, Boston|Holy Cross Church]] on Franklin Street, designed by [[Charles Bulfinch]] and built in 1803; it was demolished in 1862 and replaced by the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross (Boston)|Holy Cross Cathedral]].

As [[Cardinal Cushing]] wrote, however, not all the hostility hurled at Irish immigrants was hurled at them as Catholics; \"some of it was a new chapter in the old quarrels between England and Ireland.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Boston Globe |title=150 Years of the Boston Archdiocese |last1=Cushing |first1=Richard |authorlink=Richard Cushing |date=October 19, 1958 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/845675791.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+19%2C+1958&author=Cushing%2C+Richard&pub=Daily+Boston+Globe+%281928-1960%29&desc=150+Years+of+The+%27Our+Forefathers+Boston+Archdiocese |url-access=subscription }}</ref> This makes it difficult in some cases to say which form of bias was most in evidence. In 1806, for example, two Irish Catholics from Boston, [[Dominic Daley]] and [[James Halligan (1778\u20131806)|James Halligan]], were convicted of murder on flimsy evidence and hanged; and while it is generally agreed that the jury was biased against them, it is impossible to say whether French Catholics in their position, or any outsiders for that matter, would have suffered the same fate. Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] officially exonerated both men on St. Patrick's Day, 1984.<ref>{{cite web |website=Historic Northampton |title=The Daley & Halligan Bicentennial Commemoration |url=http://www.historic-northampton.org/daleyandhalligan/daleyandhalligan.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1837, the same year as the [[Broad Street Riot]], Irish Bostonians formed their own volunteer militia company, one of ten that made up the infantry regiment of the Boston Brigade. The [[Montgomery Guards]] were named for [[Richard Montgomery]], an Irish-born general who served in the [[Continental Army]]; their [[:File:Montgomery Guards Hat.jpg|emblem]] depicted an American eagle alighting on an [[Irish harp]]. Their efforts had the blessing of city officials and the governor, and the local press applauded their public spirit. After the annual Fall Muster on Boston Common, however, when the green-clad Montgomery Guards marched across town to their armory at [[Dock Square (Boston)|Dock Square]], hostile crowds pelted them with bottles and rocks, and thousands of rioters surrounded the armory, threatening to break down the doors. The company was forced to disband for public safety reasons.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 49-52.</ref>\n\nThe Irish who arrived during the famine years were among the poorest and least welcome immigrants in Boston. In 1850, a group of African Americans living on Elm Street signed a petition to keep the Irish out of their neighborhood.<ref>Ryan (1979), p. 150.</ref> Advertisements for domestic servants sometimes stipulated \"a Protestant woman\", implying that an Irish Protestant would be acceptable; others specifically warned, \"no Irish need apply\".<ref>See \"No Irish Need Apply\" in James Patrick Byrne, Philip Coleman, and Jason Francis King, eds.

Vol. 3'' (ABC-CLIO, 2008) pp 680-83.</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, Irish Bostonians found that the prejudice against them had lessened somewhat. The Massachusetts legislature repealed the law requiring a two-year waiting period before new citizens could vote, and passed a bill effectively declaring that Catholic students could no longer be compelled to read from the King James Bible. Soon afterwards, city officials announced that patients at Boston City Hospital could be attended by the clergy of their choice. By that time, however, the damage had been done; according to historian [[Thomas H. O'Connor]], the bitter hostilities of the 19th century had created divisions that lasted well into the 20th.<ref>O'Connor (1995), pp. 93-94.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nPeople of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent form the largest single [[Irish American|ethnic group]] in Boston, making up 15.8% of the population as of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/13_5YR/B04001/1600000US2507000 |title=American FactFinder |publisher=United States Census |access-date=2015-09-16 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213114825/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/13_5YR/B04001/1600000US2507000 |archive-date=2020-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As of 2014, Irish Americans made up 22.8% of the population of the metropolitan Boston area&mdash;the highest percentage of any of the 50 most populous U.S. cities&mdash;and 21.5% of the population of Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Boston Globe |title=Just How Irish is Boston? |date=March 17, 2016 |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/03/17/just-how-irish-boston/aTIo00BOP5Nyw6WdHAgXSI/story.html}}</ref> Many cities and towns on the [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|South Shore of Massachusetts]] have high percentages of Irish-descended residents.

It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] starts collecting [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]'s mail (he calls it \"black guy mail\") while the latter is out of town. After looking through one of Cleveland's magazines devoted to mustaches, Peter decides to grow one. It quickly becomes his most prized possession, and he pretends that it gives him special abilities; for instance, convinced he can now speak Italian, he angers an Italian butcher with his mock Italian gibberish.\n\nPeter and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] walk past McBurgertown and it's on fire. Firefighters notice Peter's mustache and give him a fire hose. Peter is reluctant to risk injury rescuing a man trapped in the building, but rationalizes \"With great mustache comes great responsibility.\" He rescues the manager from the fire, but is devastated that his mustache has been burned off. The manager later visits the Griffins to thank Peter with a lifetime supply of burgers. At the grand re-opening, Peter drowns his sense of loss with 30 burgers, causing a [[stroke]] that paralyzes the left half of his body.\n\nUnhappy about the pace of his recovery, Peter walks into a [[stem cell research]] center; he is cured of his stroke damage in only five minutes. Peter then tries to sue McBurgertown for causing his stroke. Brian points out that it was Peter's own fault for overindulging. Peter loses the trial because the company has more lawyers, he offered the judge a cheap bribe, and because he has no evidence that McBurgertown was at fault.\n\nStill wanting revenge, Peter drags Brian to the corporate headquarters. Peter claims that he and Brian are wealthy [[Asia]]n businessmen and asks for a tour. The company grants his request. Looking for evidence of wrongdoing that he can use, Peter asks about a room labeled \"restricted\". The tour guide says that room is off-limits, then excuses himself for a 30-minute bathroom break. Peter breaks his word that he would not go in the room, and finds that it is a slaughterhouse. Peter and Brian befriend a talking genetically-engineered cow who describes the horrors the company has inflicted. Brian offers a deal to set the cow free in exchange for the cow's help exposing McBurgertown. Realizing that Peter and Brian broke their promise, the tour guide sends two security men after them.\n\nFleeing the building in a madcap chase set to [[The Monkees]]' \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\", the cow reveals McBurgertown's practices and the bad health effects of its food to the media. The company suffers a blow from which it might not recover. The cow thanks Peter for helping.\n\nIn the [[B story]], [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and Brian wager that Stewie can disguise himself as a [[high school|high-schooler]] and become the most popular kid in less than a week. Using the name \"Zac Sawyer\", Stewie easily wins over Connie D'Amico and her clique, winning the bet. Connie and \"Zac\" drive to Anal Point to have sex, but Connie laughs at the size of his [[penis]] and drives off. The next day at school, Stewie is ostracized by everyone for his \"baby penis\". Stewie concedes defeat and asks Connie for one last kiss. When Connie's eyes are closed, Stewie takes off his clothes and kisses her. He loudly accuses her as a [[pedophile]] and she is arrested immediately by school security.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|right|140px|thumb|alt=A man with black short hair and a black shirt, with tan skin, laughs into a microphone while leaning forward.|[[Seth MacFarlane]] did not participate in the post-production of the episode.]]\n\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]], who has been with the show since its [[Family Guy (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref name=ya/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/petarded/episode/17739/castcrew;_ylt=ApqUwltmQ..ERF8wJh8qBou9v9EF|title=Family Guy: Petarded|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109002623/https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/petarded/episode/17739/castcrew |archivedate=2007-01-09}}</ref> It was directed by [[Brian Iles]], who would direct the episode \"[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]\" later this season.<ref name=ya>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/mcstroke/episode/157506;_ylt=Aj0yzAdZjYuZ6igH69L.9xG9v9EF|title=Family Guy: McStroke|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/back-to-the-woods/episode/161341/castcrew;_ylt=AtX213WuR0YvUFb3PmFlJmS9v9EF|title=Family Guy: Back to the Woods|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and James Purdun acted as supervising directors for the episode.<ref name=ya/>\n\nThis is one of the episodes of ''Family Guy'' that was released after the show's creator, [[Seth MacFarlane]], joined the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007\u2013present)|Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref name= tvs/> MacFarlane participated in the writing process and did record the voices of the characters he normally plays for the episode, but he did not approve or participate in any post-production done to the episode.<ref name= tvs/>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, actors [[Camille Guaty]], Denis Martel, [[Ted McGinley]] and [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] guest starred in the episode (Montalb\u00e1n would one year later guest star in the episode \"[[Moon Over Isla Island]]\" on MacFarlane's other show, ''[[American Dad]]'').<ref name=ya/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/family-guy-2008/episode-9-season-6/mcstroke/100148|title=Family Guy Episode: \"McStroke\"|magazine=TV Guide|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}</ref> Recurring voice actors [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Ralph Garman]], writer [[Mark Hentemann]], writer [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], writer [[Alec Sulkin]], [[Lisa Wilhoit]] and writer [[John Viener]] made minor appearances in the episode.<ref name=ya/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe episode featured various references to the popular culture.

Another suggestion is that it is from the word \"Jalpai\" meaning olive, and \"Guri\" meaning a place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raha|first=Manis Kumar|title=Matriliny to Patriliny: A Study of the Rabha Society|year=1989|publisher=Gian Publishing House|page=22}}</ref> The city once had many olive trees.\n\n== History ==\n{{further|Raikat}}\n\nThe [[Raikat]] family controlled large estates in [[Baikunthapur Forest|Baikunthapur]], now a part of [[West Bengal]], first as subjects to the state of [[Koch Bihar]], later as [[Zamindars]] to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers of [[Bengal]], and then to the [[British Raj|British]]. The Raikat family is descended from the [[Koch dynasty]], who took control of the [[Kamata Kingdom]] in 1515. The family founder was Sisya Singha, elder brother of Viswa Singha, the second Koch Maharajah. At Viswa Singha's coronation in 1523, Sisya Singha held the royal umbrella atop the crown, a sign of [[vassal]]age. Sisya Singha was given the title \"Raikat\" or \"family guardian\", and his descendants were hereditary prime ministers of the [[Koch Bihar]] successor state to the Kamata kingdom. They were given the land of Baikunthapur in the present [[Jalpaiguri district]] of West Bengal.<ref>[http://coochbehar.nic.in/Htmfiles/history_book.html Cooch Behar: Royal History : Book of Facts and Events], Chapter 1, p. 5</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nJalpaiguri is located at {{coord|26.52|N|88.73|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/28/Jalpaiguri.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Jalpaiguri, India|work=fallingrain.com}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 75 metres (246 feet).Jalpaiguri lies in the middle of the vast fertile plains ([[Terai]]) south of the Himalayas, watered by innumerable rivers and rivulets rising from and flowing down the Himalayas.

Another suggestion is that it is from the word \"Jalpai\" meaning olive, and \"Guri\" meaning a place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raha|first=Manis Kumar|title=Matriliny to Patriliny: A Study of the Rabha Society|year=1989|publisher=Gian Publishing House|page=22}}</ref> The city once had many olive trees.\n\n== History ==\n{{further|Raikat}}\n\nThe [[Raikat]] family controlled large estates in [[Baikunthapur Forest|Baikunthapur]], now a part of [[West Bengal]], first as subjects to the state of [[Koch Bihar]], later as [[Zamindars]] to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers of [[Bengal]], and then to the [[British Raj|British]]. The Raikat family is descended from the [[Koch dynasty]], who took control of the [[Kamata Kingdom]] in 1515. The family founder was Sisya Singha, elder brother of Viswa Singha, the second Koch Maharajah. At Viswa Singha's coronation in 1523, Sisya Singha held the royal umbrella atop the crown, a sign of [[vassal]]age. Sisya Singha was given the title \"Raikat\" or \"family guardian\", and his descendants were hereditary prime ministers of the [[Koch Bihar]] successor state to the Kamata kingdom. They were given the land of Baikunthapur in the present [[Jalpaiguri district]] of West Bengal.<ref>[http://coochbehar.nic.in/Htmfiles/history_book.html Cooch Behar: Royal History : Book of Facts and Events], Chapter 1, p. 5</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nJalpaiguri is located at {{coord|26.52|N|88.73|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/28/Jalpaiguri.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Jalpaiguri, India|work=fallingrain.com}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 75 metres (246 feet).Jalpaiguri lies in the middle of the vast fertile plains ([[Terai]]) south of the Himalayas, watered by innumerable rivers and rivulets rising from and flowing down the Himalayas.

Anne Seller, one of the Greenham women, remarked in article that the local pubs around Greenham refused to serve the women. She said that dissenters would often meet there to think of ways to disturb the protest. Seller noted that \"vigilante groups\" would form to attack the women at the base. These actions made many of the Greenham women afraid to venture into the town.{{Sfn|Seller|1985|p=29}}\n\nThe local police were also not entirely friendly toward the Greenham women. Officers would often release Greenham women from arrest in the middle of the night. If the women were driven back to the base, they would often be dropped off far from any established camp, and be forced to walk long distances to get back to the protest.{{Sfn|Seller|1985|p=29}}\n\nThe Ministry of Defence called for an increased police presence at the base. They justified this on the grounds that terrorists might be trying to infiltrate the base, pretending to be Greenham protesters. To the Greenham women, this was seen as another attempt to infringe on their protest.{{Sfn|Seller|1985|p=29}}\n\n== Protest strategies ==\nThe women at Greenham used actions, posters, and songs to protest against the nuclear missiles and gain attention.\n\nThe first protest action undertaken at Greenham involved women chaining themselves to the fence of the base in September 1981. The most well-known protest actions that the Greenham women undertook were the ''Embrace the Base'' event and their human chain protests. At ''Embrace the Base'', 30,000 women held hands around the perimeter fence. In April 1983, the Greenham women and their supporters created a 14-mile human chain. In December of that year, another human chain was created, circling around the fence, while some parts of the fence were cut.<ref name=\"NatArchive43\"/>{{Sfn|Kissed|1984|p=}} In at least once instance, the women dressed as witches and attempted to cut down the base's fence.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=58}}\n\nThe Greenham women would often 'keen'. They would dress in black, and say that they were mourning for children who would be lost to nuclear war in the future.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Greenham Common: Women at the Wire|last=Burton|date=1984|publisher=Women's Press|others=|isbn=978-0704339262|editor-last=Harford|editor-first=Barbara|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/greenhamcommonwo00harf/page/15 15]|oclc=12669725|editor-last2=Hopkins|editor-first2=Sarah|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/greenhamcommonwo00harf/page/15}}</ref>\n\nPosters were used by the women at Greenham, and often featured the symbol of a spider web, meant to symbolise the fragility and perseverance of the Greenham women.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=|pp=40-41}}\n\nSinging was another protest strategy used by the Greenham women. Popular songs were sometimes used with their lyrics rewritten to support the anti-nuclear cause. Some of the songs were original, written by the women of the camps.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=24}} In 1988, \"Greenham Women Are Everywhere\", the official songbook of the camp, was published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aldermaston.net/sites/default/files/Greenham%20Songbook1.pdf|title=Greenham Women Are Everywhere - Songs|website=aldermaston.net}}</ref>\n\n==Importance of gender==\n[[File:Embracing the base, Greenham Common December 1982 - geograph.org.uk - 759090.jpg|thumb|On 12 December 1982, 30,000 women held hands around the {{convert|6|mi|km}} perimeter of the base, in protest against the decision to site American [[cruise missiles]] there]]In February 1982 it was decided that the protest should involve women only.<ref name=\"Kidron2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/yourgreenham/chronology/0,,2071806,00.html|title=Your Greenham Chronology|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> This was important as the women were using their identity as mothers to legitimise the protest against nuclear weapons, all in the name of the safety of their children and future generations.{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}}\n\nThe spider web became one of the most-used symbols at the camp, because it is both fragile and resilient, as the Greenham women envisioned themselves.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=|pp=40-41}} The Greenham women were notorious for dressing themselves up as witches,{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=58}} in order to contrast the symbol of the evil witch with the actions of ordinary women at the base.\n\nThere were several instances when women entered the camp, thus entering \"male\" space. On New Year's Eve 1982, the women broke into the base for the first time; 44 women climbed over the military base's fence and climbed on top of the silos and danced around on them for hours.  All the women were arrested, and 36 were imprisoned.<ref name=\"Kidron2\" /> On 1 April 1983, 200 women entered the base dressed as teddy bears.<ref name=\"Kidron2\" /> A \"child\" symbol like the teddy bear was a stark contrast to the highly militarised atmosphere of the base; the women again were highlighting the safety of their children and future generations of children.{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}}\n\nThe next major event was 'Reflect the Base' on 11 December 1983, when 50,000 women circled the base to protest against the cruise missiles which had arrived three weeks earlier.<ref name=\"Kidron2\" /> The day started as a silent vigil where women held up mirrors as to allow the base to symbolically look back at itself and its actions; however, the day ended with hundreds of arrests as the women pulled down large sections of the fence.<ref name=\"Kidron2\" />\n\nUpon breaching the barriers and entering the base, the women were making the statement that they would not stay at home and do nothing, as women are traditionally expected to do while the men take care of the serious \"male\" issues.{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}} Their refusal to go home at the end of each day was a challenge against the traditional notion that a woman's place was in the home. Many media outlets even questioned the behaviour of the Greenham women: if their children were so important to them, they asked, then why were they not home with them?{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}} The media tended to ignore the Greenham women's collective identity of \"women as mothers\" protecting the children and largely focused on the illegitimacy of the camp, describing it as a witches' coven laden with criminal activity, with the women posing a threat to family values and the state.{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}} One such part of the protest that the media ignored took place on 12 December 1982, where women hung pictures of their children on the fence. The idea surrounding this particular event was to hang representations of things the women loved on the fence; to many, this meant hanging pictures of their children.{{Sfn|Seller|1985|p=31}}\n\n==Related movements: ''Window Peace''==\nThe Greenham Common Women\u2019s Peace Camp inspired related peace movements in the U.K. as well as abroad.

Camps were named after the colours of the rainbow, as a way of contrasting against the green shades of the base.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=44}} The first camp was called Yellow Gate, and others included Blue Gate with its [[New Age]] focus; Violet Gate with a religious focus; and Green Gate, which was women-only and did not accept male visitors.<ref name=\"NatArchive43\"/>[[File:Helen Thomas Memorial Peace Garden - geograph.org.uk - 29252.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Helen Thomas at Greenham.]]The last missiles left the base in 1991 as a result of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]], but the camp remained in place until 2000, after protesters won the right to house a memorial on the site.{{Sfn|The Guardian|2000|p=}} Although the missiles had been removed from the base, the camp was continued as part of the protest against the forthcoming [[UK Trident programme]].

There are seven standing stones encircling the 'Flame' sculpture representing a camp fire. Next to this there is a stone and steel spiral sculpture, engraved with the words \"You can't kill the Spirit.\"{{Sfn|BBC News|2014|p=}} There is also a plaque there for activist [[Helen Thomas (activist)|Helen Wyn Thomas]] who was killed near the site.<ref name=\"site2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenhamwpc.org.uk/historic.htm|title=Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp Commemorative & Historic Site|last=Hipperson|first=Sarah|website=Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp}}</ref> The site has since been given to the Greenham Common Trust to care for.{{Sfn|BBC News|2014|p=}}\n\n=== Dissent against the Peace Camp ===\nIt was well-known among the Greenham women that their actions and presence were not entirely welcome. Anne Seller, one of the Greenham women, remarked in article that the local pubs around Greenham refused to serve the women. She said that dissenters would often meet there to think of ways to disturb the protest. Seller noted that \"vigilante groups\" would form to attack the women at the base. These actions made many of the Greenham women afraid to venture into the town.{{Sfn|Seller|1985|p=29}}\n\nThe local police were also not entirely friendly toward the Greenham women. Officers would often release Greenham women from arrest in the middle of the night. If the women were driven back to the base, they would often be dropped off far from any established camp, and be forced to walk long distances to get back to the protest.{{Sfn|Seller|1985|p=29}}\n\nThe Ministry of Defence called for an increased police presence at the base. They justified this on the grounds that terrorists might be trying to infiltrate the base, pretending to be Greenham protesters. To the Greenham women, this was seen as another attempt to infringe on their protest.{{Sfn|Seller|1985|p=29}}\n\n== Protest strategies ==\nThe women at Greenham used actions, posters, and songs to protest against the nuclear missiles and gain attention.\n\nThe first protest action undertaken at Greenham involved women chaining themselves to the fence of the base in September 1981. The most well-known protest actions that the Greenham women undertook were the ''Embrace the Base'' event and their human chain protests. At ''Embrace the Base'', 30,000 women held hands around the perimeter fence. In April 1983, the Greenham women and their supporters created a 14-mile human chain. In December of that year, another human chain was created, circling around the fence, while some parts of the fence were cut.<ref name=\"NatArchive43\"/>{{Sfn|Kissed|1984|p=}} In at least once instance, the women dressed as witches and attempted to cut down the base's fence.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=58}}\n\nThe Greenham women would often 'keen'. They would dress in black, and say that they were mourning for children who would be lost to nuclear war in the future.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Greenham Common: Women at the Wire|last=Burton|date=1984|publisher=Women's Press|others=|isbn=978-0704339262|editor-last=Harford|editor-first=Barbara|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/greenhamcommonwo00harf/page/15 15]|oclc=12669725|editor-last2=Hopkins|editor-first2=Sarah|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/greenhamcommonwo00harf/page/15}}</ref>\n\nPosters were used by the women at Greenham, and often featured the symbol of a spider web, meant to symbolise the fragility and perseverance of the Greenham women.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=|pp=40-41}}\n\nSinging was another protest strategy used by the Greenham women. Popular songs were sometimes used with their lyrics rewritten to support the anti-nuclear cause. Some of the songs were original, written by the women of the camps.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=24}} In 1988, \"Greenham Women Are Everywhere\", the official songbook of the camp, was published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aldermaston.net/sites/default/files/Greenham%20Songbook1.pdf|title=Greenham Women Are Everywhere - Songs|website=aldermaston.net}}</ref>\n\n==Importance of gender==\n[[File:Embracing the base, Greenham Common December 1982 - geograph.org.uk - 759090.jpg|thumb|On 12 December 1982, 30,000 women held hands around the {{convert|6|mi|km}} perimeter of the base, in protest against the decision to site American [[cruise missiles]] there]]In February 1982 it was decided that the protest should involve women only.<ref name=\"Kidron2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/yourgreenham/chronology/0,,2071806,00.html|title=Your Greenham Chronology|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> This was important as the women were using their identity as mothers to legitimise the protest against nuclear weapons, all in the name of the safety of their children and future generations.{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}}\n\nThe spider web became one of the most-used symbols at the camp, because it is both fragile and resilient, as the Greenham women envisioned themselves.{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=|pp=40-41}} The Greenham women were notorious for dressing themselves up as witches,{{Sfn|Fairhall|2006|p=58}} in order to contrast the symbol of the evil witch with the actions of ordinary women at the base.\n\nThere were several instances when women entered the camp, thus entering \"male\" space. On New Year's Eve 1982, the women broke into the base for the first time; 44 women climbed over the military base's fence and climbed on top of the silos and danced around on them for hours.  All the women were arrested, and 36 were imprisoned.<ref name=\"Kidron2\" /> On 1 April 1983, 200 women entered the base dressed as teddy bears.<ref name=\"Kidron2\" /> A \"child\" symbol like the teddy bear was a stark contrast to the highly militarised atmosphere of the base; the women again were highlighting the safety of their children and future generations of children.{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}}\n\nThe next major event was 'Reflect the Base' on 11 December 1983, when 50,000 women circled the base to protest against the cruise missiles which had arrived three weeks earlier.<ref name=\"Kidron2\" /> The day started as a silent vigil where women held up mirrors as to allow the base to symbolically look back at itself and its actions; however, the day ended with hundreds of arrests as the women pulled down large sections of the fence.<ref name=\"Kidron2\" />\n\nUpon breaching the barriers and entering the base, the women were making the statement that they would not stay at home and do nothing, as women are traditionally expected to do while the men take care of the serious \"male\" issues.{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}} Their refusal to go home at the end of each day was a challenge against the traditional notion that a woman's place was in the home. Many media outlets even questioned the behaviour of the Greenham women: if their children were so important to them, they asked, then why were they not home with them?{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}} The media tended to ignore the Greenham women's collective identity of \"women as mothers\" protecting the children and largely focused on the illegitimacy of the camp, describing it as a witches' coven laden with criminal activity, with the women posing a threat to family values and the state.{{Sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=}} One such part of the protest that the media ignored took place on 12 December 1982, where women hung pictures of their children on the fence. The idea surrounding this particular event was to hang representations of things the women loved on the fence; to many, this meant hanging pictures of their children.{{Sfn|Seller|1985|p=31}}\n\n==Related movements: ''Window Peace''==\nThe Greenham Common Women\u2019s Peace Camp inspired related peace movements in the U.K. as well as abroad.

The chronicle was dedicated to the [[Abbot of Cluny]], [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]]. Today a few manuscripts of the ''Historiarum'' survive, including the author's original copy. \n\nAs a second work, Rodulfus wrote a biography of Volpiano, which probably arose shortly after his death in 1031. That year, he moved to the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre]]. The monks at St-Germain got him to restore or compose the inscriptions on the numerous altars in their church, and on the tombs of the saints who were buried in it. When this was done his wanderings began again, and he went to Cluny.<ref name=MacErlean/>\n\nHe died at Cluny around 1050.<ref name=MacErlean/>\n\n\nGlaber is credited with coining the phrase \"white mantle of churches\", describing the ubiquity of religious architecture of the times.\n\n==Works==\nGlaber is best known for ''Historiarum'', which he is believed to have started writing during his time at the Abbey of Cluny around 1026 or so, and completed at [[Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre]] some time later. Initially intended to be an ecclesiastical history, Glaber's focus is on events in the center of France, but occasionally ranges as far as [[Scotland]] and [[Southern Italy]].\n\nGlaber's writings often sympathized with proponents of church reform of that age, including [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], and [[Robert II of France]], while criticizing others like [[Conrad II]], and [[Pope Benedict IX]]. As a source of events, the work is of limited value due to its chronological and geographic inadequacy, but it is significant as a cultural history document for morality and customs of the 11th century.\n\nHe also wrote a [[hagiography]] of [[William of Volpiano]], the ''Vita Sancti Guillelmi Abbatis Divionensis.''\n\nLarge extracts from his works are cited and discussed in ''The Year 1000'', by French author [[Georges Duby]]. ''Historiarum'' was first published in 1596 from a manuscript owned by [[Pierre Pithou]], as part of a collection of eleven medieval chronicles.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Historiae-Francorum-Christi-MCCLXXXV-scriptores/dp/1130597431 (facsimile reprint of 1596 edition)</ref><ref>Included in ''Rodulfi Glabri Historiarum Libri Quinque'' by Rodulfus Glaber (Oxford, 1989) {{ISBN|9780198222415}}.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{catholic|title=Raoul Glaber}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite web\n|last=Raoul Glaber\n|title=Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, fonds lat., ms. 5390, ff.222r-230r\n|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9068454c/f223.item\n|work=Vita Domni VVillelmi Abbatis primi Fiscannensis [Life of Sir William the first Abbot of F\u00e9camp] (11th century)\n|ref=Vita\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Rodulfi Glabri Historiarum Libri Quinque'' by Rodulfus Glaber, The Five Books of the Histories [cover title: ''Rodulfus Glaber, Opera''] ed.

There he met the reform-minded cleric from [[Piedmont]], Abbot [[William of Volpiano]].<ref name=MacErlean>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06574b.htm MacErlean, Andrew. \"Raoul Glaber.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 25 June 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref> In 1028 he traveled to Italy with Volpiano, who encouraged him write what would become his masterpiece, the ''Historiarum libri quinque ab anno incarnationis DCCCC usque ad annum MXLIV'' (\"History in five books from 900 AD to 1044 AD\"). The chronicle was dedicated to the [[Abbot of Cluny]], [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]]. Today a few manuscripts of the ''Historiarum'' survive, including the author's original copy. \n\nAs a second work, Rodulfus wrote a biography of Volpiano, which probably arose shortly after his death in 1031. That year, he moved to the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre]]. The monks at St-Germain got him to restore or compose the inscriptions on the numerous altars in their church, and on the tombs of the saints who were buried in it. When this was done his wanderings began again, and he went to Cluny.<ref name=MacErlean/>\n\nIn died at Cluny around 1050.<ref name=MacErlean/>\n\n\nGlaber is credited with coining the phrase \"white mantle of churches\", describing the ubiquity of religious architecture of the times.\n\n==Works==\nGlaber is best known for ''Historiarum'', which he is believed to have started writing during his time at the Abbey of Cluny around 1026 or so, and completed at [[Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre]] some time later. Initially intended to be an ecclesiastical history, Glaber's focus is on events in the center of France, but occasionally ranges as far as [[Scotland]] and [[Southern Italy]].\n\nGlaber's writings often sympathized with proponents of church reform of that age, including [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], and [[Robert II of France]], while criticizing others like [[Conrad II]], and [[Pope Benedict IX]]. As a source of events, the work is of limited value due to its chronological and geographic inadequacy, but it is significant as a cultural history document for morality and customs of the 11th century.\n\nHe also wrote a [[hagiography]] of [[William of Volpiano]], the ''Vita Sancti Guillelmi Abbatis Divionensis.''\n\nLarge extracts from his works are cited and discussed in ''The Year 1000'', by French author [[Georges Duby]]. ''Historiarum'' was first published in 1596 from a manuscript owned by [[Pierre Pithou]], as part of a collection of eleven medieval chronicles.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Historiae-Francorum-Christi-MCCLXXXV-scriptores/dp/1130597431 (facsimile reprint of 1596 edition)</ref><ref>Included in ''Rodulfi Glabri Historiarum Libri Quinque'' by Rodulfus Glaber (Oxford, 1989) {{ISBN|9780198222415}}.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{catholic|title=Raoul Glaber}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite web\n|last=Raoul Glaber\n|title=Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, fonds lat., ms. 5390, ff.222r-230r\n|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9068454c/f223.item\n|work=Vita Domni VVillelmi Abbatis primi Fiscannensis [Life of Sir William the first Abbot of F\u00e9camp] (11th century)\n|ref=Vita\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Rodulfi Glabri Historiarum Libri Quinque'' by Rodulfus Glaber, The Five Books of the Histories [cover title: ''Rodulfus Glaber, Opera''] ed.
