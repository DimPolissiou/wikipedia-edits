The fire complex began as two separate fires, the '''Bear Butte Fire''' and the '''Booth Fire'''.  The two fires were reported on the same day and eventually burned together, forming a single fire area that stretched along the crest of the [[Cascade Mountains]] between [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]] and [[Mount Washington (Oregon)|Mount Washington]].  On the western side of the Cascades, the fire consumed mostly [[Douglas-fir]] and [[western hemlock]].  On the eastern side of the mountains, the fire burned mostly [[Ponderosa pine]], [[lodgepole pine]], and [[jack pine]].  Most of the burned area was on public land administered by the [[United States Forest Service]] including {{convert|40,419|acre|km2}} within the [[Mount Jefferson Wilderness]].  The fire also burned forest land on the [[Warm Springs Indian Reservation]] and small areas of state and private land.  Firefighters battled the blaze for 34 days.   At the peak of the firefighting effort, there were over 2,300 personnel working on the fire. Although the cost of fire suppression was over $38 million, no lives were lost and no homes burned as the fire was largely in wilderness areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2018/09/27/oregon-wildfires-b-b-complex-explosion-cascade-mountains/1374656002/|title=Fifteen years ago, a titanic wildfire in Oregon's Cascade Mountains forever changed how we view wildfires|last=Urness|first=Zach|date=2018-09-27|website=[Salem, OR] Statesman Journal|language=en|access-date=2019-07-22}}</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\nThe weather in the central Cascade Mountains in the area where the B&B Complex Fires occurred is highly seasonal and heavily influenced by local [[topography]].

The Bear Butte Fire was reported in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness.  Heavy winds prevented [[smoke jumper]]s from reaching the fire; however, a helicopter dropped water on it throughout the day.  By the end of the day, the fire had burned approximately {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} at the north end of the wilderness area and on the southwest side of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation.  The Booth Fire was reported near Henkel Butte.  During the day, Forest Service crews battled the blaze with hand tools, pumper trucks, and bulldozers.  Aerial tankers also dropped retardant on the fire.  Due to heavy smoke, [[U.S. Route 20]] was closed between [[Santiam Pass]] and the [[Black Butte Ranch, Oregon|Black Butte Ranch]].  By the end of the day, the fire had consumed {{convert|1200|acre|km2}}, and it was still actively burning north of Route 20.

During the night, the Booth Fire jumped Route 20 and began burning on both sides of the highway near [[Suttle Lake (Oregon)|Suttle Lake]] and Blue Lake.  As a result, the highway remained closed.  The fire also crossed the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] heading west.  In the early afternoon of '''August 20''', the two fires were joined into a single firefighting effort, becoming the B&B Complex Fires.  During the day, the [[Governor of Oregon]] invoked the ''Conflagration Act'' allowing structural firefighters to be dispatched to Black Butte Ranch, Suttle Lake Camp Ground, Suttle Lake Resort, [[Camp Tamarack (Oregon)|Camp Tamarack]], Blue Lake properties, Santiam Pass Ski Lodge, and Hoodoo Ski Area.  These areas were all evacuated except Black Butte Ranch.  A [[Red Cross]] evacuation shelter was established at the Sisters Elementary School.

Most of the burned area was Federal land.  However, forest lands belonging to the [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]], the [[Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs]], and various private owners were also burned.<ref name=\"FS1\"/>\n\nThe burned acreage was identified as follows:\n\n* Deschutes National Forest (non-wilderness), {{convert|42248|acre|km2}}\n* Deschutes National Forest (Mount Jefferson Wilderness), {{convert|23116|acre|km2}}\n* Willamette National Forest (non-wilderness), {{convert|2739|acre|km2}}\n* Willamette National Forest (Mount Jefferson Wilderness), {{convert|17303|acre|km2}}\n* Warm Springs Confederation Tribes, {{convert|3799|acre|km2}}\n* State of Oregon, {{convert|82|acre|km2}}\n* Private land, {{convert|1089|acre|km2}}<ref name=\"FS1\"/>\n\nAfter carefully mapping the burned area, the Forest Service changed the official total of acres burned to {{convert|90769|acre|km2}}.<ref name=\"FS1\"/>  During the course of the B&B Complex Fires, there were 13 structures destroyed and 8 firefighters injured.  The total cost of the fire suppression effort was over $38.7 million.<ref name=\"ATF\"/>\n\nOn the west side of the Cascades, most of the burned forest was [[Douglas-fir]] and [[western hemlock]].  On the east side of the mountains, the fire burned mostly [[Ponderosa pine]], [[lodgepole pine]], and [[jack pine]].<ref>[http://www.orww.org/B&B_Complex/index.html \"B&B Complex\"], Oregon Websites and Watersheds Project, ''www.orww.org'', Philomath, Oregon, 2004.</ref>  The two largest [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]] trees in the United States are located in the area where the Bear Butte and Booth fires burned together, well within the fire's perimeter.  Both forest giants survived the fire, probably due to their size and thick bark.  [[Oregon Department of Forestry]] keeps track of the record trees within the state and nominates the largest to the [[National Register of Big Trees]].  The larger of the two Douglas-fir trees in the B&B burn area is {{convert|24|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}} in circumference and {{convert|114|ft|m}} tall.<ref>Johnson, Bruce B., [http://www.oregonphotos.com/B%20and%20B%20Losses.html \"The 2003 B&B Fire: Trails lost and found, forest monarchs lost and found\"], ''Oregon Photos'', ''www.oregonphotos.com'', Olympia, Washington, 18 January 2011.</ref>\n\n== Post-fire activity ==\n\nOn 5 September, the Forest Service dispatched a ''Burned Area Emergency Response Team'' to begin evaluating the rehabilitation requirement for the B&B Complex Fires.  The team consisted of [[archaeologist]]s, [[botanist]]s, [[geologist]]s, [[hydrologist]]s, [[soil science|soil scientists]], and forest engineers.  The team assessed the environmental damage caused by the fire and related fire suppression activities.  Following their report the Forest Service allocated $1.5 million for emergency stabilization and recovery of the effected area.<ref name=\"NR3\">[http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/centraloregon/news/2003/10/031002bandb.shtml \"Fire Rehabilitation Work Begins on B and B Complex\"], ''Local Area News Release'', Deschutes National Forest, United states Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Sisters, Oregon, 2 October 2003.</ref>\n\n[[File:B&B Fire Rehabilitation.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Crew rehabilitating a fire line in September 2003]]Shortly after the fire, smokejumpers and professional timber fallers cut hazard snags along Forest Service roads.  Approximately 950 fire-killed trees were removed, allowing survey teams and rehabilitation crews to safely conduct their work.<ref name=\"NR3\"/>\n\nThe next stage of the recovery work focused on high and moderate severity burn areas where there was an increased risk of runoff damage.  Special attention was given to preventing water pollution and soil degradation in the Metolius River watershed.  Forest Service crews removed fire debris from the banks of Abbot Creek, Bear Valley Creek, Bush Creek, Canyon Creek, Davis Creek, First Creek, Link Creek, and Jack Creek.  They also replaced a number of small [[culvert]]s with larger ones.  This helped minimize drainage onto roads and ensured streams were able to accommodate increases flow from surface runoff.  This was especially critical in streams with native [[bull trout]], which are a threatened species.  Crews also cleared forest recreation sites and hiking trails.  This included a project that improved drainage along {{convert|33|mi|km}} of the Pacific Crest Trail in order to reduce surface erosion.  Finally, the Forest Service posted 40 new signs warning visitors of post-fire hazards.<ref name=\"NR3\"/>\n\n[[File:B&B Complex Fires Exhibit.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Interpretive exhibit describing the B&B Fires]]Forest botanists identified fifty noxious weed sites within the fire area, covering {{convert|305|acre|km2}}.  To deal with this problem, the Deschutes National Forest implemented a program to prevent the spread of noxious weeds especially along roads, trail, and in heavy use areas.  These efforts helped encourage the return of native grasses and [[herbaceous]] shrubs throughout the burned areas.<ref name=\"NR3\"/>\n\nIn 2005, the Forest Service approved a plan for salvage [[logging]] on {{convert|6823|acre|km2}} burned by the B&B Complex Fires. The plan allowed commercial loggers to harvest trees killed by the fire. There was some criticism of the plan; however, the Forest Service determined that in the specific areas identified for post-fire timber harvest, the prescribed operations would utilize valuable timber assets, prevent the build-up of light fuels in burned areas, and help prevent soil degradation by encouraging rapid [[reforestation]].<ref>[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/7103/B%26B_Fire_Recovery_Project_ROD.pdf?sequence=1 \"Decision and Rationale for the Decision\"], ''B&B Fire Recovery Project Record of Decision'', Sisters Ranger District, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Sisters, Oregon, August 2005, pp.18-31.</ref><ref>[http://www.orww.org/B&B_Complex/Policy/index.html \"B&B Complex Policy and Management Issues\"], Oregon Websites and Watersheds Project, ''www.orww.org'', hilomath, Oregon, 2004.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, interpretive exhibits describing the B&B Complex Fires and post-fire forest recovery were installed at three locations along Route 20.

First mentioned by [[Cassius Dio]] in the context of the campaign of [[Caracalla]] of 213, the Alemanni captured the {{lang|la|[[Agri Decumates]]|italic=no}} in 260, and later expanded into present-day [[Alsace]], and northern [[Switzerland]], leading to the establishment of the [[Old High German]] language in those regions, by the eighth century named ''[[Alamannia]]''.<ref>''in pago Almanniae'' 762, ''in pago Alemannorum'' 797, ''urbs Constantia in ducatu Alemanniae'' 797; ''in ducatu Alemannico, in pago Linzgowe'' 873. From the 9th century, ''Alamannia'' is increasingly used of the [[Alsace]] specifically, while the Alamannic territory in generally is increasingly called ''[[Duchy of Swabia|Suebia]]''; by the 12th century, the name ''Suebia'' had mostly replaced ''Alamannia''.\nS. Hirzel, ''Forschungen zur Deutschen Landeskunde'' 6 (1888), p. 299.</ref>\n\nIn 496, the Alemanni were [[battle of Tolbiac|conquered]] by [[Franks|Frankish]] leader [[Clovis I|Clovis]] and incorporated into his [[Frankish Empire|dominions]].  Mentioned as still [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] allies of the [[Germanic Christianity|Christian]] Franks, the Alemanni were gradually Christianized during the seventh century. The {{lang|la|[[Lex Alamannorum]]|italic=yes}} is a record of their customary law during this period. Until the eighth century, Frankish [[suzerainty]] over Alemannia was mostly nominal. After an uprising by [[Theudebald, Duke of Alamannia]], though, [[Carloman I|Carloman]] executed the Alamannic nobility and installed Frankish dukes. \nDuring the later and weaker years of the [[Carolingian Empire]], the Alemannic counts became almost independent, and a struggle for supremacy took place between them and the [[Bishopric of Constance]]. The chief family in Alamannia was that of the counts of {{lang|la|[[Raetia Curiensis]]|italic=yes}}, who were sometimes called margraves, and one of whom, [[Burchard II, Duke of Swabia|Burchard II]], established the [[Duchy of Swabia]], which was recognized by [[Henry the Fowler]] in 919 and became a [[stem duchy]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe area settled by the Alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where [[Alemannic German]] dialects remain spoken, including German [[Swabia]] and [[Baden]], French [[Alsace]], [[German-speaking Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and Austrian [[Vorarlberg]]. \n\nThe [[French language]] [[names of Germany|name of Germany]], {{lang|fr|Allemagne}}, is derived from their name, from [[Old French]] ''aleman(t)'',<ref>recorded as ''aleman'' in c. 1100, and with final dental, ''alemant'' or ''alemand'', from c. 1160.

At that time, they apparently dwelt in the basin of the [[Main River|Main]], to the south of the Chatti.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nCassius Dio portrays the Alemanni as victims of this treacherous emperor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html | publisher=University of Chicago | title=Cassius Dio: Roman History}}</ref> They had asked for his help, according to Dio, but instead he colonized their country, changed their place names, and executed their warriors under a pretext of coming to their aid. When he became ill, the Alemanni claimed to have put a hex on him. Caracalla, it was claimed, tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits.\n\nIn retribution, Caracalla then led the [[Legio II Traiana Fortis|Legio II ''Traiana Fortis'']] against the Alemanni, who lost and were pacified for a time. The legion was as a result honored with the name ''Germanica.'' The fourth-century fictional [[Historia Augusta]], ''Life of Antoninus Caracalla'', relates (10.5) that Caracalla then assumed the name ''Alemannicus,'' at which [[Helvius Pertinax]] jested that he should really be called ''Geticus Maximus,'' because in the year before he had murdered his brother, [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html | publisher=University of Chicago | title=Historia Augusta: The Life of Antoninus Caracalla}}</ref>\n\nThrough much of his short reign, Caracalla was known for unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations. If he had any reasons of state for such actions, they remained unknown to his contemporaries. Whether or not the Alemanni had been previously neutral, they were certainly further influenced by Caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of Rome.\n\nThis mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the Roman writers persisted in calling the Alemanni \u201dbarbari,\" meaning \"savages.\" The archaeology, however, shows that they were largely Romanized, lived in Roman-style houses and used Roman artifacts, the Alemannic women having adopted the Roman fashion of the ''[[tunic]]a'' even earlier than the men.\n\nMost of the Alemanni were probably at the time, in fact, resident in or close to the borders of [[Germania Superior]]. Although Dio is the earliest writer to mention them, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] used the name to refer to Germans on the [[Limes Germanicus]] in the time of [[Trajan]]'s governorship of the province shortly after it was formed, around 98-99 AD. At that time, the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time. Trees from the earliest fortifications found in [[Germania Inferior]] are dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 99-100 AD.\n\nAmmianus relates ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060211084122/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/fld/CLASSICS/ammianus17.html xvii.1.11]) that much later the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] undertook a [[punitive expedition]] against the Alemanni, who by then were in Alsace, and crossed the Main (Latin ''Menus''), entering the forest, where the trails were blocked by felled trees. As winter was upon them, they reoccupied a\n\"fortification which was founded on the soil of the Alemanni that Trajan wished to be called with his own name\".<ref>''munimentum quod in Alamannorum solo conditum Traianus suo nomine voluit appellari.''</ref>\n\nIn this context, the use of Alemanni is possibly an anachronism, but it reveals that Ammianus believed they were the same people, which is consistent with the location of the Alemanni of Caracalla's campaigns.\n\n===Alemanni and Hermunduri===\n''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' by Tacitus (AD 90) in [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01040.htm Chapter 42] states that the [[Hermunduri]] were a tribe certainly located in the region that later became [[Thuringia]]. Tacitus states that they traded with [[Rhaetia]], which in Ptolemy is located across the Danube from [[Germania Superior]], suggesting that the Alemanni originally in part derived from the Hermunduri.\n\nHowever, no Hermunduri appear in Ptolemy, though after the time of Ptolemy, the Hermunduri joined with the [[Marcomanni]] in the wars of 166\u2013180 against the empire. \nTacitus says that the source of the [[Elbe]] is among the Hermunduri, somewhat to the east of the upper [[Main (river)|Main]]. He places them also between the [[Naristi]] (Varisti), whose location was at the very edge of the   [[Black Forest]], and the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]]. Moreover, the Hermunduri were broken in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] and made a separate peace with Rome. \nThe Alemanni thus were probably not primarily the Hermunduri, although some elements of them may have been present.\n\n===Ptolemy's ''Geography''===\nBefore the mention of Alemanni in the time of Caracalla, one would search in vain for Alemanni in the moderately detailed geography of southern Germany in Claudius [[Ptolemy]], written in Greek in the mid-second century;  at that time, the people who later used that name likely were known by other designations.<ref>Ptolemy's description has some limitations. Upper Germany and Lower Germany are mentioned by name, but only as specific districts of Gallia Belgica (2.8), the border between them was an unidentified river, the Obruncus. The region is repeated again under Germany, but this time he does not list Roman boundaries. Germania Superior, the Agri Decumates and the limes are not to be found there, though they certainly existed at the time. \"Germania Magna\" is found within the Rhine, Danube, Vistula and shores of the \"Oceanus Germanicus\". Most of the tribes are missing or listed without name. The Main is not there, nor is Lake Constance. The Danube runs from the Alps. The Rhine does not bend to the south next to Swabia. Ptolemy's Germania is like a surreal image of itself, accurate only if certain known lines are followed, but the overall shape is greatly distorted.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn from Ptolemy. Germania Superior is easily identified. Following up the Rhine one comes to a town, Mattiacum, which must be at the border of the Roman Germany (vicinity of [[Wiesbaden]]). Upstream from it and between the Rhine and [[Abnoba]] (in the [[Black Forest]]) are the [[Ingriones]], [[Intuergi]], [[Vangiones]], [[Caritni]] and [[Vispi]], some of whom were there since the days of the early empire or before. On the other side of the northern Black Forest were the Chatti about where [[Hesse]] is today, on the lower Main.\n\nHistoric Swabia was eventually replaced by today's [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], but it had been the most significant territory of mediaeval [[Alamannia]], comprising all Germania Superior and territory east to Bavaria. It did not include the upper Main, but that is where Caracalla campaigned. Moreover, the territory of Germania Superior was not originally included among the Alemanni's possessions.\n\nHowever, if one looks for the peoples in the region from the upper Main in the north, south to the Danube and east to the [[Czech Republic]] where the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] were located, Ptolemy does not give any tribes. The [[Tubanti]] are just south of the Chatti and at the other end of what was then the Black Forest, the Varisti, whose location is known. One possible reason for this distribution is that the population preferred not to live in the forest except in troubled times. The region between the forest and the Danube, though, included about a dozen settlements, or \"cantons\".\n\nPtolemy's view of Germans in the region indicates that the tribal structure had lost its grip in the Black Forest region and was replaced by a canton structure. The tribes stayed in the Roman province, perhaps because the Romans offered stability. Also, Caracalla perhaps{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} felt more comfortable about campaigning in the upper Main because he was not declaring war on any specific historic tribe, such as the Chatti or Cherusci, against whom Rome had suffered grievous losses. By Caracalla's time, the name Alemanni was being used by cantons themselves banding together for purposes of supporting a citizen army (the \"war bands\").\n\n===Concentration of Germanic peoples under Ariovistus===\nThe term Suebi has a double meaning in the sources. On the one hand Tacitus' ''Germania'' tells us ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01030.htm Chapters 38, 39]) that they occupy more than half of Germany, use a distinctive hair style, and are spiritually centered on the [[Semnones]]. On the other hand, the Suebi of the upper Danube are described as though they were a tribe.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle as well as explaining the historical circumstances leading to the choice of the Agri Decumates as a defensive point and the concentration of Germans there are probably to be found in the German attack on the Gallic fortified town of [[Vesontio]] in 58 BC. The upper Rhine and Danube appear to form a funnel pointing straight at Vesontio.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]] in ''[[Gallic Wars]]'' tells us ([http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div2 1.51]) that [[Ariovistus]] had gathered an army from a wide region of Germany, but especially the [[Harudes]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Triboci]], [[Vangiones]], [[Nemetes]] and [[Sedusii]]. The Suebi were being invited to join. They lived in 100 cantons ([http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=4&division=div2 4.1]) from which 1000 young men per year were chosen for military service, a citizen-army by our standards and by comparison with the Roman professional army.\n\nAriovistus had become involved in an invasion of [[Gaul]], which the German wished to settle. Intending to take the strategic town of Vesontio, he concentrated his forces on the Rhine near Lake Constance, and when the Suebi arrived, he crossed. The Gauls had called to Rome for military aid. Caesar occupied the town first and defeated the Germans before its walls, slaughtering most of the German army as it tried to flee across the river (1.36ff). He did not pursue the retreating remnants, leaving what was left of the German army and their dependents intact on the other side of the Rhine.\n\nThe Gauls were ambivalent in their policies toward the Romans. In 53 BC the [[Treveri]] broke their alliance and attempted to break free of Rome. Caesar foresaw that they would now attempt to ally themselves with the Germans. He crossed the Rhine to forestall that event, a successful strategy. Remembering their expensive defeat at the Battle of Vesontio, the Germans withdrew to the Black Forest, concentrating there a mixed population dominated by Suebi. As they had left their tribal homes behind, they probably took over all the former Celtic cantons along the Danube.\n<!-- This material will be going back in as soon as I set up for it: The Alemanni emerged from the [[Irminones]]. Other groups included the [[Brisgavi]], [[Juthungi]], [[Bucinobantes]], [[Lentienses]], and perhaps the [[Armalausi]]. Close allies of the Alemanni were the East Germanic [[Suebi]], or Suabi (hence [[Swabia]]). The Hermunduri had apparently belonged to the Suebi, but it is likely enough that reinforcements from new Suebic tribes had now moved westward. In later times the names ''Alemanni'' and ''Suebi'' seem to become synonymous, although some of the Suebi later migrated to [[Hispania]] and established an independent kingdom there that endured well into the 6th century. -->\n\n===Conflicts with the Roman Empire===\n[[File:Karte limes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Limes Germanicus]] 83 to 260 CE.]]\n{{Campaignbox Rome against the Alamanni}}\nThe Alemanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the [[Roman Empire]] in the 3rd and 4th centuries. They launched a major invasion of [[Gaul]] and northern [[Italy]] in 268, when the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the [[Goths]] from the east. Their raids throughout the three parts of Gaul were traumatic: [[Gregory of Tours]] (died ca 594) mentions their destructive force at the time of [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Gallienus]] (253\u2013260), when the Alemanni assembled under their \"king\", whom he calls [[Chrocus]], who \"by the advice, it is said, of his wicked mother, and overran the whole of the Gauls, and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times. And coming to [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call ''Vasso Galatae'' in the Gallic tongue,\" martyring many Christians ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#book3 ''Historia Francorum'' Book I.32\u201334]). Thus 6th-century Gallo-Romans of Gregory's class, surrounded by the ruins of [[Roman temple]]s and public buildings, attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the Alemanni.\n\nIn the early summer of 268, the [[Roman Emperors|Emperor]] [[Gallienus]] halted their advance into Italy, but then had to deal with the Goths. When the Gothic campaign ended in Roman victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] in September, Gallienus' successor [[Claudius Gothicus]] turned north to deal with the Alemanni, who were swarming over all Italy north of the [[Po River]].\n\nAfter efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed, Claudius forced the Alemanni to battle at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]] in November. The Alemanni were routed, forced back into Germany, and did not threaten Roman territory for many years afterwards.\n\nTheir most famous battle against Rome took place in [[Argentoratum]] ([[Strasbourg]]), in 357, where they were defeated by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], later Emperor of Rome, and their king [[Chnodomarius]] was taken prisoner to Rome.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn January 2, 366, the Alemanni yet again crossed the frozen [[Rhine]] in large numbers, to invade the Gallic provinces, this time being defeated by Valentinian (see [[Battle of Solicinium]]). In the great mixed invasion of 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the [[Rhine|Rhine river]] a final time, conquering and then settling what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The crossing is described in [[Wallace Breem]]'s historical novel ''[[Eagle in the Snow]]''. The [[Chronicle of Fredegar]] gives the account. At ''Alba Augusta'' ([[Alba-la-Romaine]]) the devastation was so complete, that the Christian bishop retired to [[Viviers, Ard\u00e8che|Viviers]], but in Gregory's account at Mende in [[Loz\u00e8re]], also deep in the heart of Gaul, bishop Privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  It is thought{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence.\n\n====List of battles between Romans and Alemanni====\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD.]]\n* 259, [[Battle of Mediolanum]]\u2014[[Emperor Gallienus]] defeats the Alemanni to rescue Rome\n* 268, [[Battle of Lake Benacus]]\u2014Romans under Emperor [[Claudius II]] defeat the Alemanni.\n* 271\n** [[Battle of Placentia (271)|Battle of Placentia]]\u2014Emperor [[Aurelian]] is defeated by the Alemanni forces invading Italy\n** [[Battle of Fano]]\u2014Aurelian defeats the Alemanni, who begin to retreat from Italy\n** [[Battle of Pavia (271)|Battle of Pavia]]\u2014Aurelian destroys the retreating Alemanni army.\n* 298\n** [[Battle of Lingones]]\u2014[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Constantius Chlorus]] defeats the Alemanni\n** [[Battle of Vindonissa]]\u2014Constantius defeats the Alemanni.\n* 356, [[Battle of Reims (356)|Battle of Reims]]\u2014[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] is defeated by the Alemanni\n* 357, [[Battle of Strasbourg]]\u2014Julian expels the Alemanni from the [[Rhineland]]\n* 368, [[Battle of Solicinium]]\u2014Romans under Emperor [[Valentinian I]] defeat an Alemanni incursion.\n* 378, [[Battle of Argentovaria]]\u2014Western Emperor [[Gratianus]] is victorious over the Alemanni. \n* 451, [[Battle of the Catalaunian Fields]]-Roman General [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] and his army of Romans and barbarian allies defeat Attila's army of [[Huns]] and other Germanic allies, including the Alemanni.\n* 457, [[Battle of Campi Cannini]], Alemanni invade Italy and are defeated near [[Lake Maggiore]] by [[Majorian]]\n* 554, [[Battle of the Volturnus (554)|Battle of the Volturnus]]-Armenian-Roman General [[Narses]] defeats a combined force of [[Franks]] and Alemanni in southern [[Italy]].\n\n===Subjugation by the Franks===\n{{main|Alamannia}}\n[[File:Alamannien Hochburgund ca 1000.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Alemannia (yellow) and Upper Burgundy (green) around 1000.]]\nThe kingdom of Alamannia between Strasbourg and Augsburg lasted until 496, when the Alemanni were conquered by [[Clovis I]] at the [[Battle of Tolbiac]]. The war of Clovis with the Alemanni forms the setting for the conversion of Clovis, briefly treated by [[Gregory of Tours]]. ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gregory-clovisconv.html#n30 Book II.31]) Subsequently, the Alemanni formed part of the [[Franks|Frankish]] dominions and were governed by a Frankish duke.\n\nIn 746, [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]] ended an uprising by summarily executing all Alemannic nobility at the [[blood court at Cannstatt]], and for the following century, Alemannia was ruled by Frankish dukes. Following the [[treaty of Verdun]] of 843, Alemannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of [[Louis the German]], the precursor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The duchy persisted until 1268.\n\n==Culture==\n===Language===\n[[File:Alemannic-Dialects-Map-English.png|thumb|The traditional distribution area of Western Upper German (Alemannic) dialect features in the 19th and 20th centuries]]\n\nThe German spoken today over the range of the former Alemanni is termed [[Alemannic German]], and is recognised among the subgroups of the [[High German languages]]. Alemannic runic inscriptions such as those on the [[Pforzen buckle]] are among the earliest testimonies of [[Old High German]].\nThe [[High German consonant shift]] is thought to have originated around the 5th century either in Alemannia or among the [[Lombards]]; before that the dialect spoken by Alemannic tribes was little different from that of other West Germanic peoples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freya.theladyofthelabyrinth.com/?page_id=604|title=Alamanni/Alemanni (= Suebi/Suevi, Semnones) {{!}} Freyia V\u00f6lundarh\u00fasins|language=nb-NO|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>\n\n''Alemannia'' lost its distinct jurisdictional identity when [[Charles Martel]] absorbed it into the Frankish empire, early in the 8th century. Today, ''Alemannic'' is a linguistic term, referring to [[Alemannic German]], encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (German State), in western [[Bavaria]] (German State), in [[Vorarlberg]] (Austrian State), [[Swiss German]] in Switzerland and the [[Alsatian language]] of the [[Alsace]] (France).\n\n===Political organization===\nThe Alemanni established a series of territorially defined ''pagi'' (cantons) on the east bank of the Rhine. The exact number and extent of these ''pagi'' is unclear and probably changed over time.\n\n''Pagi'', usually pairs of ''pagi'' combined, formed kingdoms (''regna'') which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary. Ammianus describes Alemanni rulers with various terms: ''reges excelsiores ante alios'' (\"paramount kings\"), ''reges proximi'' (\"neighbouring kings\"), ''reguli'' (\"petty kings\") and ''regales'' (\"princes\"). This may be a formal hierarchy, or they may be vague, overlapping terms, or a combination of both.<ref>Drinkwater (2007) 118, 120</ref> In 357, there appear to have been two paramount kings (Chnodomar and Westralp) who probably acted as presidents of the confederation and seven other kings (''reges''). Their territories were small and mostly strung along the Rhine (although a few were in the hinterland).<ref>Drinkwater (2007) 223 (map)</ref> It is possible that the ''reguli'' were the rulers of the two ''pagi'' in each kingdom. Underneath the royal class were the nobles (called ''optimates'' by the Romans) and warriors (called ''armati'' by the Romans). The warriors consisted of professional warbands and levies of free men.<ref>Speidel (2004)</ref> Each nobleman could raise an average of c. 50 warriors.<ref>Drinkwater (2007) 120</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{further|Germanic Christianity|Religion in Switzerland#History|Pre-Christian Alpine traditions|Continental Germanic mythology}}\n[[File:Reiterscheibe von Pliezhausen v2.jpg|thumb|The gold bracteate of [[Pliezhausen]] (6th or 7th century) shows typical iconography of the pagan period.

We know that in the 6th century, the Alemanni were predominantly pagan, and in the 8th century, they were predominantly Christian. The intervening 7th century was a period of genuine [[syncretism]] during which Christian symbolism and doctrine gradually grew in influence.\n\nSome scholars have speculated that members of the Alemannic elite such as king [[Gibuld]] due to [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] influence may have been converted to [[Arianism]] even in the later 5th century.<ref>Schubert, Hans (1909).

Agathias expresses his hope that the Alemanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the Franks, which is by all appearances, in a manner of speaking, what eventually happened.<ref>R.

[[Columbanus]] and his disciple [[Saint Gall]]. [[Jonas of Bobbio]] records that Columbanus was active in [[Bregenz]], where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to [[Wodan]]. Despite these activities, for some time, the Alemanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities, with only superficial or [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] Christian elements. In particular, there is no change in burial practice, and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout Merovingian times. Syncretism of traditional Germanic animal-style with Christian symbolism is also present in artwork, but Christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the 7th century. Unlike the later Christianization of the Saxons and of the Slavs, the Alemanni seem to have adopted Christianity gradually, and voluntarily, spread in emulation of the Merovingian elite.\n\nFrom c. the 520s to the 620s, there was a surge of [[Alemannic Elder Futhark inscriptions]]. About 70 specimens have survived, roughly half of them on [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], others on belt buckles (see [[Pforzen buckle]], [[B\u00fclach fibula]]) and other jewelry and weapon parts. Use of runes subsides with the advance of Christianity.\nThe [[Nordendorf fibula]] (early 7th century) clearly records pagan theonyms, ''loga\u00feorewodanwigi\u00feonar '' read as  \"Wodan and Donar are magicians/sorcerers\", but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities, or a Christian protective charm against them.<ref name=\"D\u00fcwel\">{{Cite book |last=D\u00fcwel |first=Klaus |authorlink= |editor-last=Kamp |editor-first=Norbert |editor2-last=Wollasch |editor2-first=Joachim |contribution=Runen und Interpretatio Christiana: Zur Religioneschichtlichen Stellung der B\u00fcgelfidel von Nordendorf I |title=Tradition als Historische Kraft |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1982 |location= |pages=78\u201386 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tQ_Mmjx5hSIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false  |isbn=311-008237-3}}</ref>\nA runic inscription on a fibula found at [[Bad Ems]] reflects Christian pious sentiment (and is also explicitly marked with a Christian cross), reading ''god fura dih deofile \u16ed'' (\"God for/before you, Theophilus!\", or alternatively \"God before you, Devil!\"). Dated to between AD 660 and 690, it marks the end of the native Alemannic tradition of runic literacy. Bad Ems is in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], on the northwestern boundary of Alemannic settlement, where Frankish influence would have been strongest.<ref>Wolfgang Jungandreas, 'God fura dih, deofile \u2020' in: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur, 101, 1972, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the bishopric of [[Konstanz]] cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by Columbanus himself (before 612). In any case, it existed by 635, when [[Gunzo]] appointed [[John of Grab]] bishop. Constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands, and did not look back on late Roman church history unlike the Raetian bishopric of [[Chur]] (established 451) and [[Basel]] (an episcopal seat from 740, and which continued the line of Bishops of [[Augusta Raurica]], see [[Bishop of Basel]]). The establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history. In the early 7th century ''[[Pactus Alamannorum]]'' hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church, while [[Lantfrid]]'s ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'' of 720 has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone.\n\n==Genetics==\n{{See also|Goths#Genetics|Baiuvarii#Genetics|Lombards#Genetics|Visigoths#Genetics}}\nA genetic study published in ''[[Science Advances]]'' in September 2018 examined the remains of eight individuals buried at a 7th century Alemannic graveyard in [[Niederstotzingen]], Germany. This is the richest and most complete Alemannic graveyard ever found. The highest ranking individual at the graveyard was a male with Frankish grave goods. Four males were found to be closely related to him. They were all cariers of types of the paternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup R-M269#R1b1a1a2a1a1 (R-U106)|R1b1a2a1a1c2b2b]]. A sixth male was a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1b1a2a1a1c2b2b1a1 and the maternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5a1a1]]. Along with the five closely related inviduals, he displayed close genetic links to [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[Eastern Europe|eastern Europe]], particularly [[Lithuania]] and [[Iceland]]. Two individuals buried at the cemetery were found to be genetically different from both the others and each other, displaying genetic links to [[Southern Europe]], particularly northern [[Spain]]. Along with the sixth male, they might have been adoptees.{{sfn|O\u2019Sullivan et al.|2018|ps=: \"Genome-wide analyses were performed on eight individuals to estimate genetic affiliation to modern west Eurasians and genetic kinship at the burial.

First mentioned by [[Cassius Dio]] in the context of the campaign of [[Caracalla]] of 213, the Alemanni captured the {{lang|la|[[Agri Decumates]]|italic=no}} in 260, and later expanded into present-day [[Alsace]], and northern [[Switzerland]], leading to the establishment of the [[Old High German]] language in those regions, by the eighth century named ''[[Alamannia]]''.<ref>''in pago Almanniae'' 762, ''in pago Alemannorum'' 797, ''urbs Constantia in ducatu Alemanniae'' 797; ''in ducatu Alemannico, in pago Linzgowe'' 873. From the 9th century, ''Alamannia'' is increasingly used of the [[Alsace]] specifically, while the Alamannic territory in generally is increasingly called ''[[Duchy of Swabia|Suebia]]''; by the 12th century, the name ''Suebia'' had mostly replaced ''Alamannia''.\nS. Hirzel, ''Forschungen zur Deutschen Landeskunde'' 6 (1888), p. 299.</ref>\n\nIn 496, the Alemanni were [[battle of Tolbiac|conquered]] by [[Franks|Frankish]] leader [[Clovis I|Clovis]] and incorporated into his [[Frankish Empire|dominions]].  Mentioned as still [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] allies of the [[Germanic Christianity|Christian]] Franks, the Alemanni were gradually Christianized during the seventh century. The {{lang|la|[[Lex Alamannorum]]|italic=yes}} is a record of their customary law during this period. Until the eighth century, Frankish [[suzerainty]] over Alemannia was mostly nominal. After an uprising by [[Theudebald, Duke of Alamannia]], though, [[Carloman I|Carloman]] executed the Alamannic nobility and installed Frankish dukes. \nDuring the later and weaker years of the [[Carolingian Empire]], the Alemannic counts became almost independent, and a struggle for supremacy took place between them and the [[Bishopric of Constance]]. The chief family in Alamannia was that of the counts of {{lang|la|[[Raetia Curiensis]]|italic=yes}}, who were sometimes called margraves, and one of whom, [[Burchard II, Duke of Swabia|Burchard II]], established the [[Duchy of Swabia]], which was recognized by [[Henry the Fowler]] in 919 and became a [[stem duchy]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe area settled by the Alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where [[Alemannic German]] dialects remain spoken, including German [[Swabia]] and [[Baden]], French [[Alsace]], [[German-speaking Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and Austrian [[Vorarlberg]]. \n\nThe [[French language]] [[names of Germany|name of Germany]], {{lang|fr|Allemagne}}, is derived from their name, from [[Old French]] ''aleman(t)'',<ref>recorded as ''aleman'' in c. 1100, and with final dental, ''alemant'' or ''alemand'', from c. 1160.

When he became ill, the Alemanni claimed to have put a hex on him. Caracalla, it was claimed, tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits.\n\nIn retribution, Caracalla then led the [[Legio II Traiana Fortis|Legio II ''Traiana Fortis'']] against the Alemanni, who lost and were pacified for a time. The legion was as a result honored with the name ''Germanica.'' The fourth-century fictional [[Historia Augusta]], ''Life of Antoninus Caracalla'', relates (10.5) that Caracalla then assumed the name ''Alemannicus,'' at which [[Helvius Pertinax]] jested that he should really be called ''Geticus Maximus,'' because in the year before he had murdered his brother, [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html | publisher=University of Chicago | title=Historia Augusta: The Life of Antoninus Caracalla}}</ref>\n\nThrough much of his short reign, Caracalla was known for unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations. If he had any reasons of state for such actions, they remained unknown to his contemporaries. Whether or not the Alemanni had been previously neutral, they were certainly further influenced by Caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of Rome.\n\nThis mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the Roman writers persisted in calling the Alemanni \u201dbarbari,\" meaning \"savages.\" The archaeology, however, shows that they were largely Romanized, lived in Roman-style houses and used Roman artifacts, the Alemannic women having adopted the Roman fashion of the ''[[tunic]]a'' even earlier than the men.\n\nMost of the Alemanni were probably at the time, in fact, resident in or close to the borders of [[Germania Superior]]. Although Dio is the earliest writer to mention them, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] used the name to refer to Germans on the [[Limes Germanicus]] in the time of [[Trajan]]'s governorship of the province shortly after it was formed, around 98-99 AD. At that time, the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time. Trees from the earliest fortifications found in [[Germania Inferior]] are dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 99-100 AD.\n\nAmmianus relates ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060211084122/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/fld/CLASSICS/ammianus17.html xvii.1.11]) that much later the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] undertook a [[punitive expedition]] against the Alemanni, who by then were in Alsace, and crossed the Main (Latin ''Menus''), entering the forest, where the trails were blocked by felled trees. As winter was upon them, they reoccupied a\n\"fortification which was founded on the soil of the Alemanni that Trajan wished to be called with his own name\".<ref>''munimentum quod in Alamannorum solo conditum Traianus suo nomine voluit appellari.''</ref>\n\nIn this context, the use of Alemanni is possibly an anachronism, but it reveals that Ammianus believed they were the same people, which is consistent with the location of the Alemanni of Caracalla's campaigns.\n\n===Alemanni and Hermunduri===\n''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' by Tacitus (AD 90) in [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01040.htm Chapter 42] states that the [[Hermunduri]] were a tribe certainly located in the region that later became [[Thuringia]]. Tacitus states that they traded with [[Rhaetia]], which in Ptolemy is located across the Danube from [[Germania Superior]], suggesting that the Alemanni originally in part derived from the Hermunduri.\n\nHowever, no Hermunduri appear in Ptolemy, though after the time of Ptolemy, the Hermunduri joined with the [[Marcomanni]] in the wars of 166\u2013180 against the empire. \nTacitus says that the source of the [[Elbe]] is among the Hermunduri, somewhat to the east of the upper [[Main (river)|Main]]. He places them also between the [[Naristi]] (Varisti), whose location was at the very edge of the   [[Black Forest]], and the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]]. Moreover, the Hermunduri were broken in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] and made a separate peace with Rome. \nThe Alemanni thus were probably not primarily the Hermunduri, although some elements of them may have been present.\n\n===Ptolemy's ''Geography''===\nBefore the mention of Alemanni in the time of Caracalla, one would search in vain for Alemanni in the moderately detailed geography of southern Germany in Claudius [[Ptolemy]], written in Greek in the mid-second century;  at that time, the people who later used that name likely were known by other designations.<ref>Ptolemy's description has some limitations. Upper Germany and Lower Germany are mentioned by name, but only as specific districts of Gallia Belgica (2.8), the border between them was an unidentified river, the Obruncus. The region is repeated again under Germany, but this time he does not list Roman boundaries. Germania Superior, the Agri Decumates and the limes are not to be found there, though they certainly existed at the time. \"Germania Magna\" is found within the Rhine, Danube, Vistula and shores of the \"Oceanus Germanicus\". Most of the tribes are missing or listed without name. The Main is not there, nor is Lake Constance. The Danube runs from the Alps. The Rhine does not bend to the south next to Swabia. Ptolemy's Germania is like a surreal image of itself, accurate only if certain known lines are followed, but the overall shape is greatly distorted.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn from Ptolemy. Germania Superior is easily identified. Following up the Rhine one comes to a town, Mattiacum, which must be at the border of the Roman Germany (vicinity of [[Wiesbaden]]). Upstream from it and between the Rhine and [[Abnoba]] (in the [[Black Forest]]) are the [[Ingriones]], [[Intuergi]], [[Vangiones]], [[Caritni]] and [[Vispi]], some of whom were there since the days of the early empire or before. On the other side of the northern Black Forest were the Chatti about where [[Hesse]] is today, on the lower Main.\n\nHistoric Swabia was eventually replaced by today's [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], but it had been the most significant territory of mediaeval [[Alamannia]], comprising all Germania Superior and territory east to Bavaria. It did not include the upper Main, but that is where Caracalla campaigned. Moreover, the territory of Germania Superior was not originally included among the Alemanni's possessions.\n\nHowever, if one looks for the peoples in the region from the upper Main in the north, south to the Danube and east to the [[Czech Republic]] where the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] were located, Ptolemy does not give any tribes. The [[Tubanti]] are just south of the Chatti and at the other end of what was then the Black Forest, the Varisti, whose location is known. One possible reason for this distribution is that the population preferred not to live in the forest except in troubled times. The region between the forest and the Danube, though, included about a dozen settlements, or \"cantons\".\n\nPtolemy's view of Germans in the region indicates that the tribal structure had lost its grip in the Black Forest region and was replaced by a canton structure. The tribes stayed in the Roman province, perhaps because the Romans offered stability. Also, Caracalla perhaps{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} felt more comfortable about campaigning in the upper Main because he was not declaring war on any specific historic tribe, such as the Chatti or Cherusci, against whom Rome had suffered grievous losses. By Caracalla's time, the name Alemanni was being used by cantons themselves banding together for purposes of supporting a citizen army (the \"war bands\").\n\n===Concentration of Germanic peoples under Ariovistus===\nThe term Suebi has a double meaning in the sources. On the one hand Tacitus' ''Germania'' tells us ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01030.htm Chapters 38, 39]) that they occupy more than half of Germany, use a distinctive hair style, and are spiritually centered on the [[Semnones]]. On the other hand, the Suebi of the upper Danube are described as though they were a tribe.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle as well as explaining the historical circumstances leading to the choice of the Agri Decumates as a defensive point and the concentration of Germans there are probably to be found in the German attack on the Gallic fortified town of [[Vesontio]] in 58 BC. The upper Rhine and Danube appear to form a funnel pointing straight at Vesontio.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]] in ''[[Gallic Wars]]'' tells us ([http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div2 1.51]) that [[Ariovistus]] had gathered an army from a wide region of Germany, but especially the [[Harudes]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Triboci]], [[Vangiones]], [[Nemetes]] and [[Sedusii]]. The Suebi were being invited to join. They lived in 100 cantons ([http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=4&division=div2 4.1]) from which 1000 young men per year were chosen for military service, a citizen-army by our standards and by comparison with the Roman professional army.\n\nAriovistus had become involved in an invasion of [[Gaul]], which the German wished to settle. Intending to take the strategic town of Vesontio, he concentrated his forces on the Rhine near Lake Constance, and when the Suebi arrived, he crossed. The Gauls had called to Rome for military aid. Caesar occupied the town first and defeated the Germans before its walls, slaughtering most of the German army as it tried to flee across the river (1.36ff). He did not pursue the retreating remnants, leaving what was left of the German army and their dependents intact on the other side of the Rhine.\n\nThe Gauls were ambivalent in their policies toward the Romans. In 53 BC the [[Treveri]] broke their alliance and attempted to break free of Rome. Caesar foresaw that they would now attempt to ally themselves with the Germans. He crossed the Rhine to forestall that event, a successful strategy. Remembering their expensive defeat at the Battle of Vesontio, the Germans withdrew to the Black Forest, concentrating there a mixed population dominated by Suebi. As they had left their tribal homes behind, they probably took over all the former Celtic cantons along the Danube.\n<!-- This material will be going back in as soon as I set up for it: The Alemanni emerged from the [[Irminones]]. Other groups included the [[Brisgavi]], [[Juthungi]], [[Bucinobantes]], [[Lentienses]], and perhaps the [[Armalausi]]. Close allies of the Alemanni were the East Germanic [[Suebi]], or Suabi (hence [[Swabia]]). The Hermunduri had apparently belonged to the Suebi, but it is likely enough that reinforcements from new Suebic tribes had now moved westward. In later times the names ''Alemanni'' and ''Suebi'' seem to become synonymous, although some of the Suebi later migrated to [[Hispania]] and established an independent kingdom there that endured well into the 6th century. -->\n\n===Conflicts with the Roman Empire===\n[[File:Karte limes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Limes Germanicus]] 83 to 260 CE.]]\n{{Campaignbox Rome against the Alamanni}}\nThe Alemanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the [[Roman Empire]] in the 3rd and 4th centuries. They launched a major invasion of [[Gaul]] and northern [[Italy]] in 268, when the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the [[Goths]] from the east. Their raids throughout the three parts of Gaul were traumatic: [[Gregory of Tours]] (died ca 594) mentions their destructive force at the time of [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Gallienus]] (253\u2013260), when the Alemanni assembled under their \"king\", whom he calls [[Chrocus]], who \"by the advice, it is said, of his wicked mother, and overran the whole of the Gauls, and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times. And coming to [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call ''Vasso Galatae'' in the Gallic tongue,\" martyring many Christians ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#book3 ''Historia Francorum'' Book I.32\u201334]). Thus 6th-century Gallo-Romans of Gregory's class, surrounded by the ruins of [[Roman temple]]s and public buildings, attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the Alemanni.\n\nIn the early summer of 268, the [[Roman Emperors|Emperor]] [[Gallienus]] halted their advance into Italy, but then had to deal with the Goths. When the Gothic campaign ended in Roman victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] in September, Gallienus' successor [[Claudius Gothicus]] turned north to deal with the Alemanni, who were swarming over all Italy north of the [[Po River]].\n\nAfter efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed, Claudius forced the Alemanni to battle at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]] in November. The Alemanni were routed, forced back into Germany, and did not threaten Roman territory for many years afterwards.\n\nTheir most famous battle against Rome took place in [[Argentoratum]] ([[Strasbourg]]), in 357, where they were defeated by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], later Emperor of Rome, and their king [[Chnodomarius]] was taken prisoner to Rome.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn January 2, 366, the Alemanni yet again crossed the frozen [[Rhine]] in large numbers, to invade the Gallic provinces, this time being defeated by Valentinian (see [[Battle of Solicinium]]). In the great mixed invasion of 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the [[Rhine|Rhine river]] a final time, conquering and then settling what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The crossing is described in [[Wallace Breem]]'s historical novel ''[[Eagle in the Snow]]''. The [[Chronicle of Fredegar]] gives the account. At ''Alba Augusta'' ([[Alba-la-Romaine]]) the devastation was so complete, that the Christian bishop retired to [[Viviers, Ard\u00e8che|Viviers]], but in Gregory's account at Mende in [[Loz\u00e8re]], also deep in the heart of Gaul, bishop Privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  It is thought{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence.\n\n====List of battles between Romans and Alemanni====\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD.]]\n* 259, [[Battle of Mediolanum]]\u2014[[Emperor Gallienus]] defeats the Alemanni to rescue Rome\n* 268, [[Battle of Lake Benacus]]\u2014Romans under Emperor [[Claudius II]] defeat the Alemanni.\n* 271\n** [[Battle of Placentia (271)|Battle of Placentia]]\u2014Emperor [[Aurelian]] is defeated by the Alemanni forces invading Italy\n** [[Battle of Fano]]\u2014Aurelian defeats the Alemanni, who begin to retreat from Italy\n** [[Battle of Pavia (271)|Battle of Pavia]]\u2014Aurelian destroys the retreating Alemanni army.\n* 298\n** [[Battle of Lingones]]\u2014[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Constantius Chlorus]] defeats the Alemanni\n** [[Battle of Vindonissa]]\u2014Constantius defeats the Alemanni.\n* 356, [[Battle of Reims (356)|Battle of Reims]]\u2014[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] is defeated by the Alemanni\n* 357, [[Battle of Strasbourg]]\u2014Julian expels the Alemanni from the [[Rhineland]]\n* 368, [[Battle of Solicinium]]\u2014Romans under Emperor [[Valentinian I]] defeat an Alemanni incursion.\n* 378, [[Battle of Argentovaria]]\u2014Western Emperor [[Gratianus]] is victorious over the Alemanni. \n* 451, [[Battle of the Catalaunian Fields]]-Roman General [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] and his army of Romans and barbarian allies defeat Attila's army of [[Huns]] and other Germanic allies, including the Alemanni.\n* 457, [[Battle of Campi Cannini]], Alemanni invade Italy and are defeated near [[Lake Maggiore]] by [[Majorian]]\n* 554, [[Battle of the Volturnus (554)|Battle of the Volturnus]]-Armenian-Roman General [[Narses]] defeats a combined force of [[Franks]] and Alemanni in southern [[Italy]].\n\n===Subjugation by the Franks===\n{{main|Alamannia}}\n[[File:Alamannien Hochburgund ca 1000.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Alemannia (yellow) and Upper Burgundy (green) around 1000.]]\nThe kingdom of Alamannia between Strasbourg and Augsburg lasted until 496, when the Alemanni were conquered by [[Clovis I]] at the [[Battle of Tolbiac]]. The war of Clovis with the Alemanni forms the setting for the conversion of Clovis, briefly treated by [[Gregory of Tours]]. ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gregory-clovisconv.html#n30 Book II.31]) Subsequently, the Alemanni formed part of the [[Franks|Frankish]] dominions and were governed by a Frankish duke.\n\nIn 746, [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]] ended an uprising by summarily executing all Alemannic nobility at the [[blood court at Cannstatt]], and for the following century, Alemannia was ruled by Frankish dukes. Following the [[treaty of Verdun]] of 843, Alemannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of [[Louis the German]], the precursor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The duchy persisted until 1268.\n\n==Culture==\n===Language===\n[[File:Alemannic-Dialects-Map-English.png|thumb|The traditional distribution area of Western Upper German (Alemannic) dialect features in the 19th and 20th centuries]]\n\nThe German spoken today over the range of the former Alemanni is termed [[Alemannic German]], and is recognised among the subgroups of the [[High German languages]].

The exact number and extent of these ''pagi'' is unclear and probably changed over time.\n\n''Pagi'', usually pairs of ''pagi'' combined, formed kingdoms (''regna'') which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary. Ammianus describes Alemanni rulers with various terms: ''reges excelsiores ante alios'' (\"paramount kings\"), ''reges proximi'' (\"neighbouring kings\"), ''reguli'' (\"petty kings\") and ''regales'' (\"princes\"). This may be a formal hierarchy, or they may be vague, overlapping terms, or a combination of both.<ref>Drinkwater (2007) 118, 120</ref> In 357, there appear to have been two paramount kings (Chnodomar and Westralp) who probably acted as presidents of the confederation and seven other kings (''reges''). Their territories were small and mostly strung along the Rhine (although a few were in the hinterland).<ref>Drinkwater (2007) 223 (map)</ref> It is possible that the ''reguli'' were the rulers of the two ''pagi'' in each kingdom. Underneath the royal class were the nobles (called ''optimates'' by the Romans) and warriors (called ''armati'' by the Romans).

[[Columbanus]] and his disciple [[Saint Gall]]. [[Jonas of Bobbio]] records that Columbanus was active in [[Bregenz]], where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to [[Wodan]]. Despite these activities, for some time, the Alemanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities, with only superficial or [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] Christian elements. In particular, there is no change in burial practice, and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout Merovingian times. Syncretism of traditional Germanic animal-style with Christian symbolism is also present in artwork, but Christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the 7th century. Unlike the later Christianization of the Saxons and of the Slavs, the Alemanni seem to have adopted Christianity gradually, and voluntarily, spread in emulation of the Merovingian elite.\n\nFrom c. the 520s to the 620s, there was a surge of [[Alemannic Elder Futhark inscriptions]]. About 70 specimens have survived, roughly half of them on [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], others on belt buckles (see [[Pforzen buckle]], [[B\u00fclach fibula]]) and other jewelry and weapon parts. Use of runes subsides with the advance of Christianity.\nThe [[Nordendorf fibula]] (early 7th century) clearly records pagan theonyms, ''loga\u00feorewodanwigi\u00feonar '' read as  \"Wodan and Donar are magicians/sorcerers\", but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities, or a Christian protective charm against them.<ref name=\"D\u00fcwel\">{{Cite book |last=D\u00fcwel |first=Klaus |authorlink= |editor-last=Kamp |editor-first=Norbert |editor2-last=Wollasch |editor2-first=Joachim |contribution=Runen und Interpretatio Christiana: Zur Religioneschichtlichen Stellung der B\u00fcgelfidel von Nordendorf I |title=Tradition als Historische Kraft |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1982 |location= |pages=78\u201386 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tQ_Mmjx5hSIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false  |isbn=311-008237-3}}</ref>\nA runic inscription on a fibula found at [[Bad Ems]] reflects Christian pious sentiment (and is also explicitly marked with a Christian cross), reading ''god fura dih deofile \u16ed'' (\"God for/before you, Theophilus!\", or alternatively \"God before you, Devil!\"). Dated to between AD 660 and 690, it marks the end of the native Alemannic tradition of runic literacy. Bad Ems is in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], on the northwestern boundary of Alemannic settlement, where Frankish influence would have been strongest.<ref>Wolfgang Jungandreas, 'God fura dih, deofile \u2020' in: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur, 101, 1972, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the bishopric of [[Konstanz]] cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by Columbanus himself (before 612). In any case, it existed by 635, when [[Gunzo]] appointed [[John of Grab]] bishop. Constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands, and did not look back on late Roman church history unlike the Raetian bishopric of [[Chur]] (established 451) and [[Basel]] (an episcopal seat from 740, and which continued the line of Bishops of [[Augusta Raurica]], see [[Bishop of Basel]]). The establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history. In the early 7th century ''[[Pactus Alamannorum]]'' hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church, while [[Lantfrid]]'s ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'' of 720 has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone.\n\n==Genetics==\n{{See also|Goths#Genetics|Baiuvarii#Genetics|Lombards#Genetics|Visigoths#Genetics}}\nA genetic study published in ''[[Science Advances]]'' in September 2018 examined the remains of eight individuals buried at a 7th century Alemannic graveyard in [[Niederstotzingen]], Germany. This is the richest and most complete Alemannic graveyard ever found. The highest ranking individual at the graveyard was a male with Frankish grave goods. Four males were found to be closely related to him. They were all cariers of types of the paternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup R-M269#R1b1a1a2a1a1 (R-U106)|R1b1a2a1a1c2b2b]]. A sixth male was a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1b1a2a1a1c2b2b1a1 and the maternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5a1a1]]. Along with the five closely related inviduals, he displayed close genetic links to [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[Eastern Europe|eastern Europe]], particularly [[Lithuania]] and [[Iceland]]. Two individuals buried at the cemetery were found be genetically different from both the others and each other, displaying genetic links to [[Southern Europe]], particularly northern [[Spain]]. Along with the sixth male, they might have been adoptees.{{sfn|O\u2019Sullivan et al.|2018|ps=: \"Genome-wide analyses were performed on eight individuals to estimate genetic affiliation to modern west Eurasians and genetic kinship at the burial. Five individuals were direct relatives. Three other individuals were not detectably related; two of these showed genomic affinity to southern Europeans... These five related individuals had culturally diverse grave goods despite the evidence that all of them showed local isotope signals with northern European genetic affiliations...

At the commencement of the [[Revolutionary War (United States)|Revolutionary War]] in 1776, he was a \"gentleman cadet\" in Captain John Allen Thomas' \"Independent\" Company, of St. Mary's county and is mentioned in a letter from Captain Thomas to the [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Council of Safety]], dated March 8, 1776, as \"deserving notice.\" Carbery was appointed second lieutenant in [[Hartley's Additional Continental Regiment|Colonel Hartley's regiment of Continental Troops]], January 24, 1777. He was promoted to first lieutenant on or about September 19, 1777, and captain on November 30, 1778. (The regiment was designated as the [[11th Pennsylvania Regiment|11th Pennsylvania]] on January 13, 1779). He was wounded on August 13, 1779, and retired January 17, 1781. He was a captain in Major Henry Gaither's battalion of the \"Levies of 1791,\" and he served under [[Arthur St. Clair|General St. Clair]] against the [[Miami people|Miami Indians]] in November, 1791. Carbery became captain of infantry, U.S. Army, on March 16, 1792, and was assigned to the [[Legion of the United States|4th sub-legion]] September 4, 1792. He resigned February 10, 1794.\n\nHenry Carbery was appointed adjutant general of the Maryland State Militia October 6, 1794, and served under Governors Stone, Henry, Ogle, Mercer, [[Robert Bowie]] (1803) and Wright.

In Council. Sir: Presuming that the defence of the frontiers will require an augmented force, and that Military promotions will of course take place, we beg leave to address you in favor of Mr. Henry Carbery, who served in the late expedition against the Indians as Senior Captain in the Battalion of levies from this State, and has returned with the reputation of having exhibited an exemplary conduct as well in the unfortunate action as during the Campaign in general. These testimonies joined to the knowledge we have of his respectable deportment in private life, have impressed us with the desire of procuring him the further notice of your Excellency. We believe him to be among those men who by a prediction for the Military life are led to a closer study of the duties of that profession than officers of his rank in general impose on themselves. We beg leave Sir, to add, that during the former war he occasionally commanded a party of Cavalry against the Indians, and seems confident of acquitting himself well if he should be honored with a Command of that kind in the proposed arrangements. With the highest respect we have the honor to be your excellency's Most Obedt. Hble. Servt.

Sir: Presuming that the defence of the frontiers will require an augmented force, and that Military promotions will of course take place, we beg leave to address you in favor of Mr. Henry Carbery, who served in the late expedition against the Indians as Senior Captain in the Battalion of levies from this State, and has returned with the reputation of having exhibited an exemplary conduct as well in the unfortunate action as during the Campaign in general. These testimonies joined to the knowledge we have of his respectable deportment in private life, have impressed us with the desire of procuring him the further notice of your Excellency. We believe him to be among those men who by a prediction for the Military life are led to a closer study of the duties of that profession than officers of his rank in general impose on themselves. We beg leave Sir, to add, that during the former war he occasionally commanded a party of Cavalry against the Indians, and seems confident of acquitting himself well if he should be honored with a Command of that kind in the proposed arrangements. With the highest respect we have the honor to be your excellency's Most Obedt. Hble. Servt.

They had asked for more creative input and they also felt that they were not getting a fair share of the huge amount of money being earned by the project. As no agreement was reached, they each went their separate ways before a final single \"[[Spread Your Love (2 Unlimited song)|Spread Your Love]]\" was released in June 1996.\n\n===''II'' (1998\u20131999)===\nAs they still owned the rights to the name \"2 Unlimited\", De Coster and Wilde recruited two new (again Dutch) singers, Romy van Ooijen (b. 18 November 1971) and Marjon van Iwaarden (b. 18 June 1974), in order to capitalise on previous success. \"[[Wanna Get Up]]\" did well in the Netherlands, reaching No. 10 and the single, which was remixed by [[Sash!]] for UK release, reached No. 38.\n\nThe album ''[[II (2 Unlimited album)|II]]'', was released in April 1998. It was not as successful as previous studio albums, nor were the subsequent singles \"Edge of Heaven\" and \"Never Surrender\". In 1999, both van Ooijen and van Iwaarden left 2 Unlimited.\n\n===Remixes (2000\u20132006)===\nIn 2000, Byte Records released the remix singles \"[[No Limit (2 Unlimited song)#Millennium remixes|No Limit]]\" and \"[[Twilight Zone (Millennium Remixes)|Twilight Zone]]\". A remix album was to be released that year but some master tapes were stolen from Byte, and taken to Russia where they were released as a bootleg compilation. Also in this year, 2 Unlimited made their first appearance on the Eurodance compilation ''[[Dancemania]]'' series, specifically its ''[[Dancemania Speed|Speed]]'' sub-series, with their song \"Twilight Zone\"'s \"B4 Za Beat Mix\".<ref>{{cite web|title= 2 Unlimited Discography |publisher= [[Discogs]] |url= http://www.discogs.com/artist/4057-2-Unlimited |accessdate= 26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Byte finally released \"[[Greatest Hits Remixes]]\" featuring many new remixes. Some of the remixes from the stolen master tapes released in Russia were not included. The album was released solely in Japan. In 2002, ''[[Trance Remixes (Special Edition)|Trance Remixes: Special Edition]]'' was released in Japan featuring many more new remixes not included in the previous compilation.\n\nIn recent years, many \"best of\" compilations have been released in various territories, often with new remixes. Most notably, [[ZYX Music|ZYX Records]] released \"[[No Limit (2 Unlimited song)#No Limit 2.3|No Limit 2.3]]\" in 2003 and it was a moderate hit, reaching no. 41 in the German singles chart.

They had asked for more creative input and they also felt that they were not getting a fair share of the huge amount of money being earned by the project. As no agreement was reached, they each went their separate ways before a final single \"[[Spread Your Love (2 Unlimited song)|Spread Your Love]]\" was released in June 1996.\n\n===''II'' (1998\u20131999)===\nAs they still owned the rights to the name \"2 Unlimited\", De Coster and Wilde recruited two new (again Dutch) singers, Romy van Ooijen (b. 18 November 1971) and Marjon van Iwaarden (b. 18 June 1974), in order to capitalise on previous success. \"[[Wanna Get Up]]\" did well in the Netherlands, reaching No. 10 and the single, which was remixed by [[Sash!]] for UK release, reached No. 38.\n\nThe album ''[[II (2 Unlimited album)|II]]'', was released in April 1998. It was not as successful as previous studio albums, nor were the subsequent singles \"Edge of Heaven\" and \"Never Surrender\".

A remix album was to be released that year but some master tapes were stolen from Byte, and taken to Russia where they were released as a bootleg compilation. Also in this year, 2 Unlimited made their first appearance on the Eurodance compilation ''[[Dancemania]]'' series, specifically its ''[[Dancemania Speed|Speed]]'' sub-series, with their song \"Twilight Zone\"'s \"B4 Za Beat Mix\".<ref>{{cite web|title= 2 Unlimited Discography |publisher= [[Discogs]] |url= http://www.discogs.com/artist/4057-2-Unlimited |accessdate= 26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Byte finally released \"[[Greatest Hits Remixes]]\" featuring many new remixes. Some of the remixes from the stolen master tapes released in Russia were not included. The album was released solely in Japan. In 2002, ''[[Trance Remixes (Special Edition)|Trance Remixes: Special Edition]]'' was released in Japan featuring many more new remixes not included in the previous compilation.\n\nIn recent years, many \"best of\" compilations have been released in various territories, often with new remixes. Most notably, [[ZYX Music|ZYX Records]] released \"[[No Limit (2 Unlimited song)#No Limit 2.3|No Limit 2.3]]\" in 2003 and it was a moderate hit, reaching no. 41 in the German singles chart.

Without explanation, communication is lost and stocks begin to run low. Several scouting parties leave to investigate, but do not return.\n\nHunter, who disappeared during the events of ''[[Metro 2033]]'' and is now heavily traumatised, has been working as a border guard at Sevastopolskaya. He volunteers to lead one last attempt to re-establish contact with the central Metro stations before the station mobilises its military and heads north en masse. He is accompanied by Homer, an old man searching for inspiration for a book. Hunter makes contact with the guards at [[Tulskaya (Moscow Metro)|Tulskaya Station]], but after an argument the hermetic doors are sealed. Hunter tells Homer that the station had been captured by bandits and must be destroyed, but Homer recovers a diary left by one of the previous expeditions which indicates that the station had been infected by a deadly disease.\n\nThey detour through the abandoned and heavily irradiated [[Kakhovskaya Line]] and encounter the teenage daughter of the exiled [[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya line)|Avtozavodskaya]] Station Master, who had recently died. She accompanies them and the increasingly violent Hunter kills several men as they pass through Avtozavodskaya. Sasha restrains him somewhat, preventing additional bloodshed and during a mutant attack at [[Paveletskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya line)|Paveletskaya Station]], Hunter is seriously injured after saving Sasha. Sasha believes that she can prevent Hunter from committing further atrocities in his mission to protect Sevastopolskaya, but after an argument Hunter presses on without them. Homer and Sasha are joined by Leonid, a musician and are re-united with Hunter at [[Dobryninskaya|Dobryninskaya Station]].\n\nAn increasingly unstable Hunter heads to the centre of the Metro, to Polis, to gather an armed force to cleanse the infected stations. He is accompanied by Homer, while Sasha leaves with Leonid who claims to know a cure for the plague. The detour was unnecessary and Leonid admits that he did it in order to spend some time with Sasha. He tells her the disease had broken out before in a different section of the Metro and it was found that exposure to radiation could cure it. He agrees to accompany her in an effort to prevent Hunter from killing everyone there.\n\nHunter finds his old comrade Miller (referred to as 'Melnik' in ''Metro 2033''), the leader of \"The Order\" \u2013 a paramilitary group dedicated to defending the Metro and who believed Hunter dead. Miller provides him with a heavily armed squad and Hunter returns to Dobryninskaya, while Homer wrestles with his conscience as to whether to attempt to stop him or allow the massacre to proceed. The Order arrives at Tulskaya and prepare to fire at the infected, only to be distracted by Leonid's music. Sasha appeals to Hunter, and tells him of the possible cure. The troops already stationed within Tulskaya, who had been trying to contain the outbreak, detonate explosives that flood the station. The Order withdraws and seals the hermetic doors, leaving those inside to drown.\n\nSeveral weeks later, both Hunter and Homer are back at the border guard at Sevastopolskaya. Homer had searched for Sasha's body, but was unable to find it, leaving her fate unknown.\n\n==English editions==\nThe novel was released as an [[e-book]] by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Victor Gollancz]] in English on 20 February 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gollancz.co.uk/2014/02/metro-2034-and-you-think-the-northern-lines-bad/|title=Metro 2034 \u2013 and you think the Northern Line\u2019s bad\u2026|date=20 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref> The paperback edition was published by Gollancz and [[Orion Publishing Group]] in United Kingdom on 13 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gollancz.co.uk/2014/11/happy-publication-day-november-13th-2014/|title=Happy Publication Day: November 13th 2014|date=13 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781473204300|title=Dmitry Glukhovsky - Metro 2034 - Orion Publishing Group|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe novel was well received by critics and audiences alike.

He tells her the disease had broken out before in a different section of the Metro and it was found that exposure to radiation could cure it. He agrees to accompany her in an effort to prevent Hunter from killing everyone there.\n\nHunter finds his old comrade Miller (referred to as 'Melnik' in ''Metro 2033''), the leader of \"The Order\" \u2013 a paramilitary group dedicated to defending the Metro and who believed Hunter dead. Miller provides him with a heavily armed squad and Hunter returns to Dobryninskaya, while Homer wrestles with his conscience as to whether to attempt to stop him or allow the massacre to proceed. The Order arrives at Tulskaya and prepare to fire at the infected, only to be distracted by Leonid's music. Sasha appeals to Hunter, and tells him of the possible cure. The troops already stationed within Tulskaya, who had been trying to contain the outbreak, detonate explosives that flood the station. The Order withdraws and seals the hermetic doors, leaving those inside to drown.\n\nSeveral weeks later, both Hunter and Homer are back at the border guard at Sevastopolskaya. Homer had searched for Sasha's body, but was unable to find it, leaving her fate unknown.\n\n==English editions==\nThe novel was released as an [[e-book]] by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Victor Gollancz]] in English on 20 February 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gollancz.co.uk/2014/02/metro-2034-and-you-think-the-northern-lines-bad/|title=Metro 2034 \u2013 and you think the Northern Line\u2019s bad\u2026|date=20 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref> The paperback edition was published by Gollancz and [[Orion Publishing Group]] in United Kingdom on 13 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gollancz.co.uk/2014/11/happy-publication-day-november-13th-2014/|title=Happy Publication Day: November 13th 2014|date=13 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781473204300|title=Dmitry Glukhovsky - Metro 2034 - Orion Publishing Group|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe novel was well received by critics and audiences alike.

After destroying the demons that were burdening Mother Earth, Goddess Vaishnavi was requested to reside on Earth, so that she may forever keep all evil at bay. She chose to incarnate as a human, named Vaishnavi.\n\nAs a child, Vaishnavi was immersed in the devotional service of Lord Vishnu, a habit she carried well into her adulthood. When she was of a marriageable age, she left home to perform intense austerities to please and win Lord Vishnu as her husband. Years passed, and as an answer to her prayers, Lord Vishnu appeared to her in the form of Lord Rama. She learned from him that he was already married and was searching for his wife, Sita, who was abducted by the demon king of Lanka, Ravana.\n\nSeeing his devotee distraught, Rama promised her that he would return to her one day, and if she recognized him, she could marry him. Rama went on to rescue Sita and become the king of Ayodhya, all while Vaishnavi waited for his return. One such day, she was approached by an old man who asked the beautiful Vaishnavi to be his wife. She however, refused his proposal, thinking of him as undesirable for his age and looks. She had failed to recognize the old man who was none other than Lord Rama, who had come to keep his end of the promise. However, the harsh penance of the goddess can't go unfulfilled, so Lord Rama granted her the boon that in his 10th incarnation of Lord Kalki during kaliyuga, he would marry her and asked her to wait for him till his 10th incarnation on the Trikuta mountain. He even gave her a Bow and two quivers of arrows and a troop of his monkey army for her protection.\n\nRama left, and Vaishnavi continued to spend years in meditation, moving from place to place, solving the troubles of all who asked, with her Siddhis. This threatened the popularity of a local Tantrik who sent his disciple Bhairon Nath to find out more about her. But Bhairon Nath was stupefied by her beauty and lustfully stalked her wherever she went.\n\nIn order to escape his unwanted attention, Vaishnavi entered a cave and continued her meditation there, for nine months, as a child rests in its mother's womb. When Bhairon Nath discovered her hiding spot and attempted to hunt her down again, with an intention of forcing himself upon her, Vaishnavi appeared as a ten armed Goddess,with dark complexion of kaali holding different weapons, wearing garland of severed heads,manifesting as mahakaali she severed Bhairon nath's head.\n\nAfter she severed his head off, Bhairon Nath realized his mistake and begged her for forgiveness. His head had fallen far from his body, but the merciful Goddess [[Vaishno Devi]] promised him that he would forever be enshrined there and that he would be her guardian form then on. Vaishno Devi abandoned her rage and returned to the form of Vaishnavi, and reentered her cave, where she assumed the form of three rocks and resides there to date. Each rock is representative of [[Saraswati]], [[MahaLakshmi]] and [[Mahakali]]. This shrine is lovingly called 'Vaishno Devi', where lakhs of devotees throng every year.\n\nShe is called by many names. \n* Trikuta - The Goddess who lives upon the mountain Trikut, and this is why she is also called Pahadawali (The Goddess who lives upon a mountain). \n\n* Jyotawali - The Goddess who shines like an oil lamp and spreads light everywhere. \n\n* Sherawali - The Goddess who rides upon a lion (the form she appeared in when she cut off Bhairon Nath\u2019s head. \n\n* Mata Rani/ Jagat Janani -\nThe mother of the Universe.  \n\n* Meherawali- merciful goddess.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University]]\n* [[Vaishnavi (Matrika goddess)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.vaishno.in My Mother Goddess Vaishno]\n* [https://www.maavaishnodevi.org/introduction.aspx Maa Vaishno Devi Shrine Board]\n\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline}}\n{{commons category}}\n{{Hindu Temples in Jammu and Kashmir}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu goddesses]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Jammu and Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Shakti temples]]\n[[Category:Hindu cave temples in India]]\n[[Category:Katra, Jammu and Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Caves of Jammu and Kashmir]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Vaishnavi (Matrika goddess)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}{{Use Indian English|date=June 2016}} \n{{Infobox Hindu temple\n| name               = Vaishno Devi\n| image              = Vaishno Devi Bhavan.jpg\n| alt                =\n| caption            = The [[Vaishno Devi shrine]] attracts millions of devotees every year, located in Katra\n| map_type           = India Jammu and Kashmir#India\n| map_caption        = Location of Vaishno Devi in Jammu and Kashmir\n| coordinates        = {{coord|33.0299|74.9482|type:landmark_region:IN|display=inline,title}}\n| country            = [[India]]\n| location           = [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]]\n| district           = \n| locale             = [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]]\n| elevation_m        = 1584.96\n| deity              = Vaishno Devi\n| festivals          = [[Navratri]], [[Durga Puja]]\n| architecture       = Cave Temple\n| temple_quantity    = 4\n| monument_quantity  = \n| inscriptions       = \n| year_completed     = \n| website            = {{url|https://www.maavaishnodevi.org/|maavaishnodevi.org}}\n}}\n\n'''Vaishno Devi,''' also known as '''Mata Rani, Trikuta''' and '''Vaishnavi''', is a manifestation of the Hindu Goddess .
