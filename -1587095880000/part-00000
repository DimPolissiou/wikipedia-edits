The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was in 2002; see below.

The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010; likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. [[Montana]] (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. [[Nebraska]] (March 20, 2010), [[Oregon]] (March 28, 2010), [[Arizona]] (April 18, 2010), [[Maine]] (May 9, 2010), [[Colorado]] and [[South Dakota]] (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.\n\nAs of January 2020, there were 47 lotteries offering Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball; Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019; it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only stores which sold Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball tickets were retailers whose business was on a border between jurisdictions which sold competing games.\n\nThe current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the ''Megaplier'', if activated, multiplies non-jackpot prizes. Multipliers are 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x (a second-prize Megaplier play can win $5 million cash.) The Megaplier is not available in California, or on ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers (where offered.)<ref>http://www.megamillions.com/how-to-play</ref>\n\n=== Current Mega Millions members ===\n[[File:stateswithlotto.png|thumb|400px|As of January 30, 2020, Mega Millions is available in 45 states and the [[District of Columbia]] (''in blue''), plus the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] ''(not shown)''.]]\n\nMega Millions replaced ''The Big Game'' in 2002 (see below for the evolution of the name ''Mega Millions'').\n\n=== Mega Millions and Powerball ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Lottery \n!Powerball\n!Mega Millions\n|-\n|[[Arizona Lottery|Arizona]]\n|{{dts|April 4, 1994}}\n|{{dts|April 18, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]]\n|{{dts|October 31, 2009}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[California State Lottery|California]]\n|{{dts|April 8, 2013}}\n|{{dts|June 22, 2005}}\n|-\n|[[Connecticut Lottery|Connecticut]]\n|{{dts|November 28, 1995}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Colorado Lottery|Colorado]]\n|{{dts|August 2, 2001}}\n|{{dts|May 16, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Delaware Lottery|Delaware]]\n|{{dts|January 14, 1991}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[D.C.

''The Big Game'' was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multi-state game with lottery directors [[Rebecca Paul]] of the Georgia Lottery and [[Penelope W. Kyle]] of the Virginia Lottery. ''The Big Game'' initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996; however, within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.\n\nBeginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in [[present value|cash]]. In May 1999, [[New Jersey]] joined ''The Big Game'', the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before ''The Big Game'' became Mega Millions in 2002.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== ''The Big Game Mega Millions'' ===\n[[File:The Big Game Mega Millions Logo.png|thumb|201px|right|''The Big Game Mega Millions'' logo following the addition of the name ''Mega Millions'']] Ohio and New York joined ''The Big Game'' consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions'', temporarily retaining the old name and the original \"gold ball\" logo. The \"Big Money Ball\" became the \"Mega Ball.\" While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read \"The Big Game\" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (in September 2002), [[Texas]] (in 2003), and [[California]] (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.\n\nWhen Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the ''Megaplier'', which was similar to Powerball's ''Power Play''. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without ''Megaplier'' on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the ''Megaplier''. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to ''Megaplier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelottery.com/games/megamillions.shtml |title=Mega Millions with Megaplier: Maine State Lottery |publisher=Mainelottery.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night's drawing was held in [[Hollywood]], with [[Carrie Underwood]] assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.\n\nFor the November 15, 2005 drawing, a group called \"The Lucky 7\" held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in [[Anaheim, California]], winning $315 million. They chose the cash option, splitting $175 million before federal withholdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1 |title=California's First Mega Millions Jackpot Winners The Lucky Seven -- Claim Prize |publisher=Mega Millions |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2013-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121134302/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1|archivedate=2013-01-21}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 2007, the Mega Millions jackpot reached $390 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp |title=Mega Millions Jackpot History |publisher=Megamillions.com |date= 2013-09-29|accessdate=2013-12-18| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130929051737/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp| archivedate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> which was then the record for the third largest jackpot in U.S. history.

In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey's, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members; as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions ''after'' the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.\n\nRecent additions to Mega Millions included the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013; the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.\n\nPresumably due to their experience with the ''Power Play'' option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010 immediately offered ''Megaplier'' to their players. The ''Megaplier'' continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the ''Megaplier'' option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, this raised the number of lotteries offering the ''Megaplier'' to 37.\n\nMega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls \u2013 but excluding the Mega Ball \u2013 are matched.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.\n\nIn January 2012, Mega Millions' rival Powerball was altered; among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option. At the time, there were no plans to change the price of a Mega Millions play, with or without the ''Megaplier'' (see below for the 2017 format change that includes the base price for a Mega Millions play to be raised to $2). The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in [[Louisiana]] deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state's lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.\n\n=== October 2013 format change ===\nThe final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013; that night's jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format\u2014which saw the jackpot estimate \"leap\" to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure\u2014occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the \"Gold Ball\" number out of 15.\n\nThe ''Megaplier'' option remained; the 5x multiplier was added.\n\nLower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:\n*Match 5+0: $250,000\n*Match 4+MB: $10,000\n*Match 4+0: $150\n*Match 3+MB: $150\n*Match 3+0: $7\n*Match 2+MB: $10\n*Match 1+MB: $3\n*Match 0+MB: $2\n\nPayouts in California remained [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel]].\n\nThe odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017): 1 in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were 1 in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a \"Mega Ball\"-only match.\n\nPrizes and odds (2013-2017 version) based on a $1 play:\n*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850\n*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; $ 1 in 17,259,390\n*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 \n*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835\n*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720\n*3+0: $5; 1 in 766\n*2+1: $5; 1 in 473\n*1+1: $2; 1 in 56\n*Mega Ball ''only'': $1; 1 in 21\n\nThe odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching ''none'' of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.\n\nThe annuity\u2014which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when ''The Big Game'' began\u2014changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.\n\n=== October 2017 format/price point change ===\nOn October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2; the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25.<ref>[blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/274243/mega-millions-lottery-tickets-will-go-from-1-to-2/ Mega Millions lottery tickets will go from $1 to $2]</ref> The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The \"Megaplier\" option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won; the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)\n\n=== April 2020 format change ===\nHowever in the new version regulations (which began on Saturday April 4, 2020 with the first drawing on Tuesday April 7, 2020) for Mega Millions, the minimum Mega Millions advertised [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] is $20&nbsp;million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing based upon sales the sales of everywhere;percent each year (unless the cash option is chosen; see below for differences by lotteries on cash/annuity choice regulations.) The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner. So far, we haven't have a Mega Millions jackpot winning ticket yet. Once we do have a Mega Millions jackpot winning ticket, then the game will reset back down to $20 million dollars!<ref name=wp2020 />\n\nMega Millions' non-California prize tiers effective April 5, 2020 (old prizes in parentheses; changed amounts in '''boldface''') for a $2 base play:\n\n* 5+MB: Jackpot; '''starting jackpot to $20 million (annuity value)'''\n* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)\n* 4+MB: '''$10,000''' ($5,000)\n* 4+0: $500 ($500)\n* 3+MB: '''$200''' ($50)\n* 3+0: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 2+MB: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 1+MB: '''$4''' ($2)\n* 0+MB: '''$2''' ($1)\n\nThe new prize structure allocates roughly 75 percent of the prize pool for the jackpot; this is, in part, to facilitate the new ''Just the Jackpot'' option. The 2013-2017 version allocated about 68 percent towards the jackpot.\n\n=== \"Just the Jackpot\" option ===\n\nIn preparation for the October 28, 2017 format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the '''choice''' of offering a $3, two-game play (called \"Just the Jackpot\"). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes; therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers.\n\nThese lotteries offered the \"Just the Jackpot\" option upon the format change: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. [[Kentucky]] has since added \"Just the Jackpot\", with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering \"Just the Jackpot\" beginning after the October 28, 2017 format change.\n\n\"Just the Jackpot\" wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers are terminal-generated; however, ''JtJ'' wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, while Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.\n\nAs of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a ''Just the Jackpot'' wager; there also is no known count of ''JtJ'' wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.\n\n=== Record jackpots ===\nThe largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.537 billion, was won on October 23, 2018 by one ticket, sold in South Carolina. This prize, the largest for one set of numbers in world history, was the second largest lottery payout, behind Powerball's $1.586 billion jackpot won on January 13, 2016 by multiple tickets. The record Mega Millions jackpot was claimed on March 5, 2019, with the winner choosing to remain anonymous under South Carolina law.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/03/04/mystery-winner-finally-claims-billion-mega-millions-jackpot-ending-months-speculation/]</ref>\n\nThe second-largest Mega Millions jackpot advertised as $640 million at the time of the drawing (annuitized) or $462 million (cash value), was drawn on March 30, 2012. The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million); brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher. The amount spent on Mega Millions for drawings following its previous jackpot win, on January 24, 2012, was at least $1.5 [[1,000,000,000|billion]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 31, 2012 |title=Mega Millions mania leads to disappointment in California |author1=Matt Stevens |author2=Carol J.

(Neither ''Megaplier'' nor ''Power Play'' are offered in California because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" in which the bank cannot be \"broken\", and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]]; only a \"lottery\" was authorized by the state Lottery Act.) By adding $1 to a basic Mega Millions game, to $3, a player has an opportunity to multiply any non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The ''Megaplier'' is drawn by the Texas Lottery (before the cross-sell expansion on January 31, 2010, it was the only lottery to offer ''Megaplier''), it is drawn by a [[random number generator]] (RNG).

Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(<sub>75</sub>C<sub>5</sub>) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing; however, the odds will still remain the same.\n\nPayouts through October 18, 2013:\n{| cellspacing=3; class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Matches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n!rowspan=2|Prize\n!rowspan=2|Approximate probability of winning\n|-\n|White balls (pool of 56)\n|Mega Ball (pool of 46)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jackpot<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n|1 in 175,711,536 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2856+choose+5%29*46\n| title = (56 choose 5)*46\n| accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18| publisher = [[Google]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/mega-millions-jackpot-probability |publisher=Khan Academy |title=Mega Millions Jackpot Probability |author=Sal Khan}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $250,000\n|1 in 3,904,701 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746/45)<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%205%29*%2851%20choose%200%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 5)*(51 choose 0)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10,000\n|1 in 689,065<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 15,313<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 13,781<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10\n|1 in 844<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%202%29*%2851%20choose%203%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 2)*(51 choose 3)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $7\n|1 in 306<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $3\n|1 in 141<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%201%29*%2851%20choose%204%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 1)*(51 choose 4)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $2\n|1 in 74.8 (the probability for this prize was not 1:46, because there is the possibility of matching at least one of the \"white\" balls, which decreases the likelihood of matching ''only'' the \"Mega Ball\")<ref name=MMHow />\n|}\n\nOverall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes,<ref name=MMHow /> 1 in 40 of winning any prize.<ref name=\"Lotto numbers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |title=Lotto Numbers |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212014739/http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |archive-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn California, prize levels are paid on a [[parimutuel]] basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions.

Each of the 46 lotteries have rules in regards to unclaimed prizes; most Mega Millions members set aside unclaimed winnings for educational purposes.<ref>{{cite web |author=kowens |url=http://www.calottery.com/Games/MegaMillions/howtoplay/faq.html#q13 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Calottery.com |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207112904/http://www.calottery.com/Games/MegaMillions/howtoplay/faq.html#q13 |archivedate=2011-12-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/lottery/0,1607,7-110-1227-4242--F,00.html |title=What Happens to Unclaimed Prizes? |publisher=Michigan.gov |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, a $31 million prize went unclaimed in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2007/12/06/many_major_us_lottery_prizes_unclaimed/3678/ |title=Many major U.S. lottery prizes unclaimed |publisher=UPI.com |date=2007-12-06 |accessdate=2011-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222000410/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2007/12/06/many_major_us_lottery_prizes_unclaimed/3678/ |archivedate=2008-02-22 }}</ref> Many prizes of $250,000 each have been unclaimed, including several in Michigan for 2007 drawings.<ref>[http://www.michigan.gov/lottery/0,1607,7-110-46442_812_967---,00.html Michigan.gov <!-- Bot generated title -->], Lottery - Top Unclaimed Prizes</ref>\n\nMega Millions winners have either 180 days (California non-jackpot prizes only) or one year to claim prizes, including the jackpot (although some Mega Millions winners lose the right to collect a jackpot in cash if they wait more than 60 days after the drawing).\n\nThe minimum age to purchase a Mega Millions ticket is 18, except in [[Arizona Lottery|Arizona]], [[Iowa Lottery|Iowa]], [[Louisiana Lottery (modern)|Louisiana]], and Mississippi, where the minimum is 21; and in [[Nebraska Lottery|Nebraska]], where it is 19. Generally (an exception is Virginia), minors can win on tickets received as gifts; the rules according to each Mega Millions member vary for minors receiving prizes.\n\nRules vary according to the applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction where the ticket is sold, and the winner's residence (e.g. if a [[New Jersey]]an wins on a ticket bought near their workplace in Manhattan). Mega Millions winnings are exempt from state [[income tax]] in California; while Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington state, and Wyoming do not have an income tax.

Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio's governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join ''The Big Game'', which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions''; shortly after, it became just ''Mega Millions''. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time ''The Big Game'' or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.\n\nIn 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scamfraudalert.com/f23/mega-millions-logo-officials-warn-lottery-scams-5259/ |title=Mega Millions Logo Officials Warn of Lottery scams |publisher=ScamFraudAlert |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nA budget impasse due to the [[2006 New Jersey Government shutdown]] led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the [[Atlantic City]] casinos and the [[New Jersey Lottery]]. Not only were New Jersey's in-house games (such as [[New Jersey Pick 6|Pick-6]]) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual.

One such usage involved character [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes]] playing the sequence in a similar \"Mega Lotto\" game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the \"mega ball\" number) in the ''Lost'' sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene.

The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010; likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. [[Montana]] (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. [[Nebraska]] (March 20, 2010), [[Oregon]] (March 28, 2010), [[Arizona]] (April 18, 2010), [[Maine]] (May 9, 2010), [[Colorado]] and [[South Dakota]] (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.\n\nAs of January 2020, there were 47 lotteries offering Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball; Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019; it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only stores which sold Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball tickets were retailers whose business was on a border between jurisdictions which sold competing games.\n\nThe current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the ''Megaplier'', if activated, multiplies non-jackpot prizes. Multipliers are 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x (a second-prize Megaplier play can win $5 million cash.) The Megaplier is not available in California, or on ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers (where offered.)<ref>http://www.megamillions.com/how-to-play</ref>\n\n=== Current Mega Millions members ===\n[[File:stateswithlotto.png|thumb|400px|As of January 30, 2020, Mega Millions is available in 45 states and the [[District of Columbia]] (''in blue''), plus the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] ''(not shown)''.]]\n\nMega Millions replaced ''The Big Game'' in 2002 (see below for the evolution of the name ''Mega Millions'').\n\n=== Mega Millions and Powerball ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Lottery \n!Powerball\n!Mega Millions\n|-\n|[[Arizona Lottery|Arizona]]\n|{{dts|April 4, 1994}}\n|{{dts|April 18, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]]\n|{{dts|October 31, 2009}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[California State Lottery|California]]\n|{{dts|April 8, 2013}}\n|{{dts|June 22, 2005}}\n|-\n|[[Connecticut Lottery|Connecticut]]\n|{{dts|November 28, 1995}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Colorado Lottery|Colorado]]\n|{{dts|August 2, 2001}}\n|{{dts|May 16, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Delaware Lottery|Delaware]]\n|{{dts|January 14, 1991}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[D.C.

''The Big Game'' was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multi-state game with lottery directors [[Rebecca Paul]] of the Georgia Lottery and [[Penelope W. Kyle]] of the Virginia Lottery. ''The Big Game'' initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996; however, within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.\n\nBeginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in [[present value|cash]]. In May 1999, [[New Jersey]] joined ''The Big Game'', the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before ''The Big Game'' became Mega Millions in 2002.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== ''The Big Game Mega Millions'' ===\n[[File:The Big Game Mega Millions Logo.png|thumb|201px|right|''The Big Game Mega Millions'' logo following the addition of the name ''Mega Millions'']] Ohio and New York joined ''The Big Game'' consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions'', temporarily retaining the old name and the original \"gold ball\" logo. The \"Big Money Ball\" became the \"Mega Ball.\" While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read \"The Big Game\" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (in September 2002), [[Texas]] (in 2003), and [[California]] (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.\n\nWhen Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the ''Megaplier'', which was similar to Powerball's ''Power Play''. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without ''Megaplier'' on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the ''Megaplier''. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to ''Megaplier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelottery.com/games/megamillions.shtml |title=Mega Millions with Megaplier: Maine State Lottery |publisher=Mainelottery.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night's drawing was held in [[Hollywood]], with [[Carrie Underwood]] assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.\n\nFor the November 15, 2005 drawing, a group called \"The Lucky 7\" held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in [[Anaheim, California]], winning $315 million. They chose the cash option, splitting $175 million before federal withholdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1 |title=California's First Mega Millions Jackpot Winners The Lucky Seven -- Claim Prize |publisher=Mega Millions |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2013-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121134302/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1|archivedate=2013-01-21}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 2007, the Mega Millions jackpot reached $390 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp |title=Mega Millions Jackpot History |publisher=Megamillions.com |date= 2013-09-29|accessdate=2013-12-18| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130929051737/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp| archivedate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> which was then the record for the third largest jackpot in U.S. history.

In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey's, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members; as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions ''after'' the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.\n\nRecent additions to Mega Millions included the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013; the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.\n\nPresumably due to their experience with the ''Power Play'' option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010 immediately offered ''Megaplier'' to their players. The ''Megaplier'' continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the ''Megaplier'' option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, this raised the number of lotteries offering the ''Megaplier'' to 37.\n\nMega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls \u2013 but excluding the Mega Ball \u2013 are matched.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.\n\nIn January 2012, Mega Millions' rival Powerball was altered; among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option. At the time, there were no plans to change the price of a Mega Millions play, with or without the ''Megaplier'' (see below for the 2017 format change that includes the base price for a Mega Millions play to be raised to $2). The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in [[Louisiana]] deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state's lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.\n\n=== October 2013 format change ===\nThe final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013; that night's jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format\u2014which saw the jackpot estimate \"leap\" to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure\u2014occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the \"Gold Ball\" number out of 15.\n\nThe ''Megaplier'' option remained; the 5x multiplier was added.\n\nLower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:\n*Match 5+0: $250,000\n*Match 4+MB: $10,000\n*Match 4+0: $150\n*Match 3+MB: $150\n*Match 3+0: $7\n*Match 2+MB: $10\n*Match 1+MB: $3\n*Match 0+MB: $2\n\nPayouts in California remained [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel]].\n\nThe odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017): 1 in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were 1 in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a \"Mega Ball\"-only match.\n\nPrizes and odds (2013-2017 version) based on a $1 play:\n*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850\n*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; $ 1 in 17,259,390\n*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 \n*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835\n*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720\n*3+0: $5; 1 in 766\n*2+1: $5; 1 in 473\n*1+1: $2; 1 in 56\n*Mega Ball ''only'': $1; 1 in 21\n\nThe odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching ''none'' of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.\n\nThe annuity\u2014which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when ''The Big Game'' began\u2014changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.\n\n=== October 2017 format/price point change ===\nOn October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2; the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25.<ref>[blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/274243/mega-millions-lottery-tickets-will-go-from-1-to-2/ Mega Millions lottery tickets will go from $1 to $2]</ref> The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The \"Megaplier\" option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won; the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)\n\n=== April 2020 format change ===\nHowever in the new version regulations (which began on Saturday April 4, 2020 with the first drawing on Tuesday April 7) for Mega Millions, the minimum Mega Millions advertised [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] is $20&nbsp;million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing based upon sales the sales of everywhere;percent each year (unless the cash option is chosen; see below for differences by lotteries on cash/annuity choice regulations.) The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner.<ref name=wp2020 />\n\nMega Millions' non-California prize tiers effective April 5, 2020 (old prizes in parentheses; changed amounts in '''boldface''') for a $2 base play:\n\n* 5+MB: Jackpot; '''starting jackpot to $20 million (annuity value)'''\n* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)\n* 4+MB: '''$10,000''' ($5,000)\n* 4+0: $500 ($500)\n* 3+MB: '''$200''' ($50)\n* 3+0: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 2+MB: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 1+MB: '''$4''' ($2)\n* 0+MB: '''$2''' ($1)\n\nThe new prize structure allocates roughly 75 percent of the prize pool for the jackpot; this is, in part, to facilitate the new ''Just the Jackpot'' option. The 2013-2017 version allocated about 68 percent towards the jackpot.\n\n=== \"Just the Jackpot\" option ===\n\nIn preparation for the October 28, 2017 format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the '''choice''' of offering a $3, two-game play (called \"Just the Jackpot\"). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes; therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers.\n\nThese lotteries offered the \"Just the Jackpot\" option upon the format change: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. [[Kentucky]] has since added \"Just the Jackpot\", with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering \"Just the Jackpot\" beginning after the October 28, 2017 format change.\n\n\"Just the Jackpot\" wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers are terminal-generated; however, ''JtJ'' wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, while Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.\n\nAs of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a ''Just the Jackpot'' wager; there also is no known count of ''JtJ'' wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.\n\n=== Record jackpots ===\nThe largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.537 billion, was won on October 23, 2018 by one ticket, sold in South Carolina. This prize, the largest for one set of numbers in world history, was the second largest lottery payout, behind Powerball's $1.586 billion jackpot won on January 13, 2016 by multiple tickets. The record Mega Millions jackpot was claimed on March 5, 2019, with the winner choosing to remain anonymous under South Carolina law.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/03/04/mystery-winner-finally-claims-billion-mega-millions-jackpot-ending-months-speculation/]</ref>\n\nThe second-largest Mega Millions jackpot advertised as $640 million at the time of the drawing (annuitized) or $462 million (cash value), was drawn on March 30, 2012. The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million); brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher. The amount spent on Mega Millions for drawings following its previous jackpot win, on January 24, 2012, was at least $1.5 [[1,000,000,000|billion]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 31, 2012 |title=Mega Millions mania leads to disappointment in California |author1=Matt Stevens |author2=Carol J.

Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(<sub>75</sub>C<sub>5</sub>) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing; however, the odds will still remain the same.\n\nPayouts through October 18, 2013:\n{| cellspacing=3; class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Matches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n!rowspan=2|Prize\n!rowspan=2|Approximate probability of winning\n|-\n|White balls (pool of 56)\n|Mega Ball (pool of 46)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jackpot<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n|1 in 175,711,536 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2856+choose+5%29*46\n| title = (56 choose 5)*46\n| accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18| publisher = [[Google]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/mega-millions-jackpot-probability |publisher=Khan Academy |title=Mega Millions Jackpot Probability |author=Sal Khan}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $250,000\n|1 in 3,904,701 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746/45)<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%205%29*%2851%20choose%200%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 5)*(51 choose 0)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10,000\n|1 in 689,065<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 15,313<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 13,781<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10\n|1 in 844<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%202%29*%2851%20choose%203%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 2)*(51 choose 3)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $7\n|1 in 306<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $3\n|1 in 141<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%201%29*%2851%20choose%204%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 1)*(51 choose 4)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $2\n|1 in 74.8 (the probability for this prize was not 1:46, because there is the possibility of matching at least one of the \"white\" balls, which decreases the likelihood of matching ''only'' the \"Mega Ball\")<ref name=MMHow />\n|}\n\nOverall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes,<ref name=MMHow /> 1 in 40 of winning any prize.<ref name=\"Lotto numbers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |title=Lotto Numbers |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212014739/http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |archive-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn California, prize levels are paid on a [[parimutuel]] basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions.

Individually, the five white balls, several seconds apart, drop through a hole in the bottom of the mixing drum.\n\n=== Record jackpots (listed by ''cash value'') ===\n{{see also|Lottery jackpot records}}\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|Cash value (in millions USD)\n|Annuity value (in millions USD)\n!Drawing date\n!Winner(s)\n!Description\n|-\n|$878\n|$1,537\n|October 23, 2018<ref name=cbcnews2018 />\n|1 [[South Carolina Education Lottery|SC]]\n|World's largest jackpot (cash or annuity)\n|-\n|$474\n|$656\n|March 30, 2012\n|3 ([[Maryland Lottery|MD]], [[Kansas Lottery|KS]], [[Illinois|IL]])\n|World's third largest jackpot (cash or annuity)\n|-\n|$347.7<ref name=MM648MClaimAtlanta/>\n|$648<ref name=MM648M />\n|December 17, 2013\n|2 ([[California Lottery|CA]], [[Georgia Lottery|GA]])\n|Second-largest annuity value\n|-\n|$320\n|$543\n|July 24, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/group-of-co-workers-are-winners-of-543-million-mega-millions-jackpot.html|title=A group of 11 co-workers are the winners of a $543 million Mega Millions jackpot.

Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio's governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join ''The Big Game'', which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions''; shortly after, it became just ''Mega Millions''. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time ''The Big Game'' or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.\n\nIn 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scamfraudalert.com/f23/mega-millions-logo-officials-warn-lottery-scams-5259/ |title=Mega Millions Logo Officials Warn of Lottery scams |publisher=ScamFraudAlert |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nA budget impasse due to the [[2006 New Jersey Government shutdown]] led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the [[Atlantic City]] casinos and the [[New Jersey Lottery]]. Not only were New Jersey's in-house games (such as [[New Jersey Pick 6|Pick-6]]) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual. A similar shutdown happened in [[Minnesota]] on July 1, 2011.\n\nElecia Battle made national headlines in January 2004 when she claimed that she had lost the winning ticket in the December 30, 2003 Mega Millions drawing.<ref name=\"bbcnews\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3373077.stm| title = Women argue over 'lost' jackpot | publisher = BBC News | date = 2004-01-06 | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref> She then filed a lawsuit against the woman who had come forward with the ticket, Rebecca Jemison.

One such usage involved character [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes]] playing the sequence in a similar \"Mega Lotto\" game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the \"mega ball\" number) in the ''Lost'' sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene.

Based on [[R. L. Stine]]'s [[Goosebumps|children's horror book series of the same name]], it follows a teenager who tries to save his town with Stine's help after all the monsters from the ''Goosebumps'' franchise begin to escape from their books, wreaking havoc in the real world. The film stars [[Jack Black]], [[Dylan Minnette]], [[Odeya Rush]], [[Amy Ryan]], [[Ryan Lee (actor)|Ryan Lee]], and [[Jillian Bell]].\n\nThe development of a ''Goosebumps'' feature film adaptation began in 1998, with [[Tim Burton]] attached to direct. After failing to find a script to determine which book to adapt, the project was halted. In early 2008, [[Columbia Pictures]] acquired the rights to create a ''Goosebumps''-based film, and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from April to July 2014 in [[Candler Park]], [[Atlanta]].\n\n''Goosebumps'' was theatrically released in the United States on October 16, 2015, by Columbia Pictures. The film was a commercial and critical success, with praise for its humor, usage of the ''Goosebumps'' characters, and performances (especially Black's and Minnette's)<ref name=\"VarietyReview\">{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: 'Goosebumps'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/goosebumps-film-review-r-l-stine-1201608681/|accessdate=October 14, 2015|work=Variety|date=October 5, 2015}}</ref> and grossed $158 million against its $84 million budget.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-preview-goosebumps-could-831790|title=Box-Office Preview: 'Goosebumps' Could Out-Spook 'Crimson Peak,' 'Bridge of Spies'|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween]]'', was released on October 12, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter his father's recent death, Zach Cooper and his mother Gale move from [[New York City]] to the peaceful town of Madison, [[Delaware]]. While settling in the neighborhood, Zach meets his neighbor Hannah, but her overprotective father warns him to avoid contact with them. The next morning, at Madison High School, where Gale works as vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ, a clumsy student. That night, Hannah invites Zach to an abandoned [[amusement park]] where they start to befriend. However, when they return home, Hannah's father warns again that Zach should stay away or something bad will happen.\n\nThe following night, Gale leaves to supervise a dance at the school, leaving Zach with his aunt Lorraine Conyers. Fearing that Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks her father into going to the local police station while he and Champ enter in his home. While investigating, both find a bookshelf with numerous books from the [[Goosebumps|''Goosebumps'' franchise]], each mysteriously locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach opens ''The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena'', releasing the book's titular monster. With Hannah's help, they chase the creature to a local [[ice rink]] where Hannah's father appears and encloses the monster again the book.\n\nHannah's father unwittingly reveals that he is ''Goosebumps''<nowiki/> creator, [[R. L. Stine]].  Back home, the group encounters [[Slappy the Dummy]] from the ''Night of the Living Dummy'' books. As revenge for being locked up for years, Slappy burns his book and flees with all the others. Stine and the kids are attacked by the lawn gnomes from ''Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes'', being forced to escape. Slappy begins releasing several other monsters from their books, causing panic and destruction around Madison. Meanwhile, Lorraine is attacked by Fifi the Vampire Poodle from ''Please Don't Feed the Vampire!''.\n\nZach implores Stine to write a new book that can lock all the monsters back, but it can only be done with a supernatural [[typewriter]] in the school. Along the way, the group is attacked by The Invisible Boy from ''My Best Friend Is Invisible'' and the giant [[Mantis|praying mantis]] from ''A Shocker on Shock Street'', forcing them to hide in the local supermarket. The killer werewolf from ''[[The Werewolf of Fever Swamp]]'' chases them to the parking lot where he is run over by Lorraine, who survived Fifi's attack.\n\nStine and the kids go through a cemetery, where Zach realizes that Hannah shines in the moonlight, claiming to be Hannah Fairchild from \"The Ghost Next Door\",  before being attacked by [[Ghoul|ghouls]] from ''Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls''. When they arrive at the school, Zach confronts Stine in private; he reveals that his \"daughter\" is Hannah Fairchild from ''The Ghost Next Door'', and that he created her to face his loneliness, although Hannah is unaware of this. Stine finds the typewriter and begins writing a book based on the events around them, while Zach and Champ try to warn everyone, but nobody believes them until the mantis attacks the building. Slappy releases the rest of the monsters from the books and they storm the school. Despite the students and school staff's efforts to keep the monsters out, they break in nonetheless. Slappy finds Stine and breaks his fingers with the typewriter's case before he can finish the book. \n\nTo ensure everyone's safety, Stine and the kids trick them into following a school bus rigged with explosives while they board another bus to the abandoned amusement park. After realizing the group's ruse, Slappy tracks down and confronts them, he then releases the Blob from ''The Blob That Ate Everyone'' as the other monsters arrive at the park. Stine confronts the creature but is devoured while Zach, Hannah and Champ climb a [[ferris wheel]] to finish the book. However, the mantis causes it to collapse and roll towards the forest. Zach refuses to open the book, because Hannah will also be sucked in, but she reveals that she knew the truth about herself all along. Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the monsters inside, saying goodbye to Zach with a kiss before accepting her fate.\n\nSome time later, Stine starts working as a new teacher at Madison High School while starting to date Lorraine. After school, Stine reveals to Zach that he re-wrote Hannah back into reality with a new book. When Zach and Hannah leave school together, Stine burns Hannah's book, making her permanently real. However, when Stine is about to leave school, he looks at his typewriter writing by itself. To his horror, Brent Green was omitted in imprisonment, beginning to write a new ''Goosebumps'' book entitled ''The Invisible Boy's Revenge''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Goosebumps,_Jack_Black,_SDCC_2014_07.jpg\n| width1    = 100\n| image3    = OdeyaRush2011-1-.jpg\n| width3    = 100\n| image2    = Dylan_Minnette_2010.jpg\n| width2     = 107\n| footer      = [[Jack Black]],  [[Dylan Minnette]], and [[Odeya Rush]] starred in the film as R.

Based on [[R. L. Stine]]'s [[Goosebumps|children's horror book series of the same name]], it follows a teenager who tries to save his town with Stine's help after all the monsters from the ''Goosebumps'' franchise begin to escape from their books, wreaking havoc in the real world. The film stars [[Jack Black]], [[Dylan Minnette]], [[Odeya Rush]], [[Amy Ryan]], [[Ryan Lee (actor)|Ryan Lee]], and [[Jillian Bell]].\n\nThe development of a ''Goosebumps'' feature film adaptation began in 1998, with [[Tim Burton]] attached to direct. After failing to find a script to determine which book to adapt, the project was halted. In early 2008, [[Columbia Pictures]] acquired the rights to create a ''Goosebumps''-based film, and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from April to July 2014 in [[Candler Park]], [[Atlanta]].\n\n''Goosebumps'' was theatrically released in the United States on October 16, 2015, by Columbia Pictures. The film was a commercial and critical success, with praise for its humor, usage of the ''Goosebumps'' characters, and performances (especially Black's and Minnette's)<ref name=\"VarietyReview\">{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: 'Goosebumps'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/goosebumps-film-review-r-l-stine-1201608681/|accessdate=October 14, 2015|work=Variety|date=October 5, 2015}}</ref> and grossed $158 million against its $84 million budget.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-preview-goosebumps-could-831790|title=Box-Office Preview: 'Goosebumps' Could Out-Spook 'Crimson Peak,' 'Bridge of Spies'|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween]]'', was released on October 12, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter his father's recent death, Zach Cooper and his mother Gale move from [[New York City]] to the peaceful town of Madison, [[Delaware]]. While settling in the neighborhood, Zach meets his neighbor Hannah, but her overprotective father warns him to avoid contact with them. The next morning, at Madison High School, where Gale works as vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ, a clumsy student. That night, Hannah invites Zach to an abandoned [[amusement park]] where they start to befriend. However, when they return home, Hannah's father warns again that Zach should stay away or something bad will happen.\n\nThe following night, Gale leaves to supervise a dance at the school, leaving Zach with his aunt Lorraine Conyers. Fearing that Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks her father into going to the local police station while he and Champ enter in his home. While investigating, both find a bookshelf with numerous books from the [[Goosebumps|''Goosebumps'' franchise]], each mysteriously locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach opens ''The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena'', releasing the book's titular monster. With Hannah's help, they chase the creature to a local [[ice rink]] where Hannah's father appears and encloses the monster again the book.\n\nHannah's father unwittingly reveals that he is ''Goosebumps''<nowiki/> creator, [[R. L. Stine]].  Back home, the group encounters [[Slappy the Dummy]] from the ''Night of the Living Dummy'' books. As revenge for being locked up for years, Slappy burns his book and flees with all the others. Stine and the kids are attacked by the lawn gnomes from ''Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes'', being forced to escape. Slappy begins releasing several other monsters from their books, causing panic and destruction around Madison. Meanwhile, Lorraine is attacked by Fifi the Vampire Poodle from ''Please Don't Feed the Vampire!''.\n\nZach implores Stine to write a new book that can lock all the monsters back, but it can only be done with a supernatural [[typewriter]] in the school. Along the way, the group is attacked by The Invisible Boy from ''My Best Friend Is Invisible'' and the giant [[Mantis|praying mantis]] from ''A Shocker on Shock Street'', forcing them to hide in the local supermarket. The killer werewolf from ''[[The Werewolf of Fever Swamp]]'' chases them to the parking lot where he is run over by Lorraine, who survived Fifi's attack.\n\nStine and the kids go through a cemetery, where Zach realizes that Hannah shines in the moonlight before being attacked by [[Ghoul|ghouls]] from ''Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls''. When they arrive at the school, Zach confronts Stine in private; he reveals that his \"daughter\" is Hannah Fairchild from ''The Ghost Next Door'', and that he created her to face his loneliness, although Hannah is unaware of this. Stine finds the typewriter and begins writing a book based on the events around them, while Zach and Champ try to warn everyone, but nobody believes them until the mantis attacks the building. Slappy releases the rest of the monsters from the books and they storm the school. Despite the students and school staff's efforts to keep the monsters out, they break in nonetheless. Slappy finds Stine and breaks his fingers with the typewriter's case before he can finish the book. \n\nTo ensure everyone's safety, Stine and the kids trick them into following a school bus rigged with explosives while they board another bus to the abandoned amusement park. After realizing the group's ruse, Slappy tracks down and confronts them, he then releases the Blob from ''The Blob That Ate Everyone'' as the other monsters arrive at the park. Stine confronts the creature but is devoured while Zach, Hannah and Champ climb a [[ferris wheel]] to finish the book. However, the mantis causes it to collapse and roll towards the forest. Zach refuses to open the book, because Hannah will also be sucked in, but she reveals that she knew the truth about herself all along. Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the monsters inside, saying goodbye to Zach with a kiss before accepting her fate.\n\nSome time later, Stine starts working as a new teacher at Madison High School while starting to date Lorraine. After school, Stine reveals to Zach that he re-wrote Hannah back into reality with a new book. When Zach and Hannah leave school together, Stine burns Hannah's book, making her permanently real. However, when Stine is about to leave school, he looks at his typewriter writing by itself. To his horror, Brent Green was omitted in imprisonment, beginning to write a new ''Goosebumps'' book entitled ''The Invisible Boy's Revenge''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Goosebumps,_Jack_Black,_SDCC_2014_07.jpg\n| width1    = 100\n| image3    = OdeyaRush2011-1-.jpg\n| width3    = 100\n| image2    = Dylan_Minnette_2010.jpg\n| width2     = 107\n| footer      = [[Jack Black]],  [[Dylan Minnette]], and [[Odeya Rush]] starred in the film as R.

[http://syngen.co.uk/ Synaptyclypse Generator]</ref>\n\nThe ''Principia Discordia'', if read literally, encourages the worship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], known in [[Latin]] as [[Discordia]], the goddess of disorder, or archetypes and ideals associated with her. Depending on the version of Discordianism, Eris might be considered the goddess exclusively of disorder or the goddess of disorder and chaos. Both views are supported by the ''Principia Discordia''. The ''Principia Discordia'' holds three core principles: the Aneristic (order), the Eristic (disorder), and the notion that both are mere illusions. Due to these principles, a Discordian believes there is no distinction between order and disorder, since they are both man-made conceptual divisions of the pure element of chaos. An argument presented by the text is that it is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality as it is, chaos.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system,<ref>Rabinovitch, Shelly & Lewis, James.

[[Zeus]] believes that Eris is a troublemaker, so he does not invite her to [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]'s wedding. Having been snubbed, Eris creates a golden apple with the word ''kallisti'' ({{lang-grc|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7}}, to the prettiest one) inscribed in it. This, the [[Apple of Discord]], is a notable symbol in Discordianism for its inclusion in the Holy Chao, and is traditionally described as being made of gold (although whether that gold was metallic or [[Acapulco Gold|Acapulco]] is noted as uncertain<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principia Discordia|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781387762668|location=|page=00018}}</ref>).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html|title=JUDGEMENT OF PARIS - Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref>\n\nSome recent interpretations of the original snub place Eris as being not at all mischievous with her delivery of the apple, but instead suggest that Eris was simply bringing the apple as a wedding present for Thetis.

The following excerpt summarizes these principles:{{quote|text=The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.\n\nWith our concept-making apparatus called \"the brain\" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.\nThe ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled \"reality\" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see \"reality\" differently.\n\nIt is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.\nWe look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle.\n\nWestern philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.\n\nDisorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like \"relation\", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is \"absence of female-ness\", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.\n\nThe belief that \"order is true\" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.\nThe point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.<ref>Malaclypse the Younger. ''Principia Discordia''. p. 49-50.</ref>}}\n\n=== Operation Mindfuck ===\n[[Operation Mindfuck]]{{Definition needed|date=February 2019}} is an important practice in the Discordian religion. The concept was developed by [[Kerry Thornley]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] in 1968<ref name=\"Gorightly\">{{cite book|last=Gorightly|first=Adam|title=The Beast of Adam Gorightly: Collected Rantings (1992-2004)|publisher=Virtualbookworm Publishing|year=2005|page=163|chapter=The Prankster or The Manchurian Candidate?|isbn=978-1-58939-781-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fH_R_iP3yQ8C|accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref> and given its name by Wilson and [[Robert Shea]] in ''[[The Illuminatus!

Among those that have been published are ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', first published in 1965 (which includes portions of ''The Honest Book of Truth''); and ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', which had its first volume published in 1975.<ref>''[[Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati]]'' (1977), page 167. {{ISBN|1-56184-003-3}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Principia Discordia'' is a Discordian [[religious text]] written by Greg Hill ([[Malaclypse the Younger]]) with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst).The phrase ''Principia Discordia'', reminiscent of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', is presumably intended to mean ''Discordant Principles'', or ''Principles of Discordance''.<ref>In [[Latin]], ''discordia'' is not an adjective. It can be a singular noun by itself, meaning \"discord\", or, like ''principia'', be the plural of a noun \u2013 ''discordium'', also meaning \"discord\". In either case, the phrase consists of two juxtaposed nouns without a grammatical relationship.</ref>\n\n''Summa Universalia'' was another work by [[Malaclypse the Younger]], purported to be a summary of the universe. It was excerpted in the first edition of ''Principia'' but never published. It was mentioned in an introduction to one of the ''Principia'' editions, and the work was quoted from in the first edition.<ref>\"By no means is the Principia our only scripture.

[http://syngen.co.uk/ Synaptyclypse Generator]</ref>\n\nThe ''Principia Discordia'', if read literally, encourages the worship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], known in [[Latin]] as [[Discordia]], the goddess of disorder, or archetypes and ideals associated with her. Depending on the version of Discordianism, Eris might be considered the goddess exclusively of disorder or the goddess of disorder and chaos. Both views are supported by the ''Principia Discordia''. The ''Principia Discordia'' holds three core principles: the Aneristic (order), the Eristic (disorder), and the notion that both are mere illusions. Due to these principles, a Discordian believes there is no distinction between order and disorder, since they are both man-made conceptual divisions of the pure element of chaos. An argument presented by the text is that it is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality as it is, chaos.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system,<ref>Rabinovitch, Shelly & Lewis, James.

The following excerpt summarizes these principles:{{quote|text=The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.\n\nWith our concept-making apparatus called \"the brain\" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.\nThe ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled \"reality\" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see \"reality\" differently.\n\nIt is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.\nWe look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle.\n\nWestern philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.\n\nDisorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like \"relation\", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is \"absence of female-ness\", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.\n\nThe belief that \"order is true\" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.\nThe point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.<ref>Malaclypse the Younger.

BlueJ is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Blue was an integrated system with its own programming language and environment, and was a relative of the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] language. BlueJ implements the Blue environment design for the Java programming language.\n\nIn March 2009, the BlueJ project became [[free and open source software]], and licensed under [[GNU GPL]] with the [[Classpath exception#The classpath exception|classpath exception]].\n\nBlueJ is currently being maintained by a team at [[King's College London]], England, where K\u00f6lling works.\n\n== Functionality ==\n\nBlueJ has a simpler interface than most professional IDEs, but its functionality is not a subset of those kinds of environment. While many of the standard development tools exist, such as an editor, compiler and runtime environment, it also offers tools that are specific to its educational goals and not found in this form in common professional environments. These includes interactive object creation and method invocation (via the \"Object Bench\"), simplified debugging and teamwork controls, interactive, line-based expression and statement evaluation (via the \"Code Pad\"), and automated creation of JUnit classes from recordings of interactive test sequences.\n\n=== Visualisation ===\n\nThe BlueJ interface emphasises class structure (in preference of source code) by showing a UML-like diagram as its main screen. Class structures can be manipulated by the user, and the class relation display is generated automatically from the source code.\n\nSource level structure is visualised through ''scope highlighting'' (the visual emphasis of lexical scope through use of graphical frames and background colour).\n\n=== Interaction and experimentation ===\n\nSupported interaction features include the ability to create objects interactively for ad-hoc testing and experimentation, and support for interactive invocation of public methods. Parameters may be passed and objects can be composed in interactive calls.\n\nInteractive tests may be recorded and stored as standard unit test classes. Code fragments can be evaluated interactively in the Code Pad, which provides a Java-based [[REPL]].\n\n=== Supported languages ===\n\nBlueJ supports programming in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and in Stride.<ref>[http://stride-lang.net Stride]</ref> Java support has been provided in BlueJ since its inception, while Stride support was added in 2017.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software|Computer programming}}\n* [[Greenfoot]]\n* [[DrJava]]\n* [[Educational programming language]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book\n| first1    = David J.\n| last1     = Barnes\n| first2    = Michael\n| last2     = K\u00f6lling\n| date      = May 12, 2011\n| title     = Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using BlueJ\n| edition   = 5th\n| publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]\n| pages     = 560\n| isbn      = 978-0-13-249266-9\n| url       = http://www.pearsonhighered.com/pearsonhigheredus/educator/product/products_detail.page?isbn=9780132492669\n}}\n*{{Cite journal\n| first1    = Michael\n| last1     = K\u00f6lling\n| first2    = Bruce\n| last2     = Quig\n| first3    = Andrew\n| last3     = Patterson\n| first4    = John\n| last4     = Rosenberg\n| date      = Aug 9, 2010\n| title     = The BlueJ System and its Pedagogy\n| journal  = Computer Science Education\n| volume     = 13\n| issue     = 4\n| pages     = 249\u2013268\n| doi     = 10.1076/csed.13.4.249.17496\n| citeseerx     = 10.1.1.22.3975\n}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{Official website|http://www.bluej.org}}\n* [http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/ BlueJ textbook]\n\n{{Integrated development environments}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluej}}\n[[Category:Integrated development environments]]\n[[Category:Free integrated development environments]]\n[[Category:Cross-platform free software]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Java (programming language)]]\n[[Category:Java development tools]]\n[[Category:Java platform]]\n[[Category:Linux programming tools]]\n[[Category:Software development kits]]\n[[Category:MacOS programming tools]]\n[[Category:Programming tools for Windows]]\n[[Category:Linux software]]\n[[Category:Educational programming languages]]\n[[Category:Pedagogic integrated development environments]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox software\n| name                   = BlueJ\n| logo                   = BlueJ Logo.gif\n| logo size              = 96px\n| screenshot             = BlueJ screenshot.png\n| screenshot size        = 250px\n| caption                = Screenshot of BlueJ\n| author                 = [[Michael K\u00f6lling]] and [[John Rosenberg (academic)|John Rosenberg]]\n| developer              = BlueJ Team\n| status                 = Active\n| latest release version = 4.2.2\n| latest release date    = {{release date|2019|10|04}}<ref name=\"Ref_a\">{{cite web |url = https://www.bluej.org/versions.html |title = Version History |accessdate = 2019-08-12}}</ref>\n| operating system       = [[Cross-platform]]\n| platform               = [[Java (Sun)|Java]]\n| programming language   = [[Java (programming language)|Java]]\n| language               = [[Multilingual]]\n| genre                  = [[Integrated development environment]]\n| license                = [[GNU General Public License]] v2 with the [[GPL linking exception#The classpath exception|ClassPath exception]]\n| website                = {{url|http://bluej.org/}}\n}}\n'''BlueJ''' is an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], developed mainly for educational purposes, but also suitable for small-scale [[software development]].

Object-oriented concepts ([[Class (computer science)|classes]], [[Object (computer science)|objects]], communication through [[Method (computer science)|method calls]]) are represented visually and in its interaction design in the interface.Today BlueJ is used by schools in learning Java.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe development of BlueJ was started in 1999 by [[Michael K\u00f6lling]] and [[John Rosenberg (academic)|John Rosenberg]] at [[Monash University]], as a successor to the [[Blue programming language|Blue]]<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{cite web|title=An Object-Oriented Program Development Environment for the First Programming Course|url=https://kar.kent.ac.uk/21392/1/ObjectKolling.pdf|accessdate=2018-09-17}}</ref> system. BlueJ is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Blue was an integrated system with its own programming language and environment, and was a relative of the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] language. BlueJ implements the Blue environment design for the Java programming language.\n\nIn March 2009, the BlueJ project became [[free and open source software]], and licensed under [[GNU GPL]] with the [[Classpath exception#The classpath exception|classpath exception]].\n\nBlueJ is currently being maintained by a team at [[King's College London]], England, where K\u00f6lling works.\n\n== Functionality ==\n\nBlueJ has a simpler interface than most professional IDEs, but its functionality is not a subset of those kinds of environment. While many of the standard development tools exist, such as an editor, compiler and runtime environment, it also offers tools that are specific to its educational goals and not found in this form in common professional environments. These includes interactive object creation and method invocation (via the \"Object Bench\"), simplified debugging and teamwork controls, interactive, line-based expression and statement evaluation (via the \"Code Pad\"), and automated creation of JUnit classes from recordings of interactive test sequences.\n\n=== Visualisation ===\n\nThe BlueJ interface emphasises class structure (in preference of source code) by showing a UML-like diagram as its main screen. Class structures can be manipulated by the user, and the class relation display is generated automatically from the source code.\n\nSource level structure is visualised through ''scope highlighting'' (the visual emphasis of lexical scope through use of graphical frames and background colour).\n\n=== Interaction and experimentation ===\n\nSupported interaction features include the ability to create objects interactively for ad-hoc testing and experimentation, and support for interactive invocation of public methods. Parameters may be passed and objects can be composed in interactive calls.\n\nInteractive tests may be recorded and stored as standard unit test classes. Code fragments can be evaluated interactively in the Code Pad, which provides a Java-based [[REPL]].\n\n=== Supported languages ===\n\nBlueJ supports programming in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and in Stride.<ref>[http://stride-lang.net Stride]</ref> Java support has been provided in BlueJ since its inception, while Stride support was added in 2017.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software|Computer programming}}\n* [[Greenfoot]]\n* [[DrJava]]\n* [[Educational programming language]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book\n| first1    = David J.\n| last1     = Barnes\n| first2    = Michael\n| last2     = K\u00f6lling\n| date      = May 12, 2011\n| title     = Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using BlueJ\n| edition   = 5th\n| publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]\n| pages     = 560\n| isbn      = 978-0-13-249266-9\n| url       = http://www.pearsonhighered.com/pearsonhigheredus/educator/product/products_detail.page?isbn=9780132492669\n}}\n*{{Cite journal\n| first1    = Michael\n| last1     = K\u00f6lling\n| first2    = Bruce\n| last2     = Quig\n| first3    = Andrew\n| last3     = Patterson\n| first4    = John\n| last4     = Rosenberg\n| date      = Aug 9, 2010\n| title     = The BlueJ System and its Pedagogy\n| journal  = Computer Science Education\n| volume     = 13\n| issue     = 4\n| pages     = 249\u2013268\n| doi     = 10.1076/csed.13.4.249.17496\n| citeseerx     = 10.1.1.22.3975\n}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{Official website|http://www.bluej.org}}\n* [http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/ BlueJ textbook]\n\n{{Integrated development environments}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluej}}\n[[Category:Integrated development environments]]\n[[Category:Free integrated development environments]]\n[[Category:Cross-platform free software]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Java (programming language)]]\n[[Category:Java development tools]]\n[[Category:Java platform]]\n[[Category:Linux programming tools]]\n[[Category:Software development kits]]\n[[Category:MacOS programming tools]]\n[[Category:Programming tools for Windows]]\n[[Category:Linux software]]\n[[Category:Educational programming languages]]\n[[Category:Pedagogic integrated development environments]]\n", "name_user": "Mesospheric", "label": "safe", "comment": "Remove unnecessary sentence - the fact that BlueJ was \"developed mainly for educational purposes\" already exists in the opening line of the article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueJ"}
