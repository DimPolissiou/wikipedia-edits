Incoterms inform sales contracts defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer, but they do not themselves conclude a contract, determine the price payable, currency or credit terms, govern [[contract law]] or define where title to goods transfers.\n\nThe Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from the differing interpretations of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts<ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-guide-to-incoterms-2010 | title = ICC Guide to Incoterms\u00ae 2010 | access-date = March 14, 2014 | publisher = ICC}}</ref> worldwide.\n\n\"Incoterms\" is a registered [[trademark]] of the ICC.\n\nThe first work published by the ICC on international trade terms was issued in 1923, with the first edition known as Incoterms published in 1936.

''Incoterms 2020'' defines 11 rules, the same number as defined by ''Incoterms 2010''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2010 | title = Incoterms\u00ae 2010| publisher = ICC}}</ref> One rule of the 2010 version (\"Delivered at Terminal\"; DAT)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://iccwbo.org/publication/incoterms-rules-2020/ | title = From the introduction of Incoterms 2020 | publisher = ICC}}</ref> was removed, and is replaced by a new rule (\"Delivered at Place Unloaded\"; DPU) in the 2020 rules.\n\nThe insurance to be provided under terms CIF and CIP has also changed, increasing from Institute Cargo Clauses(C) to Institute Cargo Clauses(A). \n\nIn prior versions, the rules were divided into four categories, but the 11 pre-defined terms of ''Incoterms 2020'' are subdivided into two categories ''based only on method of delivery''. The larger group of seven rules may be used regardless of the method of transport, with the smaller group of four being applicable only to sales that solely involve transportation by water where the condition of the goods can be verified at the point of loading on board ship. They are therefore not to be used for containerized freight, other combined transport methods, or for transport by road, air or rail.\n\nIncoterms 2020 also formally defines delivery. Previously, the term had been defined informally but it is now defined as the point in the transaction where \"the risk of loss or damage [to the goods] passes from the seller to the buyer.\"<ref>Incoterms\u00ae 2020 English Edition</ref>\n\n==Incoterms in government regulations==\nIn some jurisdictions, the duty costs of the goods may be calculated against a specific Incoterm: for example in [[India]], duty is calculated against the CIF value of the goods,<ref>[http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp Brief on Customs Valuation<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305033924/http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp |date=5 March 2018 }} Directorate General of Valuation</ref> and in [[South Africa]] the duty is calculated against the FOB value of the goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|title=Valuation<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=sars.gov.za|access-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426074735/http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|archive-date=26 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because of this it is common for contracts for exports to these countries to use these Incoterms, even when they are not suitable for the chosen mode of transport. If this is the case then great care must be exercised to ensure that the points at which costs and risks pass are clarified with the customer.\n\n==Defined terms in Incoterms==\nThere are certain terms that have special meaning within Incoterms, and some of the more important ones are defined below:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Ray August; with revisions by Don|last2=Bixby|first2=Michael|title=International business law : text, cases, and readings|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Harlow [etc.]|isbn=978-0273768616|edition=6th ed., international}}</ref>\n* Delivery: The point in the transaction where the risk of loss or damage to the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer \n* Arrival: The point named in the Incoterm to which carriage has been paid\n* Free: Seller has an obligation to deliver the goods to a named place for transfer to a carrier\n* Carrier: Any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of transport by rail, road, air, sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes\n* [[Freight forwarder]]: A firm that makes or assists in the making of shipping arrangements;\n* Terminal: Any place, whether covered or not, such as a dock, warehouse, container yard or road, rail or air cargo terminal\n* To clear for export: To file Shipper\u2019s Export Declaration and get export permit\n\n==Variation of Incoterms==\nParties adopting Incoterms should be wary about their intention and variations. The desire of the parties should be expressed clearly and casual adoption should be refrained. Also, making additions or variations to the meaning of a certain term should be carefully done as parties' failure to use any trade term at all can produce unexpected results.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Rules for any mode of transport==\n\n==={{anchor|EXW|Ex Works}}EXW \u2013 Ex Works (named place of delivery)===\nThe seller makes the goods available at their premises, or at another named place. This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used while making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included.\n\nEXW means that a buyer incurs the risks for bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load the goods, he does so at buyer's risk and cost. If the parties agree that the seller should be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.\n\nThere is no obligation for the seller to make a contract of carriage, but there is also no obligation for the buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the goods on to their own customer for collection from the original seller's warehouse. However, in common practice the buyer arranges the collection of the freight from the designated location, and is responsible for clearing the goods through Customs. The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does have an obligation to obtain information and documents at the buyer's request and cost.\n\nThese documentary requirements may result in two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction they will be unable to clear the goods for export, meaning that the goods may be declared in the name of the seller by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer's responsibility under the EXW term.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf | title = Customs Information Paper (11) 89 | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = HMRC | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220180504/http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf | archive-date = 20 December 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nSecondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA ''seller's premises'', may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.strongandherd.co.uk/faqs/incoterms-rules/inco-question-7/ |title = Evidence of export | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = Strong & Herd}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|FCA|Free Carrier}}FCA \u2013 Free Carrier (named place of delivery)===\n\nThe seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, at a named place (possibly including the seller's own premises). The goods can be delivered to a carrier nominated by the buyer, or to another party nominated by the buyer.\n\nIn many respects this Incoterm has replaced FOB in modern usage, although the critical point at which the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place. The chosen place of delivery affects the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place.\n\nIf delivery occurs at the seller's premises, or at any other location that is under the seller's control, the seller is responsible for loading the goods on to the buyer's carrier. However, if delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is deemed to have delivered the goods once their transport has arrived at the named place; the buyer is responsible for both unloading the goods and loading them onto their own carrier.\n\n=== {{anchor|CPT|Carriage Paid To}}CPT \u2013 Carriage Paid To (named place of destination) ===\n\nCPT replaces the  C&F (cost and freight) and CFR terms for all shipping modes outside of non-containerized seafreight.\n\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named place of destination. However, the goods are considered to be delivered when the goods have been handed over to the first or main carrier, so that the risk transfers to buyer upon handing goods over to that carrier at the place of shipment in the country of Export.\n\nThe seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to the named place of destination (either the final destination such as the buyer's facilities or a port of destination. This has to be agreed to by seller and buyer, however).\n\nIf the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIP should be considered instead.\n\n==={{anchor|CIP|Carriage and Insurance Paid to}}CIP \u2013 Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)===\n\nThis term is broadly similar to the above CPT term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract, and should allow the buyer, the seller, and anyone else with an insurable interest in the goods to be able to make a claim.\n\nCIP can be used for all modes of transport, whereas the Incoterm CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea-freight.\n\n==={{anchor|DPU|Delivered At Place Unloaded}}DPU \u2013 Delivered At Place Unloaded (named place of destination)===\n\nThis Incoterm requires that the seller delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named place of destination. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until arrival at the destination port or terminal.\n\nThe terminal can be a Port, Airport, or inland freight interchange, but must be a facility with the capability to receive the shipment. If the seller is not able to organize unloading, they should consider shipping under DAP terms instead.\n\nAll charges after unloading (for example, Import duty, taxes, customs and on-carriage) are to be borne by buyer. However, it is important to note that any delay or demurrage charges at the terminal will generally be for the seller's account.\n\n==={{anchor|DAP|Delivered At Place}}DAP \u2013 Delivered At Place (named place of destination)===\n\nIncoterms 2010 defines DAP as 'Delivered at Place' \u2013 the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination. Under DAP terms, the risk passes from seller to buyer from the point of destination mentioned in the contract of delivery.\n\nOnce goods are ready for shipment, the necessary packing is carried out by the seller at his own cost, so that the goods reach their final destination safely. All necessary legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by the seller at his own cost and risk to clear the goods for export.\n\nAfter arrival of the goods in the country of destination, the customs clearance in the importing country needs to be completed by the buyer, e.g. import permit, documents required by customs and etc., including all customs duties and taxes.\n\nUnder DAP terms, all carriage expenses with any terminal expenses are paid by seller up to the agreed destination point. The necessary unloading cost at final destination has to be borne by buyer under DAP terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/incoterms-2010/the-incoterms-rules/|title=Incoterms\u00ae rules 2010 - ICC - International Chamber of Commerce|author=|date=|website=iccwbo.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.export.gov/faq/eg_main_043740.asp|title=Exporting FAQs - Expor.gov - export.gov|author=|date=|website=www.export.gov}}</ref>\n\n==={{Anchor|DDP|Delivered Duty Paid}}DDP \u2013 Delivered Duty Paid (named place of destination)===\n\nSeller is responsible for delivering the  goods to the named place in the country of the buyer, and pays all costs in bringing the goods to the destination including import duties and taxes. The seller is not responsible for unloading. This term is often used in place of the non-Incoterm \"Free In Store (FIS)\". This term places the maximum obligations on the seller and minimum obligations on the buyer. No risk or responsibility is transferred to the buyer until delivery of the goods at the named place of destination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incotermsexplained.com/the-incoterms-rules/the-eleven-rules-in-brief/delivered-duty-paid/|title=Delivered Duty Paid - Incoterms Explained|author=|date=|website=incotermsexplained.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most important consideration for DDP terms is that the seller is responsible for clearing the goods through customs in the buyer's country, including both paying the duties and taxes, and obtaining the necessary authorizations and registrations from the authorities in that country. Unless the rules and regulations in the buyer's country are very well understood, DDP terms can be a very big risk both in terms of delays and in unforeseen extra costs, and should be used with caution.\n\n==Rules for sea and inland waterway transport==\n\nTo determine if a location qualifies for these four rules, please refer to 'United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations ([[UN/LOCODE]])'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location.html|title=UN/LOCODE Code List by Country - Trade - UNECE|author=|date=|website=www.unece.org}}</ref>\n\nThe four rules defined by Incoterms 2010 for international trade where transportation is entirely conducted by water are as per the below. It is important to note that these terms are generally not suitable for shipments in shipping containers; the point at which risk and responsibility for the goods passes is when the goods are loaded on board the ship, and if the goods are sealed into a shipping container it is impossible to verify the condition of the goods at this point.\n\nAlso of note is that the point at which risk passes under these terms has shifted from previous editions of Incoterms, where the risk passed at the ship's rail.\n\n==={{anchor|Free Alongside Ship}}FAS \u2013 Free Alongside Ship (named port of shipment)===\nThe seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller to clear the goods for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.\n\n==={{anchor|Free on Board}}FOB \u2013 Free on Board (named port of shipment)===\n\n{{Main|FOB_(shipping)|label 1=FOB (Shipping)}}\n\nUnder FOB terms the seller bears all costs and risks up to the point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller's responsibility does not end at that point unless the goods are \"appropriated to the contract\" that is, they are \"clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods\".<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0132718979|title=International Business Law 6th Edition}}</ref> Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport. However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce. In some [[common law countries]] such as the [[United States|United States of America]], FOB is not only connected with the carriage of goods by sea but also used for inland carriage aboard any \"vessel, car or other vehicle.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Day|title=The law of international trade|date=2003|publisher=Butterworths|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0406921830|edition=3.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lawofinternation0000grif}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Cost and Freight}}CFR \u2013 Cost and Freight (named port of destination)===\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship in the country of Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.\n\n==={{anchor|Cost, Insurance and Freight}}CIF \u2013 Cost, Insurance & Freight (named port of destination)===\nThis term is broadly similar to the above CFR term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the [[bill of lading]]. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price.

Incoterms inform sales contracts defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer, but they do not themselves conclude a contract, determine the price payable, currency or credit terms, govern [[contract law]] or define where title to goods transfers.\n\nThe Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from the differing interpretations of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts<ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-guide-to-incoterms-2010 | title = ICC Guide to Incoterms\u00ae 2010 | access-date = March 14, 2014 | publisher = ICC}}</ref> worldwide.\n\n\"Incoterms\" is a registered [[trademark]] of the ICC.\n\nThe first work published by the ICC on international trade terms was issued in 1923, with the first edition known as Incoterms published in 1936.

The larger group of seven rules may be used regardless of the method of transport, with the smaller group of four being applicable only to sales that solely involve transportation by water where the condition of the goods can be verified at the point of loading on board ship. They are therefore not to be used for containerized freight, other combined transport methods, or for transport by road, air or rail.\n\nIncoterms 2020 also formally defines delivery. Previously, the term had been defined informally but it is now defined as the point in the transaction where \"the risk of loss or damage [to the goods] passes from the seller to the buyer.\"<ref>Incoterms\u00ae 2020 English Edition</ref>\n\n==Incoterms in government regulations==\nIn some jurisdictions, the duty costs of the goods may be calculated against a specific Incoterm: for example in [[India]], duty is calculated against the CIF value of the goods,<ref>[http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp Brief on Customs Valuation<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305033924/http://www.dov.gov.in/newsite3/brief_on_customs_valuation.asp |date=5 March 2018 }} Directorate General of Valuation</ref> and in [[South Africa]] the duty is calculated against the FOB value of the goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|title=Valuation<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=sars.gov.za|access-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426074735/http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Customs-Excise/Processing/Assessment/Pages/Valuation.aspx|archive-date=26 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because of this it is common for contracts for exports to these countries to use these Incoterms, even when they are not suitable for the chosen mode of transport. If this is the case then great care must be exercised to ensure that the points at which costs and risks pass are clarified with the customer.\n\n==Defined terms in Incoterms==\nThere are certain terms that have special meaning within Incoterms, and some of the more important ones are defined below:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Ray August; with revisions by Don|last2=Bixby|first2=Michael|title=International business law : text, cases, and readings|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Harlow [etc.]|isbn=978-0273768616|edition=6th ed., international}}</ref>\n* Delivery: The point in the transaction where the risk of loss or damage to the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer \n* Arrival: The point named in the Incoterm to which carriage has been paid\n* Free: Seller has an obligation to deliver the goods to a named place for transfer to a carrier\n* Carrier: Any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of transport by rail, road, air, sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes\n* [[Freight forwarder]]: A firm that makes or assists in the making of shipping arrangements;\n* Terminal: Any place, whether covered or not, such as a dock, warehouse, container yard or road, rail or air cargo terminal\n* To clear for export: To file Shipper\u2019s Export Declaration and get export permit\n\n==Variation of Incoterms==\nParties adopting Incoterms should be wary about their intention and variations. The desire of the parties should be expressed clearly and casual adoption should be refrained. Also, making additions or variations to the meaning of a certain term should be carefully done as parties' failure to use any trade term at all can produce unexpected results.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Rules for any mode of transport==\n\n==={{anchor|EXW|Ex Works}}EXW \u2013 Ex Works (named place of delivery)===\nThe seller makes the goods available at their premises, or at another named place. This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used while making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included.\n\nEXW means that a buyer incurs the risks for bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load the goods, he does so at buyer's risk and cost. If the parties agree that the seller should be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.\n\nThere is no obligation for the seller to make a contract of carriage, but there is also no obligation for the buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the goods on to their own customer for collection from the original seller's warehouse. However, in common practice the buyer arranges the collection of the freight from the designated location, and is responsible for clearing the goods through Customs. The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does have an obligation to obtain information and documents at the buyer's request and cost.\n\nThese documentary requirements may result in two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction they will be unable to clear the goods for export, meaning that the goods may be declared in the name of the seller by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer's responsibility under the EXW term.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf | title = Customs Information Paper (11) 89 | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = HMRC | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220180504/http://www.thamesvalleychamber.co.uk/uploads/Export_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf | archive-date = 20 December 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nSecondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA ''seller's premises'', may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.strongandherd.co.uk/faqs/incoterms-rules/inco-question-7/ |title = Evidence of export | accessdate = December 13, 2016 | publisher = Strong & Herd}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|FCA|Free Carrier}}FCA \u2013 Free Carrier (named place of delivery)===\n\nThe seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, at a named place (possibly including the seller's own premises). The goods can be delivered to a carrier nominated by the buyer, or to another party nominated by the buyer.\n\nIn many respects this Incoterm has replaced FOB in modern usage, although the critical point at which the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place. The chosen place of delivery affects the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place.\n\nIf delivery occurs at the seller's premises, or at any other location that is under the seller's control, the seller is responsible for loading the goods on to the buyer's carrier. However, if delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is deemed to have delivered the goods once their transport has arrived at the named place; the buyer is responsible for both unloading the goods and loading them onto their own carrier.\n\n=== {{anchor|CPT|Carriage Paid To}}CPT \u2013 Carriage Paid To (named place of destination) ===\n\nCPT replaces the  C&F (cost and freight) and CFR terms for all shipping modes outside of non-containerized seafreight.\n\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named place of destination. However, the goods are considered to be delivered when the goods have been handed over to the first or main carrier, so that the risk transfers to buyer upon handing goods over to that carrier at the place of shipment in the country of Export.\n\nThe seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to the named place of destination (either the final destination such as the buyer's facilities or a port of destination. This has to be agreed to by seller and buyer, however).\n\nIf the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIP should be considered instead.\n\n==={{anchor|CIP|Carriage and Insurance Paid to}}CIP \u2013 Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)===\n\nThis term is broadly similar to the above CPT term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract, and should allow the buyer, the seller, and anyone else with an insurable interest in the goods to be able to make a claim.\n\nCIP can be used for all modes of transport, whereas the Incoterm CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea-freight.\n\n==={{anchor|DPU|Delivered At Place Unloaded}}DPU \u2013 Delivered At Place Unloaded (named place of destination)===\n\nThis Incoterm requires that the seller delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named place of destination. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until arrival at the destination port or terminal.\n\nThe terminal can be a Port, Airport, or inland freight interchange, but must be a facility with the capability to receive the shipment. If the seller is not able to organize unloading, they should consider shipping under DAP terms instead.\n\nAll charges after unloading (for example, Import duty, taxes, customs and on-carriage) are to be borne by buyer. However, it is important to note that any delay or demurrage charges at the terminal will generally be for the seller's account.\n\n==={{anchor|DAP|Delivered At Place}}DAP \u2013 Delivered At Place (named place of destination)===\n\nIncoterms 2010 defines DAP as 'Delivered at Place' \u2013 the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination. Under DAP terms, the risk passes from seller to buyer from the point of destination mentioned in the contract of delivery.\n\nOnce goods are ready for shipment, the necessary packing is carried out by the seller at his own cost, so that the goods reach their final destination safely. All necessary legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by the seller at his own cost and risk to clear the goods for export.\n\nAfter arrival of the goods in the country of destination, the customs clearance in the importing country needs to be completed by the buyer, e.g. import permit, documents required by customs and etc., including all customs duties and taxes.\n\nUnder DAP terms, all carriage expenses with any terminal expenses are paid by seller up to the agreed destination point. The necessary unloading cost at final destination has to be borne by buyer under DAP terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/incoterms-2010/the-incoterms-rules/|title=Incoterms\u00ae rules 2010 - ICC - International Chamber of Commerce|author=|date=|website=iccwbo.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.export.gov/faq/eg_main_043740.asp|title=Exporting FAQs - Expor.gov - export.gov|author=|date=|website=www.export.gov}}</ref>\n\n==={{Anchor|DDP|Delivered Duty Paid}}DDP \u2013 Delivered Duty Paid (named place of destination)===\n\nSeller is responsible for delivering the  goods to the named place in the country of the buyer, and pays all costs in bringing the goods to the destination including import duties and taxes. The seller is not responsible for unloading. This term is often used in place of the non-Incoterm \"Free In Store (FIS)\". This term places the maximum obligations on the seller and minimum obligations on the buyer. No risk or responsibility is transferred to the buyer until delivery of the goods at the named place of destination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incotermsexplained.com/the-incoterms-rules/the-eleven-rules-in-brief/delivered-duty-paid/|title=Delivered Duty Paid - Incoterms Explained|author=|date=|website=incotermsexplained.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most important consideration for DDP terms is that the seller is responsible for clearing the goods through customs in the buyer's country, including both paying the duties and taxes, and obtaining the necessary authorizations and registrations from the authorities in that country. Unless the rules and regulations in the buyer's country are very well understood, DDP terms can be a very big risk both in terms of delays and in unforeseen extra costs, and should be used with caution.\n\n==Rules for sea and inland waterway transport==\n\nTo determine if a location qualifies for these four rules, please refer to 'United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations ([[UN/LOCODE]])'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location.html|title=UN/LOCODE Code List by Country - Trade - UNECE|author=|date=|website=www.unece.org}}</ref>\n\nThe four rules defined by Incoterms 2010 for international trade where transportation is entirely conducted by water are as per the below. It is important to note that these terms are generally not suitable for shipments in shipping containers; the point at which risk and responsibility for the goods passes is when the goods are loaded on board the ship, and if the goods are sealed into a shipping container it is impossible to verify the condition of the goods at this point.\n\nAlso of note is that the point at which risk passes under these terms has shifted from previous editions of Incoterms, where the risk passed at the ship's rail.\n\n==={{anchor|Free Alongside Ship}}FAS \u2013 Free Alongside Ship (named port of shipment)===\nThe seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller to clear the goods for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.\n\n==={{anchor|Free on Board}}FOB \u2013 Free on Board (named port of shipment)===\n\n{{Main|FOB_(shipping)|label 1=FOB (Shipping)}}\n\nUnder FOB terms the seller bears all costs and risks up to the point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller's responsibility does not end at that point unless the goods are \"appropriated to the contract\" that is, they are \"clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods\".<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0132718979|title=International Business Law 6th Edition}}</ref> Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport. However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce. In some [[common law countries]] such as the [[United States|United States of America]], FOB is not only connected with the carriage of goods by sea but also used for inland carriage aboard any \"vessel, car or other vehicle.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Day|title=The law of international trade|date=2003|publisher=Butterworths|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0406921830|edition=3.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lawofinternation0000grif}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Cost and Freight}}CFR \u2013 Cost and Freight (named port of destination)===\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship in the country of Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.\n\n==={{anchor|Cost, Insurance and Freight}}CIF \u2013 Cost, Insurance & Freight (named port of destination)===\nThis term is broadly similar to the above CFR term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the [[bill of lading]]. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea freight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.\n\n==Allocations of costs to buyer/seller according to Incoterms 2020==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Incoterm 2020\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Loading at origin\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Export customs declaration\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Carriage to port of export\n| align=\"LEFT\"| Unloading of truck in port of export\n| align=\"center\"| Loading on vessel/airplane in port of export\n| align=\"center\"| Carriage (sea/air) to port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Insurance\n| align=\"center\"| Unloading in port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Loading on truck in port of import\n| align=\"center\"| Carriage to place of destination\n| align=\"center\"| Import customs clearance\n| align=\"center\"| Import duties and taxes\n| align=\"center\"| Unloading at destination\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|EXW|Ex Works}} \n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FCA|Free Carrier}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FAS|Free Alongside Ship}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|FOB|Free On Board}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CPT|Carriage Paid To}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CFR|Cost and Freight}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CIF|Cost, Insurance and Freight}} \n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|CIP|Carriage and Insurance Paid to}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{Maybe|Buyer/Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DPU|Delivered At Place Unloaded}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DAP|Delivered At Place}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|{{Abbr|DDP|Delivered Duty Paid}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{Yes|Seller}}\n|{{No|Buyer}}\n|}\n\nnb.

It spent two weeks atop the ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the ''[[USA Today]]'' bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] format. A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] in 2010.\n\nIn her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels. ''Vision in White'' was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints. When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works.\n\nThe novel marked Roberts' return to [[contemporary romance]]. The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. Like several other Roberts novels, ''Vision in White'' explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment. Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love.\n\n==Background==\n[[Nora Roberts]] is a prolific author of [[romance novel|romance]] and futuristic suspense novels.<ref name=kopun>{{citation|last=Kopun|first=Francine|title=Nora Roberts, a bestselling author rarely reviewed|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=October 19, 2009|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2009/10/19/nora_roberts_a_bestselling_author_rarely_reviewed.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> From 1979 through 2008, almost 200 of her novels were published.

Mac and her childhood friends Parker, Emma, and Laurel are the founders of Vows, a fictional wedding planning company in Connecticut. While accompanying his sister to a planning session at Vows, Carter renews his acquaintance with Mac, and confesses that he had been infatuated with her since high school. She is intrigued by his honesty and earnestness and decides to embark on a casual fling with him.\n\nAfter seeing her parents' numerous failed marriages, Mac does not trust the idea of commitment. Her determination to avoid emotional intimacy is reinforced as she struggles against her mother's continued tactics of [[emotional manipulation]].\n\nTheir relationship progresses slowly through the book. Each protagonist receives much advice from a large circle of friends and family. With the support of her friends and Carter, Mac develops the courage to stand up to her mother. By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:NoraRoberts.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Author [[Nora Roberts]]]]\nThe four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood. The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice. Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks. Focused on their careers, the heroines have little time for outside relationships, and they rely heavily on each other for comfort, help, and distractions.<ref name=snodgrass85>Snodgrass (2010), p. 85.</ref> A similar theme is seen in several of Roberts' other works; her [[In Death]] series, written as J.

Many were delighted to see Roberts return to traditional contemporary romances, minus the elements of fantasy and magic that had woven through her more recent novels. Some praised the tight bonds of sisterhood that Roberts created for the four founders of Vows, but other readers complained that the character voices were too similar.

It spent two weeks atop the ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the ''[[USA Today]]'' bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] format.  A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] in 2010.\n\nIn her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels.  ''Vision in White'' was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints.  When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works.\n\nThe novel marked Roberts' return to [[contemporary romance]].  The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends.  This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire.  Like several other Roberts novels, ''Vision In White'' explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment.  Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love.\n\n==Background==\n[[Nora Roberts]] is a prolific author of [[romance novel|romance]] and futuristic suspense novels.<ref name=kopun>{{citation|last=Kopun|first=Francine|title=Nora Roberts, a bestselling author rarely reviewed|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=October 19, 2009|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2009/10/19/nora_roberts_a_bestselling_author_rarely_reviewed.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>  From 1979 through 2008, almost 200 of her novels were published.  On average, she completed a book every 45 days.  She does not outline the novels in advance or create character biographies, preferring to develop the plot as she goes.<ref name=collins>{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Lauren|title=Real romance|date=June 22, 2009|newspaper=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/22/real-romance-2|accessdate=June 10, 2015|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', three of the top-ten bestselling [[mass market paperbacks]] of 2008 were Roberts novels.<ref name=collins/> Her new releases focused primarily on [[paranormal romance|paranormal]] and fantasy romance.

Five of the releases were paperback reprints of books previously issued.  Three were new hardcovers, including two published under the pseudonym J. D. Robb.  ''Vision in White'' and its sequel, ''Bed of Roses'', were released in [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]].<ref name=memmott>{{citation|last=Memmott|first=Carol|title=Book a literary-lovers room at Nora Roberts' romantic inn|newspaper=USA Today|date=February 13, 2009|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2009-02-11-nora-roberts_N.htm|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> To help readers differentiate the new releases from the reprints, the covers of the two trade paperbacks included a medallion with the initials NR.<ref name=memmott/>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel follows the relationship of photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English teacher Carter Maguire.  Mac and her childhood friends Parker, Emma, and Laurel are the founders of Vows, a fictional wedding planning company in Connecticut. While accompanying his sister to a planning session at Vows, Carter renews his acquaintance with Mac, and confesses that he had been infatuated with her since high school.  She is intrigued by his honesty and earnestness and decides to embark on a casual fling with him.\n\nAfter seeing her parents' numerous failed marriages, Mac does not trust the idea of commitment.  Her determination to avoid emotional intimacy is reinforced as she struggles against her mother's continued tactics of [[emotional manipulation]].\n\nTheir relationship progresses slowly through the book.  Each protagonist receives much advice from a large circle of friends and family.  With the support of her friends and Carter, Mac develops the courage to stand up to her mother.  By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:NoraRoberts.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Author [[Nora Roberts]]]]\nThe four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood.  The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice.  Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks. Focused on their careers, the heroines have little time for outside relationships, and they rely heavily on each other for comfort, help, and distractions.<ref name=snodgrass85>Snodgrass (2010), p. 85.</ref>  A similar theme is seen in several of Roberts' other works; her [[In Death]] series, written as J. D. Robb, has a heroine who has created a family from female friends and colleagues.<ref name=snodgrass86>Snodgrass (2010), p. 86.</ref>\n\nAccording to critic [[Betsy Prioleau]], ''Vision In White'''s hero is a typical representation of one of the eight [[archetype]]s of a romance hero: the professor.<ref name=prioleau/> Several scenes in the novel show him teaching students or in parent-teacher conferences.<ref name=snodgrass86/>  Like most intellectual romance heroes, Carter is a \"sober good guy\", and the heroine is attracted to him primarily for his mind.<ref name=prioleau>Prioleau (2013), Chapter 5.</ref>  In an unusual twist for a romance novel, however, the hero is the character who is ready for a commitment but must help the heroine overcome her fears.<ref name=pw/>  After seeing her mother divorce four husbands and discard countless boyfriends, Mac prefers to avoid emotional intimacy rather than risk the relationship splintering.<ref name=snodgrass88/>  Carter provides reassurance that their relationship is built on a solid foundation.<ref name=snodgrass89>Snodgrass (2010), p. 89.</ref>\n\nCritic [[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]] calls ''Vision In White'' a story of the [[New Woman]], with a strong heroine who is extremely proud of her significant career accomplishments.<ref name=snodgrass66>Snodgrass (2010), p. 66.</ref>  Roberts uses the heroine's choices of how to pose or spotlight her photography clients as pointed ways of celebrating both monogamy and \"unconventional views of femininity\".<ref name=snodgrass87>Snodgrass (2010), p. 87.</ref>  In one scene, Mac convinces a heavily pregnant woman to pose nude, despite her feelings of awkwardness; through the resulting photos, the client comes to believe that she is actually beautiful.<ref name=snodgrass88>Snodgrass (2010), p. 88.</ref><ref name=snodgrass87/>  In another poke at traditional stereotypes, Mac photographs a bride and groom posing together on a horse, evoking the metaphor of a knight coming to rescue the princess\u2014but the couple are equals.<ref name=snodgrass87/>\n\nRoberts contrasts Mac's competence in business matters with her difficulties in dealing with an extremely dysfunctional family, a theme Roberts had previously used in the Chesapeake Bay Series (''Rising Tides'', ''[[Sea Swept]]'', and ''Inner Harbor'') and the Calhoun Series.<ref name=snodgrass66/> In ''Visions in White'', the family difficulties are caused by the heroine's mother, who is essentially a cross between the mothers in ''[[Carolina Moon (novel)|Carolina Moon]]'' and ''Tribute''.<ref name=snodgrass66/>   Roberts shows that, as a result of her family's dysfunction, Mac has chosen to distance herself from deeper emotions.<ref name=snodgrass67/> The camera allows Mac to interact with other people's happiness and lives without having to fully participate; as the book progresses, she gradually develops the courage to come out of her shell and fully participate in life.<ref name=snodgrass67>Snodgrass (2010), p. 67.</ref>\n\nThe use of the wedding industry is, per Snodgrass, \"a wry reprise of Roberts' career in fictional matchmaking\".<ref name=snodgrass66/>  The novel celebrates the joy of a traditional wedding ceremony,<ref name=snodgrass67/> including the playful ceremonies arranged by children playing dress-up.  Roberts' treatment of these themes \"validates the dress-up game of playing bride as both fantasy and a stabilizing preface on women's devotion to mate and family\".<ref name=snodgrass66/>  Roberts included significant detail on the wedding planning industry, which Snodgrass posits is meant to highlight and celebrate the success the female characters had at niche marketing.<ref name=snodgrass67/>\n\n==Reception==\nJill M. Smith in ''[[Romantic Times]]'' gave the novel four out of five stars, labeling it a \"wonderful and cozy read\".<ref name=smith/> A ''Publishers Weekly'' review highlighted the \"gentle humor and likable cast\" and predicted that readers would be eager to follow the characters through the rest of the series.<ref name=pw>{{citation|title=Vision in White|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=May 2009|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-425-22751-0|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> In ''[[Booklist]]'', John Charles called the novel \"thoroughly charming\" and lauded the deep characterization and \"sharp, clever writing\" that combined to celebrate \"friendship and love\".<ref name=charles/>\n\nIn a survey of readers, Snodgrass found mixed opinions.  Many were delighted to see Roberts return to traditional contemporary romances, minus the elements of fantasy and magic that had woven through her more recent novels.

This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs such as [[orange juice]] and other orange (''[[Citrus]]'' species) products, both of the \"sweet\" and \"bitter\" variety. The preparations used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM), also known as Zhi Shi, are the immature and dried whole oranges from ''[[Citrus aurantium]]'' (Fructus Aurantii Immaturus). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the US, sometimes in combination with [[caffeine]], as a weight-loss-promoting [[dietary supplement]] for oral consumption. While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved OTC drug. As a pharmaceutical, ''m''-synephrine ([[phenylephrine]]) is still used as a [[sympathomimetic]] (i.e. for its [[hypertensive]] and [[vasoconstrictor]] properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with [[asthma]] and [[hay-fever]].{{efn|Synephrine does however not appear in the current FDA [[Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations|\"Orange Book\"]] or the 2012 ''[[Physicians' Desk Reference]]''.}}\n\nIt is important to distinguish between studies concerning synephrine as a single chemical entity (synephrine can exist in the form of either of two [[stereoisomers]], d- and l-synephrine, which are chemically and pharmacologically distinct), and synephrine which is mixed with other drugs and/or botanical extracts in a \"Supplement\", as well as synephrine which is present as only one chemical component in a naturally-occurring mixture of [[phytochemicals]] such as the rind or fruit of a bitter orange. Mixtures containing synephrine as only one of their chemical components (regardless of whether these are of synthetic or natural origin) should not be assumed to produce exactly the same biological effects as synephrine alone.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wagner H., Ulrich-Merzenich G. | year = 2009 | title = Synergy research: approaching a new generation of phytopharmaceuticals | url = | journal = Phytomed | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 97\u2013110 }}</ref>\n\nIn physical appearance, synephrine is a colorless, crystalline solid and is water-soluble.

This intermediate was then hydrolyzed with HCl/alcohol to the ''p''-hydroxy-aminoketone, and the product then reduced catalytically to give (racemic) synephrine.\n\nA later synthesis, due to Bergmann and Sulzbacher, began with the ''O''-benzylation of ''p''-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, followed by a [[Reformatsky reaction|Reformatskii reaction]] of the protected aldehyde with ethyl bromoacetate/Zn to give the expected \u03b2-hydroxy ester.

However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to a very large number of other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others are not, making unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate.\n\nThus, replacement of the ''N''-[[methyl]] group in synephrine with a hydrogen atom gives [[octopamine]]; replacement of the \u03b2-[[hydroxyl|hydroxy]] group in synephrine by a H atom gives [[N-methyltyramine|''N''-methyltyramine]]; replacement of the synephrine [[phenol]]ic 4-OH group by a \u2013H gives [[halostachine]].\n\nIf the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group is shifted to the ''meta''-, or 3-position on the benzene ring, the compound known as phenylephrine (or ''m''-synephrine, or \"Neo-synephrine\") results; if the same group is shifted to the ''ortho''-, or 2-position on the ring, ''o''-synephrine results.\n\nAddition of another phenolic \u2013OH group to the 3-position of the benzene ring produces the [[neurotransmitter]] [[epinephrine]]; addition of a [[methyl]] group to the \u03b1-position in the side-chain of synephrine gives [[oxilofrine]] (methylsynephrine). Four stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers) are possible for this substance.\n\nExtension of the synephrine ''N''-methyl substituent by one [[methylene bridge|methylene]] unit to an ''N''-[[ethyl group|ethyl]] gives the [[hypotensive]] experimental drug \"Sterling #573\"/\"Aethyl-Sympatol\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lands A.

However, the structure of ephedrine differs from that of synephrine at ''two'' different positions: ephedrine has no substituent on the phenyl ring where synephrine has a 4-OH group, and ephedrine has a methyl group on the position \u03b1- to the N in the side-chain, where syneprine has only a H atom. Furthermore, \"synephrine\" exists as either of two enantiomers, while \"ephedrine\" exists as one of four different enantiomers; there are, in addition, racemic mixtures of these enantiomers.\n\nThe main differences of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the [[ephedrine]]s are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the ephedrines are both direct and indirect sympathomimetics. One of the main reasons for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs.<ref>McCulloch J, Deshmukh VD, Harper AM (1978). Indirect sympathomimetic agents and cerebral blood flow and metabolism ''Eur J Pharmacol'' 47(1):11-8. PMID 412682</ref>\n\n==Pharmacology==\n\n===Synopsis===\nClassical pharmacological studies on animals and isolated animal tissues showed that the principal actions of parenterally-administered synephrine included raising blood-pressure, dilating the pupil, and constricting peripheral blood vessels.\n\nThere is now ample evidence<sup>(what evidence?)</sup> that synephrine produces most of its biological effects by acting as an [[agonist]] (i.e. stimulating) at adrenergic receptors, with a distinct preference for the \u03b1<sub>1</sub> over the  \u03b1<sub>2</sub> sub-type. However, the potency of synephrine at these receptors is relatively low (i.e. relatively large concentrations of the drug are required to activate them). The potency of synephrine at adrenergic receptors of the \u03b2-class (regardless of sub-type) is much lower than at \u03b1-receptors. There is some evidence that synephrine also has weak activity at [[5-HT receptors]], and that it interacts with [[TAAR1]] (trace amine-associated receptor 1).\n\nIn common with virtually all other simple phenylethanolamines (\u03b2-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (''R'')-(\u2212)-, or l-, enantiomer of synephrine is more potent than the (''S'')-(+)-, or d-, enantiomer in most, but not all preparations studied. However, the majority of studies have been conducted with a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.\n\nSince the details regarding such variables as test species, receptor source, route of administration, drug concentration, and stereochemical composition are important but often incomplete in other Reviews and Abstracts of research publications, many are provided in the more technical review below, in order to support as fully as possible the broad statements made in this Synopsis.\n\n===Pharmacology research===\nPharmacological studies on synephrine date back to the late 1920s, when it was observed that injected synephrine raised blood pressure, constricted peripheral blood vessels, dilated pupils, stimulated the uterus, and relaxed the intestines in experimental animals.<ref name = Las/><ref name = Las/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Ehrismann O., Maloff G. | year = 1928 | title = \u00dcber zwei Gifte der Adrenalingruppe (''p''-Oxyphenyl\u00e4thanolmethylamin und sein Keton | url = | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archiv f\u00fcr Experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie | volume = 136 | issue = | pages = 172\u2013184 }}</ref><ref>G.

These effects lasted 2\u20133 minutes, peaking at ~30 seconds after administration. l-Synephrine was thus the more potent enantiomer, with about 1/60x the potency of the standard pressor l-epinephrine in the same assay.\nA later study, by Lands and Grant, showed that a dose of ~0.6&nbsp;mg/kg of racemic synephrine, given intravenously to anesthetized dogs, produced a rise in blood pressure of 34&nbsp;mmHg lasting 5\u201310 minutes, and estimated that this pressor activity was about 1/300x that of epinephrine.<ref name = Lands>{{cite journal | author = Lands A.

Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and phenylephrine, they are nevertheless different substances. The confusion is compounded by the fact that synephrine has been marketed as a drug under numerous different names, including ''Sympatol'', ''Sympathol'', ''Synthenate'', and ''oxedrine'', while phenylephrine has also been called ''m-Sympatol''. The synephrine with which this article deals is sometimes referred to as ''p-synephrine'' in order to distinguish it from its positional isomers, ''m''-synephrine and ''o''-synephrine. A comprehensive listing of alternative names for synephrine may be found in the ChemSpider entry (see Chembox, at right). Confusion over the distinctions between ''p''- and ''m''-synephrine has even contaminated the primary research literature.{{efn|For example, a recent review paper concerning the use of synephrine-containing nutritional supplements states that: \"There is no consensus regarding which synephrine\u2019s positional isomers are present in CA [''Citrus aurantium'']. The majority of authors state that only ''p''-synephrine can be found in CA fruits...although others claim that ''m''-synephrine is also present...\"<ref name=\"G. Rossato, V. M 2011\">L. G.

Thus the Abstract is at variance with the experimental findings given in the full text of the paper, but this error has propagated through subsequent publications.}}\nEven the name \"''p''-synephrine\" is not unambiguous, since it does not specify stereochemistry.

Sulzbacher (1951). \"A new synthesi of 1-(''m''- and ''p''-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methylaminoethanol (''m''- and ''p''-sympathol).\" ''J. Org. Chem.'' '''16''' 84-89.</ref>\n\n===Structural relationships===\nMuch reference has been made in the literature (both lay and professional) of the structural kinship of synephrine with [[ephedrine]], or with [[phenylephrine]], often with the implication that the perceived similarities in structure should result in similarities in pharmacological properties. However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to a very large number of other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others are not, making unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate.\n\nThus, replacement of the ''N''-[[methyl]] group in synephrine with a hydrogen atom gives [[octopamine]]; replacement of the \u03b2-[[hydroxyl|hydroxy]] group in synephrine by a H atom gives [[N-methyltyramine|''N''-methyltyramine]]; replacement of the synephrine [[phenol]]ic 4-OH group by a \u2013H gives [[halostachine]].\n\nIf the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group is shifted to the ''meta''-, or 3-position on the benzene ring, the compound known as phenylephrine (or ''m''-synephrine, or \"Neo-synephrine\") results; if the same group is shifted to the ''ortho''-, or 2-position on the ring, ''o''-synephrine results.\n\nAddition of another phenolic \u2013OH group to the 3-position of the benzene ring produces the [[neurotransmitter]] [[epinephrine]]; addition of a [[methyl]] group to the \u03b1-position in the side-chain of synephrine gives [[oxilofrine]] (methylsynephrine). Four stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers) are possible for this substance.\n\nExtension of the synephrine ''N''-methyl substituent by one [[methylene bridge|methylene]] unit to an ''N''-[[ethyl group|ethyl]] gives the [[hypotensive]] experimental drug \"Sterling #573\"/\"Aethyl-Sympatol\".<ref>A. M. Lands, E. E. Rickards, V. L. Nash, and K. Z. Hooper (1947). \"The pharmacology of vasodepressor compounds structurally related to the sympathomimetic amines.\" ''J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.''

Unna (1951). \"Pharmakologische Untersuchungen \u00fcber neue Sympatolabk\u00f6mmlinge.\" ''Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archiv f\u00fcr Experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie'' '''213''' 207-234.</ref>\n\nThe above structural relationships all involve a change at ''one'' position in the synephrine molecule, and numerous other similar changes, many of which have been explored, are possible. However, the structure of ephedrine differs from that of synephrine at ''two'' different positions: ephedrine has no substituent on the phenyl ring where synephrine has a 4-OH group, and ephedrine has a methyl group on the position \u03b1- to the N in the side-chain, where syneprine has only a H atom. Furthermore, \"synephrine\" exists as either of two enantiomers, while \"ephedrine\" exists as one of four different enantiomers; there are, in addition, racemic mixtures of these enantiomers.\n\nThe main differences of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the [[ephedrine]]s are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the ephedrines are both direct and indirect sympathomimetics. One of the main reasons for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs.<ref>McCulloch J, Deshmukh VD, Harper AM (1978). Indirect sympathomimetic agents and cerebral blood flow and metabolism. Eur J Pharmacol.1;47(1):11-8. {{PMID|412682}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacology==\n\n===Synopsis===\nClassical pharmacological studies on animals and isolated animal tissues showed that the principal actions of parenterally-administered synephrine included raising blood-pressure, dilating the pupil, and constricting peripheral blood vessels.\n\nThere is now ample evidence<sup>(what evidence?)</sup> that synephrine produces most of its biological effects by acting as an [[agonist]] (i.e. stimulating) at adrenergic receptors, with a distinct preference for the \u03b1<sub>1</sub> over the  \u03b1<sub>2</sub> sub-type. However, the potency of synephrine at these receptors is relatively low (i.e. relatively large concentrations of the drug are required to activate them). The potency of synephrine at adrenergic receptors of the \u03b2-class (regardless of sub-type) is much lower than at \u03b1-receptors. There is some evidence that synephrine also has weak activity at [[5-HT receptors]], and that it interacts with [[TAAR1]] (trace amine-associated receptor 1).\n\nIn common with virtually all other simple phenylethanolamines (\u03b2-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (''R'')-(\u2212)-, or l-, enantiomer of synephrine is more potent than the (''S'')-(+)-, or d-, enantiomer in most, but not all preparations studied. However, the majority of studies have been conducted with a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.\n\nSince the details regarding such variables as test species, receptor source, route of administration, drug concentration, and stereochemical composition are important but often incomplete in other Reviews and Abstracts of research publications, many are provided in the more technical review below, in order to support as fully as possible the broad statements made in this Synopsis.\n\n===Pharmacology research===\nPharmacological studies on synephrine date back to the late 1920s, when it was observed that injected synephrine raised blood pressure, constricted peripheral blood vessels, dilated pupils, stimulated the uterus, and relaxed the intestines in experimental animals.<ref name = Las/><ref name = Las/><ref>O.

These effects lasted 2\u20133 minutes, peaking at ~30 seconds after administration. l-Synephrine was thus the more potent enantiomer, with about 1/60x the potency of the standard pressor l-epinephrine in the same assay.\nA later study, by Lands and Grant, showed that a dose of ~0.6&nbsp;mg/kg of racemic synephrine, given intravenously to anesthetized dogs, produced a rise in blood pressure of 34&nbsp;mmHg lasting 5\u201310 minutes, and estimated that this pressor activity was about 1/300x that of epinephrine.<ref name = Lands>A.

Furthermore, the marked brocho-constriction produced by injections of [[histamine]] was not reversed by either l-synephrine  or d,l-synephrine.<ref name = Tain/>\n\nIn experiments with isolated sheep [[carotid]] artery, d-, l- and d,l-synephrine all showed some [[vasoconstrictor]] activity: l-synephrine was the most potent, producing strong contractions at a concentration of 1:10000.{{efn|~ 5 x 10<sup>\u22124</sup>M.}} d-Synephrine was about 1/2 as potent as the l-isomer, but d,l-synephrine (which would have been expected to have a potency of 1/2 that of l-synephrine even if the d-isomer were completely inactive) did not produce significant and irregular contractions until a concentration of 1:2500{{efn|~ 2 x 10<sup>\u22123</sup>M.}}had been reached, implying an inhibitory interaction between the two enantiomers.<ref name = Tain/>\n\nQualitatively similar results were obtained in a rabbit ear preparation: 25&nbsp;mg l-synephrine produced significant (50%) vasoconstriction, while the same concentration of d-synephrine elicited essentially no response. In contrast, d,l-synephrine did not produce any constriction up to 25&nbsp;mg, but 25 \u2013 50&nbsp;mg caused a relaxation of the blood vessels, which again suggested that the d-isomer might be inhibiting the action of the l-isomer.<ref name = Tain/>\n\nExperiments on strips of rabbit [[duodenum]] showed that l-synephrine caused a modest reduction in contractions at a concentration of 1:17000,{{efn|~ 3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>M.}} but that the effects of the d- and d,l- forms were much weaker.<ref name = Tain/>\n\nRacemic synephrine, given intramuscularly, or by instillation, was found to significantly reduce the inflammation caused by instillation of [[mustard oil]] into the eyes of rabbits.<ref name = Tain/>\n\nSubcutaneous injection of racemic synephrine into rabbits was reported to cause a large rise in [[blood sugar]].<ref name = Hart/>\n\nIn experiments on anesthetized cats, Papp and Szekeres found that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) raised the thresholds for auricular and ventricular [[fibrillation]], an indication of [[anti-arrhythmic]] properties.<ref>J.

However, there exists considerable controversy about the safety and/or efficacy of ''synephrine-containing preparations'', which are often confused with synephrine alone, sometimes with ''m''-synephrine, and much has been written about such preparations in the medical literature and on the Internet.<ref name = Blum/><ref name=\"G.

The lower figure is Mercury or Hermes, the god or divine force of magic - as shown by his wings and caduceus.]]\n\n[[Wicca]]n views of [[divinity]] are generally [[theistic]], and revolve around a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Goddess]] and a [[Horned God]], thereby being generally [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]]. In traditional Wicca, as expressed in the writings of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and [[Doreen Valiente]], the emphasis is on the theme of divine gender polarity, and the God and Goddess are regarded as equal and opposite divine cosmic forces. In some newer forms of Wicca, such as feminist or [[Dianic Wicca]], the Goddess is given primacy or even exclusivity. In some forms of [[traditional witchcraft]] that share a similar duotheistic theology, the Horned God is given precedence over the Goddess.<ref>http://www.blue-moon-manor.com/articles/compared-to-wicca.html</ref> \n\nSome Wiccans are [[Polytheism|polytheists]], believing in many different deities taken from various [[Pagan]] pantheons, while others would believe that, in the words of [[Dion Fortune]], \"all the Goddesses are one Goddess, and all the Gods one God\". Some Wiccans are both duotheistic and polytheistic, (and sometimes a combination of duotheism, polytheism, and pantheism), in that they honor diverse pagan deities while reserving their worship for the Wiccan Goddess and Horned God, whom they regard as the supreme deities. (This approach is not dissimilar to ancient pagan pantheons where one divine couple, a god and goddess, were seen as the supreme deities of an entire pantheon.) Some see divinity as having a real, external existence; others see the Goddesses and Gods as [[archetype]]s or [[thoughtform]]s within the collective consciousness.\n\nAccording to several 20th century witches, most notably [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the \"father of Wicca\", the witches' God and Goddess are the ancient gods of the [[British Isles]]: a [[Horned God]] of hunting, death and magic who rules over an after-world paradise (often referred to as [[the Summerland]]), and a goddess, the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Great Mother]] (who is simultaneously the Eternal Virgin and the Primordial Enchantress), who gives regeneration and rebirth to souls of the dead and love to the living.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 260-261\">{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Gerald |authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|title=The Meaning of Witchcraft |pages=260\u2013261|year=1988 |origyear=1959 |location=Lakemont, GA US |publisher=Copple House Books}}</ref> The Goddess is especially connected to the Moon and stars and the sea, while the Horned God is connected to the Sun and the forests. Gardner explains that these are the tribal gods of the witches, just as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] had their tribal gods [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]] and the [[Judaism|Jews]] had [[Elohim]]; he also states that a being higher than any of these tribal gods is recognised by the witches as [[Cosmological argument|Prime Mover]], but remains unknowable, and is of little concern to them.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 26\u201327\">{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Gerald |authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|title=The Meaning of Witchcraft |pages=26\u201327|year=1988 |origyear=1959 |location=Lakemont, GA US |publisher=Copple House Books}}</ref>\n\nThe Goddess is often seen as having a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|triple aspect]]; that of the maiden, mother and crone. The God is traditionally seen as being the [[Horned God]] of the woods. A key belief in Wicca is that the gods are able to manifest in personal form, either through dreams, as physical manifestations, or through the bodies of Priestesses and Priests.\n\n[[Gardnerian Wicca]] as a denomination is primarily concerned with the priestess or priest's relationship to the Goddess and God. The Lady and Lord (as they are often called) are seen as primal cosmic beings, the source of limitless power, yet they are also familiar figures who comfort and nurture their children, and often challenge or even reprimand them.\n\n== Dualism ==\nWiccan theology largely revolves around [[ontological dualism]]. Ontological dualism is traditionally a sacred gender polarity between the complementary polar opposites of male and female, who are regarded as divine lovers. This kind of dualism is common to various religions; for example, [[Taoism]], where it is represented through [[yin and yang]], and Hinduism, where the lingam and the yoni are symbols of the sacred sexual union of a supreme god and goddess (often Shiva and Shakti). Ontological dualism is distinct from moral dualism in that moral dualism posits a supreme force of good and a supreme force of evil. There is no supreme force of evil in Wicca.\n\n=== The God ===\n{{see also| Horned God}}\n\nIn Wicca, the God is seen as the masculine form of divinity, and the polar opposite, and equal, to the Goddess.\n\nThe God is traditionally seen as the [[Horned God]], an archetypal deity with links to the Celtic [[Cernunnos]], English folkloric [[Herne the Hunter]], Greek [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], Roman [[Faunus]] and Indian [[Pashupati]]. This was the God whom [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] presented as the old God of the ancient Witches, and who was supported by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of the pan-European witch religion, which has largely been discredited.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 260-261\" /> Horns are traditionally a sacred symbol of male virility, and male gods with horns or antlers were common in pagan religious iconography throughout the ancient world.\n\nIn Wicca, the [[Green Man]] is also often associated with the Horned God, though he does not always have horns.\n\nAt different times of the Wiccan year the God is seen as different personalities. He is sometimes seen as the [[Oak King (archetype)|Oak King]] and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]], who each rule for half of the year each. [[Oak]] and [[Holly]] are two European trees. Another view of the God is that of the [[Solar deity|sun god]], who is particularly revered at the [[sabbat]] of [[Lughnasadh]]. Many Wiccans see these many facets, such as the sun god, [[Horned deity|horned god]], sacrificial god, as all aspects of the same God, but a minority view them as separate [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities.\n\nThe most exhaustive work on Wiccan ideas of the God is the book ''The Witches' God'' by [[Janet Farrar|Janet]] and [[Stewart Farrar]].\n[[File:Triple-Goddess-Waxing-Full-Waning-Symbol.svg|thumb|right|[[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] symbol of waxing, full and waning moon]]\n\n=== The Goddess ===\n{{see also|Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)}}\n{{further|Goddess movement}}\nTraditionally in Wicca, the Goddess is seen as the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], meaning that she is the maiden, the mother and the crone. The mother aspect, the [[Mother Goddess]], is perhaps the most important of these, and it was her that Gerald Gardner and Margaret Murray claimed was the ancient Goddess of the witches.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 260-261\" />\n\n[[Dianic Wicca|Certain Wiccan traditions]] are Goddess-centric; this view differs from most traditions in that most others focus on a duality of goddess and god.\n\n=== Interpretations ===\n\nGardner's explanation aside, individual interpretations of the exact natures of the gods differ significantly, since priests and priestesses develop their own relationships with the gods through intense personal work and [[revelation]]. Many have a [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] conception of deity as a Goddess (of Moon, Earth and sea) and a God (of forest, hunting and the animal realm). This concept is often extended into a kind of [[polytheism]] by the belief that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are aspects of this pair (or of the Goddess alone). Others hold the various gods and goddesses to be separate and distinct. [[Janet Farrar]] and [[Gavin Bone]] have observed that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures, and embracing a more traditional pagan worldview.<ref>[[Janet Farrar|Farrar, Janet]] and [[Gavin Bone|Bone, Gavin]] ''Progressive Witchcraft''</ref>\nMany groups and individuals are drawn to particular deities from a variety of [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheons]] (often [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], or from elsewhere in Europe), whom they honour specifically. Some examples are [[Cernunnos]] and [[Brigit]] from [[Celtic mythology]],  [[Hecate]], [[Lugh]], and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].\n\nStill others do not believe in the gods as real personalities, yet attempt to have a relationship with them as personifications of universal principles or as [[Jungian psychology|Jungian]] [[archetype]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Adler |first=Margot |authorlink=Margot Adler |title=Drawing Down the Moon |year=1979 |location=Boston |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=0-8070-3237-9 |pages=25, 34\u201335}}</ref>\nSome Wiccans conceive deities as akin to [[thoughtform]]s.\n\n==Dryghten / The Star Goddess==\n''Dryghten'', an [[Old English]] term for [[The Lord]], is the term used by [[Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)|Patricia Crowther]] to refer to the universal [[pantheism|pantheistic]] deity in Wicca.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crowther |first=Patricia |authorlink=Patricia Crowther (Wiccan) |year=1974 |title=Witch Blood!}}</ref> Gerald Gardner had initially called it, according to the [[cosmological argument]], the [[primum movens|Prime Mover]], a term borrowed from [[Aristotle]], but he claimed that the witches did not worship it, and considered it unknowable.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 26\u201327\"/> It was referred to by [[Scott Cunningham]] by the term used in [[Neo-Platonism]], \"[[Henosis|The One]]\";<ref>{{cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Cunningham |title=Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner|url=https://archive.org/details/wiccaguideforsol00cunn |url-access=registration }}</ref>  Many Wiccans whose practice involves study of the [[Kabbalah]] also regard the Gods and Goddesses they worship as being aspects or expressions of the ineffable supreme One.\n\nSome feminist Wiccans such as [[Starhawk]] use the term ''Star Goddess'' to describe the universal pantheistic deity that created the [[cosmos]], and regard Her as a knowable Deity that can and should be worshipped.<ref>[http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/charge-of-the-star-goddess.html Charge of the Star Goddess --Starhawk]</ref><ref>[http://barsoomfishrap.org/chrgstar.html Charge of the Star Goddess --\"Book of the Goddess\" (Co-edited by Julie Ann Rhoads and Ann Forfreedom in 1979-80):]</ref> Contrary to the popular notion that the term \"Star Goddess\" comes from the [[Charge of the Goddess]], a text sacred to many Wiccans, it actually originates from the Anderson [[Feri Tradition]] of (non-Wiccan) Witchcraft- of which Starhawk was an initiate. Within the Feri tradition the \"Star Goddess\" is the androgynous point of all creation - from which all things (including the dual God and Goddess) emanate.\n\n== \"The One\" / \"The All\" ==\nIn addition to the two main deities worshiped within Wicca\u2014the God and Goddess\u2014there are also several possible theological conceptions of an ultimate (impersonal) [[pantheism|pantheistic]] or monistic divinity, known variously as Dryghtyn or \"the One\" or \"[[The All]].\"  This impersonal ultimate divinity is generally regarded as unknowable, and is acknowledged but not worshiped. This [[monism|monistic]] idea of an ultimate impersonal divinity is not to be confused with the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] idea of a single supreme personal deity. (Especially since Wicca traditionally honors its two supreme deities, the Goddess and the God, as equal.) This impersonal ultimate divinity may also be regarded as the underlying order or organising principle within the world, similar to religious ideas such as [[Tao]] and [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. While not all Wiccans subscribe to this monistic idea of an impersonal, ultimate divinity, many do; and there are various philosophical constructions of how this ultimate divinity relates to the physical world of Nature. Unlike religions that place a divine creator outside of Nature, Wicca is generally pantheistic, seeing Nature as divine in itself. (The traditional Charge of the Goddess\u2014the most widely shared piece of liturgy within the religion\u2014refers to the Goddess as \"the Soul of Nature\" from whom all things come, and to which all things return. This theme is also expressed in the symbology of the magic cauldron as the womb of the Goddess, from which all creation emerges, and in which it is all dissolved before reemerging again.)\n\nWicca emphasises the [[immanence]] of divinity within Nature, seeing the natural world as comprised both of spiritual substance as well as matter and physical energy. Many Wiccans also embrace the idea of the spiritual [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] of divinity, and see this transcendence as compatible with the idea of immanence. In such a view, divinity and dimensions of spiritual existence (sometimes called \"the astral planes\") can exist outside the physical world, as well as extending into the  material, and/or rising out of the material, intimately interwoven into the fabric of material existence in such a way that the spiritual affects the physical, and vice versa. (The conception of Nature as a vast, interconnected web of existence that is woven by the Goddess is very common within Wicca; an idea often connected with the Triple Goddess as personified by the Three Fates who weave the Web of [[Wyrd]].)  This combination of transcendence and immanence allows for the intermingling and the interaction of the unmanifest spiritual nature of the universe with the manifest physical universe; the physical reflects the spiritual, and vice versa. (An idea expressed in the occult maxim \"As Above, So Below\" which is also used within Wicca.)\n\nGiven the usual interpretation of Wicca as a pantheistic and duotheistic/polytheistic religion, the monotheistic belief in a single \"supreme deity\" does not generally apply. An individual Wiccan's personal devotion may be centered on the traditional Horned God and the Moon Goddess of Wicca, a large number of divine \"aspects\" of the Wiccan God and Goddess, a large pantheon of individual pagan Gods, one specific pagan God and one specific pagan Goddess, or any combination of those perspectives. Accordingly, the religion of Wicca can be understood as [[Dualistic cosmology|duotheistic]], [[Henotheism|henotheistic]], [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], or [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] depending upon the personal faith, cosmological belief, and philosophy of the individual Wiccan.<ref>{{cite book |title=Covencraft: Witchcraft for Three or More |publisher=Llewellyn |first=Amber |last=K. |pages=13-20 |date=1998 |isbn=1-56718-018-3}}</ref>\n\nIf persons choose to use different personal names for their God or Goddess, such as Hecate (Greek) or Trivia (Roman), it is merely a familiar name to use. Both names refer to the same fundamental Goddess.\n\nBecause Wicca (as with most neo-Pagan belief systems) is very eclectic there is no \"right\" way to practice the craft, no rulebook. The focus is on connecting with the \"divine\" however an individual chooses to conceptualise it.\n\n== Other ==\n\nAccording to current [[Gardnerian Wicca]]ns, the exact names of the Goddess and God of traditional Wicca remain an initiatory secret, and they are not given in Gardner's books about witchcraft.<ref name=\"HeseltonWiccanRoots\">Philip Heselton, ''Wiccan Roots''</ref> However, the collection of Toronto Papers of Gardner's writings has been investigated by American scholars such as [[Aidan Kelly]], leading to the suggestion that their names are [[Cernunnos]] and [[Aradia]]. These are the names used in the prototype [[Book of Shadows]] known as ''Ye Bok of Ye Arte Magical''.<ref>[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, R.]] ''The Triumph of the Moon''.</ref>\n\nFor most Wiccans, the Lord and Lady are seen as complementary polarities: male and female, force and form, comprehending all in their union; the tension and interplay between them is the basis of all creation, and this balance is seen in much of nature. The God and Goddess are sometimes symbolised as the Sun and Moon, and from her lunar associations the Goddess becomes a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] with aspects of \"Maiden\", \"Mother\" and \"Crone\" corresponding to the Moon's waxing, full and waning phases.\n\nSome Wiccans hold the Goddess to be pre-eminent, since she contains and conceives all ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]] or [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] is one of her more commonly revered aspects); the God, commonly described as the [[Horned God]] or the [[Divine Child]], is the spark of life and inspiration within her, simultaneously her lover and her child. This is reflected in the traditional structure of the coven, wherein \"the High Priestess is the leader, with the High Priest as her partner; he acknowledges her primacy and supports and complements her leadership with the qualities of his own polarity.\"<ref>Farrar, J> and Farrar, S (1981). ''A Witches' Bible'' (previously published as ''The Witches' Way''. Custer, Washington: Phoenix. pp.181-2</ref> In some traditions, notably Feminist branches of [[Dianic Wicca]], the Goddess is seen as complete unto herself, and the God is not worshipped at all.\n\nSince the Goddess is said to conceive and contain all life within her, all beings are held to be divine. This is a key understanding conveyed in the [[Charge of the Goddess]], one of the most important texts of Wicca, and is very similar to the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] understanding that \"God\" contains all things, and in truth ''is'' all things.<ref>Scott, W. (transl.) (1993). ''Hermetica'' Libellus IX, p. 185. Boston:Shamballah.</ref> For some Wiccans, this idea also involves elements of [[animism]], and plants, rivers, rocks (and, importantly, ritual tools) are seen as spiritual beings, facets of a single life.\n\nA key belief in Wicca is that the gods are able to manifest in personal form, either through dreams, as physical manifestations, or through the bodies of Priestesses and Priests. The latter kind of manifestation is the purpose of the ritual of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing down the Moon]] (or Drawing down the Sun), whereby the Goddess is called to descend into the body of the Priestess (or the God into the Priest) to effect divine [[Spirit possession|possession]].\n\n== The elements ==\n{{Original research|date=September 2007}}\nWhile they are not regarded as deities, the [[classical elements]] are a featured key of the Wiccan world-view. Every manifest force or form is seen to express one of the four archetypal elements &mdash; [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Water (classical element)|Water]] &mdash; or several in combination. This scheme is fundamentally identical with that employed in other [[Western mystery tradition|Western Esoteric]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] traditions, such as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]], which in turn were influenced by the [[Hindu]] system of [[tattva]]s.\n\nThere is no consensus as to the exact nature of these elements. One popular system is the [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek conception]], where the elements correspond to matter (earth) and energy (fire), with the mediating elements (water, air) relating to the [[Phase (matter)|phases of matter]] (fire/earth mixtures). A more modern conception correlates the four elements to the four [[State of matter|states of matter]] known to science: [[Solid]] (earth); [[Liquid]] (water); [[Gas]] (air); and [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] (fire); with the akasha element corresponding to pure [[Energy]]. The [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] system proposes a fifth or [[Aether (classical element)|quintessential]] element, spirit ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[akasha]]). The preferred version is a matter of ongoing dispute in the Wiccan community. There are other non-[[Chemical_element|scientific]] [[Classical element|conceptions]], but they are not widely used among Wiccans.\n\nTo some Wiccans, the five points of the frequently worn [[pentagram]] symbolise, among other things, the four elements with spirit presiding at the top.<ref name=\"valienteABCPentagram\">{{cite book |last=Valiente |first=Doreen |authorlink=Doreen Valiente |year=1973 |title=An ABC of Witchcraft Past and Present |publisher=Phoenix Publishing, Inc |location=Custer, Washington |isbn=0-919345-77-8 |pages=264}}</ref> The [[pentagram]] is the [[symbol]] most commonly associated with Wicca in modern times. It is often circumscribed &mdash; depicted within a circle &mdash; and is usually (though not exclusively) shown with a single point upward. The inverse pentagram, with two points up, is associated with the Horned God (the two upper points being his horns), and is a symbol of the second degree initiation rite of traditional Wicca. The inverted pentagram is also used by Satanists; and for this reason, some Wiccans have alternatively been known to associate the inverted pentagram with evil.<ref>[[Vivianne Crowley|Crowley, Vivianne]] ''Wicca: The Old Religion in the New World.''</ref> In [[geometry]], the pentagram is an elegant expression of the [[golden ratio]] [[phi]] which is popularly connected with ideal beauty and was considered by the [[Pythagoreans]] to express truths about the hidden nature of existence. The five points of the pentagram have also been seen to correspond to the three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned God. \n\nIn the casting of a [[magic circle]], the four cardinal elements are visualised as contributing their influence from the four cardinal directions: Air in the east, Fire in the south, Water in the west and Earth in the north. There may be variations between groups though, particularly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since these attributions are symbolic of (amongst other things) the path of the sun through the daytime sky. For example, in southern latitudes the sun reaches its hottest point in the northern part of the sky, and north is the direction of the Tropics, so this is commonly the direction given to Fire.<ref name=\"BattenCelebrating\">{{cite book |last=Batten |first=Juliet |year=2005 |title=Celebrating the Southern Seasons |location=Auckland |publisher=Random House NZ Ltd |isbn=1-86941-734-8}}</ref>\n\nSome Wiccan groups also modify the religious calendar (the [[Wheel of the Year]]) to reflect local seasonal changes; for instance, most Southern Hemisphere covens celebrate Samhain on April 30 and Beltane on October 31, reflecting the southern hemisphere's autumn and spring seasons.<ref>{{cite book |last=Batten |first=Juliet |title=Celebrating the Southern Seasons |location=Auckland |publisher=Tandem Press}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Classical elements]]\n* [[Great Rite]]\n* [[Magic (paranormal)]]\n* [[Neopaganism]]\n* [[New Age]]\n* [[The Summerland]]\n* [[Three-fold Law]]\n* [[Wiccan Rede]]\n* [[Witchcraft]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_beli.htm The 13 General principles of Wiccan beliefs], \n* [http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/new-wicca.html New Wicca, spirituality]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Bibliographical and encyclopedic sources\n* Raymond Buckland, ''The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-paganism'' (Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 2002).\n* Anne Carson, ''Goddesses and Wise Women: The Literature of Feminist Spirituality 1980-1992 An Annotated Bibliography'' (Freedom, California: Crossing Press, 1992).\n* Chas S.

The lower figure is Mercury or Hermes, the god or divine force of magic - as shown by his wings and caduceus.]]\n\n[[Wicca]]n views of [[divinity]] are generally [[theistic]], and revolve around a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Goddess]] and a [[Horned God]], thereby being generally [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]]. In traditional Wicca, as expressed in the writings of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and [[Doreen Valiente]], the emphasis is on the theme of divine gender polarity, and the God and Goddess are regarded as equal and opposite divine cosmic forces. In some newer forms of Wicca, such as feminist or [[Dianic Wicca]], the Goddess is given primacy or even exclusivity. In some forms of [[Traditional Witchcraft]] that share a similar duotheistic theology, the Horned God is given precedence over the Goddess.<ref>http://www.blue-moon-manor.com/articles/compared-to-wicca.html</ref> \n\nSome Wiccans are [[Polytheism|polytheists]], believing in many different deities taken from various [[Pagan]] pantheons, while others would believe that, in the words of [[Dion Fortune]], \"all the Goddesses are one Goddess, and all the Gods one God\". Some Wiccans are both duotheistic and polytheistic, (and sometimes a combination of duotheism, polytheism, and pantheism), in that they honor diverse pagan deities while reserving their worship for the Wiccan Goddess and Horned God, whom they regard as the supreme deities. (This approach is not dissimilar to ancient pagan pantheons where one divine couple, a god and goddess, were seen as the supreme deities of an entire pantheon.) Some see divinity as having a real, external existence; others see the Goddesses and Gods as [[archetype]]s or [[thoughtform]]s within the collective consciousness.\n\nAccording to several 20th century witches, most notably [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the \"father of Wicca\", the witches' God and Goddess are the ancient gods of the [[British Isles]]: a [[Horned God]] of hunting, death and magic who rules over an after-world paradise (often referred to as [[the Summerland]]), and a goddess, the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Great Mother]] (who is simultaneously the Eternal Virgin and the Primordial Enchantress), who gives regeneration and rebirth to souls of the dead and love to the living.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 260-261\">{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Gerald |authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|title=The Meaning of Witchcraft |pages=260\u2013261|year=1988 |origyear=1959 |location=Lakemont, GA US |publisher=Copple House Books}}</ref> The Goddess is especially connected to the Moon and stars and the sea, while the Horned God is connected to the Sun and the forests. Gardner explains that these are the tribal gods of the witches, just as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] had their tribal gods [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]] and the [[Judaism|Jews]] had [[Elohim]]; he also states that a being higher than any of these tribal gods is recognised by the witches as [[Cosmological argument|Prime Mover]], but remains unknowable, and is of little concern to them.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 26\u201327\">{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Gerald |authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|title=The Meaning of Witchcraft |pages=26\u201327|year=1988 |origyear=1959 |location=Lakemont, GA US |publisher=Copple House Books}}</ref>\n\nThe Goddess is often seen as having a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|triple aspect]]; that of the maiden, mother and crone. The God is traditionally seen as being the [[Horned God]] of the woods. A key belief in Wicca is that the gods are able to manifest in personal form, either through dreams, as physical manifestations, or through the bodies of Priestesses and Priests.\n\n[[Gardnerian Wicca]] as a denomination is primarily concerned with the priestess or priest's relationship to the Goddess and God. The Lady and Lord (as they are often called) are seen as primal cosmic beings, the source of limitless power, yet they are also familiar figures who comfort and nurture their children, and often challenge or even reprimand them.\n\n== Dualism ==\nWiccan theology largely revolves around [[ontological dualism]]. Ontological dualism is traditionally a sacred gender polarity between the complementary polar opposites of male and female, who are regarded as divine lovers. This kind of dualism is common to various religions; for example, [[Taoism]], where it is represented through [[yin and yang]], and Hinduism, where the lingam and the yoni are symbols of the sacred sexual union of a supreme god and goddess (often Shiva and Shakti). Ontological dualism is distinct from moral dualism in that moral dualism posits a supreme force of good and a supreme force of evil. There is no supreme force of evil in Wicca.\n\n=== The God ===\n{{see also| Horned God}}\n\nIn Wicca, the God is seen as the masculine form of divinity, and the polar opposite, and equal, to the Goddess.\n\nThe God is traditionally seen as the [[Horned God]], an archetypal deity with links to the Celtic [[Cernunnos]], English folkloric [[Herne the Hunter]], Greek [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], Roman [[Faunus]] and Indian [[Pashupati]]. This was the God whom [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] presented as the old God of the ancient Witches, and who was supported by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of the pan-European witch religion, which has largely been discredited.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 260-261\" /> Horns are traditionally a sacred symbol of male virility, and male gods with horns or antlers were common in pagan religious iconography throughout the ancient world.\n\nIn Wicca, the [[Green Man]] is also often associated with the Horned God, though he does not always have horns.\n\nAt different times of the Wiccan year the God is seen as different personalities. He is sometimes seen as the [[Oak King (archetype)|Oak King]] and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]], who each rule for half of the year each. [[Oak]] and [[Holly]] are two European trees. Another view of the God is that of the [[Solar deity|sun god]], who is particularly revered at the [[sabbat]] of [[Lughnasadh]]. Many Wiccans see these many facets, such as the sun god, [[Horned deity|horned god]], sacrificial god, as all aspects of the same God, but a minority view them as separate [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities.\n\nThe most exhaustive work on Wiccan ideas of the God is the book ''The Witches' God'' by [[Janet Farrar|Janet]] and [[Stewart Farrar]].\n[[File:Triple-Goddess-Waxing-Full-Waning-Symbol.svg|thumb|right|[[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] symbol of waxing, full and waning moon]]\n\n=== The Goddess ===\n{{see also|Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)}}\n{{further|Goddess movement}}\nTraditionally in Wicca, the Goddess is seen as the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], meaning that she is the maiden, the mother and the crone. The mother aspect, the [[Mother Goddess]], is perhaps the most important of these, and it was her that Gerald Gardner and Margaret Murray claimed was the ancient Goddess of the witches.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 260-261\" />\n\n[[Dianic Wicca|Certain Wiccan traditions]] are Goddess-centric; this view differs from most traditions in that most others focus on a duality of goddess and god.\n\n=== Interpretations ===\n\nGardner's explanation aside, individual interpretations of the exact natures of the gods differ significantly, since priests and priestesses develop their own relationships with the gods through intense personal work and [[revelation]]. Many have a [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] conception of deity as a Goddess (of Moon, Earth and sea) and a God (of forest, hunting and the animal realm). This concept is often extended into a kind of [[polytheism]] by the belief that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are aspects of this pair (or of the Goddess alone). Others hold the various gods and goddesses to be separate and distinct. [[Janet Farrar]] and [[Gavin Bone]] have observed that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures, and embracing a more traditional pagan worldview.<ref>[[Janet Farrar|Farrar, Janet]] and [[Gavin Bone|Bone, Gavin]] ''Progressive Witchcraft''</ref>\nMany groups and individuals are drawn to particular deities from a variety of [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheons]] (often [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], or from elsewhere in Europe), whom they honour specifically. Some examples are [[Cernunnos]] and [[Brigit]] from [[Celtic mythology]],  [[Hecate]], [[Lugh]], and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].\n\nStill others do not believe in the gods as real personalities, yet attempt to have a relationship with them as personifications of universal principles or as [[Jungian psychology|Jungian]] [[archetype]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Adler |first=Margot |authorlink=Margot Adler |title=Drawing Down the Moon |year=1979 |location=Boston |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=0-8070-3237-9 |pages=25, 34\u201335}}</ref>\nSome Wiccans conceive deities as akin to [[thoughtform]]s.\n\n==Dryghten / The Star Goddess==\n''Dryghten'', an [[Old English]] term for [[The Lord]], is the term used by [[Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)|Patricia Crowther]] to refer to the universal [[pantheism|pantheistic]] deity in Wicca.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crowther |first=Patricia |authorlink=Patricia Crowther (Wiccan) |year=1974 |title=Witch Blood!}}</ref> Gerald Gardner had initially called it, according to the [[cosmological argument]], the [[primum movens|Prime Mover]], a term borrowed from [[Aristotle]], but he claimed that the witches did not worship it, and considered it unknowable.<ref name=\"Gardner 1988 26\u201327\"/> It was referred to by [[Scott Cunningham]] by the term used in [[Neo-Platonism]], \"[[Henosis|The One]]\";<ref>{{cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Cunningham |title=Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner|url=https://archive.org/details/wiccaguideforsol00cunn |url-access=registration }}</ref>  Many Wiccans whose practice involves study of the [[Kabbalah]] also regard the Gods and Goddesses they worship as being aspects or expressions of the ineffable supreme One.\n\nSome feminist Wiccans such as [[Starhawk]] use the term ''Star Goddess'' to describe the universal pantheistic deity that created the [[cosmos]], and regard Her as a knowable Deity that can and should be worshipped.<ref>[http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/charge-of-the-star-goddess.html Charge of the Star Goddess --Starhawk]</ref><ref>[http://barsoomfishrap.org/chrgstar.html Charge of the Star Goddess --\"Book of the Goddess\" (Co-edited by Julie Ann Rhoads and Ann Forfreedom in 1979-80):]</ref> Contrary to the popular notion that the term \"Star Goddess\" comes from the [[Charge of the Goddess]], a text sacred to many Wiccans, it actually originates from the Anderson [[Feri Tradition]] of (non-Wiccan) Witchcraft- of which Starhawk was an initiate. Within the Feri tradition the \"Star Goddess\" is the androgynous point of all creation - from which all things (including the dual God and Goddess) emanate.\n\n== \"The One\" / \"The All\" ==\nIn addition to the two main deities worshiped within Wicca\u2014the God and Goddess\u2014there are also several possible theological conceptions of an ultimate (impersonal) [[pantheism|pantheistic]] or monistic divinity, known variously as Dryghtyn or \"the One\" or \"[[The All]].\"  This impersonal ultimate divinity is generally regarded as unknowable, and is acknowledged but not worshiped. This [[monism|monistic]] idea of an ultimate impersonal divinity is not to be confused with the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] idea of a single supreme personal deity. (Especially since Wicca traditionally honors its two supreme deities, the Goddess and the God, as equal.) This impersonal ultimate divinity may also be regarded as the underlying order or organising principle within the world, similar to religious ideas such as [[Tao]] and [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. While not all Wiccans subscribe to this monistic idea of an impersonal, ultimate divinity, many do; and there are various philosophical constructions of how this ultimate divinity relates to the physical world of Nature. Unlike religions that place a divine creator outside of Nature, Wicca is generally pantheistic, seeing Nature as divine in itself. (The traditional Charge of the Goddess\u2014the most widely shared piece of liturgy within the religion\u2014refers to the Goddess as \"the Soul of Nature\" from whom all things come, and to which all things return. This theme is also expressed in the symbology of the magic cauldron as the womb of the Goddess, from which all creation emerges, and in which it is all dissolved before reemerging again.)\n\nWicca emphasises the [[immanence]] of divinity within Nature, seeing the natural world as comprised both of spiritual substance as well as matter and physical energy. Many Wiccans also embrace the idea of the spiritual [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] of divinity, and see this transcendence as compatible with the idea of immanence. In such a view, divinity and dimensions of spiritual existence (sometimes called \"the astral planes\") can exist outside the physical world, as well as extending into the  material, and/or rising out of the material, intimately interwoven into the fabric of material existence in such a way that the spiritual affects the physical, and vice versa. (The conception of Nature as a vast, interconnected web of existence that is woven by the Goddess is very common within Wicca; an idea often connected with the Triple Goddess as personified by the Three Fates who weave the Web of [[Wyrd]].)  This combination of transcendence and immanence allows for the intermingling and the interaction of the unmanifest spiritual nature of the universe with the manifest physical universe; the physical reflects the spiritual, and vice versa. (An idea expressed in the occult maxim \"As Above, So Below\" which is also used within Wicca.)\n\nGiven the usual interpretation of Wicca as a pantheistic and duotheistic/polytheistic religion, the monotheistic belief in a single \"supreme deity\" does not generally apply. An individual Wiccan's personal devotion may be centered on the traditional Horned God and the Moon Goddess of Wicca, a large number of divine \"aspects\" of the Wiccan God and Goddess, a large pantheon of individual pagan Gods, one specific pagan God and one specific pagan Goddess, or any combination of those perspectives. Accordingly, the religion of Wicca can be understood as [[Dualistic cosmology|duotheistic]], [[Henotheism|henotheistic]], [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], or [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] depending upon the personal faith, cosmological belief, and philosophy of the individual Wiccan.<ref>{{cite book |title=Covencraft: Witchcraft for Three or More |publisher=Llewellyn |first=Amber |last=K. |pages=13-20 |date=1998 |isbn=1-56718-018-3}}</ref>\n\nIf persons choose to use different personal names for their God or Goddess, such as Hecate (Greek) or Trivia (Roman), it is merely a familiar name to use. Both names refer to the same fundamental Goddess.\n\nBecause Wicca (as with most neo-Pagan belief systems) is very eclectic there is no \"right\" way to practice the craft, no rulebook. The focus is on connecting with the \"divine\" however an individual chooses to conceptualise it.\n\n== Other ==\n\nAccording to current [[Gardnerian Wicca]]ns, the exact names of the Goddess and God of traditional Wicca remain an initiatory secret, and they are not given in Gardner's books about witchcraft.<ref name=\"HeseltonWiccanRoots\">Philip Heselton, ''Wiccan Roots''</ref> However, the collection of Toronto Papers of Gardner's writings has been investigated by American scholars such as [[Aidan Kelly]], leading to the suggestion that their names are [[Cernunnos]] and [[Aradia]]. These are the names used in the prototype [[Book of Shadows]] known as ''Ye Bok of Ye Arte Magical''.<ref>[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, R.]] ''The Triumph of the Moon''.</ref>\n\nFor most Wiccans, the Lord and Lady are seen as complementary polarities: male and female, force and form, comprehending all in their union; the tension and interplay between them is the basis of all creation, and this balance is seen in much of nature. The God and Goddess are sometimes symbolised as the Sun and Moon, and from her lunar associations the Goddess becomes a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] with aspects of \"Maiden\", \"Mother\" and \"Crone\" corresponding to the Moon's waxing, full and waning phases.\n\nSome Wiccans hold the Goddess to be pre-eminent, since she contains and conceives all ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]] or [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] is one of her more commonly revered aspects); the God, commonly described as the [[Horned God]] or the [[Divine Child]], is the spark of life and inspiration within her, simultaneously her lover and her child. This is reflected in the traditional structure of the coven, wherein \"the High Priestess is the leader, with the High Priest as her partner; he acknowledges her primacy and supports and complements her leadership with the qualities of his own polarity.\"<ref>Farrar, J> and Farrar, S (1981). ''A Witches' Bible'' (previously published as ''The Witches' Way''. Custer, Washington: Phoenix. pp.181-2</ref> In some traditions, notably Feminist branches of [[Dianic Wicca]], the Goddess is seen as complete unto herself, and the God is not worshipped at all.\n\nSince the Goddess is said to conceive and contain all life within her, all beings are held to be divine. This is a key understanding conveyed in the [[Charge of the Goddess]], one of the most important texts of Wicca, and is very similar to the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] understanding that \"God\" contains all things, and in truth ''is'' all things.<ref>Scott, W. (transl.) (1993). ''Hermetica'' Libellus IX, p. 185. Boston:Shamballah.</ref> For some Wiccans, this idea also involves elements of [[animism]], and plants, rivers, rocks (and, importantly, ritual tools) are seen as spiritual beings, facets of a single life.\n\nA key belief in Wicca is that the gods are able to manifest in personal form, either through dreams, as physical manifestations, or through the bodies of Priestesses and Priests. The latter kind of manifestation is the purpose of the ritual of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing down the Moon]] (or Drawing down the Sun), whereby the Goddess is called to descend into the body of the Priestess (or the God into the Priest) to effect divine [[Spirit possession|possession]].\n\n== The elements ==\n{{Original research|date=September 2007}}\nWhile they are not regarded as deities, the [[classical elements]] are a featured key of the Wiccan world-view. Every manifest force or form is seen to express one of the four archetypal elements &mdash; [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Water (classical element)|Water]] &mdash; or several in combination. This scheme is fundamentally identical with that employed in other [[Western mystery tradition|Western Esoteric]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] traditions, such as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]], which in turn were influenced by the [[Hindu]] system of [[tattva]]s.\n\nThere is no consensus as to the exact nature of these elements. One popular system is the [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek conception]], where the elements correspond to matter (earth) and energy (fire), with the mediating elements (water, air) relating to the [[Phase (matter)|phases of matter]] (fire/earth mixtures). A more modern conception correlates the four elements to the four [[State of matter|states of matter]] known to science: [[Solid]] (earth); [[Liquid]] (water); [[Gas]] (air); and [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] (fire); with the akasha element corresponding to pure [[Energy]]. The [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] system proposes a fifth or [[Aether (classical element)|quintessential]] element, spirit ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[akasha]]). The preferred version is a matter of ongoing dispute in the Wiccan community. There are other non-[[Chemical_element|scientific]] [[Classical element|conceptions]], but they are not widely used among Wiccans.\n\nTo some Wiccans, the five points of the frequently worn [[pentagram]] symbolise, among other things, the four elements with spirit presiding at the top.<ref name=\"valienteABCPentagram\">{{cite book |last=Valiente |first=Doreen |authorlink=Doreen Valiente |year=1973 |title=An ABC of Witchcraft Past and Present |publisher=Phoenix Publishing, Inc |location=Custer, Washington |isbn=0-919345-77-8 |pages=264}}</ref> The [[pentagram]] is the [[symbol]] most commonly associated with Wicca in modern times. It is often circumscribed &mdash; depicted within a circle &mdash; and is usually (though not exclusively) shown with a single point upward. The inverse pentagram, with two points up, is associated with the Horned God (the two upper points being his horns), and is a symbol of the second degree initiation rite of traditional Wicca. The inverted pentagram is also used by Satanists; and for this reason, some Wiccans have alternatively been known to associate the inverted pentagram with evil.<ref>[[Vivianne Crowley|Crowley, Vivianne]] ''Wicca: The Old Religion in the New World.''</ref> In [[geometry]], the pentagram is an elegant expression of the [[golden ratio]] [[phi]] which is popularly connected with ideal beauty and was considered by the [[Pythagoreans]] to express truths about the hidden nature of existence. The five points of the pentagram have also been seen to correspond to the three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned God. \n\nIn the casting of a [[magic circle]], the four cardinal elements are visualised as contributing their influence from the four cardinal directions: Air in the east, Fire in the south, Water in the west and Earth in the north. There may be variations between groups though, particularly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since these attributions are symbolic of (amongst other things) the path of the sun through the daytime sky. For example, in southern latitudes the sun reaches its hottest point in the northern part of the sky, and north is the direction of the Tropics, so this is commonly the direction given to Fire.<ref name=\"BattenCelebrating\">{{cite book |last=Batten |first=Juliet |year=2005 |title=Celebrating the Southern Seasons |location=Auckland |publisher=Random House NZ Ltd |isbn=1-86941-734-8}}</ref>\n\nSome Wiccan groups also modify the religious calendar (the [[Wheel of the Year]]) to reflect local seasonal changes; for instance, most Southern Hemisphere covens celebrate Samhain on April 30 and Beltane on October 31, reflecting the southern hemisphere's autumn and spring seasons.<ref>{{cite book |last=Batten |first=Juliet |title=Celebrating the Southern Seasons |location=Auckland |publisher=Tandem Press}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Classical elements]]\n* [[Great Rite]]\n* [[Magic (paranormal)]]\n* [[Neopaganism]]\n* [[New Age]]\n* [[The Summerland]]\n* [[Three-fold Law]]\n* [[Wiccan Rede]]\n* [[Witchcraft]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_beli.htm The 13 General principles of Wiccan beliefs], \n* [http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/new-wicca.html New Wicca, spirituality]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Bibliographical and encyclopedic sources\n* Raymond Buckland, ''The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-paganism'' (Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 2002).\n* Anne Carson, ''Goddesses and Wise Women: The Literature of Feminist Spirituality 1980-1992 An Annotated Bibliography'' (Freedom, California: Crossing Press, 1992).\n* Chas S.

Originally based on [[Electric Avenue]] in [[Brixton]], the school moved to its current premises on Shelton Street in 1966, after a brief parenthesis in [[Charlotte Street]], and changed its name to London Film School in 1969. From 1974 to 2000, it was known as the '''London International Film School''' (LIFS), and reverted to the name London Film School in 2001. \n\nLFS offers various degrees at [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] level: an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Filmmaking, an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Screenwriting, and, in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]], an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in International Film Business and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Film by Practice. It also offers an expanding range of short and part-time professional development courses under the LFS Workshops banner. \n\nLFS recruits students from all over the world and is specifically constituted as an international community; around 60% of its students are from outside the [[United Kingdom]]. LFS is one of the ScreenSkills \"Film Academy Centres of Excellence\".<ref name=\"lfs.org.uk\">[http://www.lfs.org.uk/ Official Website], London Film School. Retrieved June 2007.</ref>\n\nThe school's current Director is G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r and its current chairman is [[Greg Dyke]].\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the LFS was a short film training course taught by Gilmore Roberts at the [[Heatherley School of Fine Art]] in [[Chelsea]]. In October 1956, due to a dispute with the art school, he decided to continue the course independently, so he set up the London School of Film Technique. After struggling to find suitable premises, the first filmmaking course finally started in April 1957, based in rather modest locales above a grocer's shop in [[Electric Avenue]], [[Brixton]].\n\nThe school was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. Inspired by the emergence of film schools in Eastern Europe after World War II, it was set up around the belief that the future of the British film industry required properly designed formal training, rather than the apprenticeship basis which was, at the time, the only access into the field. At first, the school offered a 6-months diploma course which students could take over the day or evening classes, with an optional 6-months extension. Under the leadership of new principal Robert Dunbar, the course was expanded to 33 weeks and later 2 years, forming the basic structure for a curriculum that is still largely in place today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Educating Film-makers: Past, Present and Future|last=Petrie|first=Duncan J.|last2=Stoneman|first2=Rod|publisher=Intellect|year=2014|isbn=978-178320-185-3|location=Bristol|pages=123-140}}</ref> \n\nThis caused a drastic increase in the student numbers, which made the original premises unsuited. The school moved to the [[West End of London|West End]] in 1963, first into a building in [[Charlotte Street]] and later, in 1966, in its current premises on Shelton Street. In 1969 it changed name to London Film School, to avoid being regarded as an institution that only offered narrow technical training. Notable alumni from the 1960s include directors such as [[Mike Leigh]], [[Michael Mann]], [[Don Boyd]], and [[Les Blair]], cinematographers such as [[Tak Fujimoto]] and [[Roger Pratt (cinematographer)|Roger Pratt]], as well as producers like [[Iain Smith (producer)|Iain Smith]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, a decrease of student numbers caused by various factors, including the establishment of the [[National Film and Television School|National Film School]] and the global impact of the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], brought the school into a financial crisis and eventually into liquidation. Staff and students banded together to press for continuation of the school; thanks to their efforts in raising the necessary funds, the school reopened in 1975, at the same location, under a new name: the London International Film School. \n\nThe school was newly incorporated as a charity, nonprofit-making company limited by guarantee. All students automatically became members of the company upon enrolment, with the right to elect, together with the other members, a board of governors with the overall responsibility for the management of the school. Manny Wynn was appointed Principal of the re-established LIFS until his sudden death six months later, when he was succeeded by John Fletcher.\n\nNotable filmmakers from all over the world studied at the LIFS in the 1970s and 1980s, including Mexican director [[Luis Mandoki]], Hong Kong director [[Ann Hui]], Swiss cinematographer [[Ueli Steiger]] and Argentinian director [[Miguel Pereira (film director)|Miguel Pereira]]. After John Fletcher's death, Martin Amstel was appointed principal in 1986. Ten years later, in 1996, the 40th anniversary of the school was celebrated with events and screening of graduates\u2019 work in London, Los Angeles and Mexico City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lfs.org.uk/50th/index.php?sec=1990|title=London Film School 50th|website=www.lfs.org.uk|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> \n\nAfter the appointment of principal Ben Gibson in 2000, the school returned to be known as London Film School.\u00a0Under Ben Gibson, LFS transitioned from offering a diploma course to offering [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[Master of Arts|MA]] programmes, first validated by the [[London Metropolitan University]] and later by [[University of Warwick]]. Nevertheless, the curriculum of the filmmaking course remained very similar and maintained its focus on practical filmmaking. Adjustments where brought in place to reflect the technological developments in the film industry and the transition to [[Digital cinematography|digital]]. The school also started diversifying its courses: next to its traditional course in [[filmmaking]], it started offering an MA course in [[screenwriting]] in 2005 and, from 2014, an MA in International Film Business in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]]. \n\nBen Gibson was succeeded as the director of the school by Jane Roscoe, who briefly held the post from 2014 to 2017. In 2018, G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r, former head of the Puttnam School of Film at the [[LASALLE College of the Arts]] in [[Singapore]] and Head of Studies at LFS since 2016, was appointed as the new director. \n\nIn recent years, films made at the school have regularly featured and won awards in some of the world's top film festivals, including [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[BFI London Film Festival]], Encounters and [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]]. Recent alumni include [[Duncan Jones]], [[Benjamin Cleary]], and [[Anu Menon]].\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe main London Film School building in Shelton Street was previously a brewery and a banana warehouse. Additional facilities are present in an annex building in [[Long Acre]].\n\nFacilities at LFS include two studios (Stage B and Stage D) equipped with lighting grids, as well as a rehearsal studio used also for workshops. LFS occasionally hires external studios facilities as well. \n\nThe school has a fully equipped [[Production designer|design]] studio with drawing boards, model making facilities, visual reference library, materials library and design computer suite. It has [[editing]] suites equipped with [[Media Composer|Avid Media Composer]] as well as sound suites equipped with [[Pro Tools|Pro Tools 24HD]], a commentary and foley recording area and a sound effects library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/facilities|title=Facilities {{!}} London Film School|website=lfs.org.uk|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> \n\nLFS also has two [[Movie theater|cinemas]] (Cinema A & B), with 110 and 35 seat capacity respectively and projection facilities for both [[Digital Cinema Package|digital]] and [[35mm movie film|35mm]]. \n\nLondon Film School is planning to relocate to new facilities in London City Island, [[Canning Town]], by autumn 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/admissions|title=Admissions {{!}} London Film School|website=lfs.org.uk|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Courses of studies==\n\nThe London Film School is built around a conservatoire model, providing an environment for intense creative work. Filmmaking is taught on stages and in workshops rather than in classrooms, and the courses are structured around practical work; students spend most of their time making films of increasing levels of difficulty. The school has a full-time faculty and a varied group of regular visiting lecturers, forming a living creative community with continuous connections to the film industry. \n\nThe '''MA Filmmaking''' programme has no pre-specialisation. All students are provided with a full education in all the craft areas of [[filmmaking]]: directing, producing, editing, cinematography, sound, production design, and writing. Students work on a minimum of ten films over 2 years, in different roles, and have the chance to crew on films from terms above and below them. Exercises include films shot in [[16 mm film|16mm]] on location with no sound or only post-recorded sound and films shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm]] or [[Digital cinematography|digital]] in studio, on purposely designed and built sets. One term is dedicated to making a [[Documentary film|documentary]]. For their graduation films, students do not have limitations and are allowed to shoot on any format and at any length they can budget and schedule. Often, students go back to their home country to make a graduation film, which means that LFS films have been made all over the world. All film exercises are provided with a production allowance included in the fees. With around 200 full-time students at any one time on the programme, it generates over 180 films a year. \n\nThe one-year '''MA Screenwriting''' programme is centred on the development of a full-length feature script, with individual monitoring and guidance from industry mentors. Workshops on storytelling and film language, characterisation, scene writing, and more are based around practical writing exercises. Screenwriting students have the chance to collaborate with students on the filmmaking programme and experience the production side of filmmaking first hand. \n\nThe '''MA International Film Business''' programme, run in conjunction with the [[University of Exeter]], prepares students for careers in programming, exhibition and distribution. Over the one-year course, students participate in modules in international finance, world cinema and a trip to the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]. \n\nNext to the full-time MA courses, the London Film School offers a variety of short term workshops and professional development courses, as well as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] programme in Film by Practice in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]]. \n\n==Governance and Staff==\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n===Director===\n*G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r Erlingsson\n\n===Governing Body===\n*Chair: [[Greg Dyke]]\n*Vice-chair: Professor [[Diana Green]] [[CBE]]\n*Governors:\n**Graham Easton\n**Peter Armstrong\n**Helen Dudley [[CBE]]\n**Kemal Akhtar\n**Olivier Kaempfer\n**Nick Humby\n**Peter Holliday\n**Moshe Nitzani, LFS Staff Governor\n**Peter Hogenson, LFS Student Governor\n\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n===Key Tutors===\n*Femi Kolade \u2013 Head of Studies \n*Jonathan Hourigan \u2013 Co-Head of Screenwriting\n*Sophia Wellington \u2013 Co-Head of Screenwriting\n*Timo Hein\u00e4nen FSC \u2013 Head of Camera\n*Candida Moriarty \u2013 Head of Production Design\n*Wojciech Wrzesniewski \u2013 Head of Sound\n*Peter Hollywood \u2013 Head of Editing\n*Rafael Kapelinski \u2013 Term 1 Tutor\n*Dominic Fitzgerald - Term 2 Tutor\n*Nicola Gibson \u2013 Term 3 Tutor\n*Rosie Toner - Term 4 Tutor\n*Giles Borg - Term 5 Tutor\n*Sue Austen \u2013 Term 6 Tutor\n*[[Richard Kwietniowski]] \u2013 Term 6 Tutor\n*[[Les Blair]] \u2013 Emeritus Professor\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notable LFS alumni==\n{{Category seealso|Alumni of the London Film School}}\nThe school's alumni include:\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*[[Gavin MacFadyen]]\n*[[John Irvin]] \n*[[Ian Wilson (cinematographer)|Ian Wilson]] [[British Society of Cinematographers|BSC]]\n*[[Ross Devenish]]\n*[[Bill Douglas]]\n*[[Tak Fujimoto]] [[American Society of Cinematographers|ASC]]\n*[[Boaz Davidson]]\n*[[Mark Forstater]]\n*[[Harley Cokeliss]]\n*[[Mohamed Khan]]\n*[[Mike Leigh]]\n*[[Les Blair]]\n*[[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]\n*[[Franc Roddam]]\n*[[Eduardo Guedes]]\n*[[George P.

Manny Wynn was appointed Principal of the re-established LIFS until his sudden death six months later, when he was succeeded by John Fletcher.\n\nNotable filmmakers from all over the world studied at the LIFS in the 1970s and 1980s, including Mexican director [[Luis Mandoki]], Hong Kong director [[Ann Hui]], Swiss cinematographer [[Ueli Steiger]] and Argentinian director [[Miguel Pereira (film director)|Miguel Pereira]]. After John Fletcher's death, Martin Amstel was appointed principal in 1986. Ten years later, in 1996, the 40th anniversary of the school was celebrated with events and screening of graduates\u2019 work in London, Los Angeles and Mexico City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lfs.org.uk/50th/index.php?sec=1990|title=London Film School 50th|website=www.lfs.org.uk|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> \n\nAfter the appointment of principal Ben Gibson in 2000, the school returned to be known as London Film School.\u00a0Under Ben Gibson, LFS transitioned from offering a diploma course to offering [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[Master of Arts|MA]] programmes, first validated by the [[London Metropolitan University]] and later by [[University of Warwick]]. Nevertheless, the curriculum of the filmmaking course remained very similar, with a continued focus on practical filmmaking. Adjustments where brought in place to reflect the technological developments in the film industry and the transition to [[Digital cinematography|digital]]. The school also started diversifying its courses: next to its traditional course in [[filmmaking]], it started offering an MA course in [[screenwriting]] in 2005 and, from 2014, an MA in International Film Business in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]]. \n\nBen Gibson was succeeded as the director of the school by Jane Roscoe, who briefly held the post from 2014 to 2017. In 2018, G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r, already LFS Head of Studies since 2016 and former head of the Puttnam School of Film at the [[LASALLE College of the Arts]] in [[Singapore]], was appointed as the new director. \n\nIn recent years, films made at the school have regularly featured and won awards in some of the world's top film festivals, including [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[BFI London Film Festival]], Encounters and [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]]. Recent alumni include [[Duncan Jones]], [[Benjamin Cleary]], and [[Anu Menon]].\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe main London Film School building in Shelton Street was previously a brewery and a banana warehouse. Additional facilities are present in an annex building in [[Long Acre]].\n\nFacilities at LFS include two studios (Stage B and Stage D) equipped with lighting grids, as well as a rehearsal studio used also for workshops. LFS occasionally hires external studios facilities as well. \n\nThe school has a fully equipped [[Production designer|design]] studio with drawing boards, model making facilities, visual reference library, materials library and design computer suite. It has [[editing]] suites equipped with [[Media Composer|Avid Media Composer]] as well as sound suites equipped with [[Pro Tools|Pro Tools 24HD]], a commentary and foley recording area and a sound effects library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/facilities|title=Facilities {{!}} London Film School|website=lfs.org.uk|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> \n\nLFS also has two [[Movie theater|cinemas]] (Cinema A & B), with 110 and 35 seat capacity respectively and projection facilities for both [[Digital Cinema Package|digital]] and [[35mm movie film|35mm]]. \n\nLondon Film School is planning to relocate to new facilities in London City Island, [[Canning Town]], by autumn 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/admissions|title=Admissions {{!}} London Film School|website=lfs.org.uk|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Courses of studies==\n\nThe London Film School is built around a conservatoire model, providing an environment for intense creative work. Filmmaking is taught on stages and in workshops rather than in classrooms, and the courses are structured around practical work; students spend most of their time making films of increasing levels of difficulty. The school has a full-time faculty and a varied group of regular visiting lecturers, forming a living creative community with continuous connections to the film industry. \n\nThe '''MA Filmmaking''' programme has no pre-specialisation. All students are provided with a full education in all the craft areas of [[filmmaking]]: directing, producing, editing, cinematography, sound, production design, and writing. Students work on a minimum of ten films over 2 years, in different roles, and have the chance to crew on films from terms above and below them. Exercises include films shot in [[16 mm film|16mm]] on location with no sound or only post-recorded sound and films shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm]] or [[Digital cinematography|digital]] in studio, on purposely designed and built sets. One term is dedicated to making a [[Documentary film|documentary]]. For their graduation films, students do not have limitations and are allowed to shoot on any format and at any length they can budget and schedule. Often, students go back to their home country to make a graduation film, which means that LFS films have been made all over the world. All film exercises are provided with a production allowance included in the fees. With around 200 full-time students at any one time on the programme, it generates over 180 films a year. \n\nThe one-year '''MA Screenwriting''' programme is centred on the development of a full-length feature script, with individual monitoring and guidance from industry mentors. Workshops on storytelling and film language, characterisation, scene writing, and more are based around practical writing exercises. Screenwriting students have the chance to collaborate with students on the filmmaking programme and experience the production side of filmmaking first hand. \n\nThe '''MA International Film Business''' programme, run in conjunction with the [[University of Exeter]], prepares students for careers in programming, exhibition and distribution. Over the one-year course, students participate in modules in international finance, world cinema and a trip to the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]. \n\nNext to the full-time MA courses, the London Film School offers a variety of short term workshops and professional development courses, as well as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] programme in Film by Practice in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]]. \n\n==Governance and Staff==\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n===Director===\n*G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r Erlingsson\n\n===Governing Body===\n*Chair: [[Greg Dyke]]\n*Vice-chair: Professor [[Diana Green]] [[CBE]]\n*Governors:\n**Graham Easton\n**Peter Armstrong\n**Helen Dudley [[CBE]]\n**Kemal Akhtar\n**Olivier Kaempfer\n**Nick Humby\n**Peter Holliday\n**Moshe Nitzani, LFS Staff Governor\n**Peter Hogenson, LFS Student Governor\n\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n===Key Tutors===\n*Femi Kolade \u2013 Head of Studies \n*Jonathan Hourigan \u2013 Co-Head of Screenwriting\n*Sophia Wellington \u2013 Co-Head of Screenwriting\n*Timo Hein\u00e4nen FSC \u2013 Head of Camera\n*Candida Moriarty \u2013 Head of Production Design\n*Wojciech Wrzesniewski \u2013 Head of Sound\n*Peter Hollywood \u2013 Head of Editing\n*Rafael Kapelinski \u2013 Term 1 Tutor\n*Dominic Fitzgerald - Term 2 Tutor\n*Nicola Gibson \u2013 Term 3 Tutor\n*Rosie Toner - Term 4 Tutor\n*Giles Borg - Term 5 Tutor\n*Sue Austen \u2013 Term 6 Tutor\n*[[Richard Kwietniowski]] \u2013 Term 6 Tutor\n*[[Les Blair]] \u2013 Emeritus Professor\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notable LFS alumni==\n{{Category seealso|Alumni of the London Film School}}\nThe school's alumni include:\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*[[Gavin MacFadyen]]\n*[[John Irvin]] \n*[[Ian Wilson (cinematographer)|Ian Wilson]] [[British Society of Cinematographers|BSC]]\n*[[Ross Devenish]]\n*[[Bill Douglas]]\n*[[Tak Fujimoto]] [[American Society of Cinematographers|ASC]]\n*[[Boaz Davidson]]\n*[[Mark Forstater]]\n*[[Harley Cokeliss]]\n*[[Mohamed Khan]]\n*[[Mike Leigh]]\n*[[Les Blair]]\n*[[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]\n*[[Franc Roddam]]\n*[[Eduardo Guedes]]\n*[[George P.
