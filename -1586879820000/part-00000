Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently over the course of the next few years. Ferry frequently enlisted members of Roxy Music as session musicians for his solo releases.\n\nRoxy Music became a successful act in Europe and Australia during the 1970s. This success began with their self-titled debut album, ''[[Roxy Music (album)|Roxy Music]]'' (1972).<ref name=\"Prendergast\"/> The band pioneered more musically sophisticated elements of [[glam rock]] while significantly influencing early English [[punk rock|punk]] music,<ref>''More Than This: The Story of Roxy Music'', Eagle Rock, October 2009.</ref> and provided a model for many [[New wave music|new wave]] acts while innovating elements of [[electronic music|electronic]] composition.

In early 1970 Ferry had auditioned as lead singer for [[King Crimson]], who were seeking a replacement for [[Greg Lake]]. Although [[Robert Fripp]] and [[Pete Sinfield]] decided that Ferry's voice was unsuitable for King Crimson's material, they were impressed with his talent and helped the fledgling Roxy Music to obtain a contract with [[E.G. Records]].\n\n[[Andy Mackay]] replied to Ferry's advertisement, not as a keyboard player but a saxophonist and oboist, though he did have a [[VCS3]] synthesizer. Mackay had already met [[Brian Eno]] during university days, as both were interested in avant-garde and electronic music. Although Eno was a non-musician, he could operate a synthesizer and owned a [[Revox]] reel-to-reel tape machine, so Mackay convinced him to join the band as a technical adviser. Before long Eno was an official member of the group.  Rounding out the original sextet were guitarist Roger Bunn (who had issued the well-regarded solo album ''Piece Of Mind'' earlier in 1970)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roger-bunn-mn0001614978/biography|title=Roger Bunn - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> and drummer Dexter Lloyd, a classically trained [[timpani]]st.

Although he did not initially make the band as a guitarist, the group were impressed enough with Manzanera that he was invited to become Roxy Music's roadie, an offer which he accepted.\n\nThe band's fortunes were greatly increased by the support of broadcaster [[John Peel]] and ''Melody Maker'' journalist [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]]. Williams became an enthusiastic fan after meeting Ferry and being given a demonstration tape during mid-1971, and wrote the first major article on the band, featured on ''Melody Maker'''s \"Horizons\" page in the edition of 7 August 1971. This line-up of Roxy Music (Ferry/Mackay/Eno/Simpson/Thompson/O'List) recorded a BBC session shortly thereafter.\n\n===First two albums (1972\u20131973)===\nIn early February 1972, guitarist O'List quit the group abruptly after an altercation with Paul Thompson, which took place at their audition for David Enthoven of [[E.G. Records|EG Management]]. When O'List didn't show up for the next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band's sound mixer. When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O'List's permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as [[David Gilmour]], who was a friend of his older brother, and [[Soft Machine]]'s [[Robert Wyatt]].\n\nTwo weeks after Manzanera joined the band, Roxy Music signed with EG Management.<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) pp.376\u201377</ref>\n[[File:Roxy Music - TopPop 1973 13.png|thumb|right|Roxy Music perform on ''[[TopPop]]'' in 1973.

A&R staffer Tim Clark records that although he argued strongly that Island should contract them, company boss [[Chris Blackwell]] at first seemed unimpressed and Clark assumed he was not interested. A few days later however, Clark and Enthoven were standing in the hallway of the Island offices examining cover images for the album when Blackwell walked past, glanced at the artwork and said \"Looks great! Have we got them signed yet?\"<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) p.385\u201386</ref> The band signed with [[Island Records]] a few days later. The LP was released in June to good reviews and became a major success, reaching No.&nbsp;10 on the UK album chart in September 1972.<ref name=\"Prendergast\">{{cite book |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance: The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |last=Prendergast |first=Mark |year=2001 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=[https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/119 119] |isbn=1-58234-134-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/119 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of 1972, bassist Graham Simpson became increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative, which led to his leaving the band almost immediately after the recording of the debut album. He was replaced by Rik Kenton.<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) p.376</ref>\n\nTo bring more attention to their album, Roxy Music decided to record and release a single. Their debut single was \"[[Virginia Plain]]\", which scored No.&nbsp;4 in the British charts. The band's eclectic visual image, captured in their debut performance on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', became a cornerstone for the glam trend in the UK; the ''TOTP'' clip of \"Virginia Plain\" was later parodied by the British comedy series ''[[Big Train]]''. The single caused a renewed interest in the album. Soon after \"Virginia Plain\", Rik Kenton departed the band, which would never again have a permanent bass player.<!--Do not add note stating that Kenton was not officially replaced in the band unless the later references to Gustafson, Spenner, and Tibbs as official members of the band during their stints are changed to demonstrate that they were not.-->\n\nThe next album, ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'', was released in March 1973. It marked the beginning of the band's long, successful collaboration with producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]], who worked on all of the group's classic albums and singles in the 1970s. The album was promoted with the non-album single \"Pyjamarama\"; no album track was released as a single.

Also, [[John Gustafson (musician)|John Gustafson]] became the band's permanent bass player for the next three studio albums, but not always for live shows; though he toured with Roxy on certain dates in 1973 and 1975, other live Roxy bassists of this period (1973\u20131976) included Sal Maida, [[John Wetton]] and [[Rick Wills]].<ref>Stump, Paul \u2013 Unknown Pleasures: A Cultural biography of Roxy Music, Thunder's Mouth Press, New York, 1998, pps. 72, 154</ref>\n\nEno, meanwhile, was replaced by 18-year-old multi-instrumentalist [[Eddie Jobson]], formerly of [[progressive rock]]ers [[Curved Air]], who played keyboards and electric violin. Although some fans lamented the loss of the experimental attitude and camp aesthetic that Eno had brought to the band, the classically trained Jobson was an accomplished musician. Eno himself later acknowledged the quality of the two albums that followed his departure{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}, ''[[Stranded (album)|Stranded]]'' (1973) and ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'' (1974). ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to the albums as marking \"the zenith of contemporary British art rock\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n[[File:Roxy_Music_band.jpg|thumb|left|Roxy Music, 1974]] The songs on these albums also cemented Ferry's persona as the epitome of the suave, jaded Euro-sophisticate. Although this persona undoubtedly began as a deliberately ironic device, during the mid-1970s it seemed to merge with Ferry's real life, as the working-class miner's son from the north of England became an international rock star and an icon of male style.\n\nOn the first two Roxy albums, all songs were written solely by Bryan Ferry. Beginning with ''Stranded'', Mackay and Manzanera began to co-write some material. Gradually, their songwriting and musicianship became more integrated into the band's sound, although Ferry remained the dominant songwriter; throughout their career, all but one of Roxy's singles were written either wholly or jointly by Ferry (Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson did individually write a few of the band's B-sides). ''Stranded'' was released in November 1973, and produced the top-10 single \"[[Street Life (Roxy Music song)|Street Life]]\".\n\nThe fourth album, ''Country Life'', was released in 1974, and was the first Roxy Music album to enter the US Top 40, albeit at No.&nbsp;37. ''Country Life'' was met with widespread critical acclaim, with ''Rolling Stone'' referring to it \"as if Ferry ran a cabaret for psychotics, featuring chanteurs in a state of shock\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite news|title=Albums Reviews: Roxy Music -Country Life|work=Rolling Stone|author=Jim Miller|date=27 February 1975|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/123934/review/5943949/country_life|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415212253/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/123934/review/5943949/country_life|archive-date=15 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their fifth album, ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'', contained their only US top 40 hit, \"[[Love Is the Drug]]\". (Ferry said the song came to him while kicking the leaves during a walk through [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].)\n\nAfter the concert tours in support of ''Siren'' in 1976, Roxy Music disbanded. Their live album ''Viva!'' was released in August 1976. During this time Ferry released two solo records on which Manzanera and Thompson performed, and Manzanera reunited with Eno on the critically acclaimed one-off ''[[801 Live]]'' album.\n\n===Final albums and hiatus (1978\u20131983)===\nRoxy Music reunited during 1978 to record a new album, ''[[Manifesto (Roxy Music album)|Manifesto]]'', but with a reshuffled cast. Jobson was not present, and was reportedly not contacted for the reunion. (At that time, Jobson was touring and recording with his own band, [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]]) The sleeve of ''Manifesto'' indicated that the revived Roxy Music line-up consisted of Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson, along with [[Paul Carrack]] (keyboards), [[Alan Spenner]] (bass), and Gary Tibbs (ex Vibrators) (bass); despite this all other media pointed to Roxy Music being a quartet (and a trio following the 1980 departure of Thompson), with the latter three musicians being regular collaborators of the band.\n\nThree singles were spun off from ''Manifesto'', including the major UK hits \"Angel Eyes\" (UK No.&nbsp;4), and \"Dance Away\" (UK No.&nbsp;2). Both these tracks are significantly different from the album versions, as \"Dance Away\" was remixed for single release, and \"Angel Eyes\" was entirely re-recorded.\n\nAfter the tour and before the recording of the next album, ''[[Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)|Flesh + Blood]]'' (1980), Thompson broke his thumb in a motorcycle mishap and took a leave from the band. Soon afterward he left permanently, due to musical differences with Ferry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/interview-roxy-musics-paul-thompson-1449252|title=Interview: Roxy Music's Paul Thompson|date=6 February 2009|work=nechronicle}}</ref>\n\nAt this point, Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera became the only permanent members of Roxy Music, and were supplemented by a variety of session players over the next few years including Tibbs, Spenner, Carrack, [[Andy Newmark]] and Neil Hubbard. The trio's 1980 album ''Flesh + Blood'' became a huge commercial success in their homeland, as the album went to No.&nbsp;1 on the UK charts, and spun off three UK hits: \"Oh Yeah\" (UK No.&nbsp;5), \"Over You\" (UK No.&nbsp;5), and \"Same Old Scene\" (UK No.&nbsp;12).\n\nHowever, the changed cast reflected a distinct change in Roxy's musical style. Gone were the unpredictable elements of the group's sound, giving way to smoother musical arrangements. ''Rolling Stone'' panned ''Manifesto'' (\"Roxy Music has not gone disco. Roxy Music has not particularly gone anywhere else either\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/141100/review/5942773/manifesto|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224094932/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/141100/review/5942773/manifesto|url-status=dead|title=Roxy Music: Manifesto : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone|archivedate=24 December 2008}}</ref>) as well as ''Flesh + Blood'' (\"such a shockingly bad Roxy Music record that it provokes a certain fascination\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/283455/review/5942618/flesh__blood|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224093710/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/283455/review/5942618/flesh__blood|url-status=dead|title=Roxy Music: Flesh & Blood : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone|archivedate=24 December 2008}}</ref>), while other sources praised the reunion. ''[[Melody Maker]]'' said, of ''Manifesto,'' \"...reservations aside, this may be the first such return bout ever attempted with any degree of genuine success: a technical knockout against the odds.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/articles/reviews/albums/1979_03_00_manifesto_melodymaker.shtml |title=Manifesto Album Review \u2013 Melody Maker \u2013 circa March 1979 |publisher=Roxyrama.com |date=25 May 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Roxy Music recorded the non-album single \"[[Jealous Guy]]\". A cover of a song written and originally recorded by [[John Lennon]], Roxy Music recorded \"Jealous Guy\" as a tribute to Lennon after his 1980 death. The song topped the UK charts for two weeks in March 1981, becoming the band's only No.&nbsp;1 single.\n\nLater, with more sombre and carefully sculpted soundscapes, the band's eighth\u2014and final\u2014studio album, ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' (1982), recorded at [[Chris Blackwell]]'s [[Compass Point Studios]], was a major commercial success and restored the group's critical reputation<ref>(''Rolling Stone'': \"''Avalon'' takes a long time to kick in, but it finally does, and it's a good one.\")</ref> and contained the successful single \"[[More Than This (Roxy Music song)|More Than This]]\". The album also included several Roxy Music classics, such as \"Avalon\", \"The Main Thing\", \"The Space Between\", \"True to Life\", and \"To Turn You On\". The trio (augmented by session players) toured extensively until 1983, when Bryan Ferry dissolved the band and band members devoted themselves full-time to solo careers.\n\n===Reunions and final dissolution (2001\u20132011)===\nFerry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson re-formed in 2001 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band and toured extensively. A festival performance in Portugal and a short tour of the United States followed in 2003. Absent was Brian Eno, who criticised the motives of the band's reunion, saying, \"I just don't like the idea. It leaves a bad taste\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1185763.stm Eno attacks Roxy reunion], BBC News</ref> Later Eno remarked that his comment had been taken out of context. Manzanera and Thompson recorded and toured with Ferry on his 2002 album ''[[Frantic (album)|Frantic]]''. Eno also contributed to ''Frantic'' on the track \"I Thought\".\n\nDuring 2002, Image Entertainment, Inc., released the concert DVD ''Roxy Music Live at the Apollo'' featuring performances of 20 songs plus interviews and rehearsal footage.\n\nIn 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked the group No.&nbsp;98 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRoxy Music gave a live performance at the 2005 [[Isle of Wight Festival]] on 11 June 2005, their first UK concert since the 2001\u20132002 world tour. On 2 July 2005, the band played \"[[Jealous Guy]]\", \"Do the Strand\", and \"Love is the Drug\" at the Berlin contribution to [[Live8]]; \"Do the Strand\" is available on the 4-disc DVD collection, whereas \"Love Is the Drug\" can be found on the Live 8 Berlin DVD.\n\nIn March 2005, it was announced on Phil Manzanera's official site<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.manzanera.com| title=Phil Manzanera, Expression Records and the Roxy Music Archive| accessdate=11 March 2006}}</ref> that the band, including Brian Eno, had decided to record an album of new material. The project would mark the first time Eno worked with Roxy Music since 1973's ''For Your Pleasure''. After a number of denials that he would be involved with any Roxy Music reunion, on 19 May 2006 Eno revealed that he had contributed two songs to the new album as well as playing keyboards on other tracks. He did, however, rule out touring with the band.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2006_355.shtml| title=Viva Roxy Music| accessdate=30 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060621075845/http://www.vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2006_355.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 June 2006}}</ref> Had the record been released as a Roxy Music album, it would have been the first album since ''Manifesto'' on which original drummer Paul Thompson performed.\n[[File:RoxyMusicExCelCentre2006.jpg|thumb|right|Roxy Music on stage during concert at London's [[ExCeL Exhibition Centre]], July 2006]]\n\nDuring early 2006 a classic Roxy track, \"The Main Thing\", was remixed by Malcolm Green and used as the soundtrack to a pan-European television commercial for the [[Opel Vectra]] featuring celebrated football referee [[Pierluigi Collina]]. In July that year, the band toured Europe. They concentrated mostly on places they had never visited before, such as Serbia and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Roxy Music's second drummer, Andy Newmark, performed during the tour, as Thompson withdrew due to health issues, and [[Oliver Thompson]] (guitar) made his first appearance with the band.\n\nIn a March 2007 interview with the ''Western Daily Press'', Ferry confirmed that the next Roxy album was definitely being made, but would not be vended for another \"year and a half\", as he had just released and toured behind his twelfth studio album, ''[[Dylanesque (album)|Dylanesque]]'', consisting of [[Bob Dylan]] covers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/cgi-bin/2007/cginews.cgi?record=22 |title=Roxy Rama |publisher=Roxy Rama |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> In June 2007, the band hired a Liverpool-based design agency to develop a website supporting their new album.

Ferry, Mackay and Eno all had studied at prominent UK art colleges during the mid-to-late 1960s, when these institutions were introducing courses that avoided traditional art teaching practice, with its emphasis on painting, and instead focused on more recent developments, most notably [[pop art]], and explored new concepts such as [[cybernetics]]. As writer Michael Bracewell notes in his book ''Roxy: the band that invented an era'', Roxy Music was created expressly by Ferry, Mackay and Eno as a means of combining their mutual interests in music, modern art and fashion.\n\nFerry studied at [[Newcastle University]] in the Sixties under renowned [[pop art]]ist and educator [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], and many of Ferry's university friends, classmates and tutors \u2013 e.g. [[Rita Donagh]] and [[Tim Head]] \u2013 became well-known artists in their own right. Eno studied at [[Winchester School of Art]] and although his iconoclastic style became apparent early and caused some conflict with the college establishment, it also resulted in him meeting important artists and musicians including [[Cornelius Cardew]] and [[Gavin Bryars]]. His interest in electronic music also resulted in his first meetings with Andy Mackay, who was studying at Reading University and who had likewise developed a strong interest in avant garde and electronic music.\n\nThe three eventually joined forces in London during 1970\u201371 after meeting through mutual friends and decided to form a rock band.\n\nRoxy Music was initially influenced by other contemporary artists at the time including [[The Beatles]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[David Bowie]], [[Elton John]], [[The Animals]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[The Who]], as well as American rock'n'roll acts and genres such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Motown]]. Ferry stated that Roxy Music's unique sound came as a result of the diverse and eclectic musical backgrounds of the band's members; \"I had lots of musical influences, [[Phil Manzanera]] had this Latin heritage, being born in South America. Saxophone and oboe player [[Andy Mackay]] was classically trained. Eno with his deep interest in experimental music. They were specialists in their field. Paul Thompson brought a lot, with his very powerful, earthy drumming.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/01/bryan-ferry-roxy-music-invented-new-pop-game-for-anything |title=Bryan Ferry on how Roxy Music invented art pop: 'We were game for anything' |work=The Guardian |date=1 February 2018|accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/02/roxy-music-40-years |title=Roxy Music: the band that broke the sound barrier |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2012|accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref> \n\nRoxy Music was one of the first rock music groups to create and maintain a carefully crafted look and style that included their stage presentation, music videos, album and single cover designs, and promotional materials such as posters, handbills, cards and badges.\nThey were assisted in this by a group of friends and associates who helped to sculpt the classic Roxy Music 'look', notably fashion designer [[Antony Price]], hair stylist Keith Mainwaring, photographer Karl Stoecker, the group's \"PR consultant\" Simon Puxley (a former university friend of Mackay's) and Ferry's art school classmate Nicholas De Ville. Well-known critic [[Lester Bangs]] went so far as to say that Roxy represented \"the triumph of artifice\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/roxy-music/2774 |title=Roxy Music \u2013 The Early Years \u2013 Album Reviews |work=Nme |date=2 September 2000 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> Ferry later attributed the band's look to his interest in American music and popular culture icons including [[Marilyn Monroe]], Motown and [[Stax Records]] artists, and stated he wanted to create an alternative image to publicity shots of pop and rock groups at the time \"in a dreary street, looking rather sullen. Which was the norm.\u201d<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album, produced by [[King Crimson]]'s [[Pete Sinfield]], was the first in a series of increasingly sophisticated album covers, art-directed by Ferry in collaboration with his friend Nick De Ville. The album artwork imitated the visual style of classic \"[[girlie magazine|girlie]]\" and [[fashion magazine]]s, featuring high-fashion shots of scantily clad models [[Amanda Lear]], [[Marilyn Cole]] and [[Jerry Hall]], each of whom had romances with Ferry during the time of their contributions, as well as model Kari-Ann Muller who appears on the cover of the first Roxy album but who was not otherwise involved with anyone in the band, and who later married [[Mick Jagger]]'s brother Chris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.librario.com/1123|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809141847/http://www.librario.com/1123|url-status=dead|title=These Vintage Years! \u2013 Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music \u2013 Kari-Ann|archivedate=9 August 2010}}</ref> The title of the fourth Roxy album, ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'', was intended as a parody of the well-known British rural magazine of the same name, and the visually punning front cover photo featured two models (two German fans, Constanze Karoli\u2014sister of [[Can (band)|Can]]'s [[Michael Karoli]]\u2014and Eveline Grunwald)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/ac26countrylife.html |title=Seventies' Greatest Album Covers: Country Life |publisher=Superseventies.com |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> clad only in semi-transparent lingerie standing in a forest. As a result, in many areas of the United States the album was sold in an opaque plastic wrapper because retailers refused to display the cover. Later, an alternative cover, featuring just a picture of the forest, was used.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 2005, [[Tim de Lisle]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' argued that Roxy Music are the second most influential British band after [[The Beatles]]. He wrote, \"Somehow, in a landscape dominated by [[Led Zeppelin]] at one end and [[The Osmonds]] at the other, they managed to reach the Top 10 with a heady mixture of futurism, retro rock'n'roll, camp, funny noises, silly outfits, art techniques, film references and oboe solos.

Some of the Sex Pistols' instruments and their expensive PA system was said to have been stolen by Steve Jones and Paul Cook from a Roxy Music gig in 1975.

Ferry frequently enlisted members of Roxy Music as session musicians for his solo releases.\n\nRoxy Music became a successful act in Europe and Australia during the 1970s. This success began with their self-titled debut album, ''[[Roxy Music (album)|Roxy Music]]'' (1972).<ref name=\"Prendergast\"/> The band pioneered more musically sophisticated elements of [[glam rock]] while significantly influencing early English [[punk rock|punk]] music,<ref>''More Than This: The Story of Roxy Music'', Eagle Rock, October 2009.</ref> and provided a model for many [[New wave music|new wave]] acts while innovating elements of [[electronic music|electronic]] composition.

In early 1970 Ferry had auditioned as lead singer for [[King Crimson]], who were seeking a replacement for [[Greg Lake]]. Although [[Robert Fripp]] and [[Pete Sinfield]] decided that Ferry's voice was unsuitable for King Crimson's material, they were impressed with his talent and helped the fledgling Roxy Music to obtain a contract with [[E.G. Records]].\n\n[[Andy Mackay]] replied to Ferry's advertisement, not as a keyboard player but a saxophonist and oboist, though he did have a [[VCS3]] synthesizer. Mackay had already met [[Brian Eno]] during university days, as both were interested in avant-garde and electronic music. Although Eno was a non-musician, he could operate a synthesizer and owned a [[Revox]] reel-to-reel tape machine, so Mackay convinced him to join the band as a technical adviser. Before long Eno was an official member of the group.

Although he did not initially make the band as a guitarist, the group were impressed enough with Manzanera that he was invited to become Roxy Music's roadie, an offer which he accepted.\n\nThe band's fortunes were greatly increased by the support of broadcaster [[John Peel]] and ''Melody Maker'' journalist [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]]. Williams became an enthusiastic fan after meeting Ferry and being given a demonstration tape during mid-1971, and wrote the first major article on the band, featured on ''Melody Maker'''s \"Horizons\" page in the edition of 7 August 1971. This line-up of Roxy Music (Ferry/Mackay/Eno/Simpson/Thompson/O'List) recorded a BBC session shortly thereafter.\n\n===First two albums (1972\u20131973)===\nIn early February 1972, guitarist O'List quit the group abruptly after an altercation with Paul Thompson, which took place at their audition for David Enthoven of [[E.G. Records|EG Management]]. When O'List didn't show up for the next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band's sound mixer. When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O'List's permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as [[David Gilmour]], who was a friend of his older brother, and [[Soft Machine]]'s [[Robert Wyatt]].\n\nTwo weeks after Manzanera joined the band, Roxy Music signed with EG Management.<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) pp.376\u201377</ref>\n[[File:Roxy Music - TopPop 1973 13.png|thumb|right|Roxy Music perform on ''[[TopPop]]'' in 1973.

A&R staffer Tim Clark records that although he argued strongly that Island should contract them, company boss [[Chris Blackwell]] at first seemed unimpressed and Clark assumed he was not interested. A few days later however, Clark and Enthoven were standing in the hallway of the Island offices examining cover images for the album when Blackwell walked past, glanced at the artwork and said \"Looks great! Have we got them signed yet?\"<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) p.385\u201386</ref> The band signed with [[Island Records]] a few days later. The LP was released in June to good reviews and became a major success, reaching No.&nbsp;10 on the UK album chart in September 1972.<ref name=\"Prendergast\">{{cite book |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance: The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |last=Prendergast |first=Mark |year=2001 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=[https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/119 119] |isbn=1-58234-134-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/119 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of 1972, bassist Graham Simpson became increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative, which led to his leaving the band almost immediately after the recording of the debut album. He was replaced by Rik Kenton.<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) p.376</ref>\n\nTo bring more attention to their album, Roxy Music decided to record and release a single. Their debut single was \"[[Virginia Plain]]\", which scored No.&nbsp;4 in the British charts. The band's eclectic visual image, captured in their debut performance on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', became a cornerstone for the glam trend in the UK; the ''TOTP'' clip of \"Virginia Plain\" was later parodied by the British comedy series ''[[Big Train]]''. The single caused a renewed interest in the album. Soon after \"Virginia Plain\", Rik Kenton departed the band, which would never again have a permanent bass player.<!--Do not add note stating that Kenton was not officially replaced in the band unless the later references to Gustafson, Spenner, and Tibbs as official members of the band during their stints are changed to demonstrate that they were not.-->\n\nThe next album, ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'', was released in March 1973. It marked the beginning of the band's long, successful collaboration with producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]], who worked on all of the group's classic albums and singles in the 1970s. The album was promoted with the non-album single \"Pyjamarama\"; no album track was released as a single.

Also, [[John Gustafson (musician)|John Gustafson]] became the band's permanent bass player for the next three studio albums, but not always for live shows; though he toured with Roxy on certain dates in 1973 and 1975, other live Roxy bassists of this period (1973\u20131976) included Sal Maida, [[John Wetton]] and [[Rick Wills]].<ref>Stump, Paul \u2013 Unknown Pleasures: A Cultural biography of Roxy Music, Thunder's Mouth Press, New York, 1998, pps. 72, 154</ref>\n\nEno, meanwhile, was replaced by 18-year-old multi-instrumentalist [[Eddie Jobson]], formerly of [[progressive rock]]ers [[Curved Air]], who played keyboards and electric violin. Although some fans lamented the loss of the experimental attitude and camp aesthetic that Eno had brought to the band, the classically trained Jobson was an accomplished musician. Eno himself later acknowledged the quality of the two albums that followed his departure{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}, ''[[Stranded (album)|Stranded]]'' (1973) and ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'' (1974). ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to the albums as marking \"the zenith of contemporary British art rock\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n[[File:Roxy_Music_band.jpg|thumb|left|Roxy Music, 1974]] The songs on these albums also cemented Ferry's persona as the epitome of the suave, jaded Euro-sophisticate. Although this persona undoubtedly began as a deliberately ironic device, during the mid-1970s it seemed to merge with Ferry's real life, as the working-class miner's son from the north of England became an international rock star and an icon of male style.\n\nOn the first two Roxy albums, all songs were written solely by Bryan Ferry. Beginning with ''Stranded'', Mackay and Manzanera began to co-write some material. Gradually, their songwriting and musicianship became more integrated into the band's sound, although Ferry remained the dominant songwriter; throughout their career, all but one of Roxy's singles were written either wholly or jointly by Ferry (Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson did individually write a few of the band's B-sides). ''Stranded'' was released in November 1973, and produced the top-10 single \"[[Street Life (Roxy Music song)|Street Life]]\".\n\nThe fourth album, ''Country Life'', was released in 1974, and was the first Roxy Music album to enter the US Top 40, albeit at No.&nbsp;37. ''Country Life'' was met with widespread critical acclaim, with ''Rolling Stone'' referring to it \"as if Ferry ran a cabaret for psychotics, featuring chanteurs in a state of shock\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite news|title=Albums Reviews: Roxy Music -Country Life|work=Rolling Stone|author=Jim Miller|date=27 February 1975|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/123934/review/5943949/country_life|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415212253/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/123934/review/5943949/country_life|archive-date=15 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their fifth album, ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'', contained their only US top 40 hit, \"[[Love Is the Drug]]\". (Ferry said the song came to him while kicking the leaves during a walk through [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].)\n\nAfter the concert tours in support of ''Siren'' in 1976, Roxy Music disbanded. Their live album ''Viva!'' was released in August 1976. During this time Ferry released two solo records on which Manzanera and Thompson performed, and Manzanera reunited with Eno on the critically acclaimed one-off ''[[801 Live]]'' album.\n\n===Final albums and hiatus (1978\u20131983)===\nRoxy Music reunited during 1978 to record a new album, ''[[Manifesto (Roxy Music album)|Manifesto]]'', but with a reshuffled cast. Jobson was not present, and was reportedly not contacted for the reunion. (At that time, Jobson was touring and recording with his own band, [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]]) The sleeve of ''Manifesto'' indicated that the revived Roxy Music line-up consisted of Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson, along with [[Paul Carrack]] (keyboards), [[Alan Spenner]] (bass), and Gary Tibbs (ex Vibrators) (bass); despite this all other media pointed to Roxy Music being a quartet (and a trio following the 1980 departure of Thompson), with the latter three musicians being regular collaborators of the band.\n\nThree singles were spun off from ''Manifesto'', including the major UK hits \"Angel Eyes\" (UK No.&nbsp;4), and \"Dance Away\" (UK No.&nbsp;2). Both these tracks are significantly different from the album versions, as \"Dance Away\" was remixed for single release, and \"Angel Eyes\" was entirely re-recorded.\n\nAfter the tour and before the recording of the next album, ''[[Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)|Flesh + Blood]]'' (1980), Thompson broke his thumb in a motorcycle mishap and took a leave from the band. Soon afterward he left permanently, due to musical differences with Ferry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/interview-roxy-musics-paul-thompson-1449252|title=Interview: Roxy Music's Paul Thompson|date=6 February 2009|work=nechronicle}}</ref>\n\nAt this point, Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera became the only permanent members of Roxy Music, and were supplemented by a variety of session players over the next few years including Tibbs, Spenner, Carrack, [[Andy Newmark]] and Neil Hubbard. The trio's 1980 album ''Flesh + Blood'' became a huge commercial success in their homeland, as the album went to No.&nbsp;1 on the UK charts, and spun off three UK hits: \"Oh Yeah\" (UK No.&nbsp;5), \"Over You\" (UK No.&nbsp;5), and \"Same Old Scene\" (UK No.&nbsp;12).\n\nHowever, the changed cast reflected a distinct change in Roxy's musical style. Gone were the unpredictable elements of the group's sound, giving way to smoother musical arrangements. ''Rolling Stone'' panned ''Manifesto'' (\"Roxy Music has not gone disco.

A cover of a song written and originally recorded by [[John Lennon]], Roxy Music recorded \"Jealous Guy\" as a tribute to Lennon after his 1980 death. The song topped the UK charts for two weeks in March 1981, becoming the band's only No.&nbsp;1 single.\n\nLater, with more sombre and carefully sculpted soundscapes, the band's eighth\u2014and final\u2014studio album, ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' (1982), recorded at [[Chris Blackwell]]'s [[Compass Point Studios]], was a major commercial success and restored the group's critical reputation<ref>(''Rolling Stone'': \"''Avalon'' takes a long time to kick in, but it finally does, and it's a good one.\")</ref> and contained the successful single \"[[More Than This (Roxy Music song)|More Than This]]\". The album also included several Roxy Music classics, such as \"Avalon\", \"The Main Thing\", \"The Space Between\", \"True to Life\", and \"To Turn You On\". The trio (augmented by session players) toured extensively until 1983, when Bryan Ferry dissolved the band and band members devoted themselves full-time to solo careers.\n\n===Reunions and final dissolution (2001\u20132011)===\nFerry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson re-formed in 2001 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band and toured extensively. A festival performance in Portugal and a short tour of the United States followed in 2003. Absent was Brian Eno, who criticised the motives of the band's reunion, saying, \"I just don't like the idea. It leaves a bad taste\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1185763.stm Eno attacks Roxy reunion], BBC News</ref> Later Eno remarked that his comment had been taken out of context. Manzanera and Thompson recorded and toured with Ferry on his 2002 album ''[[Frantic (album)|Frantic]]''. Eno also contributed to ''Frantic'' on the track \"I Thought\".\n\nDuring 2002, Image Entertainment, Inc., released the concert DVD ''Roxy Music Live at the Apollo'' featuring performances of 20 songs plus interviews and rehearsal footage.\n\nIn 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked the group No.&nbsp;98 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRoxy Music gave a live performance at the 2005 [[Isle of Wight Festival]] on 11 June 2005, their first UK concert since the 2001\u20132002 world tour. On 2 July 2005, the band played \"[[Jealous Guy]]\", \"Do the Strand\", and \"Love is the Drug\" at the Berlin contribution to [[Live8]]; \"Do the Strand\" is available on the 4-disc DVD collection, whereas \"Love Is the Drug\" can be found on the Live 8 Berlin DVD.\n\nIn March 2005, it was announced on Phil Manzanera's official site<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.manzanera.com| title=Phil Manzanera, Expression Records and the Roxy Music Archive| accessdate=11 March 2006}}</ref> that the band, including Brian Eno, had decided to record an album of new material. The project would mark the first time Eno worked with Roxy Music since 1973's ''For Your Pleasure''. After a number of denials that he would be involved with any Roxy Music reunion, on 19 May 2006 Eno revealed that he had contributed two songs to the new album as well as playing keyboards on other tracks. He did, however, rule out touring with the band.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2006_355.shtml| title=Viva Roxy Music| accessdate=30 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060621075845/http://www.vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2006_355.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 June 2006}}</ref> Had the record been released as a Roxy Music album, it would have been the first album since ''Manifesto'' on which original drummer Paul Thompson performed.\n[[File:RoxyMusicExCelCentre2006.jpg|thumb|right|Roxy Music on stage during concert at London's [[ExCeL Exhibition Centre]], July 2006]]\n\nDuring early 2006 a classic Roxy track, \"The Main Thing\", was remixed by Malcolm Green and used as the soundtrack to a pan-European television commercial for the [[Opel Vectra]] featuring celebrated football referee [[Pierluigi Collina]]. In July that year, the band toured Europe. They concentrated mostly on places they had never visited before, such as Serbia and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Roxy Music's second drummer, Andy Newmark, performed during the tour, as Thompson withdrew due to health issues, and [[Oliver Thompson]] (guitar) made his first appearance with the band.\n\nIn a March 2007 interview with the ''Western Daily Press'', Ferry confirmed that the next Roxy album was definitely being made, but would not be vended for another \"year and a half\", as he had just released and toured behind his twelfth studio album, ''[[Dylanesque (album)|Dylanesque]]'', consisting of [[Bob Dylan]] covers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/cgi-bin/2007/cginews.cgi?record=22 |title=Roxy Rama |publisher=Roxy Rama |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> In June 2007, the band hired a Liverpool-based design agency to develop a website supporting their new album. Early in the year, Manzanera revealed that the band were planning to sign a record contract. In an October 2007 interview, Ferry said the album would include a collaboration with [[Scissor Sisters]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Elio Iannacci |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/ferry-tails/article696296/ |title=Style |publisher=globeandmail.com |accessdate=20 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOver the summer of 2010, Roxy Music headlined various festivals across the world, including Lovebox at London's Victoria Park, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Co.

Ferry, Mackay and Eno all had studied at prominent UK art colleges during the mid-to-late 1960s, when these institutions were introducing courses that avoided traditional art teaching practice, with its emphasis on painting, and instead focused on more recent developments, most notably [[pop art]], and explored new concepts such as [[cybernetics]]. As writer Michael Bracewell notes in his book ''Roxy: the band that invented an era'', Roxy Music was created expressly by Ferry, Mackay and Eno as a means of combining their mutual interests in music, modern art and fashion.\n\nFerry studied at [[Newcastle University]] in the Sixties under renowned [[pop art]]ist and educator [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], and many of Ferry's university friends, classmates and tutors \u2013 e.g. [[Rita Donagh]] and [[Tim Head]] \u2013 became well-known artists in their own right. Eno studied at [[Winchester School of Art]] and although his iconoclastic style became apparent early and caused some conflict with the college establishment, it also resulted in him meeting important artists and musicians including [[Cornelius Cardew]] and [[Gavin Bryars]]. His interest in electronic music also resulted in his first meetings with Andy Mackay, who was studying at Reading University and who had likewise developed a strong interest in avant garde and electronic music.\n\nThe three eventually joined forces in London during 1970\u201371 after meeting through mutual friends and decided to form a rock band.\n\nRoxy Music was initially influenced by other contemporary artists at the time including [[The Beatles]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[David Bowie]], [[Elton John]], [[The Animals]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[The Who]], as well as American rock'n'roll acts and genres such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Motown]]. Ferry stated that Roxy Music's unique sound came as a result of the diverse and eclectic musical backgrounds of the band's members; \"I had lots of musical influences, [[Phil Manzanera]] had this Latin heritage, being born in South America. Saxophone and oboe player [[Andy Mackay]] was classically trained. Eno with his deep interest in experimental music. They were specialists in their field. Paul Thompson brought a lot, with his very powerful, earthy drumming.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/01/bryan-ferry-roxy-music-invented-new-pop-game-for-anything |title=Bryan Ferry on how Roxy Music invented art pop: 'We were game for anything' |work=The Guardian |date=1 February 2018|accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/02/roxy-music-40-years |title=Roxy Music: the band that broke the sound barrier |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2012|accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref> \n\nRoxy Music was one of the first rock music groups to create and maintain a carefully crafted look and style that included their stage presentation, music videos, album and single cover designs, and promotional materials such as posters, handbills, cards and badges.\nThey were assisted in this by a group of friends and associates who helped to sculpt the classic Roxy Music 'look', notably fashion designer [[Antony Price]], hair stylist Keith Mainwaring, photographer Karl Stoecker, the group's \"PR consultant\" Simon Puxley (a former university friend of Mackay's) and Ferry's art school classmate Nicholas De Ville. Well-known critic [[Lester Bangs]] went so far as to say that Roxy represented \"the triumph of artifice\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/roxy-music/2774 |title=Roxy Music \u2013 The Early Years \u2013 Album Reviews |work=Nme |date=2 September 2000 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> Ferry later attributed the band's look to his interest in American music and popular culture icons including [[Marilyn Monroe]], Motown and [[Stax Records]] artists, and stated he wanted to create an alternative image to publicity shots of pop and rock groups at the time \"in a dreary street, looking rather sullen. Which was the norm.\u201d<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album, produced by [[King Crimson]]'s [[Pete Sinfield]], was the first in a series of increasingly sophisticated album covers, art-directed by Ferry in collaboration with his friend Nick De Ville. The album artwork imitated the visual style of classic \"[[girlie magazine|girlie]]\" and [[fashion magazine]]s, featuring high-fashion shots of scantily clad models [[Amanda Lear]], [[Marilyn Cole]] and [[Jerry Hall]], each of whom had romances with Ferry during the time of their contributions, as well as model Kari-Ann Muller who appears on the cover of the first Roxy album but who was not otherwise involved with anyone in the band, and who later married [[Mick Jagger]]'s brother Chris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.librario.com/1123|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809141847/http://www.librario.com/1123|url-status=dead|title=These Vintage Years! \u2013 Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music \u2013 Kari-Ann|archivedate=9 August 2010}}</ref> The title of the fourth Roxy album, ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'', was intended as a parody of the well-known British rural magazine of the same name, and the visually punning front cover photo featured two models (two German fans, Constanze Karoli\u2014sister of [[Can (band)|Can]]'s [[Michael Karoli]]\u2014and Eveline Grunwald)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/ac26countrylife.html |title=Seventies' Greatest Album Covers: Country Life |publisher=Superseventies.com |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> clad only in semi-transparent lingerie standing in a forest. As a result, in many areas of the United States the album was sold in an opaque plastic wrapper because retailers refused to display the cover. Later, an alternative cover, featuring just a picture of the forest, was used.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 2005, [[Tim de Lisle]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' argued that Roxy Music are the second most influential British band after [[The Beatles]]. He wrote, \"Somehow, in a landscape dominated by [[Led Zeppelin]] at one end and [[The Osmonds]] at the other, they managed to reach the Top 10 with a heady mixture of futurism, retro rock'n'roll, camp, funny noises, silly outfits, art techniques, film references and oboe solos.

Some of the Sex Pistols' instruments and their expensive PA system was said to have been stolen by Steve Jones and Paul Cook from a Roxy Music gig in 1975.

As its name suggests, Simula was designed for doing [[simulations]], and the needs of that [[Problem domain|domain]] provided the framework for many of the features of object-oriented languages today.\n\nSimula has been used in a wide range of applications such as simulating [[very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] designs, [[process modeling]], [[protocol (computing)|protocols]], [[algorithm]]s, and other applications such as [[typesetting]], [[computer graphics]], and [[education]]. The influence of Simula is often understated, and Simula-type objects are reimplemented in [[C++]], [[Object Pascal]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and several other languages. Computer scientists such as [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], creator of C++, and [[James Gosling]], creator of Java, have acknowledged Simula as a major influence.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=William|title=Before C, What Did You Use?|url=http://www.electronicdesign.com/embedded-revolution/c-what-did-you-use|website=Electronic Design|accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe following account is based on Jan Rune Holmevik's historical essay.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n  | last = Holmevik\n  | first = Jan Rune\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Compiling Simula: A historical study of technological genesis\n  | journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing\n  | volume = 16\n  | issue = 4\n  | pages = 25\u201337\n  | publisher =\n  | location =\n  | year = 1994\n  | url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/simula/holmevik-simula-ieeeannals94.pdf\n  | issn =\n  | doi = 10.1109/85.329756\n  | id =\n  | accessdate = 12 May 2010 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Holmevik|first=Jan Rune|url=http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~cim/sim_history.html|title=Compiling Simula|publisher=Institute for Studies in Research and Higher Education|location=Oslo, Norway|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420140846/http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~cim/sim_history.html|archive-date=20 April 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=19 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Kristen Nygaard]] started writing computer simulation programs in 1957. Nygaard saw a need for a better way to describe the heterogeneity and the [[instruction (computer science)|operation]] of a system.  To go further with his ideas on a formal [[computer language]] for describing a system, Nygaard realized that he needed someone with more [[computer programming]] skills than he had.  [[Ole-Johan Dahl]] joined him on his work January 1962.  The decision of linking the language up to [[ALGOL 60]] was made shortly after.  By May 1962 the main concepts for a [[simulation]] [[programming language|language]] were set. \"SIMULA I\" was born, a special purpose programming language for simulating discrete event systems.\n\nKristen Nygaard was invited to visit the [[Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation]] late May 1962 in connection with the marketing of their new [[UNIVAC 1107]] computer.  At that visit Nygaard presented the ideas of Simula to [[Bob Bemer|Robert Bemer]], the director of systems programming at [[Univac]]. Bemer was a sworn [[ALGOL]] fan and found the Simula project compelling. Bemer was also chairing a session at the second international conference on information processing hosted by [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]].  He invited Nygaard, who presented the paper \"SIMULA -- An Extension of ALGOL to the Description of Discrete-Event Networks\".\n\nThe [[Norwegian Computing Center]] got a [[UNIVAC 1107]] August 1963 at a considerable discount, on which Dahl implemented the SIMULA I under contract with UNIVAC. The implementation was based on the UNIVAC [[ALGOL 60]] compiler. SIMULA I was fully operational on the UNIVAC 1107 by January 1965.  In the following couple of years Dahl and Nygaard spent a lot of time teaching Simula. Simula spread to several countries around the world and SIMULA I was later implemented on [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5500 computers]] and the Russian [[Ural (computer)|URAL-16 computer]].\n\nIn 1966 [[C. A. R. Hoare]] introduced the concept of record class construct, which Dahl and Nygaard  extended with the concept of prefixing and other features to meet their requirements for a generalized process concept.  Dahl and Nygaard presented their paper on [[class (computer science)|Class]] and [[subclass (computer science)|Subclass]] declarations at the  [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]] Working Conference on [[simulation language]]s in [[Oslo]], May 1967. This paper became the first formal definition of Simula 67. In June 1967 a conference was held to standardize the language and initiate a number of implementations. Dahl proposed to unify the [[data type|type]] and the class concept. This led to serious discussions, and the proposal was rejected by the board.  SIMULA 67 was formally standardized on the first meeting of the SIMULA Standards Group (SSG) in February 1968.\n\nSimula was influential in the development of [[Smalltalk]] and later [[object-oriented programming language]]s.  It also helped inspire the [[actor model]] of concurrent computation although Simula only supports [[coroutine]]s and not true [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lehrmann Madsen|first=Ole|title=Concurrent Objects and Beyond|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-3-662-44471-9|editors=Gul Agha, Atsushi Igarashi, Naoki Kobayashi, Hidehiko Masuhara, Satoshi Matsuoka, Etsuya Shibayama, Kenjiro Taura|location=Berlin|pages=68|chapter=Building Safe Concurrency Abstractions|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-44471-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the late sixties and the early seventies there were four main implementations of Simula:\n\n* [[UNIVAC|UNIVAC 1100]] by [[Norwegian Computing Center|NCC]]\n* [[System/360]] and [[System/370]] by [[Norwegian Computing Center|NCC]]\n* [[CDC 3000]] by [[University of Oslo]]'s Joint Computer Installation at Kjeller\n* [[TOPS-10]] by [[Swedish National Defence Research Institute]] (FOA)\n\nThese implementations were ported to a wide range of platforms.  The [[TOPS-10]] implemented the concept of public, protected, and private member variables and procedures, that later was integrated into Simula 87.  Simula 87 is the latest standard and is ported to a wide range of platforms.  There are mainly four implementations:\n\n* Simula AS\n* Lund Simula\n* GNU Cim<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/cim/|title=GNU Cim}}</ref>\n* Portable Simula Revisited<ref>{{cite web |title=Portable Simula Revisited |url=https://portablesimula.github.io/github.io/ |website=GitHub |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2001 Dahl and Nygaard were awarded the [[IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] \"For the introduction of the concepts underlying object-oriented programming through the design and implementation of SIMULA 67\". In April 2002 they received the 2001 A. M.

The new Computer Science building at the [[University of Oslo]] is named Ole Johan Dahl's House, in Dahl's honour, and the main auditorium is named Simula.\n\n== Sample code ==\n\n=== Minimal program ===\nThe empty [[computer file]] is the minimal [[computer program|program]] in Simula, measured by the size of the [[source code]].\nIt consists of one thing only; a dummy [[statement (programming)|statement]].\n\nHowever, the minimal program is more conveniently represented as an empty block:\n\n '''Begin'''\n '''End''';\n\nIt begins executing and immediately terminates.\nThe language does not have any [[return value]] from the program itself.\n\n=== Classic Hello world ===\nAn example of a [[Hello world program]] in Simula:\n\n '''Begin'''\n    '''OutText''' (\"Hello, World!\");\n    '''Outimage''';\n '''End''';\n\nSimula is [[case-insensitive]].\n\n=== Classes, subclasses and virtual procedures ===\n\nA more realistic example with use of classes,<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|1.3.3, 2}} subclasses<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|2.2.1}} and virtual procedures:<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|2.2.3}}\n\n '''Begin'''\n    '''Class''' Glyph;\n       '''Virtual''': '''Procedure''' print '''Is''' '''Procedure''' print;;\n    '''Begin'''\n    '''End''';\n\n    Glyph '''Class''' Char (c);\n       '''Character''' c;\n    '''Begin'''\n       '''Procedure''' print;\n         OutChar(c);\n    '''End''';\n\n    Glyph '''Class''' Line (elements);\n       '''Ref''' (Glyph) '''Array''' elements;\n    '''Begin'''\n       '''Procedure''' print;\n       '''Begin'''\n          '''Integer''' i;\n          '''For''' i:= 1 '''Step''' 1 '''Until''' UpperBound (elements, 1) '''Do'''\n             elements (i).print;\n          OutImage;\n       '''End''';\n    '''End''';\n\n    '''Ref''' (Glyph) rg;\n    '''Ref''' (Glyph) '''Array''' rgs (1 : 4);\n\n    ''! Main program;''\n    rgs (1):- '''New''' Char ('A');\n    rgs (2):- '''New''' Char ('b');\n    rgs (3):- '''New''' Char ('b');\n    rgs (4):- '''New''' Char ('a');\n    rg:- '''New''' Line (rgs);\n    rg.print;\n '''End''';\n\nThe above example has one [[superclass (computer science)|super class]] (Glyph) with two [[subclass (computer science)|subclasses]] (Char and Line).\nThere is one [[virtual function|virtual procedure]] with two [[implementation]]s.\nThe execution starts by executing the main program.\nSimula does not have the concept of [[abstract class]]es since classes with [[pure virtual function|pure virtual procedures]] can be [[instantiation (computer science)|instantiated]].  This means that in the above example all classes can be instantiated.  Calling a [[pure virtual function|pure virtual procedure]] will however produce a [[run-time error]].\n\n=== Call by name ===\n\nSimula supports [[call by name]]<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|8.2.3}} so the [[Jensen's Device]] can easily be implemented.\nHowever, the default transmission mode for simple parameter is [[call by value]], contrary to  [[ALGOL]] which used [[call by name]].\nThe source code for the [[Jensen's Device]] must therefore specify [[call by name]] for the parameters when compiled by a Simula compiler.\n\nAnother much simpler example is the [[arithmetic function#Summation functions|summation function <math> \\sum </math>]] which can be implemented as follows:\n\n '''Real''' '''Procedure''' Sigma (k, m, n, u);\n    '''Name''' k, u;\n    '''Integer''' k, m, n; '''Real''' u;\n '''Begin'''\n    '''Real''' s;\n    k:= m;\n    '''While''' k <= n '''Do''' '''Begin''' s:= s + u; k:= k + 1; '''End''';\n    Sigma:= s;\n '''End''';\n\nThe above code uses [[call by name]] for the controlling variable (k) and the expression (u).\nThis allows the controlling variable to be used in the expression.\n\nNote that the Simula standard allows for certain restrictions on the controlling variable\nin a [[for loop]]. The above code therefore uses a while loop for maximum portability.\n\nThe following:\n\n<math> Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{100}{1 \\over (i + a)^2}</math>\n\ncan then be implemented as follows:\n\n Z:= Sigma (i, 1, 100, 1 / (i + a) ** 2);\n\n=== Simulation ===\n\nSimula includes a [[simulation]]<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|14.2}} package for doing [[discrete event simulation]]s.  This simulation package is based on Simula's [[object oriented]] features and its [[coroutine]]<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|9.2}} concept.\n\nSam, Sally, and Andy are shopping for clothes.  They have to share one fitting room.  Each one of them is browsing the store for about 12 minutes and then uses the fitting room exclusively for about three minutes, each following a normal distribution.  A simulation of their fitting room experience is as follows:\n\n Simulation '''Begin'''\n    '''Class''' FittingRoom; '''Begin'''\n       '''Ref''' (Head) door;\n       '''Boolean''' inUse;\n       '''Procedure''' request; '''Begin'''\n          '''If''' inUse '''Then''' '''Begin'''\n              Wait (door);\n              door.First.Out;\n          '''End''';\n          inUse:= '''True''';\n       '''End''';\n       '''Procedure''' leave; '''Begin'''\n          inUse:= '''False''';\n          '''Activate''' door.First;\n       '''End''';\n       door:- '''New''' Head;\n    '''End''';\n\n    '''Procedure''' report (message); '''Text''' message; '''Begin'''\n       OutFix (Time, 2, 0); OutText (\": \" & message); OutImage;\n    '''End''';\n\n    Process '''Class''' Person (pname); '''Text''' pname; '''Begin'''\n       '''While''' '''True''' '''Do''' '''Begin'''\n          Hold (Normal (12, 4, u));\n          report  (pname & \" is requesting the fitting room\");\n          fittingroom1.request;\n          report (pname & \" has entered the fitting room\");\n          Hold (Normal (3, 1, u));\n          fittingroom1.leave;\n          report (pname & \" has left the fitting room\");\n       '''End''';\n    '''End''';\n\n    '''Integer''' u;\n    '''Ref''' (FittingRoom) fittingRoom1;\n\n    fittingRoom1:- '''New''' FittingRoom;\n    '''Activate''' '''New''' Person (\"Sam\");\n    '''Activate''' '''New''' Person (\"Sally\");\n    '''Activate''' '''New''' Person (\"Andy\");\n    Hold (100);\n '''End''';\n\nThe main block is prefixed with <code>Simulation</code> for enabling simulation.  The simulation package can be used on any block and simulations can even be nested when simulating someone doing simulations.\n\nThe fitting room object uses a queue (<code>door</code>) for getting access to the fitting room.  When someone requests the fitting room and it's in use they must wait in this queue (<code>Wait (door)</code>).  When someone leaves the fitting room the first one (if any) is released from the queue (<code>'''Activate''' door.first</code>) and accordingly removed from the door queue (<code>door.First.Out</code>).\n\nPerson is a subclass of Process and its activity is described using hold (time for browsing the store and time spent in the fitting room) and calls procedures in the fitting room object for requesting and leaving the fitting room.\n\nThe main program creates all the objects and activates all the person objects to put them into the event queue.

The influence of Simula is often understated, and Simula-type objects are reimplemented in [[C++]], [[Object Pascal]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and several other languages.

Nygaard saw a need for a better way to describe the heterogeneity and the [[instruction (computer science)|operation]] of a system.  To go further with his ideas on a formal [[computer language]] for describing a system, Nygaard realized that he needed someone with more [[computer programming]] skills than he had.  [[Ole-Johan Dahl]] joined him on his work January 1962.  The decision of linking the language up to [[ALGOL 60]] was made shortly after.  By May 1962 the main concepts for a [[simulation]] [[programming language|language]] were set. \"SIMULA I\" was born, a special purpose programming language for simulating discrete event systems.\n\nKristen Nygaard was invited to visit the [[Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation]] late May 1962 in connection with the marketing of their new [[UNIVAC 1107]] computer.  At that visit Nygaard presented the ideas of Simula to [[Bob Bemer|Robert Bemer]], the director of systems programming at [[Univac]]. Bemer was a sworn [[ALGOL]] fan and found the Simula project compelling. Bemer was also chairing a session at the second international conference on information processing hosted by [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]].  He invited Nygaard, who presented the paper \"SIMULA -- An Extension of ALGOL to the Description of Discrete-Event Networks\".\n\nThe [[Norwegian Computing Center]] got a [[UNIVAC 1107]] August 1963 at a considerable discount, on which Dahl implemented the SIMULA I under contract with UNIVAC. The implementation was based on the UNIVAC [[ALGOL 60]] compiler. SIMULA I was fully operational on the UNIVAC 1107 by January 1965.  In the following couple of years Dahl and Nygaard spent a lot of time teaching Simula. Simula spread to several countries around the world and SIMULA I was later implemented on [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5500 computers]] and the Russian [[Ural (computer)|URAL-16 computer]].\n\nIn 1966 [[C. A. R. Hoare]] introduced the concept of record class construct, which Dahl and Nygaard  extended with the concept of prefixing and other features to meet their requirements for a generalized process concept.  Dahl and Nygaard presented their paper on [[class (computer science)|Class]] and [[subclass (computer science)|Subclass]] declarations at the  [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]] Working Conference on [[simulation language]]s in [[Oslo]], May 1967. This paper became the first formal definition of Simula 67. In June 1967 a conference was held to standardize the language and initiate a number of implementations. Dahl proposed to unify the [[data type|type]] and the class concept. This led to serious discussions, and the proposal was rejected by the board.  SIMULA 67 was formally standardized on the first meeting of the SIMULA Standards Group (SSG) in February 1968.\n\nSimula was influential in the development of [[Smalltalk]] and later [[object-oriented programming language]]s.  It also helped inspire the [[actor model]] of concurrent computation although Simula only supports [[coroutine]]s and not true [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lehrmann Madsen|first=Ole|title=Concurrent Objects and Beyond|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-3-662-44471-9|editors=Gul Agha, Atsushi Igarashi, Naoki Kobayashi, Hidehiko Masuhara, Satoshi Matsuoka, Etsuya Shibayama, Kenjiro Taura|location=Berlin|pages=68|chapter=Building Safe Concurrency Abstractions|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-44471-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the late sixties and the early seventies there were four main implementations of Simula:\n\n* [[UNIVAC|UNIVAC 1100]] by [[Norwegian Computing Center|NCC]]\n* [[System/360]] and [[System/370]] by [[Norwegian Computing Center|NCC]]\n* [[CDC 3000]] by [[University of Oslo]]'s Joint Computer Installation at Kjeller\n* [[TOPS-10]] by [[Swedish National Defence Research Institute]] (FOA)\n\nThese implementations were ported to a wide range of platforms.  The [[TOPS-10]] implemented the concept of public, protected, and private member variables and procedures, that later was integrated into Simula 87.  Simula 87 is the latest standard and is ported to a wide range of platforms.  There are mainly four implementations:\n\n* Simula AS\n* Lund Simula\n* GNU Cim<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/cim/|title=GNU Cim}}</ref>\n* Portable Simula Revisited<ref>{{cite web |title=Portable Simula Revisited |url=https://portablesimula.github.io/github.io/ |website=GitHub |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2001 Dahl and Nygaard were awarded the [[IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] \"For the introduction of the concepts underlying object-oriented programming through the design and implementation of SIMULA 67\".

The new Computer Science building at the [[University of Oslo]] is named Ole Johan Dahl's House, in Dahl's honour, and the main auditorium is named Simula.\n\n== Sample code ==\n\n=== Minimal program ===\nThe empty [[computer file]] is the minimal [[computer program|program]] in Simula, measured by the size of the [[source code]].\nIt consists of one thing only; a dummy [[statement (programming)|statement]].\n\nHowever, the minimal program is more conveniently represented as an empty block:\n\n '''Begin'''\n '''End''';\n\nIt begins executing and immediately terminates.\nThe language does not have any [[return value]] from the program itself.\n\n=== Classic Hello world ===\nAn example of a [[Hello world program]] in Simula:\n\n '''Begin'''\n    '''OutText''' (\"Hello, World!\");\n    '''Outimage''';\n '''End''';\n\nSimula is [[case-insensitive]].\n\n=== Classes, subclasses and virtual procedures ===\n\nA more realistic example with use of classes,<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|1.3.3, 2}} subclasses<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|2.2.1}} and virtual procedures:<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|2.2.3}}\n\n '''Begin'''\n    '''Class''' Glyph;\n       '''Virtual''': '''Procedure''' print '''Is''' '''Procedure''' print;;\n    '''Begin'''\n    '''End''';\n\n    Glyph '''Class''' Char (c);\n       '''Character''' c;\n    '''Begin'''\n       '''Procedure''' print;\n         OutChar(c);\n    '''End''';\n\n    Glyph '''Class''' Line (elements);\n       '''Ref''' (Glyph) '''Array''' elements;\n    '''Begin'''\n       '''Procedure''' print;\n       '''Begin'''\n          '''Integer''' i;\n          '''For''' i:= 1 '''Step''' 1 '''Until''' UpperBound (elements, 1) '''Do'''\n             elements (i).print;\n          OutImage;\n       '''End''';\n    '''End''';\n\n    '''Ref''' (Glyph) rg;\n    '''Ref''' (Glyph) '''Array''' rgs (1 : 4);\n\n    ''! Main program;''\n    rgs (1):- '''New''' Char ('A');\n    rgs (2):- '''New''' Char ('b');\n    rgs (3):- '''New''' Char ('b');\n    rgs (4):- '''New''' Char ('a');\n    rg:- '''New''' Line (rgs);\n    rg.print;\n '''End''';\n\nThe above example has one [[superclass (computer science)|super class]] (Glyph) with two [[subclass (computer science)|subclasses]] (Char and Line).\nThere is one [[virtual function|virtual procedure]] with two [[implementation]]s.\nThe execution starts by executing the main program.\nSimula does not have the concept of [[abstract class]]es since classes with [[pure virtual function|pure virtual procedures]] can be [[instantiation (computer science)|instantiated]].  This means that in the above example all classes can be instantiated.  Calling a [[pure virtual function|pure virtual procedure]] will however produce a [[run-time error]].\n\n=== Call by name ===\n\nSimula supports [[call by name]]<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|8.2.3}} so the [[Jensen's Device]] can easily be implemented.\nHowever, the default transmission mode for simple parameter is [[call by value]], contrary to  [[ALGOL]] which used [[call by name]].\nThe source code for the [[Jensen's Device]] must therefore specify [[call by name]] for the parameters when compiled by a Simula compiler.\n\nAnother much simpler example is the [[arithmetic function#Summation functions|summation function <math> \\sum </math>]] which can be implemented as follows:\n\n '''Real''' '''Procedure''' Sigma (k, m, n, u);\n    '''Name''' k, u;\n    '''Integer''' k, m, n; '''Real''' u;\n '''Begin'''\n    '''Real''' s;\n    k:= m;\n    '''While''' k <= n '''Do''' '''Begin''' s:= s + u; k:= k + 1; '''End''';\n    Sigma:= s;\n '''End''';\n\nThe above code uses [[call by name]] for the controlling variable (k) and the expression (u).\nThis allows the controlling variable to be used in the expression.\n\nNote that the Simula standard allows for certain restrictions on the controlling variable\nin a [[for loop]]. The above code therefore uses a while loop for maximum portability.\n\nThe following:\n\n<math> Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{100}{1 \\over (i + a)^2}</math>\n\ncan then be implemented as follows:\n\n Z:= Sigma (i, 1, 100, 1 / (i + a) ** 2);\n\n=== Simulation ===\n\nSimula includes a [[simulation]]<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|14.2}} package for doing [[discrete event simulation]]s.  This simulation package is based on Simula's [[object oriented]] features and its [[coroutine]]<ref name=\"CommonBase\"/>{{rp|9.2}} concept.\n\nSam, Sally, and Andy are shopping for clothes.  They have to share one fitting room.  Each one of them is browsing the store for about 12 minutes and then uses the fitting room exclusively for about three minutes, each following a normal distribution.  A simulation of their fitting room experience is as follows:\n\n Simulation '''Begin'''\n    '''Class''' FittingRoom; '''Begin'''\n       '''Ref''' (Head) door;\n       '''Boolean''' inUse;\n       '''Procedure''' request; '''Begin'''\n          '''If''' inUse '''Then''' '''Begin'''\n              Wait (door);\n              door.First.Out;\n          '''End''';\n          inUse:= '''True''';\n       '''End''';\n       '''Procedure''' leave; '''Begin'''\n          inUse:= '''False''';\n          '''Activate''' door.First;\n       '''End''';\n       door:- '''New''' Head;\n    '''End''';\n\n    '''Procedure''' report (message); '''Text''' message; '''Begin'''\n       OutFix (Time, 2, 0); OutText (\": \" & message); OutImage;\n    '''End''';\n\n    Process '''Class''' Person (pname); '''Text''' pname; '''Begin'''\n       '''While''' '''True''' '''Do''' '''Begin'''\n          Hold (Normal (12, 4, u));\n          report  (pname & \" is requesting the fitting room\");\n          fittingroom1.request;\n          report (pname & \" has entered the fitting room\");\n          Hold (Normal (3, 1, u));\n          fittingroom1.leave;\n          report (pname & \" has left the fitting room\");\n       '''End''';\n    '''End''';\n\n    '''Integer''' u;\n    '''Ref''' (FittingRoom) fittingRoom1;\n\n    fittingRoom1:- '''New''' FittingRoom;\n    '''Activate''' '''New''' Person (\"Sam\");\n    '''Activate''' '''New''' Person (\"Sally\");\n    '''Activate''' '''New''' Person (\"Andy\");\n    Hold (100);\n '''End''';\n\nThe main block is prefixed with <code>Simulation</code> for enabling simulation.  The simulation package can be used on any block and simulations can even be nested when simulating someone doing simulations.\n\nThe fitting room object uses a queue (<code>door</code>) for getting access to the fitting room.  When someone requests the fitting room and it's in use they must wait in this queue (<code>Wait (door)</code>).  When someone leaves the fitting room the first one (if any) is released from the queue (<code>'''Activate''' door.first</code>) and accordingly removed from the door queue (<code>door.First.Out</code>).\n\nPerson is a subclass of Process and its activity is described using hold (time for browsing the store and time spent in the fitting room) and calls procedures in the fitting room object for requesting and leaving the fitting room.\n\nThe main program creates all the objects and activates all the person objects to put them into the event queue.  The main program holds for 100 minutes of simulated time before the program terminates.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[BETA (programming language)|BETA]], a modern successor to Simula\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.edelweb.eu/Simula/|title=IBM System 360/370 Compiler and Historical Documentation|type=The Simula Standard and other historical documentation|last=Sylvester|first=Peter}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Pooley\n |first       = Rob\n |title       = An Introduction to Programming in Simula\n |url         = http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rjp/bookhtml/\n |publisher   = Alfred Waller Ltd\n |year        = 1987\n |isbn        = 0632016116\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20040919031218/http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rjp/bookhtml/\n |archivedate = 2004-09-19\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:ALGOL 60 dialect]]\n[[Category:Class-based programming languages]]\n[[Category:Norwegian inventions]]\n[[Category:Programming languages created in 1962]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Norway]]\n[[Category:Simulation programming languages]]\n[[Category:Programming languages]]\n[[Category:1962 software]]\n", "name_user": "Jerryobject", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cut needless spaces.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula"}

In Scottish ballad lore, Adam became known as '''[[Edom o Gordon|Edom o'Gordon]]'''.\n\n==Supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots==\n[[File:Auchindoun Castle - geograph.org.uk - 265007.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Auchindoun Castle]]]]\nAdam was the son of [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly]] and [[Elizabeth Keith, Countess of Huntley|Elizabeth Keith]], daughter of [[Earl Marischal|Robert Keith, Master of Marischal]].\n\nAdam Gordon was taken prisoner at the [[battle of Corrichie]] in 1562, but was restored to royal favour and made Laird of [[Auchindoun Castle]]. During the civil war he fought for the exiled Queen Mary, particularly against the [[Clan Forbes]] who followed the cause of [[James VI of Scotland]] against his mother. In October 1571 Adam defeated the Forbes at the battle of [[battle of Tillieangus|Tillieangus]]. In November at [[battle of Craibstone|Craibstone]], or Aberdeen Bridge, he defeated the Forbes and a troop of the Regent's soldiers commanded by Captains Chisholm and Wedderburn. Adam then defeated an army of [[Regent Mar]] at Brechin. The major historical sources for Adam's role in the conflict are the near contemporary accounts of [[John Knox]]'s secretary [[Richard Bannatyne]] and the chronicles, the ''Diurnal of Occurrents'' and ''History of King James the Sext''.\n\n==Battle of Tullieangus and the burning of Corgarff==\nBannatyne said that Adam had 1,000 men at Tillieangus against 300 Forbes on 17 October 1571. Adam concealed his superior numbers to draw the Forbes into an ambush. The brother of Lord Forbes, Arthur Forbes was killed and 12 or 16 Forbes. William Forbes and 16 others were taken prisoner. Twenty-two Gordons were killed,<ref>Bannatyne, Richard, ''Memorials of the Transactions in Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1836), p. 194.</ref> including John Gordon of Buiky.<ref>'Walter Cullen's Chronicle of Aberdeen,' in [https://archive.org/details/miscellanyofspal02spaluoft Stuart, John, ed., ''Miscellany of the Spalding Club'', vol. 2 (Aberdeen, 1842)], p. 38.</ref> Before Craibstone, he or his men were involved in a massacre of the Forbes family at [[Corgarff Castle]]. According to Bannatyne, 24 people were burnt to death in the castle including Lady Towie, although a day's truce was agreed. Only one escaped, by crawling through the heather and straw which the attackers had piled to fire the castle.<ref>Bannatyne, Richard, ''Memorials of the Transactions in Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1836), pp. 212-3.</ref> The ''Diurnal'' says that Adam sent his lieutenant Captain Ker to Lady Towie to ask her to surrender \"Carrigill or (Corgarffe).\" When she said no, Adam ordered the place to be burnt, with about 27 casualties including Lady Towie and her daughters.<ref>Thomson, Thomas, ed., ''Diurnal of Occurrents'' (Edinburgh, 1833), p. 255.</ref>\n\nGordon's kinsman, [[Alexander Gordon (bishop of Galloway)]] wrote from Edinburgh on 16 November 1571 with news of the battle at Tullieangus to [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]], who was the keeper of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. He intended to promote the Marian cause in England, writing \"there was slain the principals of the gentlemen of the Forbes the number of 36, with my Lord Forbes's brother, one hundred taken, whereof my Lord Forbes' second son is one, and the rest brothers of Baronies and substantial gentlemen\".<ref>[[Edmund Lodge]], ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 2 (London, 1791), pp. 62-63.</ref>\n\n==Battle of Craibstone==\nAccording to the ''Diurnal'', the Master of Forbes and Captains Chisholm and Wedderburn marched from [[Cowie, Aberdeenshire|Cowie]] to Aberdeen on 20 November 1571. Chisholm and Wedderburn, the Regent's men, commanded two bands of [[musketeer]]s called \"hagbutters.\" Their whole strength was about 800 men. Adam and Captain Ker had 900 men in the town. The Forbes came over the bridge of Aberdeen, and fought with Adam's men for an hour (at Craibstone). The Forbes retreated, Chisholm and 300 men were killed, and the Master of Forbes and 200 men were captured. Two hundred Gordons were killed.<ref>Thomson, Thomas, ed.,  ''Diurnal of Occurrents'' (Edinburgh, 1833), p. 255.</ref> Bannatyne mentions that some cavalry commanded by Alexander Campbell fought with the Forbes. Bannatyne says that the Forbes and the Regent's troops came to Aberdeen because they were short of food. Adam was reluctant to fight because he was outgunned, but saw his chance after the troops wasted their ammunition. The Forbes bowmen or archers fled, Bannatyne wrote they \"gave backis, and did no guid.\"<ref>Bannatyne, Richard, ''Memorials of the Transactions in Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1836), pp. 212-3.</ref>\n\nA chronicle written by an Aberdeen man, Walter Cullen, records the casualties at 'Craibstayne' as about 60, three score, on each side (unless this a copyist's error for three hundred), and mentions the death of 'Guid' Duncan Forbes.<ref>'Walter Cullen's Chronicle of Aberdeen,' in Stuart, John, ed., ''Miscellany of the Spalding Club, vol. 2 (Aberdeen, 1842), p. 38.</ref> The chronicle ''History of King James of Sext'' described Adam's vigilance in Aberdeen as like a \"valiant chiftayne, having alwayis his men in reddienes,\" and adds there were 600 cavalrymen against him. The fleeing Forbes were pursued for four miles. According to the ''History of James Sext'' (which has a bias against the Regents of Scotland), there were 300 Forbes casualties against thirty Gordons. Adam's victories against the Forbes were marred by the \"infamy\" of the burning of the Lady Towie.<ref>Thomson, Thomas, ed., ''The historie and life of King James the Sext: being an account of the affairs of Scotland from the year 1566 to the year 1596'' (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 96-7.</ref>\n\n==Exile and death==\nAdam was included in the peace called the \"Pacification of Perth\" of 23 February 1573. He was then allowed to go to France, where he tried to rally support for Queen Mary.<ref>Huntly, Marquess of, ''The Cock o'the North'' (London, 1935), pp. 36\u201346.</ref> Then in 1574, Adam was in touch with the English diplomat in Scotland, [[Henry Killigrew (diplomat)|Henry Killigrew]], and in France, and [[Francis Walsingham]] trying to secure his reconciliation with [[Regent Morton]]. At the same time, his brother, the [[George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly|5th Earl of Huntly]], wrote to [[Elizabeth I of England]] distancing himself from Adam's activities in France. In September 1574, Morton arrested Alexander Duff, a servant of Adam Gordon who came to Scotland.\n\nIn the summer of 1575 Adam Gordon returned to Scotland and was imprisoned at [[Blackness Castle]], then in 1577 released under a bond to live in Galloway. On 9 April 1580, Adam Gordon came to Stirling when, according to [[Cunningham of Drumquhassle|John Cunningham of Drumquhassle]] there was a scare that James VI might be abducted to [[Dumbarton Castle]] and taken to France.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 5 (Edinburh, 1907), pp. 2, 5, 23, 31\u20132, 59, 62, 178, 215, 253, 264, 329, 392\u20133.</ref>\n\nHe died at Perth on 27 October 1580.<ref>Huntly, Marquess of, ''The Cock o'the North'' (London, 1935), pp. 36\u201346.</ref>\n\n==References==\n* [[Thomas Thomson (advocate)|Thomson, Thomas]], ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=01oJAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s  ''A Diurnal of Remarkable Occurrents in Scotland, 1513-1575'' (Edinburgh, 1833).]\n* [[John Colville (c. 1540\u20131605)|Colville, John]], attributed to, Thomson, Thomas, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=-1sJAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The historie and life of King James the Sext: being an account of the affairs of Scotland from the year 1566 to the year 1596'' (Edinburgh, 1825).]\n* Pitcairn, Robert, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=hawVAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s Richard Bannatyne's ''Memorials of transactions in Scotland, 1569-1573'' (Edinburgh, 1836).]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gordon, Adam}}\n[[Category:1545 births]]\n[[Category:1580 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Scottish people]]\n[[Category:16th-century soldiers]]\n[[Category:Lairds]]\n[[Category:Scottish knights]]\n[[Category:Scottish prisoners and detainees]]\n[[Category:Scottish expatriates in France]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:House of Gordon|Adam Gordon of Auchindoun]]\n", "text_old": "'''Adam Gordon''' of Auchindoun (1545\u20131580), Scottish knight, younger brother of the [[Earl of Huntly]] and military leader during the [[Marian civil war]] on behalf of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in north west Scotland.

Chisholm and Wedderburn, the Regent's men, commanded two bands of [[musketeer]]s called \"hagbutters.\" Their whole strength was about 800 men. Adam and Captain Ker had 900 men in the town. The Forbes came over the bridge of Aberdeen, and fought with Adam's men for an hour (at Craibstone). The Forbes retreated, Chisholm and 300 men were killed, and the Master of Forbes and 200 men were captured. Two hundred Gordons were killed.<ref>Thomson, Thomas, ed.,  ''Diurnal of Occurrents'' (Edinburgh, 1833), p. 255.</ref> Bannatyne mentions that some cavalry commanded by Alexander Campbell fought with the Forbes. Bannatyne says that the Forbes and the Regent's troops came to Aberdeen because they were short of food. Adam was reluctant to fight because he was outgunned, but saw his chance after the troops wasted their ammunition. The Forbes bowmen or archers fled, Bannatyne wrote they \"gave backis, and did no guid.\"<ref>Bannatyne, Richard, ''Memorials of the Transactions in Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1836), pp. 212-3.</ref>\n\nGordon's kinsman, [[Alexander Gordon (bishop of Galloway)]] wrote from Edinburgh on 16 November 1571 with new of the battle at Tullieangus to [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]], who was the keeper of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. He intended to promote the Marian cause in England, writing \"there was slain the principals of the gentlemen of the Forbes the number of 36, with my Lord Forbes's brother, one hundred taken, whereof my Lord Forbes' second son is one, and the rest brothers of Baronies and substantial gentlemen\".<ref>[[Edmund Lodge]], ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 2 (London, 1791), pp. 62-63.</ref>\n\nA chronicle written by an Aberdeen man, Walter Cullen, records the casualties at 'Craibstayne' as about 60, three score, on each side (unless this a copyist's error for three hundred), and mentions the death of 'Guid' Duncan Forbes.<ref>'Walter Cullen's Chronicle of Aberdeen,' in Stuart, John, ed., ''Miscellany of the Spalding Club, vol. 2 (Aberdeen, 1842), p. 38.</ref> The chronicle ''History of King James of Sext'' described Adam's vigilance in Aberdeen as like a \"valiant chiftayne, having alwayis his men in reddienes,\" and adds there were 600 cavalrymen against him. The fleeing Forbes were pursued for four miles. According to the ''History of James Sext'' (which has a bias against the Regents of Scotland), there were 300 Forbes casualties against thirty Gordons. Adam's victories against the Forbes were marred by the \"infamy\" of the burning of the Lady Towie.<ref>Thomson, Thomas, ed., ''The historie and life of King James the Sext: being an account of the affairs of Scotland from the year 1566 to the year 1596'' (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 96-7.</ref>\n\n==Exile and death==\nAdam was included in the peace called the \"Pacification of Perth\" of 23 February 1573. He was then allowed to go to France, where he tried to rally support for Queen Mary.<ref>Huntly, Marquess of, ''The Cock o'the North'' (London, 1935), pp. 36\u201346.</ref> Then in 1574, Adam was in touch with the English diplomat in Scotland, [[Henry Killigrew (diplomat)|Henry Killigrew]], and in France, and [[Francis Walsingham]] trying to secure his reconciliation with [[Regent Morton]]. At the same time, his brother, the [[George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly|5th Earl of Huntly]], wrote to [[Elizabeth I of England]] distancing himself from Adam's activities in France. In September 1574, Morton arrested Alexander Duff, a servant of Adam Gordon who came to Scotland.\n\nIn the summer of 1575 Adam Gordon returned to Scotland and was imprisoned at [[Blackness Castle]], then in 1577 released under a bond to live in Galloway.

On February 1, 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the [[New York Central]] railroad to become [[Penn Central]], only to file for bankruptcy on June 21, 1970. Penn Central continued to operate in bankruptcy until 1976, when [[Conrail]] took over its assets along with those of several other bankrupt railroads, including the Reading Company. Conrail operated commuter services under contract to SEPTA until January 1, 1983, when SEPTA took over operations and acquired track, rolling stock, and other assets to form the [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Railroad Division]].\n\n===Subsequent expansion===\nLike New York's [[Second Avenue Subway]], the original proposal for the [[Roosevelt Boulevard Subway]] dates to 1913, but construction has remained elusive.  Instead, after completing the [[Market-Frankford Line#Original subway and expansion|Frankford Elevated]], transit service in and around the city stagnated until the early 2000s.\n\n[[File:Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) Bridge Line & Fare Tokens.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Philadelphia Transportation Company tokens (1940-68)]]On September 30, 1968, SEPTA acquired the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]] (PTC), which operated a citywide system of [[bus]], [[Tram|trolley]], and [[trackless trolley]] routes, the [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] (subway-elevated rail), the [[Broad Street Line]] (subway) and the [[PATCO Speedline|Delaware River Bridge Line]] (subway-elevated rail to City Hall, Camden, NJ) which became SEPTA's City Transit Division. The PTC had been created in 1940 with the merger of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (formed in 1902) and a group of smaller, then independent transit companies operating within the city and its environs.  \n[[File:PCC2790 Philly 1970s.jpg|thumb|The former [[SEPTA Route 6]] trolley during the early 1980s.]]\n\nOn January 30, 1970, SEPTA acquired the [[Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company]], also known as the Red Arrow Lines, which included the [[Philadelphia and Western Railroad]] (P&W) route now called the [[Norristown High Speed Line]], the [[SEPTA Surface Media and Sharon Hill Trolley Lines|Media and Sharon Hill Lines]] (Routes 101 and 102) and several suburban bus routes in Delaware County. Today, this is the [[SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes#Victory Division|Victory Division]], though it is sometimes referred to as the Red Arrow Division.\n\nOn March 1, 1976, SEPTA acquired the transit operations of Schuylkill Valley Lines, which is today the [[SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes#Frontier Division|Frontier Division]].\n\nMeanwhile, SEPTA gradually began to take over the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and [[Reading Company]] commuter trains.

This division operates 13 lines serving more than 150 stations covering most of the five-county southeastern Pennsylvania region. It also runs trains to [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] and [[Newark, Delaware]] as well as [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[West Trenton, New Jersey]]. Daily ridership averaged over 132,000 in 2016,<ref name=\"2012 report\"/> with 29% of ridership on the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line|Paoli/Thorndale]] and [[Lansdale/Doylestown Line|Lansdale/Doylestown]] lines.\n\nMost of the cars used on the lines were built between 1963 and 1976. After building delays, the first [[Silverliner V]] cars were introduced into service on October 29, 2010. These cars represent the first new electric multiple units purchased for the Regional Rail system since the completion of the Silverliner IV order in 1976 and the first such purchase to be made by SEPTA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/media/releases/2010/10-29.html |title=Silverliner V Train Makes Debut |publisher=SEPTA.org |date= |accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref> As of March 19, 2013, all Silverliner V cars are in service and make up almost one-third of the current 400 car Regional Rail fleet, which are replacing the older, aging fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/service/rail/silverliner.html |title=Silverliner V Service Schedule |publisher=SEPTA.org |date= |accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref> At the start of July 2016, however, a serious structural flaw (cracks in a weight-bearing beam on a train car's undercarriage) was discovered during an emergency inspection to exist in more than 95% of the 120 Silverliner V cars in the SEPTA regional rail fleet which the company announced would take \"the rest of the summer\" to repair and would thus would reduce the system's capacity by as much as 50%.

These divisions reflect the different transit and railroad operations that SEPTA has assumed. SEPTA also offers CCT Connect [[paratransit]] \u238cservice.\n\n=== City Transit Division ===\n{{Main|SEPTA City Transit Division surface routes}}\n[[File:4500 Baltimore Avenue.jpg|thumb|SEPTA's [[SEPTA Route 34|Route 34]] trolley in the 4500 block of [[Baltimore Avenue]]|alt=A white single-car trolley in street running. On street parking combined with double track on a two-lane street leaves limited room for automobile maneuverability.]]\n\nThe City Transit Division operates routes mostly within the City of Philadelphia, including buses, [[SEPTA Subway\u2013Surface Trolley Lines|subway\u2013surface trolleys]], surface Trolley Lines, the [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] and the [[Broad Street Line]]. [[SEPTA City Transit Division surface routes]] include bus and trackless trolley lines. Some city division routes extend into Delaware, Montgomery and Bucks counties. This division is the descendant of the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]]. There are eight operating depots in this division: five of these depots only operate buses, one is a mixed bus/trackless trolley depot, one is a mixed bus/streetcar depot and one is a streetcar-only facility.\n\n===Suburban Division===\n{{Main|SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes}}\n\n====Victory District====\n[[File:SEPTA N-5.jpg|thumb|right|Norristown High Speed Line at Gulph Mills Station]]\nThe Victory District operates suburban [[SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes|bus]] and trolley (or light rail) routes that are based at [[69th Street Transportation Center]] in [[Upper Darby]] in Delaware County. Its light rail routes comprise the [[Norristown High Speed Line]] (Route 100) that runs from 69th Street Transportation Center to [[Norristown Transportation Center]] and the [[SEPTA Surface Media and Sharon Hill Trolley Lines]] (Routes 101 and 102). This district is the descendant of the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, also known as the Red Arrow Lines. Some residents of the Victory District operating area still refer to this district as the \"Red Arrow Division.\"\n\n====Frontier District====\n\nThe Frontier District operates suburban bus routes that are based at the [[Norristown Transportation Center]] in Montgomery County and bus lines that serve eastern Bucks County. This district is the descendant of the Schuylkill Valley Lines in the Norristown area and the Trenton-Philadelphia Coach Lines in eastern Bucks County. SEPTA took over Schuylkill Valley Lines operations on March 1, 1976. SEPTA turned over the Bucks County routes (formerly Trenton-Philadelphia Coach Line Routes, a subsidiary of SEPTA) to Frontier Division in November 1983.\n\n====Suburban contract operations====\n\n[[Krapf Group|Krapf Transit]] operates one bus line under contract to SEPTA in Chester County: Route 204 between Paoli Regional Rail Station and Eagleville. This route is operated from Krapf's own garage, located in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]]. Krapf has operated three other bus routes for SEPTA in the past. Route 202 (West Chester to Wilmington), Route 207 (The Whiteland WHIRL) and Route 208 (Strafford Train Station to Chesterbrook) are no longer operating. SEPTA contracted bus operations before in Chester County. SEPTA and Reeder's Inc. joined forces in 1977 to operate three bus routes out of West Chester. These routes were the Route 120 (West Chester to Coatesville), Route 121 (West Chester to Paoli) and Route 122 (West Chester to Oxford). Bus service between West Chester and Coatesville was a replacement for the previous trolley service operated by West Chester Traction. SEPTA did replace two of the routes with their own bus service. Route 122 service was replaced by SEPTA's Route 91 on July 6, 1982, after only one year of service, Route 91 was eliminated due to lack of ridership. Route 121 was replaced by SEPTA's Route 92 on October 11, 1982, and this service continues to operate today. Since ridership on the Route 120 was strong it continued to operate under the operations of Reeder's Inc. even after SEPTA pulled the funding source. Krapf purchased the Reeder's operation in 1992 and designated the remaining (West Chester to Coatesville) bus route as Krapf Transit \"Route A\". Route 205 (Paoli Station to Chesterbrook) was formerly operated by Krapf until late 2019 when it was merged into SEPTA's own Route 206 (Paoli Station to Great Valley).\n\n{{anchor|Regional_Rail_division}}\n\n===Railroad Division===\n{{Main|SEPTA Regional Rail}}\n[[File:SEPTA GE Silverliner IV 308.jpg|thumb|right|SEPTA Regional Rail train at Fern Rock Transportation Center]]\nThe Railroad Division<ref>[http://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?objectId=0900006480e7263a&disposition=attachment&contentType=pdf 2008 SEPTA Railroad Division employee timetable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209002149/http://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?objectId=0900006480e7263a&disposition=attachment&contentType=pdf |date=December 9, 2011}} Accessed August 16, 2011</ref> operates 13 commuter railroad routes that begin in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Central Philadelphia]] and radiate outwards, terminating in intra-city, suburban and out-of-state locations.\n\nThis division is the descendant of the six electrified commuter lines of the [[Reading Company]] (RDG), the six electrified commuter lines of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR, later [[Penn Central]]: PC) and the new Airport line constructed by the City of [[Philadelphia]] between 1974 and 1984.\n\nWith the construction and opening of the [[Center City Commuter Connection]] Tunnel in 1984, lines were paired such that a former Pennsylvania Railroad line was coupled with a former Reading line. Seven such pairings were created and given route designations numbered R1 through R8 (with R4 not used). As a result, the routes were originally designed so that trains would proceed from one outlying terminal to Center City, stopping at [[30th Street Station]], [[Suburban Station]] and {{station link|SEPTA|Jefferson}} (formerly Market East Station), then proceed out to the other outlying terminal assigned to the route. Since ridership patterns have changed since the implementation of this plan, SEPTA removed the R-numbers from the lines in July 2010 and instead refers to the lines by the names of their termini.\n\nThe out-of-state terminals offer connections with other transit agencies. The Trenton Line offers connections in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] to [[New Jersey Transit|NJ Transit (NJT)]] or [[Amtrak]] for travel to [[New York City]]. Plans exist to restore NJT service to [[West Trenton, New Jersey]], thus offering a future alternate to New York via the West Trenton Line and NJT. Another plan offers a connection for travel to [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] via [[MARC Train|MARC]], involving extensions of the SEPTA Wilmington/Newark Line from [[Newark, Delaware]], an extension of MARC's Penn service from [[Perryville, Maryland]], or both.\n\n===CCT Connect===\n[[File:SEPTA CCT Connect bus 6248 in Hatboro PA.jpeg|thumb|right|SEPTA CCT Connect paratransit bus]]\nCCT Connect is a [[paratransit]] service from SEPTA that offers a Shared-Ride Program for senior citizens and ADA Paratransit Service for people with disabilities.<ref name=cct>{{cite web|title=CCT Connect|publisher=SEPTA|url=http://www.septa.org/service/cct/|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref> The Shared-Ride Program provides a door-to-door ridesharing service through advance reservations for senior citizens age 65 or older in the city of Philadelphia for travel within the city and to points within {{convert|3|mi|km}} of the city's borders.<ref name=cct/><ref>{{cite web|title=CCT Connect - Senior Shared-Ride Program|publisher=SEPTA|url=http://www.septa.org/service/cct/pdf/SRP-Brochure-rev-113015.pdf|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref> The ADA Paratransit Service provides door-to-door service through advance reservations for people with disabilities in accordance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA), allowing for travel across the SEPTA service area within  \n{{convert|3/4|mi|km}} of fixed-route transit service when such service operates.<ref name=cct/><ref>{{cite web|title=CCT Connect - ADA Paratransit Program|publisher=SEPTA|url=http://www.septa.org/service/cct/pdf/ADA-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref> CCT Connect is operated by third-party contractors for SEPTA.

These buses were used throughout the SEPTA service area. SEPTA changed its specifications on new bus orders each year. The Neoplan AK's (numbered 8285\u20138410), which was SEPTA's first Neoplan order, had longitudinal seating: all of the seats face towards the aisle. However, their suburban counterparts (8411\u20138434) had longitudinal seating only in the rear of the bus. The back door has a wheelchair ramp, which forced SEPTA officials to limit its use and specify [[wheelchair lift]]s in their next order. These buses had a nine-liter [[Detroit Diesel Series 92|6v92 engine]] and [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] HT-747 transmission.\n\nIn 1983, SEPTA, along with other transit operators in Pennsylvania, ordered 1,000 Neoplan buses of various lengths. SEPTA ultimately received 450 buses from this order: 425 were {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} buses (BD 8435\u20138584 and CD 8601\u20138875), which came without wheelchair lifts, and 25 {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} buses (BP 1301\u20131325).\n\nSEPTA purchased additional Neoplans in 1986. The first two groups (3000\u20133131 and 3132\u20133251) came without rear wheelchair lifts; the last two groups, one in late 1987 (3252\u20133371) and another in 1989 (3372\u20133491), included them. All Neoplans built between 1986 and 1989 were equipped with a ZF [[ZF Ecomat|4HP-590 transmission]].\n\nBy the early 1990s, SEPTA had 1,092 [[Neoplan AN440]] coaches in active service, making it the largest transit in North American with a fleet primarily manufactured by Neoplan USA. These buses dominated the streets of Philadelphia through late 1997, when the earlier fleet of AK and BD Neoplans (8285\u20138581) was replaced by 400 buses built by [[North American Bus Industries|American Ikarus]] and \u2013 the same company after a 1996 reorganization \u2013 [[North American Bus Industries]]. The older GMC RTS 35- and 40-foot buses were also replaced in this order, with the sole remaining exception of No. 4462, a 35-foot coach. More replacements occurred when SEPTA received its first [[low-floor bus|low-floor]] fleet and retired the last An440 buses on June 20, 2008.\n[[File:SEPTA Nova Bus.jpg|thumb|A SEPTA Nova Bus]]\nThe Neoplan model has not entirely vanished from Philadelphia's streets; in 1998, SEPTA ordered 155 [[articulated bus]]es from the company. These buses replaced the 1984 Volvo 10BM 60-foot articulated buses. These buses are now retired since late 2015, replaced by the 2013\u20132016 NovaBus LFS-A HEV.\n\nThe 1998 purchase also included 80 29-foot Transmark-29 buses from [[ElDorado National|National-Eldorado]] (4501\u20134580), the first of which began to arrive in late 2000. Most of these buses are on suburban routes, but some are in the \"LUCY\" service in the University City section of West Philadelphia, in a special paint scheme, and others on lighter lines within Philadelphia. SEPTA had decided to buy from Metrotrans Legacy, SEPTA's first choice in small buses, but the company filed for bankruptcy in 1999.\n\nA fleet of buses known as \"cutaways\" were also purchased. These buses were built on Ford van chassis, with bodies similar to those seen on car rental shuttles at various airports. These buses were retired around 2003 and replaced with slightly larger [[cutaway bus]]es on a Freightliner truck chassis.\n\nAfter evaluating sample buses from [[New Flyer]] and [[NovaBus]] in 1994\u201396, SEPTA ordered 100 low-floor buses (nos. 5401\u20135500) from New Flyer in 2001.\n\n[[Trolleybus|Trackless trolley (trolley bus)]] service was suspended in 2003 and the 110 [[AM General]] vehicles that had provided service on SEPTA's five trackless trolley routes never returned to service.<ref name=\"tm270\">{{cite journal |title=Trolleynews |date=November\u2013December 2006 |journal=Trolleybus Magazine |issue=270 |page=144}}</ref> However, in early 2006 SEPTA ordered 38 new low-floor trackless trolleys from New Flyer, which entered service in 2008, restoring trackless service on routes 59, 66 and 75.

Before the 2008 purchase, SEPTA borrowed an MTA New York City Transit Orion VII hybrid bus # 6365 to evaluate it in service. SEPTA was the first to purchase New Flyer DE40LFs equipped with rooftop HVAC units. Currently, SEPTA is delivering 525 2017-2022 NFI XDE40 hybrid buses to replaced all the diesel buses that were delivered between 2001-2004. Additionally.

These cars, known as B-IV as they are the fourth generation used on the line, are stainless steel and include some cars with operating cabs at both ends, as well as some with only a single cab.\n\nThe [[Market-Frankford Line]] uses a class of car known as M-4, as they, like the Broad Street B-IV's, represent the line's fourth generation of cars and were built from 1997 to 1999 by [[Adtranz]]. These cars are built to the unusual [[broad gauge]] of {{RailGauge|5ft2.25in}}{{discuss|section=Track gauge}}, known as \"[[Pennsylvania trolley gauge]]\".\n\n===Trolley===\n[[File:SEPTA LRVs at the maintenance facility, 1993.jpg|thumb|Single-end Kawasaki [[Tram|trolleys]] waiting in the yard in 1993|alt=Three abreast white trolleys with a red stripe around the vehicle ends.]]\n[[File:SEPTA PCC -2168.png|thumb|One of the PCC streetcars built in 1947 by the [[St. Louis Car Co.]] for PTC, running in 2019 at the [[Baltimore Streetcar Museum]]]]\nThe vehicles used on SEPTA's [[SEPTA Subway-Surface Trolley Lines|Subway-Surface trolleys]] were built by Kawasaki in 1981. Known as \"K-cars\", they use the Pennsylvania trolley gauge of {{RailGauge|5ft2.25in}}.\n\nUniquely, the [[Girard Street Line]] uses \"[[PCC streetcar|PCC]] II\" trolleys, originally built in 1947 by the [[St. Louis Car Company]], which were rebuilt for the line's reopening in 2003 to include air conditioning. The line, like the Subway-Surface lines, is Pennsylvania trolley gauge.\n\nThe [[SEPTA Routes 101 and 102|suburban trolley lines]] use Kawasaki-built vehicles similar to, but larger than, the Subway-Surface trolleys. They use a slightly wider Pennsylvania trolley gauge, 5' 2-1/2\". Notably, they are double ended, unlike the Subway-Surface trolleys, as the suburban lines lack any loops to turn the vehicles on their suburban-bound termini.\n\n===Interurban===\nThe [[Norristown High Speed Line]] uses a class of cars known as N-5s. They were delivered in 1993 by [[ABB Group|ABB]] after significant production delays. These cars are unique in that they are powered by a third rail and are [[standard gauge]].\n\n===Regional Rail===\n{{Further|SEPTA Regional Rail#Rolling stock}}\n[[File:SEPTA Silverliner V 834 inbound approaching Hatboro Station.jpg|thumb|SEPTA [[Silverliner V]] approaching [[Hatboro station]]]]\nSEPTA uses a mixed fleet of [[GE Transportation|General Electric]] and [[Hyundai Rotem]] \"Silverliner\" [[electric multiple unit]] self-operated cars.

At the [[8th Street station (Philadelphia)|8th Street station]], one can transfer to the [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] and [[Broad\u2013Ridge Spur]] with an additional transfer fare. Paid transfers are also available at PATCO's [[12\u201313th & Locust station|12th\u201313th Street station]] and [[15\u201316th & Locust station|15th\u201316th Street station]] with SEPTA's Broad Street Line [[Walnut\u2013Locust station]]. The PATCO Speedline crosses over the [[Delaware River]] via the [[Ben Franklin Bridge]]. It is owned by the [[Delaware River Port Authority]].\n\nIn the western Philadelphia suburbs, [[Krapf's]] Transit runs regularly scheduled buses for the [[TMACC]] between [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania|Coatesville]], [[Downingtown]], [[Exton, Pennsylvania|Exton]] and [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]]. SEPTA Routes 92 and 104 connect with this service in West Chester, and route 92 also connects with this service at the Exton Square Mall.  Krapf's also provide contract services to SEPTA on route 204. They also operate a free express shuttle bus from Center City to the Navy Yard in South Philadelphia as well as a free shuttle bus loop within the Navy Yard itself.\n\nIn [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]], the [[Greater Valley Forge Transportation Management Association]] runs a community shuttle, the Rambler, which connects with SEPTA at the [[King of Prussia Transit Center]].\n\nIn the northwestern Philadelphia suburbs, [[Pottstown Area Rapid Transit]] (PART, formerly known as Pottstown Urban Transit) operates five bus routes within [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania|Pottstown Borough]] and the neighboring townships of Douglass, Limerick, Lower Pottsgrove, Upper Pottsgrove, and West Pottsgrove in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] and North Coventry Township in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]].  PART and SEPTA have an agreement allowing transfers between PART service and SEPTA Route 93 buses in Pottstown.\n\n===Regional services===\n\n[[New Jersey Transit|NJ Transit]] runs buses from Philadelphia to New Jersey points. Many NJT buses stop at the [[Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal]], which is immediately north of [[Jefferson Station (Philadelphia)|Jefferson Station]] or at other locations in [[Center City Philadelphia]]. NJT also operates the [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] light rail line between [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] and [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], the [[Northeast Corridor Line]] between Trenton and New York, and the [[Atlantic City Line]] between 30th Street Station and [[Atlantic City]]. Both the Northeast Corridor Line and River Line connect with SEPTA's Regional Rail [[Trenton Line (SEPTA)|Trenton Line]] at the [[Trenton Transit Center]]. SEPTA Route 127 connects with NJT bus and rail services here also.\n\n[[DART First State]] provides bus service in Delaware. This service connects with SEPTA's [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] Regional Rail service in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] and [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]]. In 2007, SEPTA bus Route 306 began service, connecting the Great Valley Corporate Center and West Chester with the Brandywine Town Center; service between West Chester and Brandywine Town Center was discontinued in 2010 due to low ridership. In February 2009, SEPTA bus Route 113 commenced connecting bus service with DART at the Tri-State Mall, allowing service between Delaware County and the State of Delaware, and connecting with DART First State's #1 (now #13) and #61 bus at the Tri-State Mall.\n\n===National and international services===\n\n[[Amtrak]] provides rail service between [[30th Street Station]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Chicago]] to the west, [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] to the southwest, and [[New York, New York|New York]], [[Boston]], and [[Montreal]] to the northeast. Amtrak's service overlaps to some degree with the [[Wilmington/Newark Line]], [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] and [[Trenton Line (SEPTA)|Trenton Line]]. All Regional Rail routes stop at 30th Street Station. Other shared Amtrak/Regional Rail stations include {{station link|SEPTA|Wilmington}} and {{station link|SEPTA|Newark}} on the Wilmington/Newark Line, {{station link|SEPTA|Ardmore}}, {{station link|SEPTA|Paoli}}, {{station link|SEPTA|Exton}}, and {{station link|SEPTA|Downingtown}} on the Paoli/Thorndale Line, and Trenton on the Trenton Line. Amtrak also offers limited service from {{station link|SEPTA|North Philadelphia}} and {{station link|SEPTA|Cornwells Heights}}, which are also on Trenton Line. Amtrak is faster than SEPTA, but significantly more expensive, particularly for services along the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\n[[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and a variety of interregional bus operators, most of which are part of the [[Trailways]] system, stop at the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal.

The award was criticized by ''[[Next City]]'' columnist Diana Lind, stating that despite some outward appearances of improvement, SEPTA still largely operates under a cloud of non-transparency and continues to lack a system-wide expansion program for the  future. This is most notable in the regional rail division, which suffered severe cutbacks in the 1980s and whose affected routes have been converted into rail trails, preventing a restoration of those services for the foreseeable future. When asked to produce data pertaining to SEPTA's repeated attempts to consolidate bus stops, Lind observed \"the report on the project barely elaborates on the information.

On February 1, 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the [[New York Central]] railroad to become [[Penn Central]], only to file for bankruptcy on June 21, 1970. Penn Central continued to operate in bankruptcy until 1976, when [[Conrail]] took over its assets along with those of several other bankrupt railroads, including the Reading Company. Conrail operated commuter services under contract to SEPTA until January 1, 1983, when SEPTA took over operations and acquired track, rolling stock, and other assets to form the [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Railroad Division]].\n\n===Subsequent expansion===\nLike New York's [[Second Avenue Subway]], the original proposal for the [[Roosevelt Boulevard Subway]] dates to 1913, but construction has remained elusive.  Instead, after completing the [[Market-Frankford Line#Original subway and expansion|Frankford Elevated]], transit service in and around the city stagnated until the early 2000s.\n\n[[File:Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) Bridge Line & Fare Tokens.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Philadelphia Transportation Company tokens (1940-68)]]On September 30, 1968, SEPTA acquired the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]] (PTC), which operated a citywide system of [[bus]], [[Tram|trolley]], and [[trackless trolley]] routes, the [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] (subway-elevated rail), the [[Broad Street Line]] (subway) and the [[PATCO Speedline|Delaware River Bridge Line]] (subway-elevated rail to City Hall, Camden, NJ) which became SEPTA's City Transit Division. The PTC had been created in 1940 with the merger of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (formed in 1902) and a group of smaller, then independent transit companies operating within the city and its environs.  \n[[File:PCC2790 Philly 1970s.jpg|thumb|The former [[SEPTA Route 6]] trolley during the early 1980s.]]\n\nOn January 30, 1970, SEPTA acquired the [[Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company]], also known as the Red Arrow Lines, which included the [[Philadelphia and Western Railroad]] (P&W) route now called the [[Norristown High Speed Line]], the [[SEPTA Surface Media and Sharon Hill Trolley Lines|Media and Sharon Hill Lines]] (Routes 101 and 102) and several suburban bus routes in Delaware County. Today, this is the [[SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes#Victory Division|Victory Division]], though it is sometimes referred to as the Red Arrow Division.\n\nOn March 1, 1976, SEPTA acquired the transit operations of Schuylkill Valley Lines, which is today the [[SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes#Frontier Division|Frontier Division]].\n\nMeanwhile, SEPTA gradually began to take over the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and [[Reading Company]] commuter trains.

This division operates 13 lines serving more than 150 stations covering most of the five-county southeastern Pennsylvania region. It also runs trains to [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] and [[Newark, Delaware]] as well as [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[West Trenton, New Jersey]]. Daily ridership averaged over 132,000 in 2016,<ref name=\"2012 report\"/> with 29% of ridership on the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line|Paoli/Thorndale]] and [[Lansdale/Doylestown Line|Lansdale/Doylestown]] lines.\n\nMost of the cars used on the lines were built between 1963 and 1976. After building delays, the first [[Silverliner V]] cars were introduced into service on October 29, 2010. These cars represent the first new electric multiple units purchased for the Regional Rail system since the completion of the Silverliner IV order in 1976 and the first such purchase to be made by SEPTA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/media/releases/2010/10-29.html |title=Silverliner V Train Makes Debut |publisher=SEPTA.org |date= |accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref> As of March 19, 2013, all Silverliner V cars are in service and make up almost one-third of the current 400 car Regional Rail fleet, which are replacing the older, aging fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/service/rail/silverliner.html |title=Silverliner V Service Schedule |publisher=SEPTA.org |date= |accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref> At the start of July 2016, however, a serious structural flaw (cracks in a weight-bearing beam on a train car's undercarriage) was discovered during an emergency inspection to exist in more than 95% of the 120 Silverliner V cars in the SEPTA regional rail fleet which the company announced would take \"the rest of the summer\" to repair and would thus would reduce the system's capacity by as much as 50%.

These divisions reflect the different transit and railroad operations that SEPTA has assumed. SEPTA also offers CCT Connect [[paratransit]] \u238cservice.\n\n=== City Transit Division ===\n{{Main|SEPTA City Transit Division surface routes}}\n[[File:4500 Baltimore Avenue.jpg|thumb|SEPTA's [[SEPTA Route 34|Route 34]] trolley in the 4500 block of [[Baltimore Avenue]]|alt=A white single-car trolley in street running. On street parking combined with double track on a two-lane street leaves limited room for automobile maneuverability.]]\n\nThe City Transit Division operates routes mostly within the City of Philadelphia, including buses, [[SEPTA Subway\u2013Surface Trolley Lines|subway\u2013surface trolleys]], surface Trolley Lines, the [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] and the [[Broad Street Line]]. [[SEPTA City Transit Division surface routes]] include bus and trackless trolley lines. Some city division routes extend into Delaware, Montgomery and Bucks counties. This division is the descendant of the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]]. There are eight operating depots in this division: five of these depots only operate buses, one is a mixed bus/trackless trolley depot, one is a mixed bus/streetcar depot and one is a streetcar-only facility.\n\n===Suburban Division===\n{{Main|SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes}}\n\n====Victory District====\n[[File:SEPTA N-5.jpg|thumb|right|Norristown High Speed Line at Gulph Mills Station]]\nThe Victory District operates suburban [[SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes|bus]] and trolley (or light rail) routes that are based at [[69th Street Transportation Center]] in [[Upper Darby]] in Delaware County. Its light rail routes comprise the [[Norristown High Speed Line]] (Route 100) that runs from 69th Street Transportation Center to [[Norristown Transportation Center]] and the [[SEPTA Surface Media and Sharon Hill Trolley Lines]] (Routes 101 and 102). This district is the descendant of the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, also known as the Red Arrow Lines. Some residents of the Victory District operating area still refer to this district as the \"Red Arrow Division.\"\n\n====Frontier District====\n\nThe Frontier District operates suburban bus routes that are based at the [[Norristown Transportation Center]] in Montgomery County and bus lines that serve eastern Bucks County. This district is the descendant of the Schuylkill Valley Lines in the Norristown area and the Trenton-Philadelphia Coach Lines in eastern Bucks County. SEPTA took over Schuylkill Valley Lines operations on March 1, 1976. SEPTA turned over the Bucks County routes (formerly Trenton-Philadelphia Coach Line Routes, a subsidiary of SEPTA) to Frontier Division in November 1983.\n\n====Suburban contract operations====\n\n[[Krapf Group|Krapf Transit]] operates one bus line under contract to SEPTA in Chester County: Route 204 between Paoli Regional Rail Station and Eagleville. This route is operated from Krapf's own garage, located in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]]. Krapf has operated three other bus routes for SEPTA in the past. Route 202 (West Chester to Wilmington), Route 207 (The Whiteland WHIRL) and Route 208 (Strafford Train Station to Chesterbrook) are no longer operating. SEPTA contracted bus operations before in Chester County. SEPTA and Reeder's Inc. joined forces in 1977 to operate three bus routes out of West Chester. These routes were the Route 120 (West Chester to Coatesville), Route 121 (West Chester to Paoli) and Route 122 (West Chester to Oxford). Bus service between West Chester and Coatesville was a replacement for the previous trolley service operated by West Chester Traction. SEPTA did replace two of the routes with their own bus service. Route 122 service was replaced by SEPTA's Route 91 on July 6, 1982, after only one year of service, Route 91 was eliminated due to lack of ridership. Route 121 was replaced by SEPTA's Route 92 on October 11, 1982, and this service continues to operate today. Since ridership on the Route 120 was strong it continued to operate under the operations of Reeder's Inc. even after SEPTA pulled the funding source. Krapf purchased the Reeder's operation in 1992 and designated the remaining (West Chester to Coatesville) bus route as Krapf Transit \"Route A\". Route 205 (Paoli Station to Chesterbrook) was formerly operated by Krapf until late 2019 when it was merged into SEPTA's own Route 206 (Paoli Station to Great Valley).\n\n{{anchor|Regional_Rail_division}}\n\n===Railroad Division===\n{{Main|SEPTA Regional Rail}}\n[[File:SEPTA GE Silverliner IV 308.jpg|thumb|right|SEPTA Regional Rail train at Fern Rock Transportation Center]]\nThe Railroad Division<ref>[http://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?objectId=0900006480e7263a&disposition=attachment&contentType=pdf 2008 SEPTA Railroad Division employee timetable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209002149/http://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?objectId=0900006480e7263a&disposition=attachment&contentType=pdf |date=December 9, 2011}} Accessed August 16, 2011</ref> operates 13 commuter railroad routes that begin in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Central Philadelphia]] and radiate outwards, terminating in intra-city, suburban and out-of-state locations.\n\nThis division is the descendant of the six electrified commuter lines of the [[Reading Company]] (RDG), the six electrified commuter lines of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR, later [[Penn Central]]: PC) and the new Airport line constructed by the City of [[Philadelphia]] between 1974 and 1984.\n\nWith the construction and opening of the [[Center City Commuter Connection]] Tunnel in 1984, lines were paired such that a former Pennsylvania Railroad line was coupled with a former Reading line. Seven such pairings were created and given route designations numbered R1 through R8 (with R4 not used). As a result, the routes were originally designed so that trains would proceed from one outlying terminal to Center City, stopping at [[30th Street Station]], [[Suburban Station]] and {{station link|SEPTA|Jefferson}} (formerly Market East Station), then proceed out to the other outlying terminal assigned to the route. Since ridership patterns have changed since the implementation of this plan, SEPTA removed the R-numbers from the lines in July 2010 and instead refers to the lines by the names of their termini.\n\nThe out-of-state terminals offer connections with other transit agencies. The Trenton Line offers connections in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] to [[New Jersey Transit|NJ Transit (NJT)]] or [[Amtrak]] for travel to [[New York City]]. Plans exist to restore NJT service to [[West Trenton, New Jersey]], thus offering a future alternate to New York via the West Trenton Line and NJT. Another plan offers a connection for travel to [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] via [[MARC Train|MARC]], involving extensions of the SEPTA Wilmington/Newark Line from [[Newark, Delaware]], an extension of MARC's Penn service from [[Perryville, Maryland]], or both.\n\n===CCT Connect===\n[[File:SEPTA CCT Connect bus 6248 in Hatboro PA.jpeg|thumb|right|SEPTA CCT Connect paratransit bus]]\nCCT Connect is a [[paratransit]] service from SEPTA that offers a Shared-Ride Program for senior citizens and ADA Paratransit Service for people with disabilities.<ref name=cct>{{cite web|title=CCT Connect|publisher=SEPTA|url=http://www.septa.org/service/cct/|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref> The Shared-Ride Program provides a door-to-door ridesharing service through advance reservations for senior citizens age 65 or older in the city of Philadelphia for travel within the city and to points within {{convert|3|mi|km}} of the city's borders.<ref name=cct/><ref>{{cite web|title=CCT Connect - Senior Shared-Ride Program|publisher=SEPTA|url=http://www.septa.org/service/cct/pdf/SRP-Brochure-rev-113015.pdf|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref> The ADA Paratransit Service provides door-to-door service through advance reservations for people with disabilities in accordance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA), allowing for travel across the SEPTA service area within  \n{{convert|3/4|mi|km}} of fixed-route transit service when such service operates.<ref name=cct/><ref>{{cite web|title=CCT Connect - ADA Paratransit Program|publisher=SEPTA|url=http://www.septa.org/service/cct/pdf/ADA-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref> CCT Connect is operated by third-party contractors for SEPTA.

The Neoplan AK's (numbered 8285\u20138410), which was SEPTA's first Neoplan order, had longitudinal seating: all of the seats face towards the aisle. However, their suburban counterparts (8411\u20138434) had longitudinal seating only in the rear of the bus. The back door has a wheelchair ramp, which forced SEPTA officials to limit its use and specify [[wheelchair lift]]s in their next order. These buses had a nine-liter [[Detroit Diesel Series 92|6v92 engine]] and [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] HT-747 transmission.\n\nIn 1983, SEPTA, along with other transit operators in Pennsylvania, ordered 1,000 Neoplan buses of various lengths. SEPTA ultimately received 450 buses from this order: 425 were {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} buses (BD 8435\u20138584 and CD 8601\u20138875), which came without wheelchair lifts, and 25 {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} buses (BP 1301\u20131325).\n\nSEPTA purchased additional Neoplans in 1986. The first two groups (3000\u20133131 and 3132\u20133251) came without rear wheelchair lifts; the last two groups, one in late 1987 (3252\u20133371) and another in 1989 (3372\u20133491), included them. All Neoplans built between 1986 and 1989 were equipped with a ZF [[ZF Ecomat|4HP-590 transmission]].\n\nBy the early 1990s, SEPTA had 1,092 [[Neoplan AN440]] coaches in active service, making it the largest transit in North American with a fleet primarily manufactured by Neoplan USA. These buses dominated the streets of Philadelphia through late 1997, when the earlier fleet of AK and BD Neoplans (8285\u20138581) was replaced by 400 buses built by [[North American Bus Industries|American Ikarus]] and \u2013 the same company after a 1996 reorganization \u2013 [[North American Bus Industries]]. The older GMC RTS 35- and 40-foot buses were also replaced in this order, with the sole remaining exception of No. 4462, a 35-foot coach. More replacements occurred when SEPTA received its first [[low-floor bus|low-floor]] fleet and retired the last An440 buses on June 20, 2008.\n[[File:SEPTA Nova Bus.jpg|thumb|A SEPTA Nova Bus]]\nThe Neoplan model has not entirely vanished from Philadelphia's streets; in 1998, SEPTA ordered 155 [[articulated bus]]es from the company. These buses replaced the 1984 Volvo 10BM 60-foot articulated buses. These buses are now retired since late 2015, replaced by the 2013\u20132016 NovaBus LFS-A HEV.\n\nThe 1998 purchase also included 80 29-foot Transmark-29 buses from [[ElDorado National|National-Eldorado]] (4501\u20134580), the first of which began to arrive in late 2000. Most of these buses are on suburban routes, but some are in the \"LUCY\" service in the University City section of West Philadelphia, in a special paint scheme, and others on lighter lines within Philadelphia. SEPTA had decided to buy from Metrotrans Legacy, SEPTA's first choice in small buses, but the company filed for bankruptcy in 1999.\n\nA fleet of buses known as \"cutaways\" were also purchased. These buses were built on Ford van chassis, with bodies similar to those seen on car rental shuttles at various airports. These buses were retired around 2003 and replaced with slightly larger [[cutaway bus]]es on a Freightliner truck chassis.\n\nAfter evaluating sample buses from [[New Flyer]] and [[NovaBus]] in 1994\u201396, SEPTA ordered 100 low-floor buses (nos. 5401\u20135500) from New Flyer in 2001.\n\n[[Trolleybus|Trackless trolley (trolley bus)]] service was suspended in 2003 and the 110 [[AM General]] vehicles that had provided service on SEPTA's five trackless trolley routes never returned to service.<ref name=\"tm270\">{{cite journal |title=Trolleynews |date=November\u2013December 2006 |journal=Trolleybus Magazine |issue=270 |page=144}}</ref> However, in early 2006 SEPTA ordered 38 new low-floor trackless trolleys from New Flyer, which entered service in 2008, restoring trackless service on routes 59, 66 and 75.

Before the 2008 purchase, SEPTA borrowed an MTA New York City Transit Orion VII hybrid bus # 6365 to evaluate it in service. SEPTA was the first to purchase New Flyer DE40LFs equipped with rooftop HVAC units. Currently, SEPTA is delivering 525 2017-2022 NFI XDE40 hybrid buses to replaced all the diesel buses that were delivered between 2001-2004. Additionally.

These cars, known as B-IV as they are the fourth generation used on the line, are stainless steel and include some cars with operating cabs at both ends, as well as some with only a single cab.\n\nThe [[Market-Frankford Line]] uses a class of car known as M-4, as they, like the Broad Street B-IV's, represent the line's fourth generation of cars and were built from 1997 to 1999 by [[Adtranz]]. These cars are built to the unusual [[broad gauge]] of {{RailGauge|5ft2.25in}}{{discuss|section=Track gauge}}, known as \"[[Pennsylvania trolley gauge]]\".\n\n===Trolley===\n[[File:SEPTA LRVs at the maintenance facility, 1993.jpg|thumb|Single-end Kawasaki [[Tram|trolleys]] waiting in the yard in 1993|alt=Three abreast white trolleys with a red stripe around the vehicle ends.]]\n[[File:SEPTA PCC -2168.png|thumb|One of the PCC streetcars built in 1947 by the [[St. Louis Car Co.]] for PTC, running in 2019 at the [[Baltimore Streetcar Museum]]]]\nThe vehicles used on SEPTA's [[SEPTA Subway-Surface Trolley Lines|Subway-Surface trolleys]] were built by Kawasaki in 1981. Known as \"K-cars\", they use the Pennsylvania trolley gauge of {{RailGauge|5ft2.25in}}.\n\nUniquely, the [[Girard Street Line]] uses \"[[PCC streetcar|PCC]] II\" trolleys, originally built in 1947 by the [[St. Louis Car Company]], which were rebuilt for the line's reopening in 2003 to include air conditioning. The line, like the Subway-Surface lines, is Pennsylvania trolley gauge.\n\nThe [[SEPTA Routes 101 and 102|suburban trolley lines]] use Kawasaki-built vehicles similar to, but larger than, the Subway-Surface trolleys. They use a slightly wider Pennsylvania trolley gauge, 5' 2-1/2\". Notably, they are double ended, unlike the Subway-Surface trolleys, as the suburban lines lack any loops to turn the vehicles on their suburban-bound termini.\n\n===Interurban===\nThe [[Norristown High Speed Line]] uses a class of cars known as N-5s. They were delivered in 1993 by [[ABB Group|ABB]] after significant production delays. These cars are unique in that they are powered by a third rail and are [[standard gauge]].\n\n===Regional Rail===\n{{Further|SEPTA Regional Rail#Rolling stock}}\n[[File:SEPTA Silverliner V 834 inbound approaching Hatboro Station.jpg|thumb|SEPTA [[Silverliner V]] approaching [[Hatboro station]]]]\nSEPTA uses a mixed fleet of [[GE Transportation|General Electric]] and [[Hyundai Rotem]] \"Silverliner\" [[electric multiple unit]] self-operated cars.

At the [[8th Street station (Philadelphia)|8th Street station]], one can transfer to the [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] and [[Broad\u2013Ridge Spur]] with an additional transfer fare. Paid transfers are also available at PATCO's [[12\u201313th & Locust station|12th\u201313th Street station]] and [[15\u201316th & Locust station|15th\u201316th Street station]] with SEPTA's Broad Street Line [[Walnut\u2013Locust station]]. The PATCO Speedline crosses over the [[Delaware River]] via the [[Ben Franklin Bridge]]. It is owned by the [[Delaware River Port Authority]].\n\nIn the western Philadelphia suburbs, [[Krapf's]] Transit runs regularly scheduled buses for the [[TMACC]] between [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania|Coatesville]], [[Downingtown]], [[Exton, Pennsylvania|Exton]] and [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]]. SEPTA Routes 92 and 104 connect with this service in West Chester, and route 92 also connects with this service at the Exton Square Mall.  Krapf's also provide contract services to SEPTA on route 204. They also operate a free express shuttle bus from Center City to the Navy Yard in South Philadelphia as well as a free shuttle bus loop within the Navy Yard itself.\n\nIn [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]], the [[Greater Valley Forge Transportation Management Association]] runs a community shuttle, the Rambler, which connects with SEPTA at the [[King of Prussia Transit Center]].\n\nIn the northwestern Philadelphia suburbs, [[Pottstown Area Rapid Transit]] (PART, formerly known as Pottstown Urban Transit) operates five bus routes within [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania|Pottstown Borough]] and the neighboring townships of Douglass, Limerick, Lower Pottsgrove, Upper Pottsgrove, and West Pottsgrove in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] and North Coventry Township in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]].  PART and SEPTA have an agreement allowing transfers between PART service and SEPTA Route 93 buses in Pottstown.\n\n===Regional services===\n\n[[New Jersey Transit|NJ Transit]] runs buses from Philadelphia to New Jersey points. Many NJT buses stop at the [[Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal]], which is immediately north of [[Jefferson Station (Philadelphia)|Jefferson Station]] or at other locations in [[Center City Philadelphia]]. NJT also operates the [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] light rail line between [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] and [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], the [[Northeast Corridor Line]] between Trenton and New York, and the [[Atlantic City Line]] between 30th Street Station and [[Atlantic City]]. Both the Northeast Corridor Line and River Line connect with SEPTA's Regional Rail [[Trenton Line (SEPTA)|Trenton Line]] at the [[Trenton Transit Center]]. SEPTA Route 127 connects with NJT bus and rail services here also.\n\n[[DART First State]] provides bus service in Delaware. This service connects with SEPTA's [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] Regional Rail service in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] and [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]]. In 2007, SEPTA bus Route 306 began service, connecting the Great Valley Corporate Center and West Chester with the Brandywine Town Center; service between West Chester and Brandywine Town Center was discontinued in 2010 due to low ridership. In February 2009, SEPTA bus Route 113 commenced connecting bus service with DART at the Tri-State Mall, allowing service between Delaware County and the State of Delaware, and connecting with DART First State's #1 (now #13) and #61 bus at the Tri-State Mall.\n\n===National and international services===\n\n[[Amtrak]] provides rail service between [[30th Street Station]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Chicago]] to the west, [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] to the southwest, and [[New York, New York|New York]], [[Boston]], and [[Montreal]] to the northeast. Amtrak's service overlaps to some degree with the [[Wilmington/Newark Line]], [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] and [[Trenton Line (SEPTA)|Trenton Line]]. All Regional Rail routes stop at 30th Street Station. Other shared Amtrak/Regional Rail stations include {{station link|SEPTA|Wilmington}} and {{station link|SEPTA|Newark}} on the Wilmington/Newark Line, {{station link|SEPTA|Ardmore}}, {{station link|SEPTA|Paoli}}, {{station link|SEPTA|Exton}}, and {{station link|SEPTA|Downingtown}} on the Paoli/Thorndale Line, and Trenton on the Trenton Line. Amtrak also offers limited service from {{station link|SEPTA|North Philadelphia}} and {{station link|SEPTA|Cornwells Heights}}, which are also on Trenton Line. Amtrak is faster than SEPTA, but significantly more expensive, particularly for services along the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\n[[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and a variety of interregional bus operators, most of which are part of the [[Trailways]] system, stop at the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal. In addition to being adjacent to [[Jefferson Station (Philadelphia)|Jefferson Station]], the terminal is one block from the Market\u2013Frankford Line's {{station link|SEPTA|11th Street}} station and various SEPTA bus routes.

In addition, six NJ Transit bus routes (313, 315, 316, 317, 318 and 551) originate and terminate from this terminal.\n\nSEPTA serves [[Philadelphia International Airport]] with local bus service and with the [[Airport Line (SEPTA)|Airport Line]] from Center City.\n\n==Criticism and recognition==\nSEPTA's 50-year history has often been a tumultuous one, a direct result of the agency being governed at the county level rather than the state one.<ref name=crisis /> ''Railpace Newsmagazine'' contributor Gerry Williams observed that SEPTA regularly staggers from crisis to crisis, with little support or oversight originating at the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol|state level]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].<ref name=crisis /> It has a long history of being at odds with the riding public and both county and state officials.<ref name=crisis /> SEPTA has suffered more labor strikes than any other transit agency in the U.S., occurring in 1977, 1981, 1983, 1986, 1995, 1998, 2005, 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.about.com/od/transportation/a/SEPTA_strikes.htm|title=SEPTA Strike History and What to Do During a SEPTA Strike|author=Meg Favreau|work=About.com Travel}}</ref> 2014,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mulvihill |first=Geoff |title=SEPTA Commuter Rail Union on Strike |journal=[[WCAU]] |publisher=NBC10.com |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |date=June 14, 2014 |url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/SEPTA-Commuter-Rail-Union-Preparing-to-Strike-263121161.html |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref> and 2016.\n\nWilliams commented that there is a notable lack of \"any group... influential enough to bring shame on SEPTA,\"<ref name=crisis>{{cite journal |last=Williams|first=Gerry |title=SEPTA Scene |journal=Railpace Newsmagazine |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=16\u201318 |publisher=Railpace Company, Inc.|location=Piscataway, New Jersey |date=September 2004 |url=http://www.railpace.com/}}</ref> adding that SEPTA's chronic ills \"merely reflect the broader problems of local provincialism and petty political squabbles which are so rampant within the ([[Delaware Valley]]) region.\"<ref name=crisis /> The five counties it serves regularly have various hidden agendas working in the background, often at cross purposes with one another than as a unified region, a problem that has resulted in many services being severed mid-route without regard to the affected counties.<ref name=crisis /> This factor is regularly influenced by the changing political winds at the state capital in Harrisburg.<ref name=crisis />\n\nSEPTA made strides in the 21st century that helped reverse the downward trend. $191 million of funds made available from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] were utilized to make over 30 major improvements to the system, including renovations of the [[Spring Garden station (Broad Street Line)|Spring Garden]] and [[Girard station (Broad Street Line)|Girard Avenue]] subway stations and building the first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) station at [[Fox Chase station|Fox Chase terminal]] in 2010.

The award was criticized by ''[[Next City]]'' columnist Diana Lind, stating that despite some outward appearances of improvement, SEPTA still largely operates under a cloud of non-transparency and continues to lack a system-wide expansion program for the  future. This is most notable in the regional rail division, which suffered severe cutbacks in the 1980s and whose affected routes have been converted into rail trails, preventing a restoration of those services for the foreseeable future. When asked to produce data pertaining to SEPTA's repeated attempts to consolidate bus stops, Lind observed \"the report on the project barely elaborates on the information. SEPTA\u2019s trials deserve public attention and input. The public deserves the data\u2014show us the average times before and after the pilot. Give reader surveys.

It is in the plateau region and has an agricultural topography. The plateau is an extension of the Deccan Traps, formed between 60 and 68 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. In this region, the main classes of soil are black, brown and bhatori (stony) soil. The volcanic, clay-like soil of the region owes its black colour to the high iron content of the basalt from which it is formed. The soil requires less irrigation because of its high capacity for moisture retention. The other two soil types are lighter and have a higher proportion of sand. The year is popularly divided into three seasons: summer, the rains, and winter. Summer extends over the months of Chaitra to Jyestha (mid-March to mid-May). The average daily temperature during the summer months is 35&nbsp;\u00b0C, which typically rises to around 46&nbsp;\u00b0C on a few days. The rainy season starts with the first showers of Aashaadha (mid-June) and extends to the middle of Ashvin (September). Most of the rain falls during the southwest monsoon spell, and ranges from about 100&nbsp;cm in the west to about 165&nbsp;cm in the east. Ashoknagar and surrounding areas receive an average of 140&nbsp;cm of rainfall a year. The growing period lasts from 90 to 150 days, during which the average daily temperature is below 30&nbsp;\u00b0C, but seldom falls below 20&nbsp;\u00b0C. Winter is the longest of the three seasons, extending for about five months (mid-Ashvin to Phalgun, i.e., October to mid-March). The average daily temperature ranges from 15&nbsp;\u00b0C to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, though on some nights it can fall as low as 5&nbsp;\u00b0C. Some cultivators believe that an occasional winter shower during the months of Pausha and Maagha\u2014known as Mawta\u2014is helpful to the early summer wheat and germ crops.[5]\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Ashoknagar is [[sub-tropical]].

It is in the plateau region and has an agricultural topography. The plateau is an extension of the Deccan Traps, formed between 60 and 68 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. In this region, the main classes of soil are black, brown and bhatori (stony) soil. The volcanic, clay-like soil of the region owes its black colour to the high iron content of the basalt from which it is formed. The soil requires less irrigation because of its high capacity for moisture retention. The other two soil types are lighter and have a higher proportion of sand. The year is popularly divided into three seasons: summer, the rains, and winter. Summer extends over the months of Chaitra to Jyestha (mid-March to mid-May). The average daily temperature during the summer months is 35&nbsp;\u00b0C, which typically rises to around 46&nbsp;\u00b0C on a few days. The rainy season starts with the first showers of Aashaadha (mid-June) and extends to the middle of Ashvin (September). Most of the rain falls during the southwest monsoon spell, and ranges from about 100&nbsp;cm in the west to about 165&nbsp;cm in the east. Ashoknagar and surrounding areas receive an average of 140&nbsp;cm of rainfall a year. The growing period lasts from 90 to 150 days, during which the average daily temperature is below 30&nbsp;\u00b0C, but seldom falls below 20&nbsp;\u00b0C. Winter is the longest of the three seasons, extending for about five months (mid-Ashvin to Phalgun, i.e., October to mid-March). The average daily temperature ranges from 15&nbsp;\u00b0C to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, though on some nights it can fall as low as 5&nbsp;\u00b0C. Some cultivators believe that an occasional winter shower during the months of Pausha and Maagha\u2014known as Mawta\u2014is helpful to the early summer wheat and germ crops.[5]\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Ashoknagar is [[sub-tropical]].

Most notably, [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new [[News (Apple)|Apple News]] app aggregates articles from different sources; and [[Apple Maps]] received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include [[proactivity]], where [[Siri]] and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the [[iPad]]. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' [[circadian rhythm]]s. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the [[iPhone 6S]]. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\n\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\n\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 9}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release

Most notably, [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new [[News (Apple)|Apple News]] app aggregates articles from different sources; and [[Apple Maps]] received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include [[proactivity]], where [[Siri]] and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the [[iPad]]. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' [[circadian rhythm]]s. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the [[iPhone 6S]]. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\n\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\n\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 9}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release

In iOS 9, the use of Metal is expanded to let it handle many of the core user interface elements and graphics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/9-reasons-why-ios-9-will-make-your-old-iphone-feel-like-new-1519281|title=9 reasons why iOS 9 will make your old iPhone feel like new|last=McClelland|first=David|date=September 10, 2015|website=[[International Business Times]]|publisher=[[IBT Media]]|access-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090946/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/9-reasons-why-ios-9-will-make-your-old-iphone-feel-like-new-1519281|archive-date=April 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Proactivity ===\nIntelligence is one of the main features in iOS 9, consisting of the newly integrated [[Siri]] and Search (previously known as Spotlight), as well as \"proactivity\" throughout the operating system. iOS is now more aware of contextual information (such as time and location), and proactively provides the user with what they may need in advance to save them time and effort. When typing, Search has also been improved to display instant answers in an at-a-glance, widget-like format, similar to that provided in the Siri interface. Search can display current weather, sports scores, news, and more. The Search screen with proactive suggestions can be accessed either by pulling down the notifications window, in the Safari web browser through the search bar, and to the left on the home screen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=iOS 9, thoroughly reviewed |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221000039/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe intelligence also extends into apps.

The [[Cavalier]] (Royalist) army under [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], [[Charles I of England|King Charles's]] nephew and [[lieutenant general]], captured the important city and port of [[Bristol]] from its weakened [[Roundhead]] (Parliamentarian) [[garrison]]. The city remained under Royalist control until the second siege of Bristol in September of 1645.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the mid-17th century, Bristol had been one of the most important cities in England, second only to [[London]] in wealth. The Royalists had failed to secure it when the civil war began, leaving it under Parliamentarian control although there were many Royalist sympathisers within the city. In July 1643, the city's garrison was weakened when several of its units were detached to reinforce a Parliamentarian field army under Sir [[William Waller]]. On 13 July, Waller's army was destroyed at the [[Battle of Roundway Down]].<ref name=\"BCW\">1643: Lansdown, Roundway Down and Bristol.</ref>\n\nThe Royalists quickly realised that this presented them with a great opportunity to capture important Parliamentarian-held towns in the south-west of England. Only two days after the battle, Prince Rupert marched from [[Oxford, Oxfordshire|Oxford]], the Royalists' wartime capital, with a large army. He also sent orders to the Royalist western army which had been victorious at Roundway Down, now under the command of his younger brother [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice]], to march against Bristol from the south while he himself advanced on the city from the north.<ref>Young & Holmes, p.138.</ref>\n\n==Defences==\nThe Parliamentarian defenders of Bristol were commanded by Colonel [[Nathaniel Fiennes (Roundhead)|Nathaniel Fiennes]]. His garrison consisted of 300 cavalry and 1,500 infantry, plus some poorly-armed town militia. The fortifications consisted of an inner line immediately surrounding the city and resting on the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] and [[River Frome, Bristol|River Frome]], and an outer line about 500 yards outside the inner line.

The [[Cavalier]] (Royalist) army under [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], [[Charles I of England|King Charles's]] nephew and [[lieutenant general]], captured the important city and port of [[Bristol]] from its weakened [[Roundhead]] (Parliamentarian) [[garrison]]. The city remained under Royalist control until the second siege of Bristol\nin September of 1645.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the mid-17th century, Bristol had been one of the most important cities in England, second only to [[London]] in wealth. The Royalists had failed to secure it when the civil war began, leaving it under Parliamentarian control although there were many Royalist sympathisers within the city. In July 1643, the city's garrison was weakened when several of its units were detached to reinforce a Parliamentarian field army under Sir [[William Waller]]. On 13 July, Waller's army was destroyed at the [[Battle of Roundway Down]].<ref name=\"BCW\">{{cite web|title=1643: Lansdown, Roundway Down and Bristol|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1643-lansdown-roundway-bristol.htm|accessdate=2008-08-27|publisher=David Plant|year=2001\u20132008|work=British Civil Wars, Commonwealth and Protectorate 1638\u201360 website}}</ref>\n\nThe Royalists quickly realised that this presented them with a great opportunity to capture important Parliamentarian-held towns in the south-west of England. Only two days after the battle, Prince Rupert marched from [[Oxford, Oxfordshire|Oxford]], the Royalists' wartime capital, with a large army. He also sent orders to the Royalist western army which had been victorious at Roundway Down, now under the command of his younger brother [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice]], to march against Bristol from the south while he himself advanced on the city from the north.<ref>Young & Holmes, p.138</ref>\n\n==Defences==\nThe Parliamentarian defenders of Bristol were commanded by Colonel [[Nathaniel Fiennes (Roundhead)|Nathaniel Fiennes]]. His garrison consisted of 300 cavalry and 1,500 infantry, plus some poorly-armed town militia. The fortifications consisted of an inner line immediately surrounding the city and resting on the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] and [[River Frome, Bristol|River Frome]], and an outer line about 500 yards outside the inner line.

This was of great importance to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of the [[succession to Muhammad]].

On one such instance, Muhammad's \"announcement of a revelation permitting him to enter into marriages disallowed to other men drew from her [Aisha] the retort, 'It seems to me your Lord hastens to satisfy your desire!'\"<ref name=ahmed5152>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1992|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> Furthermore, Muhammad and Aisha had a strong intellectual relationship.<ref>{{harvnb|Mernissi|1988|p=104}}</ref> Muhammad valued her keen memory and intelligence and so instructed his companions to draw some of their religious practices from her.<ref>{{harvnb|Mernissi|1988|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ramadan|2007|p=121}}</ref>\n\nAisha was jealous of [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]] who was the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, saying, \"I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija though I did not see her, but the Prophet used to mention her very often, and when ever he slaughtered a sheep, he would cut its parts and send them to the women friends of Khadija.

As the story goes, Aisha left her ''[[howdah]]'' in order to search for a missing necklace. Her slaves mounted the ''howdah'' and prepared it for travel without noticing any difference in weight without Aisha's presence. Hence the caravan accidentally departed without her. She remained at the camp until the next morning, when [[Safwan ibn Muattal|Safwan ibn al-Mu\u2018attal]], a nomad and member of Muhammad's army, found her and brought her back to Muhammad at the army's next camp. Rumours that Aisha and Safwan had committed adultery were spread, particularly by [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], [[Hassan ibn Thabit]], Mistah ibn Uthatha and [[Hammanah bint Jahsh]] (sister of [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]], another of Muhammad's wives). [[Usama ibn Zayd]], son of [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], defended Aisha's reputation; while [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] advised \"Women are plentiful, and you can easily change one for another.\" Muhammad came to speak directly with Aisha about the rumours. He was still sitting in her house when he announced that he had received a revelation from [[God in Islam|God]] confirming Aisha's innocence. Surah 24 details the Islamic laws and punishment regarding [[Zina|adultery]] and slander. Aisha's accusers were subjected to punishments of 80 lashes.<ref>The story is told multiple times in the early traditions, nearly all of the versions being ultimately derived from Aisha's own account. Typical examples can be found in {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|462}}, {{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|37|6673}} and {{harvnb|Guillaume|1955|pp=494\u2013499}}.</ref>\n\n===Story of the honey===\nAfter the daily ''[[Asr prayer|Asr]]'' prayer, Muhammad would visit each of his wives' apartments to inquire about their well-being. Muhammad was just in the amount of time he spent with them and attention he gave to them.<ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.islamswomen.com/articles/zaynab_bint_jahsh.php |title=Great Women of Islam \u2013 Zaynab bint Jahsh |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015004735/http://islamswomen.com/articles/zaynab_bint_jahsh.php |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Once, Muhammad's fifth wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, received some honey from a relative which Muhammad took a particular liking to. As a result, every time Zaynab offered some of this honey to him he would spend a longer time in her apartment. This did not sit well with Aisha and [[Hafsa bint Umar]].\n{{Quote|Hafsa and I decided that when the Prophet entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"...\"But I have drunk honey.\" Hisham said: It also meant his saying, \"I will not drink anymore, and I have taken an oath, so do not inform anybody of that'|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]<ref>{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|8|78|682}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon after this event, Muhammad reported that he had received a revelation in which he was told that he could eat anything permitted by God. Some Sunni commentators on the Qur'an sometimes give this story as the \"occasion of revelation\" for [[At-Tahrim]], which opens with the following verses: {{Quote|O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which [[Allah]] has made lawful to thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<br>Allah has already ordained for you, (O men), the dissolution of your oaths (in some cases): and Allah is your Protector, and He is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.|Qur'an, surah 66 (At-Tahrim), [[ayah|ayat]] 1\u20132<ref>{{Cite quran|66|1|e=2|s=ns}}</ref>}} Word spread to the small [[Ummah|Muslim community]] that Muhammad's wives were speaking sharply to him and conspiring against him. Muhammad, saddened and upset, separated from his wives for a month. \u2018Umar, Hafsa's father, scolded his daughter and also spoke to Muhammad of the matter. By the end of this time, his wives were humbled; they agreed to \"speak correct and courteous words\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ibn Sa'd|1995|pp=132\u2013133}}</ref> and to focus on the [[afterlife]].<ref>{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|43|648}}</ref>\n\n===Death of Muhammad===\nAisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life. When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next. They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there. He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his most beloved wife.<ref name=ahmed58>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1992|p=58}}</ref><ref name=abbott69>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=69}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lings|1983|p=339}}</ref><ref name=\"Haykal\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1976|pp=502\u2013503}}</ref><ref name=\"Guillaume\">{{harvnb|Guillaume|1955|p=679 and 682}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nAfter Muhammad's death, which ended Aisha and Muhammad's 14-year-long marriage, Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning and acquiring knowledge of the Quran and the ''[[sunnah]]'' of Muhammad. Aisha was one of three wives (the other two being Hafsa bint Umar and [[Umm Salama]]) who memorized the Qur'an. Like Hafsa, Aisha had her own script of the Quran written after Muhammad's death.<ref name=\"jannah.org\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.jannah.org/sisters/aishah.html |title=Aishah bint Abu Bakr |publisher=Jannah.org |accessdate=2013-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000817/http://www.jannah.org/sisters/aishah.html |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> During Aisha's life many prominent customs of Islam, such as [[veil]]ing of women, began.\n\nAisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam.<ref name=\"Elsadda\" /> Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, and \u2018Uthman. During a time in Islam when women were not expected, or wanted, to contribute outside the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad.<ref name=ahmed51 />{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Role during caliphate===\n\n====Role during first and second caliphates====\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph. This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr.<ref>{{harvnb|Spellberg|Aghaie|pp=42\u201347}}</ref> Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as father-in-law. As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority.<ref name=spellberg45>{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|pp=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAisha garnered more special privilege in the Islamic community for being known as both a wife of Muhammad and the daughter of the first caliph. Being the daughter of Abu Bakr tied Aisha to honorable titles earned from her father's strong dedication to Islam. For example, she was given the title of ''al-siddiqa bint al-siddiq'', meaning 'the truthful woman, daughter of the truthful man',<ref name=spellberg40 /> a reference to Abu Bakr's support of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]].<ref>{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|p=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 634 Abu Bakr fell sick and was unable to recover. Prior to his death, he appointed \u2018Umar, one of his chief advisers, as the second caliph.<ref name=spellberg40 /> Throughout \u2018Umar's time in power Aisha continued to play the role of a consultant in political matters.<ref name=spellberg40 />\n\n====Role during the third caliphate====\nAfter \u2018Umar died, \u2018Uthm\u0101n was chosen to be the third caliph. He wanted to promote the interests of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. Aisha had little involvement with \u2018Uthm\u0101n for the first couple years, but eventually she found a way into the politics of his reign. She eventually grew to despise \u2018Uthm\u0101n, and many are unsure of what specifically triggered her eventual opposition towards him. A prominent opposition that arose towards him was when \u2018Uthm\u0101n mistreated \u2018[[Ammar ibn Yasir]] (companion of Muhammad) by beating him. Aisha became enraged and spoke out publicly, saying, \"How soon indeed you have forgotten the practice (sunnah) of your prophet and these, his hairs, a shirt, and sandal have not yet perished!\".<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=108}}</ref>\n\nAs time continued issues of antipathy towards \u2018Uthm\u0101n continued to arise. Another instance of opposition arose when the people came to Aisha, after Uthm\u0101n ignored the rightful punishment for Walid idn Uqbah (Uthm\u0101n's brother). Aisha and Uthm\u0101n argued with each other, Uthm\u0101n eventually made a comment on why Aisha had come and how she was \"ordered to stay at home\".<ref name= abbott111>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=111}}</ref> Arising from this comment, was the question of whether Aisha, and for that matter women, still had the ability to be involved in public affairs. The Muslim community became split: \"some sided with Uthm\u0101n, but others demanded to know who indeed had better right than Aisha in such matters\".<ref name= abbott111/>\n\nThe caliphate took a turn for the worse when [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] was governed by [[Abdullah ibn Saad]]. Abbott reports that [[Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa]] of Egypt, an opponent of \u2018Uthm\u0101n, forged letters in the Mothers of the Believers' names to the conspirators against \u2018Uthm\u0101n. The people cut off \u2018Uthm\u0101n's water and food supply. When Aisha realized the behavior of the crowd, Abbott notes, Aisha could not believe the crowd \"would offer such indignities to a widow of Mohammad\".<ref name= abbott122>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=122}}</ref> This refers to when [[Safiyya bint Huyayy]] (one of Muhammad's wives) tried to help \u2018Uthm\u0101n and was taken by the crowd. [[Malik al-Ashtar]] then approached her about killing Uthm\u0101n and the letter, and she claimed she would never want to \"command the shedding of the blood of the Muslims and the killing of their [[Imam|Im\u0101m]]\";<ref name= abbott122/> she also claimed she did not write the letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=123}}</ref> The city continued to oppose \u2018Uthm\u0101n, but as for Aisha, her journey to Mecca was approaching. With the journey to Mecca approaching at this time, she wanted to rid herself of the situation. \u2018Uthm\u0101n heard of her not wanting to hurt him, and he asked her to stay because of her influence on the people, but this did not persuade Aisha, and she continued on her journey.<ref name=\"Nabia\" />\n\n===First Fitna===\n{{Main|Battle of the Camel}}\n[[File:First Fitna map blank.svg|thumb|350px|Domains of [[Rashidun Caliphate]] under [[Rashidun|four caliphs]].

In particular, Muhammad's unions with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar associated him with two of the most significant leaders of the early Muslim community, Aisha's and Hafsa's fathers, Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, respectively.<ref name=\"Aslan\">{{harvnb|Aslan|2005|pp=58\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nAisha's marriage has given her significance among many within Islamic culture, becoming known as the most learned woman of her time.

She expressed herself as a role model to women, which can also be seen within some traditions attributed to her.

For this reason, Muslim feminists throughout the world are advocating a return to the society Muhammad originally envisioned for his followers. Despite differences in culture, nationalities, and beliefs, these women believe that the lesson to be learned from Muhammad in Medina is that Islam is above all an egalitarian religion. Their Medina is a society in which Muhammad designated women like Umm Waraqa as spiritual guides for the Ummah; in which the Prophet himself was sometimes publicly rebuked by his wives; in which women prayed and fought alongside the men; in which women like Aisha and Umm Salamah acted not only as religious but also as political\u2014and on at least one occasion military\u2014leaders; and in which the call to gather for prayer, bellowed from the rooftop of Muhammad's house, brought men and women together to kneel side by side and be blessed as a single undivided community.}}\n\nNot only was Aisha supportive of Muhammad, but she contributed scholarly intellect to the development of Islam.<ref name=\"Anwar\" /> She was given the title ''al-Siddiqah'', meaning 'the one who affirms the truth'.

Her discontinuation of public politics, however, did not stop her political influence completely. Privately, Aisha continued influencing those intertwined in the Islamic political sphere. Amongst the Islamic community, she was known as an intelligent woman who debated law with male companions.<ref>{{harvnb|Geissinger|2011|p=42}}</ref> Aisha was also considered to be the embodiment of proper rituals while partaking in the [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]], a journey she made with several groups of women. For the last two years of her life, Aisha spent much of her time telling the stories of Muhammad, hoping to correct false passages that had become influential in formulating Islamic law.

This was of great importance to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of the [[succession to Muhammad]].

On one such instance, Muhammad's \"announcement of a revelation permitting him to enter into marriages disallowed to other men drew from her [Aisha] the retort, 'It seems to me your Lord hastens to satisfy your desire!'\"<ref name=ahmed5152>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1992|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> Furthermore, Muhammad and Aisha had a strong intellectual relationship.<ref>{{harvnb|Mernissi|1988|p=104}}</ref> Muhammad valued her keen memory and intelligence and so instructed his companions to draw some of their religious practices from her.<ref>{{harvnb|Mernissi|1988|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ramadan|2007|p=121}}</ref>\n\nAisha was jealous of [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]] who was the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, saying, \"I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija though I did not see her, but the Prophet used to mention her very often, and when ever he slaughtered a sheep, he would cut its parts and send them to the women friends of Khadija.

As the story goes, Aisha left her ''[[howdah]]'' in order to search for a missing necklace. Her slaves mounted the ''howdah'' and prepared it for travel without noticing any difference in weight without Aisha's presence. Hence the caravan accidentally departed without her. She remained at the camp until the next morning, when [[Safwan ibn Muattal|Safwan ibn al-Mu\u2018attal]], a nomad and member of Muhammad's army, found her and brought her back to Muhammad at the army's next camp. Rumours that Aisha and Safwan had committed adultery were spread, particularly by [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], [[Hassan ibn Thabit]], Mistah ibn Uthatha and [[Hammanah bint Jahsh]] (sister of [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]], another of Muhammad's wives). [[Usama ibn Zayd]], son of [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], defended Aisha's reputation; while [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] advised \"Women are plentiful, and you can easily change one for another.\" Muhammad came to speak directly with Aisha about the rumours. He was still sitting in her house when he announced that he had received a revelation from [[God in Islam|God]] confirming Aisha's innocence. Surah 24 details the Islamic laws and punishment regarding [[Zina|adultery]] and slander. Aisha's accusers were subjected to punishments of 80 lashes.<ref>The story is told multiple times in the early traditions, nearly all of the versions being ultimately derived from Aisha's own account. Typical examples can be found in {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|462}}, {{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|37|6673}} and {{harvnb|Guillaume|1955|pp=494\u2013499}}.</ref>\n\n===Story of the honey===\nAfter the daily ''[[Asr prayer|Asr]]'' prayer, Muhammad would visit each of his wives' apartments to inquire about their well-being. Muhammad was just in the amount of time he spent with them and attention he gave to them.<ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.islamswomen.com/articles/zaynab_bint_jahsh.php |title=Great Women of Islam \u2013 Zaynab bint Jahsh |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015004735/http://islamswomen.com/articles/zaynab_bint_jahsh.php |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Once, Muhammad's fifth wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, received some honey from a relative which Muhammad took a particular liking to. As a result, every time Zaynab offered some of this honey to him he would spend a longer time in her apartment. This did not sit well with Aisha and [[Hafsa bint Umar]].\n{{Quote|Hafsa and I decided that when the Prophet entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"...\"But I have drunk honey.\" Hisham said: It also meant his saying, \"I will not drink anymore, and I have taken an oath, so do not inform anybody of that'|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]<ref>{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|8|78|682}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon after this event, Muhammad reported that he had received a revelation in which he was told that he could eat anything permitted by God. Some Sunni commentators on the Qur'an sometimes give this story as the \"occasion of revelation\" for [[At-Tahrim]], which opens with the following verses: {{Quote|O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which [[Allah]] has made lawful to thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<br>Allah has already ordained for you, (O men), the dissolution of your oaths (in some cases): and Allah is your Protector, and He is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.|Qur'an, surah 66 (At-Tahrim), [[ayah|ayat]] 1\u20132<ref>{{Cite quran|66|1|e=2|s=ns}}</ref>}} Word spread to the small [[Ummah|Muslim community]] that Muhammad's wives were speaking sharply to him and conspiring against him. Muhammad, saddened and upset, separated from his wives for a month. \u2018Umar, Hafsa's father, scolded his daughter and also spoke to Muhammad of the matter. By the end of this time, his wives were humbled; they agreed to \"speak correct and courteous words\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ibn Sa'd|1995|pp=132\u2013133}}</ref> and to focus on the [[afterlife]].<ref>{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|43|648}}</ref>\n\n===Death of Muhammad===\nAisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life. When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next. They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there. He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his most beloved wife.<ref name=ahmed58>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1992|p=58}}</ref><ref name=abbott69>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=69}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lings|1983|p=339}}</ref><ref name=\"Haykal\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1976|pp=502\u2013503}}</ref><ref name=\"Guillaume\">{{harvnb|Guillaume|1955|p=679 and 682}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nAfter Muhammad's death, which ended Aisha and Muhammad's 14-year-long marriage, Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning and acquiring knowledge of the Quran and the ''[[sunnah]]'' of Muhammad. Aisha was one of three wives (the other two being Hafsa bint Umar and [[Umm Salama]]) who memorized the Qur'an. Like Hafsa, Aisha had her own script of the Quran written after Muhammad's death.<ref name=\"jannah.org\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.jannah.org/sisters/aishah.html |title=Aishah bint Abu Bakr |publisher=Jannah.org |accessdate=2013-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000817/http://www.jannah.org/sisters/aishah.html |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> During Aisha's life many prominent customs of Islam, such as [[veil]]ing of women, began.\n\nAisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam.<ref name=\"Elsadda\" /> Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, and \u2018Uthman. During a time in Islam when women were not expected, or wanted, to contribute outside the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad.<ref name=ahmed51 />{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Role during caliphate===\n\n====Role during first and second caliphates====\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph. This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr.<ref>{{harvnb|Spellberg|Aghaie|pp=42\u201347}}</ref> Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as father-in-law. As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority.<ref name=spellberg45>{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|pp=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAisha garnered more special privilege in the Islamic community for being known as both a wife of Muhammad and the daughter of the first caliph. Being the daughter of Abu Bakr tied Aisha to honorable titles earned from her father's strong dedication to Islam. For example, she was given the title of ''al-siddiqa bint al-siddiq'', meaning 'the truthful woman, daughter of the truthful man',<ref name=spellberg40 /> a reference to Abu Bakr's support of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]].<ref>{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|p=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 634 Abu Bakr fell sick and was unable to recover. Prior to his death, he appointed \u2018Umar, one of his chief advisers, as the second caliph.<ref name=spellberg40 /> Throughout \u2018Umar's time in power Aisha continued to play the role of a consultant in political matters.<ref name=spellberg40 />\n\n====Role during the third caliphate====\nAfter \u2018Umar died, \u2018Uthm\u0101n was chosen to be the third caliph. He wanted to promote the interests of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. Aisha had little involvement with \u2018Uthm\u0101n for the first couple years, but eventually she found a way into the politics of his reign. She eventually grew to despise \u2018Uthm\u0101n, and many are unsure of what specifically triggered her eventual opposition towards him. A prominent opposition that arose towards him was when \u2018Uthm\u0101n mistreated \u2018[[Ammar ibn Yasir]] (companion of Muhammad) by beating him. Aisha became enraged and spoke out publicly, saying, \"How soon indeed you have forgotten the practice (sunnah) of your prophet and these, his hairs, a shirt, and sandal have not yet perished!\".<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=108}}</ref>\n\nAs time continued issues of antipathy towards \u2018Uthm\u0101n continued to arise. Another instance of opposition arose when the people came to Aisha, after Uthm\u0101n ignored the rightful punishment for Walid idn Uqbah (Uthm\u0101n's brother). Aisha and Uthm\u0101n argued with each other, Uthm\u0101n eventually made a comment on why Aisha had come and how she was \"ordered to stay at home\".<ref name= abbott111>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=111}}</ref> Arising from this comment, was the question of whether Aisha, and for that matter women, still had the ability to be involved in public affairs. The Muslim community became split: \"some sided with Uthm\u0101n, but others demanded to know who indeed had better right than Aisha in such matters\".<ref name= abbott111/>\n\nThe caliphate took a turn for the worse when [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] was governed by [[Abdullah ibn Saad]]. Abbott reports that [[Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa]] of Egypt, an opponent of \u2018Uthm\u0101n, forged letters in the Mothers of the Believers' names to the conspirators against \u2018Uthm\u0101n. The people cut off \u2018Uthm\u0101n's water and food supply. When Aisha realized the behavior of the crowd, Abbott notes, Aisha could not believe the crowd \"would offer such indignities to a widow of Mohammad\".<ref name= abbott122>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=122}}</ref> This refers to when [[Safiyya bint Huyayy]] (one of Muhammad's wives) tried to help \u2018Uthm\u0101n and was taken by the crowd. [[Malik al-Ashtar]] then approached her about killing Uthm\u0101n and the letter, and she claimed she would never want to \"command the shedding of the blood of the Muslims and the killing of their [[Imam|Im\u0101m]]\";<ref name= abbott122/> she also claimed she did not write the letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=123}}</ref> The city continued to oppose \u2018Uthm\u0101n, but as for Aisha, her journey to Mecca was approaching. With the journey to Mecca approaching at this time, she wanted to rid herself of the situation. \u2018Uthm\u0101n heard of her not wanting to hurt him, and he asked her to stay because of her influence on the people, but this did not persuade Aisha, and she continued on her journey.<ref name=\"Nabia\" />\n\n===First Fitna===\n{{Main|Battle of the Camel}}\n[[File:First Fitna map blank.svg|thumb|350px|Domains of [[Rashidun Caliphate]] under [[Rashidun|four caliphs]].

The first to respond to Aisha was Abdullah ibn Aamar al-Hadhrami, the governor of Mecca during the reign of Uthman, and prominent members of the [[Banu Umayya]].

The battle is known as the [[Battle of the Camel]], after the fact that Aisha directed her forces from a [[howdah]] on the back of a large camel.

Muhammad's subsequent marriages were depicted purely as political matches rather than unions of sexual indulgence. In particular, Muhammad's unions with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar associated him with two of the most significant leaders of the early Muslim community, Aisha's and Hafsa's fathers, Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, respectively.<ref name=\"Aslan\">{{harvnb|Aslan|2005|pp=58\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nAisha's marriage has given her significance among many within Islamic culture, becoming known as the most learned woman of her time.

For this reason, Muslim feminists throughout the world are advocating a return to the society Muhammad originally envisioned for his followers. Despite differences in culture, nationalities, and beliefs, these women believe that the lesson to be learned from Muhammad in Medina is that Islam is above all an egalitarian religion. Their Medina is a society in which Muhammad designated women like Umm Waraqa as spiritual guides for the Ummah; in which the Prophet himself was sometimes publicly rebuked by his wives; in which women prayed and fought alongside the men; in which women like Aisha and Umm Salamah acted not only as religious but also as political\u2014and on at least one occasion military\u2014leaders; and in which the call to gather for prayer, bellowed from the rooftop of Muhammad's house, brought men and women together to kneel side by side and be blessed as a single undivided community.}}\n\nNot only was Aisha supportive of Muhammad, but she contributed scholarly intellect to the development of Islam.<ref name=\"Anwar\" /> She was given the title ''al-Siddiqah'', meaning 'the one who affirms the truth'.
