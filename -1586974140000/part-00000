At 12, he found life at home unbearable because of the continuous quarrels with Antonio. Having to face life by himself at such a young age may have developed his later sympathies to help abandoned boys. After begging unsuccessfully for work, Bosco ended up at the wine farm of Louis Moglia.<ref name=\"Lemoyne, Vol I, Chapter 22, Pages 142-152\"/> Although Bosco could pursue some studies by himself, he was not able to attend school for two more years.

His other ministries included visiting prisoners, teaching [[catechism]], and helping out at many country parishes.\n\n===Adulthood===\nAt that time, the city of Turin had a population of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside in search of a better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to see so many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them from ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and marketplaces. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief ''Memoires.''\n\nThe Oratorio was not simply a charitable institution, and its activities were not limited to Sundays. For Don Bosco, it became his permanent occupation. He looked for jobs for the unemployed. Some of the boys did not have sleeping quarters and slept under bridges or in bleak public dormitories. Twice he tried to provide lodgings in his house. The first time they stole the blankets; the second they emptied the hay-loft. He did not give up. In May 1847, he gave shelter to a young boy from Valencia, in one of the three rooms he was renting in the slums of Valdocco, where he was living with his mother. He and \"Mamma Margherita\" began taking in orphans. The boys sheltered by Don Bosco numbered 36 in 1852, 115 in 1854, 470 in 1860 and 600 in 1861, 800 is the maximum sometime later.<ref name=ewtn>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/DBOSCO.HTM|title=\"Don Bosco's Story\", ewtn}}</ref>\n\nBosco and his oratory moved around town for a number of years; he was turned out of several places in succession. After only two months based in the church of St. Martin, the entire neighborhood expressed its annoyance with the noise coming from the boys at play. A formal complaint was lodged against them with the municipality. Rumors also circulated that the meetings conducted by the priest with his boys were dangerous; their recreation could be turned into a revolution against the government. The group was evicted.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|first=Charles|last=D'Espiney|title=Don Bosco: A Sketch of His Life and Miracles|date=1884|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===Work with apprentices===\nIn the archives of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on stamped paper costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice, and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many sensitive issues. Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared for their health, and demanded that they are given rest on feast days and that they are given an annual holiday. But in spite of all the efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult.<ref name=ewtn/>\n\nOne influential friend was the Piedmontese Justice Minister [[Urbano Rattazzi]].

He found a religious order to keep the oratory going after its founder\u2019s death.<ref name=\"This Saint's for You!\"/> Bosco had been thinking about that problem, too, and had been slowly organizing his helpers into a loose \"Congregation of St. Francis de Sales\". He was also training select older boys for the priesthood. Another supporter of the idea to establish a religious order to carry out Bosco's vision was the reigning pope, [[Pope Pius IX]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Villefranche|first=Jacques-Melchior|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qwsEAAAAYAAJ|title=The Life of Don Bosco: Founder of the Salesian Society|pages=15\u201316|publisher=Burns & Oates|year=1898}}</ref>\n\nBosco disliked the ideals that had been [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|exported by revolutionary France]], calling [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] \"two vicious leaders of incredulity.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Giovanni Bosco: 'Storia ecclesiastica ad uso delle scuole'|work=Giovanni Bosco: Opere edite.

In 1854, when the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] was about to pass a law suppressing monastic orders and confiscating ecclesiastical properties, Bosco reported a series of dreams about \"great funerals at court\", referring to politicians or members of the Savoy court.<ref name=\"The Dreams of St. John Bosco\">{{cite book|last=Mendl|first=Michael|url=http://www.bosconet.aust.com/DBD.html#ftn.d0e6|title=The Dreams of St. John Bosco|work=Journal of Salesian Studies|volume=12|date=2004|edition=2|pages=321\u2013348|access-date=12 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208225805/http://www.bosconet.aust.com/DBD.html#ftn.d0e6|archive-date=8 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1854, he sent a letter to King [[Victor Emmanuel II]], admonishing him to oppose the confiscation of church property and suppression of the orders, but the King failed to respond.<ref name=\"bosconet.aust.com\">{{cite book|title=Memoirs of the Oratory of Saint Francis de Sales 1815 \u2013 1855: The autobiography of Saint John Bosco|chapter-url=http://www.bosconet.aust.com/moparts/ch55.html|date=6 December 2007|translator=Daniel Lyons SDB|editor1=Eugene Ceria SDB|editor2=Lawrence Castelvecchi SDB|editor3=Michael Mendl SDB|chapter=55|page=802|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206015444/http://www.bosconet.aust.com/moparts/ch55.html|archive-date=6 December 2007}}</ref> His actions, which had been described by Italian historian Erberto Petoia as having \"manifest blackmailing intentions\",<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Medioevo|date=June 2007|first=Erberto|last=Petoia|page=70|title=I sinistri presagi di Don Giovanni Bosco}}</ref> ended only after the intervention of Prime Minister [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]].

Traditionalist clergy accused him of stealing the young and old people away from their own parishes. Nationalist politicians (including some clergy) saw his several hundred young men as a recruiting ground for revolution. The Marquis de Cavour, chief of police in Turin, regarded the open-air catechisms as overtly political and a threat to the State, and was highly suspicious of Bosco's support for the powers of the papacy. Bosco was interrogated on several occasions, but no charges made. Closure may have been prevented by orders from the king that Bosco was not to be disturbed.<ref>{{harvnb|Butler|1999|loc=Volume I}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were also made on Bosco's life, including a near-stabbing, bludgeoning and a shooting. Early biographers put this down to the growing influence of the [[Waldensians]] in opposition to Catholic clergy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Foundation of the Salesians of Don Bosco===\n[[File:Basilica Don Bosco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Basilica Don Bosco in [[Castelnuovo Don Bosco]], [[Province of Asti|Asti]]]]\n[[File:Don boscojf.JPG|thumb|right|200px|St. John Bosco Parish Church, [[Makati]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:St Don Bosco 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco, [[Ronda]], Spain]]\n[[File:Don boscojfc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco, [[Makati City]], Philippines]]\n[[File:Don Bosco statue at the Shrine of Mary Help of Christians in Calamba, Laguna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco at the Diocesan Shrine of Mary Help of Christians, [[Canlubang]], [[Calamba City]], Philippines]]\n\nSome of the boys helped by Don Bosco decided to do what he was doing, that is, to work in the service of abandoned boys. And this was the origin of the Salesian Congregation. Among the first members were Michael Rua, John Cagliero (who later became a Cardinal), and John Baptist Francesia.<ref name=ewtn/>\n\nIn 1859, Bosco selected the experienced priest Vittorio Alasonatti, 15 seminarians and one high school boy and formed them into the \"Society of St. Francis de Sales.\" This was the nucleus of the Salesians, the religious order that would carry on his work. When the group had their next meeting, they voted on the admission of Joseph Rossi as a lay member, the first Salesian brother. The Salesian Congregation was divided into priests, seminarians and \"coadjutors\" (the lay brothers).\n\nNext, he worked with estarino, [[Mary Mazzarello]] and a group of girls in the hill town of [[Mornese]]. In 1871, he founded a group of religious sisters to do for girls what the Salesians were doing for boys. They were called the \"Daughters of Mary Help of Christians.\" In 1874, he founded yet another group, the \"Salesian Cooperators.\" These were mostly lay people who would work for young people like the Daughters and the Salesians, but would not join a religious order.<ref name=\"PSI\">{{cite web|title=Saint John Bosco|work=Saints.SQPN.com|date=12 August 2010|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-john-bosco/|access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first Salesians departed for [[Argentina]] in 1875. After his ordination, Bosco himself would have become a missionary had not his director, [[Joseph Cafasso]], opposed the idea. He nevertheless eagerly read the Italian edition of the Annals of the Propagation of the Faith and used this magazine to illustrate his ''Cattolico Provveduto'' (1853) and his ''Month of May'' booklets (1858).\n\nWhen Bosco founded the Salesian Society, the thought of the missions still obsessed him, though he completely lacked the financial means at that time. Bosco claimed he had another dream{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} where he was on a vast plain, inhabited by primitive peoples, who spent their time hunting or fighting among themselves or against soldiers in European uniforms. Along came a band of missionaries, but they were all massacred. A second group appeared, which Bosco at once recognized as Salesians. Astonished, he witnessed an unexpected change when the fierce savages laid down their arms and listened to the missionaries. It seems the dream made a great impression on Bosco, because he tried hard to identify the men and the country of the dream \u2013 and for three years collected information about different countries. A request from [[Argentina]], turned him towards the Indians of [[Patagonia]], and a study of the people there convinced him that the country and its inhabitants were the ones he had seen in his dream. Towards the end of 1874, John Bosco received letters from the Argentine consult at Savona requesting that he accept an Italian parish in Buenos Aires and a school for boys at San Nicolas de los Arroyos.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nBosco regarded it as a sign of providence and started to prepare a mission. Adopting a way of evangelization that would not expose his missionaries to wild, \"uncivilized\" tribes, he proposed setting up bases in safe locations which missionary efforts were to be launched. Negotiations started after Archbishop Aneiros of [[Buenos Aires]] had indicated that he would be glad to receive the Salesians. In a ceremony held on 29 January 1875, Bosco was able to convey the great news to the oratory. On 5 February he announced the fact in a circular letter to all Salesians asking volunteers to apply in writing. He proposed that the first missionary departure start in October. There were many volunteers.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Salesian Preventive System and other Works===\n{{Main|Salesian Preventive System}}\nIn the years Don Bosco had spent running his oratory and giving spiritual and practical instruction to the boys he had housed there, he relied on a different approach on education and general instruction which he believed to be superior to traditional educational methods which he labelled as a [[School discipline|Repressive System of Education]]. On March 12, 1877, Bosco gave an opening address on the subject-matter of the systems of education during the day for the opening of the St. Peter's Youth Center in the new quarters of the Patronage de Saint Pierre in [[Nice]], in which he first mentions the term '[[Salesian Preventive System|Preventive System]]'.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Salesian Preventive System of St. John Bosco (Don Bosco) (Educational Philosophy of Don Bosco - Don Bosco's Way, Style, Approach, Method, System, etc... of Educating and Accompanying Young People Today) |url=http://www.donboscowest.org/pedagogy/preventive-system |website=http://www.donboscowest.org/ |publisher=Don Bosco West |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Upon his return to [[Turin]], don Bosco wrote down the address as a polished essay under the title ''The Preventive System in the Education of the Youth'' which was published in 1877, which he included when he drafted the Rule for the Salesian Order.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bosco |first1=Giovanni Melchor |title=Regolamento per le case della Societ\u00e0 di S.

His funeral was attended by thousands. Soon after there was popular demand to have him canonized.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The Archdiocese of Turin investigated and witnesses were called to determine if Bosco was worthy to be declared a saint. The Salesians, Daughters and Cooperators gave supportive testimonies. But many remembered Bosco's controversies in the 1870s with Archbishop Gastaldi and some others high in the Church hierarchy thought him a loose cannon and a \"wheeler-dealer\". In the [[canonization]] process, testimony was heard about how he went around Gastaldi to get some of his men ordained and about their lack of academic preparation and ecclesiastical decorum. [[Political cartoon]]s from the 1860s and later showed him shaking money from the pockets of old ladies or going off to America for the same purpose. These cartoons were not forgotten. Opponents of Bosco, including some [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], were in a position to block his canonization. \n\n[[Pope Pius XI]] had known Bosco and pushed the cause forward.

His other ministries included visiting prisoners, teaching [[catechism]], and helping out at many country parishes.\n\n===Adulthood===\nAt that time, the city of Turin had a population of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside in search of a better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to see so many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them from ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and marketplaces. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief ''Memoires.''\n\nThe Oratorio was not simply a charitable institution, and its activities were not limited to Sundays. For Don Bosco, it became his permanent occupation. He looked for jobs for the unemployed. Some of the boys did not have sleeping quarters and slept under bridges or in bleak public dormitories. Twice he tried to provide lodgings in his house. The first time they stole the blankets; the second they emptied the hay-loft. He did not give up. In May 1847, he gave shelter to a young boy from Valencia, in one of the three rooms he was renting in the slums of Valdocco, where he was living with his mother. He and \"Mamma Margherita\" began taking in orphans. The boys sheltered by Don Bosco numbered 36 in 1852, 115 in 1854, 470 in 1860 and 600 in 1861, 800 is the maximum sometime later.<ref name=ewtn>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/DBOSCO.HTM|title=\"Don Bosco's Story\", ewtn}}</ref>\n\nBosco and his oratory moved around town for a number of years; he was turned out of several places in succession. After only two months based in the church of St. Martin, the entire neighborhood expressed its annoyance with the noise coming from the boys at play. A formal complaint was lodged against them with the municipality. Rumors also circulated that the meetings conducted by the priest with his boys were dangerous; their recreation could be turned into a revolution against the government. The group was evicted.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|first=Charles|last=D'Espiney|title=Don Bosco: A Sketch of His Life and Miracles|date=1884|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===Work with apprentices===\nIn the archives of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on stamped paper costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice, and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many sensitive issues. Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared for their health, and demanded that they are given rest on feast days and that they are given an annual holiday. But in spite of all the efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult.<ref name=ewtn/>\n\nOne influential friend was the Piedmontese Justice Minister [[Urbano Rattazzi]]. He was [[anticlerical]] in his politics, but he saw some value in Bosco\u2019s work.<ref name=\"This Saint's for You!\">{{cite book|last=Craughwell|first=Thomas J.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bl-2P6HSFVwC|title=This Saint's for You!|pages=156\u2013157|publisher=Quirk Books|date=2007|isbn=9781594741845}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jestice|first=Phyllis G.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&pg=PA138&dq=john+bosco+rattazzi|title=Holy People of the World|page=138|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2004|isbn=9781576073551}}</ref> While Rattazzi was pushing a bill through the [[Sardinia]]n legislature to suppress religious orders, he advised Bosco on how to get around the law. He found a religious order to keep the oratory going after its founder\u2019s death.<ref name=\"This Saint's for You!\"/> Bosco had been thinking about that problem, too, and had been slowly organizing his helpers into a loose \"Congregation of St. Francis de Sales\". He was also training select older boys for the priesthood. Another supporter of the idea to establish a religious order to carry out Bosco's vision was the reigning pope, [[Pope Pius IX]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Villefranche|first=Jacques-Melchior|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qwsEAAAAYAAJ|title=The Life of Don Bosco: Founder of the Salesian Society|pages=15\u201316|publisher=Burns & Oates|year=1898}}</ref>\n\nBosco disliked the ideals that had been [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|exported by revolutionary France]], calling [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] \"two vicious leaders of incredulity.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Giovanni Bosco: 'Storia ecclesiastica ad uso delle scuole'|work=Giovanni Bosco: Opere edite.

In 1854, when the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] was about to pass a law suppressing monastic orders and confiscating ecclesiastical properties, Bosco reported a series of dreams about \"great funerals at court\", referring to politicians or members of the Savoy court.<ref name=\"The Dreams of St. John Bosco\">{{cite book|last=Mendl|first=Michael|url=http://www.bosconet.aust.com/DBD.html#ftn.d0e6|title=The Dreams of St. John Bosco|work=Journal of Salesian Studies|volume=12|date=2004|edition=2|pages=321\u2013348|access-date=12 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208225805/http://www.bosconet.aust.com/DBD.html#ftn.d0e6|archive-date=8 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1854, he sent a letter to King [[Victor Emmanuel II]], admonishing him to oppose the confiscation of church property and suppression of the orders, but the King failed to respond.<ref name=\"bosconet.aust.com\">{{cite book|title=Memoirs of the Oratory of Saint Francis de Sales 1815 \u2013 1855: The autobiography of Saint John Bosco|chapter-url=http://www.bosconet.aust.com/moparts/ch55.html|date=6 December 2007|translator=Daniel Lyons SDB|editor1=Eugene Ceria SDB|editor2=Lawrence Castelvecchi SDB|editor3=Michael Mendl SDB|chapter=55|page=802|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206015444/http://www.bosconet.aust.com/moparts/ch55.html|archive-date=6 December 2007}}</ref> His actions, which had been described by Italian historian Erberto Petoia as having \"manifest blackmailing intentions\",<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Medioevo|date=June 2007|first=Erberto|last=Petoia|page=70|title=I sinistri presagi di Don Giovanni Bosco}}</ref> ended only after the intervention of Prime Minister [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]]. The king's family suffered a number of deaths in a short period. From January to May 1855, [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1801-1855)|the king's mother (age 54)]], [[Adelaide of Austria|wife (32)]], newborn son (Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Genoa; nearly four months old), and [[Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Genoa|his only brother (32)]] all died.<ref name=\"The Dreams of St. John Bosco\"/><ref name=\"bosconet.aust.com\"/>\n\nOpposition to Bosco and his work came from various quarters. Traditionalist clergy accused him of stealing the young and old people away from their own parishes. Nationalist politicians (including some clergy) saw his several hundred young men as a recruiting ground for revolution. The Marquis de Cavour, chief of police in Turin, regarded the open-air catechisms as overtly political and a threat to the State, and was highly suspicious of Bosco's support for the powers of the papacy. Bosco was interrogated on several occasions, but no charges made. Closure may have been prevented by orders from the king that Bosco was not to be disturbed.<ref>{{harvnb|Butler|1999|loc=Volume I}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were also made on Bosco's life, including a near-stabbing, bludgeoning and a shooting. Early biographers put this down to the growing influence of the [[Waldensians]] in opposition to Catholic clergy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Foundation of the Salesians of Don Bosco===\n[[File:Basilica Don Bosco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Basilica Don Bosco in [[Castelnuovo Don Bosco]], [[Province of Asti|Asti]]]]\n[[File:Don boscojf.JPG|thumb|right|200px|St. John Bosco Parish Church, [[Makati]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:St Don Bosco 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco, [[Ronda]], Spain]]\n[[File:Don boscojfc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco, [[Makati City]], Philippines]]\n[[File:Don Bosco statue at the Shrine of Mary Help of Christians in Calamba, Laguna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Saint John Bosco at the Diocesan Shrine of Mary Help of Christians, [[Canlubang]], [[Calamba City]], Philippines]]\n\nSome of the boys helped by Don Bosco decided to do what he was doing, that is, to work in the service of abandoned boys. And this was the origin of the Salesian Congregation. Among the first members were Michael Rua, John Cagliero (who later became a Cardinal), and John Baptist Francesia.<ref name=ewtn/>\n\nIn 1859, Bosco selected the experienced priest Vittorio Alasonatti, 15 seminarians and one high school boy and formed them into the \"Society of St. Francis de Sales.\" This was the nucleus of the Salesians, the religious order that would carry on his work. When the group had their next meeting, they voted on the admission of Joseph Rossi as a lay member, the first Salesian brother. The Salesian Congregation was divided into priests, seminarians and \"coadjutors\" (the lay brothers).\n\nNext, he worked with estarino, [[Mary Mazzarello]] and a group of girls in the hill town of [[Mornese]]. In 1871, he founded a group of religious sisters to do for girls what the Salesians were doing for boys. They were called the \"Daughters of Mary Help of Christians.\" In 1874, he founded yet another group, the \"Salesian Cooperators.\" These were mostly lay people who would work for young people like the Daughters and the Salesians, but would not join a religious order.<ref name=\"PSI\">{{cite web|title=Saint John Bosco|work=Saints.SQPN.com|date=12 August 2010|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-john-bosco/|access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first Salesians departed for [[Argentina]] in 1875. After his ordination, Bosco himself would have become a missionary had not his director, [[Joseph Cafasso]], opposed the idea. He nevertheless eagerly read the Italian edition of the Annals of the Propagation of the Faith and used this magazine to illustrate his ''Cattolico Provveduto'' (1853) and his ''Month of May'' booklets (1858).\n\nWhen Bosco founded the Salesian Society, the thought of the missions still obsessed him, though he completely lacked the financial means at that time. Bosco claimed he had another dream{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} where he was on a vast plain, inhabited by primitive peoples, who spent their time hunting or fighting among themselves or against soldiers in European uniforms. Along came a band of missionaries, but they were all massacred. A second group appeared, which Bosco at once recognized as Salesians. Astonished, he witnessed an unexpected change when the fierce savages laid down their arms and listened to the missionaries. It seems the dream made a great impression on Bosco, because he tried hard to identify the men and the country of the dream \u2013 and for three years collected information about different countries. A request from [[Argentina]], turned him towards the Indians of [[Patagonia]], and a study of the people there convinced him that the country and its inhabitants were the ones he had seen in his dream. Towards the end of 1874, John Bosco received letters from the Argentine consult at Savona requesting that he accept an Italian parish in Buenos Aires and a school for boys at San Nicolas de los Arroyos.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nBosco regarded it as a sign of providence and started to prepare a mission. Adopting a way of evangelization that would not expose his missionaries to wild, \"uncivilized\" tribes, he proposed setting up bases in safe locations which missionary efforts were to be launched. Negotiations started after Archbishop Aneiros of [[Buenos Aires]] had indicated that he would be glad to receive the Salesians. In a ceremony held on 29 January 1875, Bosco was able to convey the great news to the oratory. On 5 February he announced the fact in a circular letter to all Salesians asking volunteers to apply in writing. He proposed that the first missionary departure start in October. There were many volunteers.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Salesian Preventive System and other Works===\n{{Main|Salesian Preventive System}}\nIn the years Don Bosco had spent running his oratory and giving spiritual and practical instruction to the boys he had housed there, he relied on a different approach on education and general instruction which he believed to be superior to traditional educational methods which he labelled as a [[School discipline|Repressive System of Education]]. On March 12, 1877, Bosco gave an opening address on the subject-matter of the systems of education during the day for the opening of the St. Peter's Youth Center in the new quarters of the Patronage de Saint Pierre in [[Nice]], in which he first mentions the term '[[Salesian Preventive System|Preventive System]]'.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Salesian Preventive System of St. John Bosco (Don Bosco) (Educational Philosophy of Don Bosco - Don Bosco's Way, Style, Approach, Method, System, etc... of Educating and Accompanying Young People Today) |url=http://www.donboscowest.org/pedagogy/preventive-system |website=http://www.donboscowest.org/ |publisher=Don Bosco West |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Upon his return to [[Turin]], don Bosco wrote down the address as a polished essay under the title ''The Preventive System in the Education of the Youth'' which was published in 1877, which he included when he drafted the Rule for the Salesian Order.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bosco |first1=Giovanni Melchor |title=Regolamento per le case della Societ\u00e0 di S.

Though the idea itself was not innovative by any means, Bosco having drawn the inspiration for his system through the contemporary criticisms of the punitive and outdated educational systems prevalent in Europe during his time, he was one of the first to combat and put these criticisms into practice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frith-Powell |first1=Louise |title=The \"Preventive System\": Walking Alongside |url=https://humanumreview.com/articles/the-preventive-system-walking-alongside |website=humanumreview.com |publisher=Humanum Revieww |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>  \n\nThough Don Bosco's written works were little known outside of his own Order and the subscribers of his [[Salesian Bulletin]], which he founded on August 1877, he wrote frequently and voluminously. Though Don Bosco was described as more of a man of action than a scholar<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nanni |first1=Carlo |title=Il Sistema Preventivo di Don Bosco |journal=Elledici |date=2003 |page=p. 7}}</ref>, he was an exceptional historian. He penned the 1881 ''\"A Compendium of Italian History from the Fall of the Roman Empire\"'' which was translated and continued to the present time by [[John Daniel Morell]], and was noted by scholars for its cultural importance on the knowledge base of ancient to modern civilization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bosco |first1=Giovanni Melchor |title=A Compendium of Italian History from the Fall of the Roman Empire, Tr. and Completed to the Present Time by J.D.

He was also a skilled biographer. He wrote two known biographies; one on his mentor [[Joseph Cafasso]]<ref>Under [[Joseph Cafasso|Cafasso]], [[John Bosco|Bosco]] himself would later become a priest when he started this work. It has since spread worldwide through the religious congregation that he founded: the Salesians of Don Bosco. He has also been declared a saint and their [[Castelnuovo Don Bosco|hometown]] has been renamed in his honor.</ref> and one about his student [[Dominic Savio]], which would later be instrumental in his canonization.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bosco |first1=Giovanni Melchor |title=The Life of St. Dominic Savio |url=http://olrl.org/books/savio.shtml |publisher=Our Lady of the Rosary Libary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202163418/http://olrl.org/books/savio.shtml |accessdate=15 April 2020|archive-date=2 December 2006 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Death and legacy==\nBosco died on 31 January 1888. His funeral was attended by thousands. Soon after there was popular demand to have him canonized.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The Archdiocese of Turin investigated and witnesses were called to determine if Bosco was worthy to be declared a saint. The Salesians, Daughters and Cooperators gave supportive testimonies. But many remembered Bosco's controversies in the 1870s with Archbishop Gastaldi and some others high in the Church hierarchy thought him a loose cannon and a \"wheeler-dealer\". In the [[canonization]] process, testimony was heard about how he went around Gastaldi to get some of his men ordained and about their lack of academic preparation and ecclesiastical decorum. [[Political cartoon]]s from the 1860s and later showed him shaking money from the pockets of old ladies or going off to America for the same purpose. These cartoons were not forgotten. Opponents of Bosco, including some [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], were in a position to block his canonization. \n\n[[Pope Pius XI]] had known Bosco and pushed the cause forward. Pius XI [[Beatification|beatified]] Bosco on June 2, 1929 and [[canonized]] him on Easter Sunday (April 1) of 1934, when he was given the title of \"Father and Teacher of Youth\".<ref name=\"catholic\">{{cite web|last=Matz|first=Terry|title=St. John Bosco|work=Catholic Online|year=2000|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=63|access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile Bosco had been popularly known as the patron saint of illusionists, on 30 January 2002, [[Silvio Mantelli]] petitioned [[Pope John Paul II]] to formally declare Bosco the patron of stage [[illusionist|magicians]].<ref name=\"magic\">{{cite web|title=Magicians Want Don Bosco Declared Their Patron|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-3537?l=english|access-date=7 August 2011|date=2002-01-29|publisher=Zenit News Agency|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807061747/http://www.zenit.org/article-3537?l=english|archive-date = 7 August 2011}}</ref> Catholic stage magicians who practice [[gospel magic]] venerate Bosco by offering free magic shows to underprivileged children on his feast day.<ref name=\"magic\" />\n\nBosco's work was carried on by his early pupil, collaborator and companion, [[Michael Rua]], who was appointed rector major of the Salesian Society by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1888.\n\n=== Pop Culture ===\n\nBosco was the subject of the 1935 biopic ''[[Don Bosco (1935 film)|Don Bosco]]'' directed by [[Goffredo Alessandrini]]. He was played by the actor [[Gian Paolo Rosmino]].\n\nBosco was also the subject of a 2004 Italian movie, [[Saint John Bosco: Mission to Love]].\n\nThe Italian church St. Giovanni Bosco is named after Bosco. The church is located in [[Montreal]], Canada, in the borough of Ville-Emard. St. Giovanni Bosco is the patron saint of the capital of Brazil, [[Bras\u00edlia]], which he supposedly foresaw in a prophecy concerning an extraordinary new civilization which would flourish in Central Brazil.\n\nA [[Don Bosco, Buenos Aires|borough]] in [[Quilmes]], [[Argentina]], is also named after him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n;General\n*{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Alan|title=Butler's lives of the saints.|year=1999|publisher=Burns & Oates|location=Tunbridge Wells|isbn=0860122522|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rFGTRItJVi0C&lpg=PA88&dq=%22John%20Bosco%22&pg=PA88#v=onepage|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Saints|year=2004|publisher=Oxford Univ.

It was the successor to the [[Yuan dynasty]] and the predecessor of the short-lived [[Shun dynasty]], which was in turn succeeded by the [[Qing dynasty]]. At its height, the Ming dynasty had a population of 160 million people,<ref name=\"fairbank 128\">Fairbank, 128.</ref> while some assert the population could actually have been as large as 200&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 197\"/>\n\nMing rule saw the construction of a vast [[Naval history of China|navy]] and a [[standing army]] of 1,000,000 troops.<ref name=\"ebrey east asia 271\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 271.</ref> Although private maritime trade and official tribute missions from China took place in previous dynasties, the size of the tributary fleet under the [[Muslim]] [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] admiral [[Zheng He]] in the 15th century surpassed all others in grandeur. There were enormous projects of construction, including the restoration of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]], the restoration of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] as it is seen today, and the establishment of the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing during the first quarter of the 15th century.  The Ming dynasty is, for many reasons, generally known as a period of stable effective government.  It had long seen the most secure and unchallenged ruling house that China had known up until that time.  Its institutions were generally preserved by the following Qing dynasty.

The impetus for restoring the canal was to solve the perennial problem of shipping grain north to Beijing. Shipping the annual 4,000,000 ''shi'' (one shi is equal to 107 liters) was made difficult with an inefficient system of shipping grain through the [[East China Sea]] or by several different inland canals that necessitated the transferring of grain onto several different barge types in the process, including shallow and deep-water barges.<ref>Brook, 46\u201347.</ref> William Atwell quotes Ming dynasty sources that state the amount of collected tax grain was actually 30 million ''shi'' (93&nbsp;million [[bushel]]s),<ref name=\"atwell 2002 86\">Atwell (2002), 86.</ref> much larger than what Brook notes.

Yet the scholar-officials were not the only political group that the Yongle Emperor had to cooperate with and appease.

The Chinese had [[Foreign relations of Imperial China|sent diplomatic missions]] over land and west since the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC\u2013220 AD) and had been engaged in [[Economy of the Song dynasty|private overseas trade]] leading all the way to [[Chinese exploration|East Africa for centuries]]\u2014culminating in the Song and Yuan dynasties\u2014but no government-sponsored tributary mission of this grandeur size had ever been assembled before. To service seven different tributary missions abroad, the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419, which included the large [[Chinese treasure ship]]s that measured 112&nbsp;m (370&nbsp;ft) to 134&nbsp;m (440&nbsp;ft) in length and 45&nbsp;m (150&nbsp;ft) to 54&nbsp;m (180&nbsp;ft) in width.<ref name=\"fairbank 137\">Fairbank, 137.</ref> The first voyage from 1405 to 1407 contained 317 vessels with a staff of 70 eunuchs, 180 medical personnel, 5 astrologers, and 300 military officers commanding a total estimated force of 26,800 men.<ref>Fairbank, 137\u2013138.</ref>\n\nThe enormous tributary missions were discontinued after the death of Zheng He, yet his death was only one of many culminating factors which brought the missions to an end.

In the battle that ensued, his force of 50,000 troops were decimated by Esen's army.

The questions were cultural, political, and economic. The historian [[Arthur Waldron]] declares that the early rulers faced the question \"Was the Ming to be essentially a Chinese version of the Yuan, or was it to be something new?\" The Tang dynasty provided an example of cosmopolitan and culturally flexible rule, but the Song dynasty, which never controlled key areas of Central Asia, offered an example that was culturally Han Chinese. The dynasty was basically reshaped by it successes and frustrations in dealing with the two sides of the outside world.{{sfnb|Waldron|1990| pp= 72\u201373}}\n\n===Universal rulership===\nThe early Ming emperors from the Hongwu Emperor to the [[Zhengde Emperor]] continued Yuan practices such as hereditary military institutions, demanding Korean and Muslim concubines and eunuchs, having Mongols serve in the Ming military, patronizing Tibetan Buddhism, with the early Ming Emperors seeking to project themselves as \"universal rulers\" to various peoples such as Central Asian Muslims, Tibetans, and Mongols.<ref>{{cite book|title=Culture, Courtiers and Competition: The Ming Court (1368\u20131644)|chapter=Eight The Ming Court and the Legacy of the Yuan Mongols|last=Robinson|first=David M.|url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/documents/readings/robinson_culture_courtiers_ch.8.pdf|publisher=Harvard University Asia Center|pages=365\u2013411|access-date=11 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611124056/http://www.history.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/documents/readings/robinson_culture_courtiers_ch.8.pdf|archive-date=11 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Slobodnik   |first=Martin |date= 2004 |title=The Relations Between The Chinese Ming Dynasty and the Tibetan Ruling House Of Phag-Mo-Gru in the Years 1368\u20131434: Political And Religious Aspects |url=https://www.sav.sk/journals/uploads/040214374_Slobodn%C3%ADk.pdf |journal=ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES |publisher= |volume= |issue=13 |page=166 |doi= |access-date=11 July 2016}}</ref> The Yongle Emperor cited [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] as a model for being familiar with both China and the steppe people.<ref>{{cite|last=Robinson|first=David M.|title=Delimiting the Realm under the Ming Dynasty|url=http://mongol.huji.ac.il/sites/default/files/Robinson_Delimiting%20the%20Realm%20under%20the%20Ming%20Dynasty.pdf|page=22|access-date=11 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181742/http://mongol.huji.ac.il/sites/default/files/Robinson_Delimiting%20the%20Realm%20under%20the%20Ming%20Dynasty.pdf|archive-date=29 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The legacy of the Mongol Khan's as supporters of both Eastern and western religions, ruler ship over the plains and steppes, was claimed by the Ming such as patronizing Islam and using the Chinese, Persian, and Mongol languages in edicts on Islam which were also used by the Yuan to show the Ming were the heirs to this Yuan legacy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Garnaut  |first1=Anthony|last2= |first2= |date=March 2006 |title=The Islamic Heritage in China: A General Survey |url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/islamic-heritage-china |journal=China Heritage Newsletter |volume= |issue=5  |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n===Illegal trade, piracy, and war with Japan===\n\n[[File:Wokou.jpg|thumb|16th century [[Wokou|Japanese]] pirate raids.]]\n{{further|Jiajing wokou raids}}\nIn 1479, the vice president of the Ministry of War burned the court records documenting Zheng He's voyages; it was one of many events signalling China's shift to an inward foreign policy.<ref name=\"fairbank 138\">Fairbank, 138.</ref> Shipbuilding laws were implemented that restricted vessels to a small size; the concurrent decline of the Ming navy allowed the growth of piracy along China's coasts.<ref name=\"fairbank 139\"/> Japanese pirates\u2014or [[wokou]]\u2014began staging raids on Chinese ships and coastal communities, although much of the acts of piracy were carried out by native Chinese.<ref name=\"fairbank 139\"/>\n\nInstead of mounting a counterattack, Ming authorities chose to shut down coastal facilities and starve the pirates out; all foreign trade was to be conducted by the state under the guise of formal tribute missions.<ref name=\"fairbank 139\"/> These were known as the [[hai jin]] laws, a strict ban on private maritime activity until its formal abolishment in 1567.<ref name=\"fairbank 138\"/> In this period government-managed overseas trade with [[Japan]] was carried out exclusively at the seaport of [[Ningbo]], trade with the [[Philippines]] exclusively at [[Fuzhou]], and trade with [[Indonesia]] exclusively at [[Guangzhou]].<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 211\"/> Even then the Japanese were only allowed into port once every ten years and were allowed to bring a maximum of three hundred men on two ships; these laws encouraged many Chinese merchants to engage in widespread illegal trade and smuggling.<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 211\"/>\n\nThe low point in relations between Ming China and Japan occurred during the rule of the great Japanese warlord [[Hideyoshi]], who in 1592 announced he was going to conquer China.

In 1639, the new [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, causing a halt of yet another source of silver coming into China.

During the Imjin War he offered to lead his tribes in support of the Ming army. This offer was declined, but he was granted honorific Ming titles for his gesture.<ref name=\"spence 27\">Spence, 27.</ref> Recognizing the weakness in the Ming authority north of their border, he took control over all of the other unrelated tribes surrounding his homeland.<ref name=\"spence 27\"/> In 1610 he broke relations with the Ming court; in 1618 he demanded the Ming pay tribute to him to redress the ''seven grievances'' which he documented and sent to the Ming court. This was, in a very real sense, a declaration of war as the Ming were not about to pay money to the Manchu.\n\nUnder the brilliant commander [[Yuan Chonghuan]] (1584\u20131630), the Ming were able to repeatedly fight off the Manchus, notably in 1626 at the [[Battle of Ningyuan]] and in 1628. Under Yuan's command the Ming had securely fortified the [[Shanhai Pass]], thus blocking the Manchus from crossing the pass to attack the [[Liaodong Peninsula]]. Using European firearms acquired from his cook, he was able to stave off Nurhaci's advances along the [[Liao River]].<ref name=\"spence 24\"/> Although he was named field marshal of all the northeastern forces in 1628, he was executed in 1630 on trumped-up charges of colluding with the Manchus as they staged their raids.<ref name=\"spence 24 25\">Spence, 24\u201325.</ref> Succeeding generals proved unable to eliminate the Manchu threat.\n\nUnable to attack the heart of Ming directly, the Manchu instead bided their time, developing their own artillery and gathering allies. They were able to enlist Ming government officials and generals as their strategic advisors. A large part of the Ming Army deserted to the Manchu banner. In 1632, they had conquered much of [[Inner Mongolia]],<ref name=\"spence 24\"/> resulting in a large scale recruitment of Mongol troops under the [[Eight Banners|Manchu banner]] and the securing of an additional route into the Ming heartland.\n\nHan defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China.  He had 3 cats named Ron, Don, and Kon. Pretty cool right? Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often [[Heqin#Qing dynasty|given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage]] while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General [[Li Yongfang]] after he surrendered [[Fushun]] in [[Liaoning]] to the Manchu in 1618 and a mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and [[Hongtaiji]] in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&pg=PA148&dq=To+win+the+support+and+cooperation+of+Ming+generals+in+Liaodong,+Nurhaci+gave+them+Aisin+Gioro+women+as+wives.+In+1618,+before+he+attacked+Fushun+city,+he+promised+the+Ming+general+defending+the+city+a+woman+from+the+Aisin+Gioro+clan&hl=en&ei=O-ChToi7Jsn20gHW4ayvCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=To%20win%20the%20support%20and%20cooperation%20of%20Ming%20generals%20in%20Liaodong%2C%20Nurhaci%20gave%20them%20Aisin%20Gioro%20women%20as%20wives.%20In%201618%2C%20before%20he%20attacked%20Fushun%20city%2C%20he%20promised%20the%20Ming%20general%20defending%20the%20city%20a%20woman%20from%20the%20Aisin%20Gioro%20clan&f=false ed.

It was the successor to the [[Yuan dynasty]] and the predecessor of the short-lived [[Shun dynasty]], which was in turn succeeded by the [[Qing dynasty]]. At its height, the Ming dynasty had a population of 160 million people,<ref name=\"fairbank 128\">Fairbank, 128.</ref> while some assert the population could actually have been as large as 200&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 197\"/>\n\nMing rule saw the construction of a vast [[Naval history of China|navy]] and a [[standing army]] of 1,000,000 troops.<ref name=\"ebrey east asia 271\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 271.</ref> Although private maritime trade and official tribute missions from China took place in previous dynasties, the size of the tributary fleet under the [[Muslim]] [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] admiral [[Zheng He]] in the 15th century surpassed all others in grandeur. There were enormous projects of construction, including the restoration of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]], the restoration of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] as it is seen today, and the establishment of the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing during the first quarter of the 15th century.  The Ming dynasty is, for many reasons, generally known as a period of stable effective government.  It had long seen the most secure and unchallenged ruling house that China had known up until that time.  Its institutions were generally preserved by the following Qing dynasty.  The civil service dominated government to an unprecedented degree at this time.<ref>Denis C Twitchett, Frederick W.

These provinces were divided along traditional and to a degree also natural lines.  These include [[Zhejiang]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Huguang Province|Huguang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Shandong]], [[Henan]], [[Shanxi]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Sichuan]], [[Yunnan]] and [[Guizhou]].<ref>Denis C Twitchett, Frederick W.

Alongside institutionalized ethnic discrimination against [[Han Chinese]] that stirred resentment and rebellion, other explanations for the Yuan's demise included overtaxing areas hard-hit by crop failure, [[inflation]], and massive flooding of the [[Yellow River]] as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects.<ref name=\"gascoigne 150\"/> Consequently, agriculture and the economy were in shambles and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dikes of the Yellow River.<ref name=\"gascoigne 150\">Gascoigne, 150.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinese Cannon.JPG|thumb|left|A [[cannon]] from the ''[[Huolongjing]]'', compiled by [[Jiao Yu]] and [[Liu Bowen]] before the latter's death in 1375.]]\nA number of Han Chinese groups revolted, including the [[Red Turban Rebellion|Red Turbans]] in 1351. The Red Turbans were affiliated with the [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] secret society of the [[White Lotus]], which propagated [[Manichaeism|Manichean]] beliefs in the struggle of good against evil and worship of the [[Maitreya|Maitreya Buddha]].<ref name=\"ebrey east asia 270\">Ebrey, et al., ''East Asia'', 270.</ref> Zhu Yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352, but soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander.<ref>Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 190\u2013191.</ref><ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 190\">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 190</ref> In 1356 Zhu's rebel force captured the city of [[Nanjing]],<ref name=\"gascoigne 151\">Gascoigne 151.</ref> which he would later establish as the capital of the Ming dynasty. Zhu enlisted the aid of many able advisors, including the artillery specialists [[Jiao Yu]] and [[Liu Bowen]].\n\nZhu cemented his power in the south by eliminating his arch rival and rebel leader [[Chen Youliang]] in the [[Battle of Lake Poyang]] in 1363. This battle was\u2014in terms of personnel\u2014one of the [[Largest naval battle in history|largest naval battles in history]]. After the dynastic head of the Red Turbans suspiciously died in 1367 while hosted as a guest of Zhu, the latter made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital in 1368.<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 191\">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 191.</ref> The last Yuan emperor fled north into Mongolia and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]] (present-day [[Beijing]]) to the ground.<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 191\"/>\n\nInstead of the traditional way of naming a dynasty after the first ruler's home district, Zhu Yuanzhang's choice of 'Ming' or 'Brilliant' for his dynasty followed a Mongol precedent of an uplifting title.<ref name=\"gascoigne 151\"/> Zhu Yuanzhang also took '[[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu]]', or 'Vastly Martial' as his [[Chinese era name|reign title]].

This included a building of schools at all levels and an increased study of the classics as well as books on morality.  Also included was the distribution of Neo-Confucian ritual manuals and a new civil service examination system for recruitment into the bureaucracy.<ref>Sarah Shneewind, Community Schools and the State in Ming China (Stanford University Press, 2006) pg. 2</ref>\n\n===Reign of the Hongwu Emperor===\n[[File:A Seated Portrait of Ming Emperor Taizu.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the [[Hongwu Emperor]] (r. 1368\u20131398)]]\nThe Hongwu Emperor immediately set to rebuilding state infrastructure.

The goal was to have soldiers become self-reliant farmers in order to sustain themselves while not fighting or training.<ref name=\"fairbank 129\">Fairbank, 129.</ref> This system was also similar to the Yuan dynasty military organization of a hereditary caste of soldiers and a hereditary nobility of commanders.<ref name=\"fairbank 129\"/> The system of the self-sufficient agricultural soldier, however, was largely a farce; infrequent rations and awards were not enough to sustain the troops, and many deserted their ranks if they weren't located in the heavily supplied frontier.<ref name=\"fairbank 134\"/>\n\nAlthough a Confucian, the Hongwu Emperor had a deep distrust for the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] of the [[Gentry (China)|gentry class]] and was not afraid to have them beaten in court for offenses.<ref name=\"ebrey 191 193\">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 191\u2013192.</ref> In favor of Confucian learning and the civil service, the emperor ordered every [[County magistrate (China)|county magistrate]] to open a Confucian school in 1369\u2014following the tradition of a nationwide school system first established by [[Emperor Ping of Han]] (9 BC\u20135 AD).<ref>Brook, xix.</ref><ref>Yuan, 193.</ref> However, he halted the [[Imperial examinations|civil service examinations]] in 1373 after complaining that the 120 scholar-officials who obtained a ''jinshi'' degree were incompetent ministers.<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 192\">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 192.</ref><ref name=\"hucker 13\">Hucker, 13.</ref> After the examinations were reinstated in 1384,<ref name=\"hucker 13\"/> he had the chief examiner executed after it was discovered that he allowed only candidates from the south to be granted ''jinshi'' degrees.<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 192\"/> In 1380, the Hongwu Emperor had the Chancellor [[Hu Weiyong]] executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him; after that the emperor abolished the [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellery]] and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor.<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 192 193\">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 192</ref><ref>Fairbank, 130.</ref> With a growing amount of suspicion for his ministers and subjects, the Hongwu Emperor established the [[Jinyiwei]], a network of [[secret police]] drawn from his own palace guard.

The impetus for restoring the canal was to solve the perennial problem of shipping grain north to Beijing. Shipping the annual 4,000,000 ''shi'' (one shi is equal to 107 liters) was made difficult with an inefficient system of shipping grain through the [[East China Sea]] or by several different inland canals that necessitated the transferring of grain onto several different barge types in the process, including shallow and deep-water barges.<ref>Brook, 46\u201347.</ref> William Atwell quotes Ming dynasty sources that state the amount of collected tax grain was actually 30 million ''shi'' (93&nbsp;million [[bushel]]s),<ref name=\"atwell 2002 86\">Atwell (2002), 86.</ref> much larger than what Brook notes.

In 1639, the new [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, causing a halt of yet another source of silver coming into China. However, the greatest stunt to the flow of silver came from the Americas, while Japanese silver still came into China in limited amounts.<ref name=\"brook 208\">Brook, 208.</ref> Some scholars even assert that the price of silver rose in the 17th century due to a falling demand for goods, not declining silver stocks.<ref name=\"brook 289\">Brook, 289.</ref>\n\nThese events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces. People began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it, forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline.<ref name=\"spence 20\"/> In the 1630s, a string of one thousand copper coins was worth an ounce of silver; by 1640 this was reduced to the value of half an ounce; by 1643 it was worth roughly one-third of an ounce.<ref name=\"spence 20\"/> For peasants this was an economic disaster, since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and selling their crops with copper coins.<ref>Spence, 20\u201321.</ref>\n\n===Natural disasters===\n\nIn this early half of the 17th century, famines became common in northern China because of unusual dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season; these were effects of a larger ecological event now known as the [[Little Ice Age]].<ref name=\"spence 21\">Spence, 21.</ref> Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility.<ref name=\"spence 21\"/> The central government was starved of resources and could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities.

During the Imjin War he offered to lead his tribes in support of the Ming army.

This was, in a very real sense, a declaration of war as the Ming were not about to pay money to the Manchu.\n\nUnder the brilliant commander [[Yuan Chonghuan]] (1584\u20131630), the Ming were able to repeatedly fight off the Manchus, notably in 1626 at the [[Battle of Ningyuan]] and in 1628. Under Yuan's command the Ming had securely fortified the [[Shanhai Pass]], thus blocking the Manchus from crossing the pass to attack the [[Liaodong Peninsula]]. Using European firearms acquired from his cook, he was able to stave off Nurhaci's advances along the [[Liao River]].<ref name=\"spence 24\"/> Although he was named field marshal of all the northeastern forces in 1628, he was executed in 1630 on trumped-up charges of colluding with the Manchus as they staged their raids.<ref name=\"spence 24 25\">Spence, 24\u201325.</ref> Succeeding generals proved unable to eliminate the Manchu threat.\n\nUnable to attack the heart of Ming directly, the Manchu instead bided their time, developing their own artillery and gathering allies. They were able to enlist Ming government officials and generals as their strategic advisors. A large part of the Ming Army deserted to the Manchu banner. In 1632, they had conquered much of [[Inner Mongolia]],<ref name=\"spence 24\"/> resulting in a large scale recruitment of Mongol troops under the [[Eight Banners|Manchu banner]] and the securing of an additional route into the Ming heartland.\n\nHan defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China.  Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often [[Heqin#Qing dynasty|given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage]] while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General [[Li Yongfang]] after he surrendered [[Fushun]] in [[Liaoning]] to the Manchu in 1618 and a mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and [[Hongtaiji]] in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&pg=PA148&dq=To+win+the+support+and+cooperation+of+Ming+generals+in+Liaodong,+Nurhaci+gave+them+Aisin+Gioro+women+as+wives.+In+1618,+before+he+attacked+Fushun+city,+he+promised+the+Ming+general+defending+the+city+a+woman+from+the+Aisin+Gioro+clan&hl=en&ei=O-ChToi7Jsn20gHW4ayvCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=To%20win%20the%20support%20and%20cooperation%20of%20Ming%20generals%20in%20Liaodong%2C%20Nurhaci%20gave%20them%20Aisin%20Gioro%20women%20as%20wives.%20In%201618%2C%20before%20he%20attacked%20Fushun%20city%2C%20he%20promised%20the%20Ming%20general%20defending%20the%20city%20a%20woman%20from%20the%20Aisin%20Gioro%20clan&f=false ed.

Nanjing, Fujian, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Yunnan were all strongholds of Ming resistance. However, there were several pretenders for the Ming throne, and their forces were divided.

At a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] [[Altamont_Free_Concert|concert]] in [[Altamont, California]], a fan was stabbed to death by [[Hells Angels]], a biker gang that had been hired to provide security for the event. In retrospect, some commentators have concluded that the violence signaled the end of the \"[[hippie]]\" movement, which espoused an ethos of [[free love]] and peace. Even more famous than the Altamont concert was the [[Woodstock festival]], which consisted of dozens of the most famous performers in the world at the time, playing together in an atmosphere of peace with nature and love, with many thousands of concert goers; it is still one of the largest concerts in the history of the world.  One of those who performed was [[Ravi Shankar]], his presence reflecting a growing interest in Indian and other Eastern music; Shankar later said that the 1960s \"got India wrong\".<ref name=Mahony>{{cite news|last=O'Mahony|first=John|title=Ravi Shankar bids Europe adieu|work=The Taipei Times |location=UK |date=8 June 2008|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2008/06/08/2003414118|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe 1967 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' generated the same-named 1968 [[Hair (Original Broadway Cast Recording)|album]], whose cuts include \"[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Aquarius]]\" and \"[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Let The Sunshine In]]\", \"[[Hair (Hair song)|Hair]]\", \"[[Good Morning Starshine]]\", \"[[Easy to Be Hard]]\" (covered, chronologically and respectively, by [[The 5th Dimension]] at number 1, [[The Cowsills]] at number 2, [[Oliver (singer)|Oliver]] at number 3, [[Three Dog Night]] at number 4, on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1969), and others, and a London Cast album released in April 1969.\n\nThe [[Isle of Wight Festival]] saw the return of [[Bob Dylan]] to live music after his motorbike accident in 1966.\n\nUS and UK pop music remained popular worldwide, with few European acts making the charts outside their home countries; exceptions included [[Jane Birkin]] & [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Shocking Blue]], [[Georges Moustaki]] and [[Christian Anders]].<ref>[http://www.worldcharts.co.uk/archives/european/euro65.htm World Charts]. Accessed 19 November 2014</ref>\n\n[[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Space Oddity]]\" became a huge hit in this year, being released at the time that American astronauts first landed on the moon. The song, the story of an astronaut named Major Tom who goes into space and is entranced by the beauty of seeing Earth from such a great distance and consequently lets himself float off into space, never again to return, was chosen by the [[BBC]] as the theme song for the television coverage of the moon landing. The remainder of the album, ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Man of Words/Man of Music]]'', was too eccentric for mainstream acceptance, though it established a devoted fanbase for Bowie, who would go on to become one of the most popular musicians in the world.\n\n[[King Crimson]]'s ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' is a pioneering album in the development of [[progressive rock]]. The album drew upon influences like [[Procol Harum]], [[The Moody Blues]] and [[The Nice]] to form a sound melding [[rock and roll]] with [[european classical music|classical]] influences in long pieces of music.  Similar albums by The Moody Blues, Procol Harum and The Nice, as well as [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Pink Floyd]] were also released this year, expanding the range of prog rock and developing it into a full-fledged genre.\n\n[[The Stooges]]' eponymous debut, ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'', was also released this year to little critical or popular acceptance. The album, however, went on to become one of the most important recordings in the early development of [[punk rock]], as did ''[[Kick Out The Jams]]'' by Detroit protopunkers [[MC5]].\n\n[[Johnny Cash]]'s ''[[At San Quentin]]'' included his only Top Ten pop hit, \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\".  The album was a sequel to last year's ''[[At Folsom Prison]]''. Also in [[country music]], [[Merle Haggard]]'s ''[[Same Train, Different Time]]'', a tribute to [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], was enormously popular and influenced the development of the [[Bakersfield sound]] into [[outlaw country]] within a few years.\n\n[[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] cement their success from the previous year. Having had a single US number 11 hit in 1968 with \"[[Susie Q (song)|Suzie Q]]\", they release not only their second, but also their third and fourth proper studio album in 1969, as well as drawing a total of four top 3 hits from these three albums. Starting with ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]'', including the US number 2 hit \"[[Proud Mary]]\", and continuing with ''[[Green River (album)|Green River]]'' and finally ''[[Willy and the Poor Boys]]'', which, during the year, transformed them from an up-and-coming underground act to bona fide rockstars. During 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival had number 2 hits in the US with \"Proud Mary\", \"[[Green River (song)|Green River]]\" and \"[[Bad Moon Rising (song)|Bad Moon Rising]]\", and also have a number 3 hit with \"[[Down on the Corner]]\"/\"[[Fortunate Son (song)|Fortunate Son]]\".\n\n[[Gilberto Gil]] and [[Caetano Veloso]] released enormously popular albums in [[Brazil]], ''[[Gilberto Gil (1969 album)|Gilberto Gil]]'' and ''[[Caetano Veloso (1969 album)|Caetano Veloso]]'', respectively.  The pair's fusion of [[bossa nova]], [[samba (music)|samba]] and other native Brazilian folk influences, melded with politically and socially aware lyrics, kickstarted what came to be known as [[Tropicalia]].  Both musicians moved to London after a period of imprisonment for anti-government activities in Brazil.\n\n[[Family (band)|Family]] released their second album, ''Family Entertainment'', in their native Britain. It is their first top 10 album in the United Kingdom, hitting number six. \"[[The Weaver's Answer]]\", which opens the record, becomes their most popular song in their concert performances. By the end of the year, however, they lose and replace two members, and their first attempt to break through commercially in the United States backfires miserably.\n\n[[Elvis Presley]] returned to live performances at the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]; breaking all attendance records in his 57-concert run. He also enjoyed great success with his songs \"[[In the Ghetto]]\" and \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\".\n\nThe [[Wendy Carlos]] album ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'' was one of the first classical albums to sell 500,000 copies, and helped bring classical music into the popular sphere, as did [[Mason Williams]]' \"[[Classical Gas]]\", played on classical guitar, in addition to being accompanied by one of the first successful music videos.<ref>[http://www.classicalgas.com/gasvideo.html Mason Williams, ''The Classical Gas Years''].

At a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] [[Altamont_Free_Concert|concert]] in [[Altamont, California]], a fan was stabbed to death by [[Hells Angels]], a biker gang that had been hired to provide security for the event. In retrospect, some commentators have concluded that the violence signaled the end of the \"[[hippie]]\" movement, which espoused an ethos of [[free love]] and peace. Even more famous than the Altamont concert was the [[Woodstock festival]], which consisted of dozens of the most famous performers in the world at the time, playing together in an atmosphere of peace with nature and love, with many thousands of concert goers; it is still one of the largest concerts in the history of the world.  One of those who performed was [[Ravi Shankar]], his presence reflecting a growing interest in Indian and other Eastern music; Shankar later said that the 1960s \"got India wrong\".<ref name=Mahony>{{cite news|last=O'Mahony|first=John|title=Ravi Shankar bids Europe adieu|work=The Taipei Times |location=UK |date=8 June 2008|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2008/06/08/2003414118|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe 1967 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' generated the same-named 1968 [[Hair (Original Broadway Cast Recording)|album]], whose cuts include \"[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Aquarius]]\" and \"[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Let The Sunshine In]]\", \"[[Hair (Hair song)|Hair]]\", \"[[Good Morning Starshine]]\", \"[[Easy to Be Hard]]\" (covered, chronologically and respectively, by [[The 5th Dimension]] at number 1, [[The Cowsills]] at number 2, [[Oliver (singer)|Oliver]] at number 3, [[Three Dog Night]] at number 4, on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1969), and others, and a London Cast album released in April 1969.\n\nThe [[Isle of Wight Festival]] saw the return of [[Bob Dylan]] to live music after his motorbike accident in 1966.\n\nUS and UK pop music remained popular worldwide, with few European acts making the charts outside their home countries; exceptions included [[Jane Birkin]] & [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Shocking Blue]], [[Georges Moustaki]] and [[Christian Anders]].<ref>[http://www.worldcharts.co.uk/archives/european/euro65.htm World Charts]. Accessed 19 November 2014</ref>\n\n[[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Space Oddity]]\" became a huge hit in this year, being released at the time that American astronauts first landed on the moon. The song, the story of an astronaut named Major Tom who goes into space and is entranced by the beauty of seeing Earth from such a great distance and consequently lets himself float off into space, never again to return, was chosen by the [[BBC]] as the theme song for the television coverage of the moon landing. The remainder of the album, ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Man of Words/Man of Music]]'', was too eccentric for mainstream acceptance, though it established a devoted fanbase for Bowie, who would go on to become one of the most popular musicians in the world.\n\n[[King Crimson]]'s ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' is a pioneering album in the development of [[progressive rock]]. The album drew upon influences like [[Procol Harum]], [[The Moody Blues]] and [[The Nice]] to form a sound melding [[rock and roll]] with [[european classical music|classical]] influences in long pieces of music.  Similar albums by The Moody Blues, Procol Harum and The Nice, as well as [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Pink Floyd]] were also released this year, expanding the range of prog rock and developing it into a full-fledged genre.\n\n[[The Stooges]]' eponymous debut, ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'', was also released this year to little critical or popular acceptance. The album, however, went on to become one of the most important recordings in the early development of [[punk rock]], as did ''[[Kick Out The Jams]]'' by Detroit protopunkers [[MC5]].\n\n[[Johnny Cash]]'s ''[[At San Quentin]]'' included his only Top Ten pop hit, \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\".  The album was a sequel to last year's ''[[At Folsom Prison]]''. Also in [[country music]], [[Merle Haggard]]'s ''[[Same Train, Different Time]]'', a tribute to [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], was enormously popular and influenced the development of the [[Bakersfield sound]] into [[outlaw country]] within a few years.\n\n[[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] cement their success from the previous year.

The reason for this sudden enrollment drop in DCPS is that the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 separated DC Public Charter Schools (DCPCS) from District of Columbia Public Schools.\n\nThe District of Columbia passed charter school legislation in 1996, which went into effect in September 1999.  The legislation gave the District the power to grant charters for 15 years.  Although this is longer than the traditional 3\u20135 year term observed in 31 other states, a required review takes place every 5 years. 4.4% of public school students enrolled in a charter school for the 1999 academic school year; the 28 schools had a total enrollment of approx. 3,000 students. After legislation was enacted in 2007, chartering authority was placed under the D.C. Public Charter School Board and disaffiliated from DCPS. The governance of DCPS was also restructured, and the district was placed under the [[Mayoral control of schools|control of the Mayor]]. In 2010 about 38% of Washington, D.C. public school students attended 60 [[charter schools]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Michael | last=Birnbaum | title=Taking baby steps towards charter schools | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042704768.html| work= | publisher=Washington Pose | location=Washington, DC | pages= 18 in Casual Living | date=29 April 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> There are 52 public charter schools in the District, with 93 campuses and 30,000 students. The total number of public charter schools has been reduced from 60 schools on 96 campuses in 2008\u201309 to 53 schools on 98 campuses as of the 2011\u201312 school year. However, the addition of grades to the charter schools are still increasing enrollment and decreasing from DCPS\u2019 numbers.\n\n==Students==\n\n===Health===\nIn 2009, 43% of all DCPS public school students were overweight or obese. This was one of the highest rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Tim | last=Craig | title=D.C.

This constituted a large drop from the freshman graduation rate of 68.4% in 2002 and 68.8% as recently as 2005. In just the 2008\u201309 school year alone, 1,075 black students dropped out of high school. This figure raises concern since there were 1,246 students that dropped out of DCPS schools that year.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=Public School Graduates and Dropouts From the Common Core of Data: School Year 2008\u201309 | url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011312.pdf | work= National Center for Education Statistics| publisher=Institute of Education Sciences, Department of Education| location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date=2008\u20132009| id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nHowever, these numbers are not meant to be misleading; the 62.8% freshman graduation rate of black students in 2008 was above the state average.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Theodore Roosevelt High School, 13th St. in upper NW, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Roosevelt Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in [[Petworth, Washington, D.C.|Petworth]].]]\nWithin DCPS, schools are classified as either a \"neighborhood school\" or a \"destination school.\" Neighborhood schools are elementary or secondary schools assigned to students based on his or her address. Destination schools are feeder-schools for elementary or secondary institutions from a school a student is already attending. Since the fall of 2009, students may choose a destination school, regardless of their neighborhood location. Locations of all of the schools and the neighborhood divides can be found on the DCPS website.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools--School Locator | url=http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/Learn+About+Schools/Find+Your+Assigned+Schools | work= | publisher=The Government of the District of Columbia | location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date= | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nFor the school year ending in spring 2007, the DCPS was governed by the [[District of Columbia State Board of Education|D.C. Board of Education]], with eleven members, including two students who had the right to debate but not to vote. Five members were elected and four were appointed by the Mayor. The Board established DCPS policies and employed a superintendent to serve as chief executive officer of the school district, responsible for day-to-day operations. Four Board members represented specific geographical boundaries and the Board President was elected at large. One condition of the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 was the creation of DCPS as a separate cabinet-level agency from the D.C. Board of Education. This moved DCPS within the executive branch of the District of Columbia government\u2014specifically, under Mayoral control. Currently, this means that DCPS is subordinate to District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] proposed putting the public schools under the direct control of the Mayor's Office upon taking office in January 2007. However, this reform to District of Columbia Public Schools was encouraged by his predecessor and constituents at large. It also placed all of the District of Columbia public charter schools under the care of a new board\u2014District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (PCSB). Although these schools were previously a part of DCPS, they are now considered to be a separate district controlled by the D.C. Public Charter School Board (PCSB).\n\nThe D.C. Council passed the Mayor's proposal into law but since the change amended the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|Home Rule Act]], the change needed to gain Federal approval before taking effect.  D.C. Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] introduced H.R. 2080, a bill to amend the D.C. Home Rule Charter Act to provide for the Mayor's proposal. H.R. 2080 was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] under an expedited procedure on May 8, 2007 by a voice vote. After three U.S. Senators ([[Ben Cardin]] of [[Maryland]], [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]], and [[Carl Levin]] of [[Michigan]]) initially placed \"holds\" on the bill to prevent its consideration in the [[United States Senate]], the Senate agreed to pass H.R. 2080 without amendment on May 22, 2007 by unanimous consent. On May 31, 2007, the bill was presented to the President and President Bush signed H.R. 2080 into law on June 1, 2007. After the standard Congressional review period expired on June 12, 2007, the Mayor's office had direct control of the Superintendent and the school budget.  On June 12, Mayor Fenty appointed [[Michelle Rhee]] the new Chancellor, replacing Superintendent [[Clifford B. Janey]].\n\n===D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003===\n{{Main|D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program}}\n\nIn January 2004, Congress passed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003. The law established a federally-funded private [[school voucher]] program known as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP). The OSP distributes vouchers to low-income families to cover private school tuition. Because there are more eligible applicants than available vouchers, they are distributed by lottery. In 2010, a [[randomized controlled trial]] conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students, finding that it raised graduation rates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Patrick|title=Evaluation of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program: Final Report|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20104018/pdf/20104018.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Education -- Institute of Education Sciences}}</ref> Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%.

Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007===\n\nThe Council of the District of Columbia enacted the DC Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007. This act established a DC public school agency based on authority given to the council in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The Department of Education that was established under the Mayor triggered several changes. The largest was already discussed\u2014DCPCS gained sole authority over chartering and charted schools, DCPS became subordinate to the Mayor's office. Secondly, many smaller authoritative changes took place. The first is that the State Education Office (SEO) became the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). The four subsections of the District were reaffirmed through location-based State Board of Education selectees. In addition, the smaller eight school election wards were reaffirmed. Finally, the Commission was established through this legislature. The \"Commission\" is the Interagency Collaboration and Services Integration Commission, which includes the Mayor, Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, Chief Judge of the DC Superior Family Court, Superintendent of Education, Chancellor of DCPS, Chair of DCPCSB and fourteen others.\nAfter the 2007\u20132008 school year, about one-fifth of the teachers and one-third of the principals resigned, retired, or were terminated from DCPS. A very strong negative impact was initially experienced by DCPS due to the loss. A [[GAO-conducted study]]<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools: Important Steps Taken to Continue Reform Efforts, But Enhanced Planning Could Improve Implementation and Sustainability| url=http://www.gao.gov/highlights/d09619high.pdf | work= Report to Congressional Requesters| publisher= United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) | location=Washington, DC | pages= | date=June 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nrecommended that the Mayor direct DCPS to establish planning processes for strikes and look to performance reviews from central offices to strengthen accountability. These recommendations were followed and accountability has increased through academic and financial report generation.  Increased accountability made way for other small reforms. One example is the implementation of a requirement that students entering 9th grade are now required to sit down with a school counselor and construct a course-plan to reach graduation.\n\n==No Child Left Behind compliance==\n\nIn accordance with Section 1116, a provision of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB), entitled \"Academic Assessment and Local Education Agency and School Improvement\", the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) of the District of Columbia oversees compliance with [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Adequate+Yearly+Progress+(AYP) Adequate Yearly Progress] (AYP). A large portion of meeting AYP is based on standardized-tests performance; the District used the [[summative assessment]] called the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System (\"DC CAS\") through the 2013-2014 school year, after which it switched to tools from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers ([[PARCC]]) and the National Center and State Collaborative (NCSC).<ref>{{cite web|title=DC CAS|url=http://osse.dc.gov/service/dc-cas|website=Office of the State Superintendent of Education|publisher=Washington, DC|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How Students Are Assessed|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208040753/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessment Glossary|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218022539/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|archive-date=February 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMany schools are failing to meet AYP, even though DCPS educators offer support and tools to students to be academically successful.{{citation needed|reason=this statement needs a source to back it up and has a slanted tone.|date=March 2015}} DCPS has created an evaluation tool to assess schools by more than their standardized test scores.

According to school choice researcher Erin Dillon, \"In its winning application for federal Race to the Top funds, DCPS, for example, touted its three models for autonomous schools: The aptly named 'Autonomous Schools,' which are granted autonomy as a reward for high performance; 'Partnership Schools,' which are run by outside organizations that are granted autonomy in the hope of dramatically improving performance; and the 'D.C. Collaborative for Change,' or DC3, a joint effort of some of the District\u2019s highest- and lowest-performing schools that have been granted autonomy as a tool for innovating with curriculum and professional development. (Meanwhile, highly autonomous charter schools, a growing presence in the District of Columbia, educate almost 40 percent of the city\u2019s public school students.)\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Erin|title=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|url=http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|work=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|publisher=Education Sector|accessdate=27 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628123000/http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|archive-date=June 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===High schools===\n====Traditional high schools====\n[[File:Wilson-high-dc.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson High School]], Tenleytown]]\n[[File:Eastern Senior High School - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]], Kingman Park]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"175\" | School name || Students* ||class=\"unsortable\"| Low grade ||class=\"unsortable\"| High grade\n|-\n| [[Anacostia High School]] || 449 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Ballou High School]] || 930 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Coolidge Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Calvin Coolidge High School]] || 346 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] || 584 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]] || 818 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[H.D.

The reason for this sudden enrollment drop in DCPS is that the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 separated DC Public Charter Schools (DCPCS) from District of Columbia Public Schools.\n\nThe District of Columbia passed charter school legislation in 1996, which went into effect in September 1999.  The legislation gave the District the power to grant charters for 15 years.  Although this is longer than the traditional 3\u20135 year term observed in 31 other states, a required review takes place every 5 years. 4.4% of public school students enrolled in a charter school for the 1999 academic school year; the 28 schools had a total enrollment of approx. 3,000 students. After legislation was enacted in 2007, chartering authority was placed under the D.C. Public Charter School Board and disaffiliated from DCPS. The governance of DCPS was also restructured, and the district was placed under the [[Mayoral control of schools|control of the Mayor]]. In 2010 about 38% of Washington, D.C. public school students attended 60 [[charter schools]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Michael | last=Birnbaum | title=Taking baby steps towards charter schools | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042704768.html| work= | publisher=Washington Pose | location=Washington, DC | pages= 18 in Casual Living | date=29 April 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> There are 52 public charter schools in the District, with 93 campuses and 30,000 students. The total number of public charter schools has been reduced from 60 schools on 96 campuses in 2008\u201309 to 53 schools on 98 campuses as of the 2011\u201312 school year. However, the addition of grades to the charter schools are still increasing enrollment and decreasing from DCPS\u2019 numbers.\n\n==Students==\n\n===Health===\nIn 2009, 43% of all DCPS public school students were overweight or obese.

This constituted a large drop from the freshman graduation rate of 68.4% in 2002 and 68.8% as recently as 2005. In just the 2008\u201309 school year alone, 1,075 black students dropped out of high school.

Destination schools are feeder-schools for elementary or secondary institutions from a school a student is already attending. Since the fall of 2009, students may choose a destination school, regardless of their neighborhood location. Locations of all of the schools and the neighborhood divides can be found on the DCPS website.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools--School Locator | url=http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/Learn+About+Schools/Find+Your+Assigned+Schools | work= | publisher=The Government of the District of Columbia | location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date= | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nFor the school year ending in spring 2007, the DCPS was governed by the [[District of Columbia State Board of Education|D.C. Board of Education]], with eleven members, including two students who had the right to debate but not to vote. Five members were elected and four were appointed by the Mayor. The Board established DCPS policies and employed a superintendent to serve as chief executive officer of the school district, responsible for day-to-day operations. Four Board members represented specific geographical boundaries and the Board President was elected at large. One condition of the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 was the creation of DCPS as a separate cabinet-level agency from the D.C. Board of Education. This moved DCPS within the executive branch of the District of Columbia government\u2014specifically, under Mayoral control. Currently, this means that DCPS is subordinate to District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] proposed putting the public schools under the direct control of the Mayor's Office upon taking office in January 2007. However, this reform to District of Columbia Public Schools was encouraged by his predecessor and constituents at large. It also placed all of the District of Columbia public charter schools under the care of a new board\u2014District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (PCSB). Although these schools were previously a part of DCPS, they are now considered to be a separate district controlled by the D.C. Public Charter School Board (PCSB).\n\nThe D.C. Council passed the Mayor's proposal into law but since the change amended the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|Home Rule Act]], the change needed to gain Federal approval before taking effect.  D.C. Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] introduced H.R. 2080, a bill to amend the D.C. Home Rule Charter Act to provide for the Mayor's proposal. H.R. 2080 was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] under an expedited procedure on May 8, 2007 by a voice vote. After three U.S. Senators ([[Ben Cardin]] of [[Maryland]], [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]], and [[Carl Levin]] of [[Michigan]]) initially placed \"holds\" on the bill to prevent its consideration in the [[United States Senate]], the Senate agreed to pass H.R. 2080 without amendment on May 22, 2007 by unanimous consent. On May 31, 2007, the bill was presented to the President and President Bush signed H.R. 2080 into law on June 1, 2007. After the standard Congressional review period expired on June 12, 2007, the Mayor's office had direct control of the Superintendent and the school budget.  On June 12, Mayor Fenty appointed [[Michelle Rhee]] the new Chancellor, replacing Superintendent [[Clifford B. Janey]].\n\n===D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003===\n{{Main|D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program}}\n\nIn January 2004, Congress passed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003. The law established a federally-funded private [[school voucher]] program known as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP). The OSP distributes vouchers to low-income families to cover private school tuition. Because there are more eligible applicants than available vouchers, they are distributed by lottery. In 2010, a [[randomized controlled trial]] conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students, finding that it raised graduation rates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Patrick|title=Evaluation of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program: Final Report|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20104018/pdf/20104018.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Education -- Institute of Education Sciences}}</ref> Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%.

Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007===\n\nThe Council of the District of Columbia enacted the DC Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007. This act established a DC public school agency based on authority given to the council in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The Department of Education that was established under the Mayor triggered several changes. The largest was already discussed\u2014DCPCS gained sole authority over chartering and charted schools, DCPS became subordinate to the Mayor's office. Secondly, many smaller authoritative changes took place. The first is that the State Education Office (SEO) became the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). The four subsections of the District were reaffirmed through location-based State Board of Education selectees. In addition, the smaller eight school election wards were reaffirmed. Finally, the Commission was established through this legislature. The \"Commission\" is the Interagency Collaboration and Services Integration Commission, which includes the Mayor, Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, Chief Judge of the DC Superior Family Court, Superintendent of Education, Chancellor of DCPS, Chair of DCPCSB and fourteen others.\nAfter the 2007\u20132008 school year, about one-fifth of the teachers and one-third of the principals resigned, retired, or were terminated from DCPS. A very strong negative impact was initially experienced by DCPS due to the loss. A [[GAO-conducted study]]<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools: Important Steps Taken to Continue Reform Efforts, But Enhanced Planning Could Improve Implementation and Sustainability| url=http://www.gao.gov/highlights/d09619high.pdf | work= Report to Congressional Requesters| publisher= United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) | location=Washington, DC | pages= | date=June 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nrecommended that the Mayor direct DCPS to establish planning processes for strikes and look to performance reviews from central offices to strengthen accountability. These recommendations were followed and accountability has increased through academic and financial report generation.  Increased accountability made way for other small reforms. One example is the implementation of a requirement that students entering 9th grade are now required to sit down with a school counselor and construct a course-plan to reach graduation.\n\n==No Child Left Behind compliance==\n\nIn accordance with Section 1116, a provision of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB), entitled \"Academic Assessment and Local Education Agency and School Improvement\", the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) of the District of Columbia oversees compliance with [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Adequate+Yearly+Progress+(AYP) Adequate Yearly Progress] (AYP). A large portion of meeting AYP is based on standardized-tests performance; the District used the [[summative assessment]] called the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System (\"DC CAS\") through the 2013-2014 school year, after which it switched to tools from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers ([[PARCC]]) and the National Center and State Collaborative (NCSC).<ref>{{cite web|title=DC CAS|url=http://osse.dc.gov/service/dc-cas|website=Office of the State Superintendent of Education|publisher=Washington, DC|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How Students Are Assessed|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208040753/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessment Glossary|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218022539/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|archive-date=February 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMany schools are failing to meet AYP, even though DCPS educators offer support and tools to students to be academically successful.{{citation needed|reason=this statement needs a source to back it up and has a slanted tone.|date=March 2015}} DCPS has created an evaluation tool to assess schools by more than their standardized test scores.

However, those figures likely underreport DCPS's actual total per pupil expenditures. In 2012, the [[Cato Institute]]'s [[Andrew J.

According to school choice researcher Erin Dillon, \"In its winning application for federal Race to the Top funds, DCPS, for example, touted its three models for autonomous schools: The aptly named 'Autonomous Schools,' which are granted autonomy as a reward for high performance; 'Partnership Schools,' which are run by outside organizations that are granted autonomy in the hope of dramatically improving performance; and the 'D.C. Collaborative for Change,' or DC3, a joint effort of some of the District\u2019s highest- and lowest-performing schools that have been granted autonomy as a tool for innovating with curriculum and professional development. (Meanwhile, highly autonomous charter schools, a growing presence in the District of Columbia, educate almost 40 percent of the city\u2019s public school students.)\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Erin|title=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|url=http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|work=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|publisher=Education Sector|accessdate=27 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628123000/http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|archive-date=June 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===High schools===\n====Traditional high schools====\n[[File:Wilson-high-dc.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson High School]], Tenleytown]]\n[[File:Eastern Senior High School - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]], Kingman Park]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"175\" | School name || Students* ||class=\"unsortable\"| Low grade ||class=\"unsortable\"| High grade\n|-\n| [[Anacostia High School]] || 449 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Ballou High School]] || 930 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Coolidge Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Calvin Coolidge High School]] || 346 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] || 584 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]] || 818 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[H.D.

After establishing himself in the first-team, he went on to make over 200 appearances and scored 100 goals in all competitions after forming a striking partnership with [[Brian Clark (footballer, born 1943)|Brian Clark]].\n\nIn 1970, he joined [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], where he formed a noted forward partnership with [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Steve Heighway]] that helped the club to win two league titles, the [[UEFA Cup]] on two occasions, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]]. His partnership with Keegan was so effective that the two were described as telepathic. Mounting injuries eventually led to him securing his release from Liverpool to join [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] as [[Player-coach|player-manager]] in March 1978. He led the club to three promotions in four seasons, elevating them from the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] to the First Division in a feat that led former Liverpool manager [[Bill Shankly]] to describe him as the \"manager of the century\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I2qoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT189&lpg=PT189&dq=bill+shankly+toshack+manager+of+the+century&source=bl&ots=GghZMAn4IB&sig=xqSMDXqTkGtk24GvmA-QVrtU4-8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi81qr4jorZAhUBb1AKHVuRDoAQ6AEIXTAN#v=onepage&q=bill%20shankly%20toshack%20manager%20of%20the%20century&f=false |title=Wales: A Historical Companion |author=Terry Breverton |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |year=2009 |isbn=184868326X}}</ref> During his career, he scored over 150 goals in the Football League in more than 350 appearances and also represented [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at international level, winning 40 caps and scoring 13 goals.<ref name=ATZ>{{Cite web |url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player/johntoshack.html |title=Johk Toshack |website=Post War English & Scottish Football League A\u2013Z Player's Database |publisher=Neil Brown |accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe resigned from Swansea in 1984 after suffering relegation and embarked on a managerial career abroad, taking charge of [[Sporting CP]] in Portugal and later Spanish side [[Real Sociedad]], winning the [[Copa del Rey]] in 1987. Two years later, he was appointed manager of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and led them to a fifth consecutive [[La Liga]] title with a record total of points and goals scored. However, a disappointing start to the following season resulted in his dismissal in November 1990 and he returned to Real Sociedad. In 1994, he was appointed part-time manager of Wales alongside his job at Sociedad but resigned from the role after just 47 days having been in charge for one match, citing the strong support for former manager [[Terry Yorath]] among fans and a \"political war\" as reasons.\n\nAfter a spell in Turkey with [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]], he returned to Real Madrid for a second time but was sacked ten months later after refusing to retract criticism he had made of his players in a press conference following a defeat. In 2004, he was appointed as manager of Wales for a second time and remained with the side for six years, presiding over three ultimately unsuccessful qualifying campaigns. He later managed [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] and Azerbaijani side [[Khazar Lankaran FK|Khazar Lankaran]] before managing outside Europe for the first time in his career with Moroccan side [[Wydad AC|Wydad Casablanca]] and [[Tractor S.C.|Tractor]] of Iran.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Toshack was born on 22 March 1949 in [[Cardiff]], Wales, and grew up on Northumberland Street

of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 22 March 1949) is a Welsh former professional [[Association football|football]] player and manager.\n\nHe began his playing career as a teenager with his hometown club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], becoming the youngest player to make an appearance for the side when he made his debut in 1965. After establishing himself in the first-team, he went on to make over 200 appearances and scored 100 goals in all competitions after forming a striking partnership with [[Brian Clark (footballer, born 1943)|Brian Clark]].\n\nIn 1970, he joined [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], where he formed a noted forward partnership with [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Steve Heighway]] that helped the club to win two league titles, the [[UEFA Cup]] on two occasions, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]]. His partnership with Keegan was so effective that the two were described as telepathic. Mounting injuries eventually led to him securing his release from Liverpool to join [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] as [[Player-coach|player-manager]] in March 1978. He led the club to three promotions in four seasons, elevating them from the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] to the First Division in a feat that led former Liverpool manager [[Bill Shankly]] to describe him as the \"manager of the century\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I2qoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT189&lpg=PT189&dq=bill+shankly+toshack+manager+of+the+century&source=bl&ots=GghZMAn4IB&sig=xqSMDXqTkGtk24GvmA-QVrtU4-8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi81qr4jorZAhUBb1AKHVuRDoAQ6AEIXTAN#v=onepage&q=bill%20shankly%20toshack%20manager%20of%20the%20century&f=false |title=Wales: A Historical Companion |author=Terry Breverton |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |year=2009 |isbn=184868326X}}</ref> During his career, he scored over 150 goals in the Football League in more than 350 appearances and also represented [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at international level, winning 40 caps and scoring 13 goals.<ref name=ATZ>{{Cite web |url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player/johntoshack.html |title=Johk Toshack |website=Post War English & Scottish Football League A\u2013Z Player's Database |publisher=Neil Brown |accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe resigned from Swansea in 1984 after suffering relegation and embarked on a managerial career abroad, taking charge of [[Sporting CP]] in Portugal and later Spanish side [[Real Sociedad]], winning the [[Copa del Rey]] in 1987. Two years later, he was appointed manager of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and led them to a fifth consecutive [[La Liga]] title with a record total of points and goals scored. However, a disappointing start to the following season resulted in his dismissal in November 1990 and he returned to Real Sociedad. In 1994, he was appointed part-time manager of Wales alongside his job at Sociedad but resigned from the role after just 47 days having been in charge for one match, citing the strong support for former manager [[Terry Yorath]] among fans and a \"political war\" as reasons.\n\nAfter a spell in Turkey with [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]], he returned to Real Madrid for a second time but was sacked ten months later after refusing to retract criticism he had made of his players in a press conference following a defeat. In 2004, he was appointed as manager of Wales for a second time and remained with the side for six years, presiding over three ultimately unsuccessful qualifying campaigns. He later managed [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] and Azerbaijani side [[Khazar Lankaran FK|Khazar Lankaran]] before managing outside Europe for the first time in his career with Moroccan side [[Wydad AC|Wydad Casablanca]] and [[Tractor S.C.|Tractor]] of Iran.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Toshack was born on 22 March 1949 in [[Cardiff]], Wales, and grew up on Northumberland Street
