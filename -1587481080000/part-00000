In New Hollywood films, the [[film director]], rather than the studio, took on a key [[Auteur theory|authorial]] role. The definition of New Hollywood varies, depending on the author, with some defining it as a movement and others as a period. The span of the period is also a subject of debate, as well as its integrity, as some authors, such as Thomas Schatz, argue that the New Hollywood consists of several different movements. The films made in this movement are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from [[Classical Hollywood Cinema|classical]] norms. After the demise of the studio system and the rise of television, the commercial success of films was diminished.\n\nSuccessful films of the early New Hollywood era include ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', ''[[The Graduate]]'', ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'', and ''[[Easy Rider]]'', while films that failed at the box office including ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' and ''[[One from the Heart]]'' marked the end of the era (despite the two maintaining a cult following years later).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://directorsseries.net/2017/05/08/francis-ford-coppolas-one-from-the-heart-1982/|title=Francis Ford Coppola's \"One From The Heart\" (1982)|last=directorsseries|date=8 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/michael-cimino-the-deer-hunter-director-dead-at-77-237644/|title=Michael Cimino, 'The Deer Hunter' Director, Dead at 77|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreps|first2=Daniel|last2=Kreps|date=2 July 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Background ===\nFollowing the [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|Paramount Case]] (which ended block booking and ownership of theater chains by film studios) and the advent of [[television]], both of which severely weakened the traditional [[studio system]], Hollywood studios initially used spectacle to retain profitability. [[Technicolor]] developed a far more widespread use, while widescreen processes and technical improvements, such as [[CinemaScope]], stereo sound and others, such as [[3-D film|3-D]], were invented in order to retain the dwindling audience and compete with television. However, these were generally unsuccessful in increasing profits.<ref>David E James, Allegories of Cinema, American film in the Sixties, Princeton University Press, New York, 1989, pp. 14\u201326</ref> By 1957, ''Life'' magazine called the 1950s \"the horrible decade\" for Hollywood.<ref name=\"hodgins19570610\"/>\n\nThe 1950s and early 1960s saw a Hollywood dominated by musicals, historical epics, and other films that benefited from the larger screens, wider framing and improved sound. Hence, as early as 1957, the era was dubbed a \"New Hollywood\".<ref name=\"hodgins19570610\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA146&pg=PA146#v=onepage&f=true | title=Amid Ruins of an Empire a New Hollywood Arises | work=Life | date=1957-06-10 | accessdate=April 22, 2012 | author=Hodgins, Eric | page=146}}</ref> However, audience shares continued to dwindle, and had reached alarmingly low levels by the mid-1960s. Several costly flops, including ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', and failed attempts to replicate the success of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', put great strain on the studios.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=15\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the [[baby boomer]] generation was coming of age in the 1960s, \"Old Hollywood\" was rapidly losing money; the studios were unsure how to react to the much changed audience demographics. The change in market during the period went from a middle-aged high school-educated audience in the mid 1960s, to a younger, more affluent, college-educated demographic: by the mid 1970s, 76% of all movie-goers were under 30, 64% of whom had gone to college.<ref>{{harvp|Belton|1993|p=290}}</ref>\n[[European cinema|European]] films, both arthouse and commercial (especially the [[Commedia all'italiana]], the [[French New Wave]], the [[Spaghetti Western]]), and [[Japanese cinema]] were making a splash in United States \u2014 the huge market of disaffected youth seemed to find relevance and artistic meaning in movies like [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'', with its oblique narrative structure and full-frontal female nudity.<ref>David A Cook, \"Auteur Cinema and the film generation in 70s Hollywood\", in The New American Cinema by Jon Lewis (ed), Duke University Press, New York, 1998, pp. 1\u20134</ref><ref name=\"time.com\">Stefan Kanfer, The Shock of Freedom in Films, Time Magazine, Dec 8, 1967, Accessed 25 April 2009, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844256-7,00.html]</ref>\n\nThe desperation felt by studios during this period of economic downturn, and after the losses from expensive movie flops, led to innovation and risk-taking, allowing greater control by younger directors and producers.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=14\u201316}}</ref> Therefore, in an attempt to capture that audience which found a connection to the \"art films\" of Europe, the studios hired a host of young filmmakers (some of whom were mentored by [[Roger Corman]]) and allowed them to make their films with relatively little studio control. This, together with the breakdown of the Production Code in 1966 and the new ratings system in 1968 (reflecting growing market segmentation) set the scene for New Hollywood.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993}}</ref>\n\n===''Bonnie and Clyde''===\n[[File:Faye_Dunaway_and_Warren_Beatty_in_'Bonnie_and_Clyde',_1967.jpg|thumb|''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967)]]\nA defining film of the New Hollywood generation was ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967).<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/silver/new/nowplaying/2011/v8i3/penn.aspx|title=AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center|website=www.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nProduced by and starring [[Warren Beatty]] and directed by [[Arthur Penn]], its combination of graphic violence and humor, as well as its theme of glamorous disaffected youth, was a hit with audiences. The film won [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Estelle Parsons]])<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXKBCFosizM Estelle Parsons winning Best Supporting Actress-Oscars on YouTube]</ref> and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6JpLGrhItM Burnett Guffey winning the Oscar\u00ae for cinematography for \"Bonnie and Clyde\"-Oscars on YouTube]</ref><ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1968 1968|Oscars.org]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Jack L. Warner]], then-CEO of [[Warner Bros.]], first saw a rough cut of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' in the summer of 1967, he hated it. Distribution executives at Warner Brothers agreed, giving the film a low-key premiere and limited release. Their strategy appeared justified when [[Bosley Crowther]], [[middlebrow]] film critic at ''The New York Times'', gave the movie a scathing review. \"It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy,\" he wrote, \"that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cut-ups in ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]''...\" Other notices, including those from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''Newsweek'' magazines, were equally dismissive.<ref name=\"newwave\">[http://www.newwavefilm.com/international/new-hollywood.shtml NewWaveFilm.com], \"New Hollywood\" article, March 2013</ref>\n\nIts portrayal of violence and ambiguity in regard to moral values, and its startling ending, divided critics. Following one of the negative reviews, ''Time'' magazine received letters from fans of the movie, and according to journalist [[Peter Biskind]], the impact of critic [[Pauline Kael]] in her positive review of the film (October 1967, ''New Yorker'') led other reviewers to follow her lead and re-evaluate the film (notably ''Newsweek'' and ''Time'').<ref>{{harvp|Biskind|1998|pp=40\u201347}}</ref> Kael drew attention to the innocence of the characters in the film and the artistic merit of the contrast of that with the violence in the film: \"In a sense, it is the absence of sadism \u2014 it is the violence without sadism \u2014 that throws the audience off balance at ''Bonnie and Clyde''. The brutality that comes out of this innocence is far more shocking than the calculated brutalities of mean killers.\" Kael also noted the reaction of audiences to the violent climax of the movie, and the potential to empathise with the gang of criminals in terms of their naivet\u00e9 and innocence reflecting a change in expectations of American cinema.<ref>Pauline Kael, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" in, ''Pauline Kael, For Keeps'' (Plume, New York, 1994) pp. 141\u201357. Originally published in ''The New Yorker'', October 21, 1967</ref>\n\nThe cover story in ''Time'' magazine in December 1967, celebrated the movie and innovation in American New Wave cinema. This influential article by Stefan Kanfer claimed that ''Bonnie and Clyde'' represented a \"New Cinema\" through its blurred genre lines, and disregard for honoured aspects of plot and motivation, and that \"In both conception and execution, ''Bonnie and Clyde'' is a watershed picture, the kind that signals a new style, a new trend.\"<ref name=\"time.com\" /> Biskind states that this review and turnaround by some critics allowed the film to be re-released, thus proving its commercial success and reflecting the move to New Hollywood.<ref>{{harvp|Biskind|1998}}</ref> The impact of this film is important in understanding the rest of the American New Wave, as well as the conditions that were necessary for it.\n\nThese initial successes paved the way for the studio to relinquish almost complete control to these innovative young filmmakers. In the mid-1970s, idiosyncratic, startling original films such as ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' among others, enjoyed enormous critical and commercial success. These successes by the members of New Hollywood led each of them in turn to make more and more extravagant demands, both on the studio and eventually on the audience.<ref name=\"reelrundown2\">{{cite web|url=https://reelrundown.com/movies/12-Greatest-Films-of-the-New-Hollywood-Era|title=12 Greatest Films of the New Hollywood Era|website=ReelRundown|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThis new generation of Hollywood filmmaker was most importantly, from the point of view of the studios, young, therefore able to reach the youth audience they were losing. This group of young filmmakers\u2014[[actor]]s, [[screenwriter|writers]] and [[film director|directors]]\u2014dubbed the \"New Hollywood\" by the press, briefly changed the business from the [[film producer|producer]]-driven Hollywood system of the past.\n\nTodd Berliner has written about the period's unusual narrative practices. The 1970s, Berliner says, marks Hollywood's most significant formal transformation since the conversion to sound film and is the defining period separating the storytelling modes of the studio era and contemporary Hollywood. New Hollywood films deviate from classical narrative norms more than Hollywood films from any other era or movement. Their narrative and stylistic devices threaten to derail an otherwise straightforward narration. Berliner argues that five principles govern the narrative strategies characteristic of Hollywood films of the 1970s:\n* Seventies films show a perverse tendency to integrate, in narrative incidental ways, story information and stylistic devices counterproductive to the films' overt and essential narrative purposes.\n* Hollywood filmmakers of the 1970s often situate their film-making practices in between those of classical Hollywood and those of European and Asian art cinema.\n* Seventies films prompt spectator responses more uncertain and discomforting than those of more typical Hollywood cinema.\n* Seventies narratives place an uncommon emphasis on irresolution, particularly at the moment of climax or in epilogues, when more conventional Hollywood movies busy themselves tying up loose ends.\n* Seventies cinema hinders narrative linearity and momentum and scuttles its potential to generate suspense and excitement.<ref>{{harvp|Berliner|2010|pp=51\u201352}}</ref>\n\nThomas Schatz points to another difference with the Hollywood Golden Age, which deals with the relationship of characters and plot. He argues that plot in classical Hollywood films (and some of the earlier New Hollywood films like ''The Godfather'') \"tended to emerge more organically as a function of the drives, desires, motivations, and goals of the central characters\". However, beginning with mid-1970s, he points to a trend that \"characters became plot functions\".<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=22}}</ref>\n\nDuring the height of the studio system, films were made almost exclusively on set in isolated studios. The content of films was limited by the Motion Picture Production Code, and though golden-age film-makers found loopholes in its rules, the discussion of more taboo content through film was effectively prevented. The shift towards a \"new realism\" was made possible when the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]] was introduced and location shooting was becoming more viable.\n\nBecause of breakthroughs in film technology (e.g. the [[Panavision]] [[Panavision cameras|Panaflex]] camera, introduced in 1972), the New Hollywood filmmakers could shoot 35mm camera film in exteriors with relative ease. Since location shooting was cheaper (no sets need to be built) New Hollywood filmmakers rapidly developed the taste for location shooting, resulting in more naturalistic approach to filmmaking, especially when compared to the mostly stylized approach of classical Hollywood musicals and spectacles made to compete with television during the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nHowever, in editing New Hollywood filmmakers adhered to realism more liberally than most of their classical Hollywood predecessors, often using editing for artistic purposes rather than for continuity alone, a practice inspired by European art films and classical Hollywood directors such as [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Films with unorthodox editing included ''[[Easy Rider]]'''s use of editing to foreshadow the climax of the movie, as well as subtler uses, such as editing to reflect the feeling of frustration in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' and the subjectivity of the protagonist in ''[[The Graduate]]''.<ref>{{harvp|Monaco|2001|p=183}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the production code enabled New Hollywood films to feature anti-establishment political themes, the use of [[rock music]], and sexual freedom deemed \"counter-cultural\" by the studios.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=12\u201322}}</ref> The youth movement of the 1960s turned anti-heroes like ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' into pop culture idols, and [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine called the characters in ''Easy Rider'' \"part of the fundamental myth central to the counterculture of the late 1960s.\"<ref name=\"Monaco_182_188\">{{harvp|Monaco|2001|pp=182\u2013188}}</ref> ''Easy Rider'' also affected the way studios looked to reach the youth market.<ref name=\"Monaco_182_188\"/> The success of ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', in spite of its X rating, was evidence for the interest in controversial themes at the time and also showed the weakness of the rating system and segmentation of the audience.<ref>{{harvp|Belton|1993|p=288}}</ref>\n\n==Interpretations on defining the movement==\nFor Peter Biskind, the new wave was foreshadowed by ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and began in earnest with ''Easy Rider''. Biskind's book ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'' argues that the New Hollywood movement marked a significant shift towards independently produced and innovative works by a new wave of directors, but that this shift began to reverse itself when the commercial success of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' led to the realization by studios of the importance of blockbusters, advertising and control over production.<ref>{{harvp|Biskind|1998|p=288}}</ref>\n\nWriting in 1968, critic [[Pauline Kael]] argued that the importance of ''The Graduate'' was in its social significance in relation to a new young audience, and the role of mass media, rather than any artistic aspects. Kael argued that college students identifying with ''The Graduate'' were not too different from audiences identifying with characters in dramas of the previous decade.<ref>Pauline Kael, \"Trash, Art, and the Movies\" in Going Steady, Film Writings 1968\u201369, Marion Boyers, New York, 1994, pp. 125\u20137</ref>\n\n[[John Belton]] points to the changing demographic to even younger, more conservative audiences in the mid 1970s (50% aged 12\u201320) and the move to less politically subversive themes in mainstream cinema<ref>{{harvp|Belton|1993|pp=292\u2013296}}</ref> as did Thomas Schatz who saw the mid to late 1970s as the decline of the art cinema movement as a significant industry force with its peak in 1974\u201375 with ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' and ''Chinatown''.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|p=20}}</ref>\n\nGeoff King sees the period as an interim movement in American cinema where a conjunction of forces led to a measure of freedom in filmmaking<ref>{{harvp|King|2002|p=48}}</ref> while Todd Berliner says that Seventies cinema resists the efficiency and harmony that normally characterize classical Hollywood cinema and tests the limits of Hollywood's classical model.<ref>{{harvp|Berliner|2010}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nBut New Hollywood was not without criticism as in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article, film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] described it as the \"halcyon age\" of the decade's filmmaking that \"was less revolution than business as usual, with rebel hype\".<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news|title=The '70s: Get over it|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2003/aug/17/entertainment/ca-dargis17|last=Dargis|first=Dargis|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 17, 2003|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref> She also pointed out in her ''[[NY Times]]'' article, its enthusiasts insisting this was \"when American movies grew up (or at least starred underdressed actresses);

In New Hollywood films, the [[film director]], rather than the studio, took on a key [[Auteur theory|authorial]] role. The definition of New Hollywood varies, depending on the author, with some defining it as a movement and others as a period. The span of the period is also a subject of debate, as well as its integrity, as some authors, such as Thomas Schatz, argue that the New Hollywood consists of several different movements. The films made in this movement are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from [[Classical Hollywood Cinema|classical]] norms. After the demise of the studio system and the rise of television, the commercial success of films was diminished.\n\nSuccessful films of the early New Hollywood era include ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', ''[[The Graduate]]'', ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'', and ''[[Easy Rider]]'', while films that failed at the box office including ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' and ''[[One from the Heart]]'' marked the end of the era (despite the two maintaining a cult following years later).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://directorsseries.net/2017/05/08/francis-ford-coppolas-one-from-the-heart-1982/|title=Francis Ford Coppola's \"One From The Heart\" (1982)|last=directorsseries|date=8 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/michael-cimino-the-deer-hunter-director-dead-at-77-237644/|title=Michael Cimino, 'The Deer Hunter' Director, Dead at 77|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreps|first2=Daniel|last2=Kreps|date=2 July 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Background ===\nFollowing the [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|Paramount Case]] (which ended block booking and ownership of theater chains by film studios) and the advent of [[television]], both of which severely weakened the traditional [[studio system]], Hollywood studios initially used spectacle to retain profitability. [[Technicolor]] developed a far more widespread use, while widescreen processes and technical improvements, such as [[CinemaScope]], stereo sound and others, such as [[3-D film|3-D]], were invented in order to retain the dwindling audience and compete with television. However, these were generally unsuccessful in increasing profits.<ref>David E James, Allegories of Cinema, American film in the Sixties, Princeton University Press, New York, 1989, pp. 14\u201326</ref> By 1957, ''Life'' magazine called the 1950s \"the horrible decade\" for Hollywood.<ref name=\"hodgins19570610\"/>\n\nThe 1950s and early 1960s saw a Hollywood dominated by musicals, historical epics, and other films that benefited from the larger screens, wider framing and improved sound. Hence, as early as 1957, the era was dubbed a \"New Hollywood\".<ref name=\"hodgins19570610\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA146&pg=PA146#v=onepage&f=true | title=Amid Ruins of an Empire a New Hollywood Arises | work=Life | date=1957-06-10 | accessdate=April 22, 2012 | author=Hodgins, Eric | page=146}}</ref> However, audience shares continued to dwindle, and had reached alarmingly low levels by the mid-1960s. Several costly flops, including ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', and failed attempts to replicate the success of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', put great strain on the studios.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=15\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the [[baby boomer]] generation was coming of age in the 1960s, \"Old Hollywood\" was rapidly losing money; the studios were unsure how to react to the much changed audience demographics. The change in market during the period went from a middle-aged high school-educated audience in the mid 1960s, to a younger, more affluent, college-educated demographic: by the mid 1970s, 76% of all movie-goers were under 30, 64% of whom had gone to college.<ref>{{harvp|Belton|1993|p=290}}</ref>\n[[European cinema|European]] films, both arthouse and commercial (especially the [[Commedia all'italiana]], the [[French New Wave]], the [[Spaghetti Western]]), and [[Japanese cinema]] were making a splash in United States \u2014 the huge market of disaffected youth seemed to find relevance and artistic meaning in movies like [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'', with its oblique narrative structure and full-frontal female nudity.<ref>David A Cook, \"Auteur Cinema and the film generation in 70s Hollywood\", in The New American Cinema by Jon Lewis (ed), Duke University Press, New York, 1998, pp. 1\u20134</ref><ref name=\"time.com\">Stefan Kanfer, The Shock of Freedom in Films, Time Magazine, Dec 8, 1967, Accessed 25 April 2009, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844256-7,00.html]</ref>\n\nThe desperation felt by studios during this period of economic downturn, and after the losses from expensive movie flops, led to innovation and risk-taking, allowing greater control by younger directors and producers.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=14\u201316}}</ref> Therefore, in an attempt to capture that audience which found a connection to the \"art films\" of Europe, the studios hired a host of young filmmakers (some of whom were mentored by [[Roger Corman]]) and allowed them to make their films with relatively little studio control. This, together with the breakdown of the Production Code in 1966 and the new ratings system in 1968 (reflecting growing market segmentation) set the scene for New Hollywood.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993}}</ref>\n\n===''Bonnie and Clyde''===\n[[File:Faye_Dunaway_and_Warren_Beatty_in_'Bonnie_and_Clyde',_1967.jpg|thumb|''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967)]]\nA defining film of the New Hollywood generation was ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967).<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/silver/new/nowplaying/2011/v8i3/penn.aspx|title=AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center|website=www.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nProduced by and starring [[Warren Beatty]] and directed by [[Arthur Penn]], its combination of graphic violence and humor, as well as its theme of glamorous disaffected youth, was a hit with audiences. The film won [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Estelle Parsons]])<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXKBCFosizM Estelle Parsons winning Best Supporting Actress-Oscars on YouTube]</ref> and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6JpLGrhItM Burnett Guffey winning the the Oscar\u00ae for cinematography for \"Bonnie and Clyde\"-Oscars on YouTube]</ref><ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1968 1968|Oscars.org]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Jack L. Warner]], then-CEO of [[Warner Bros.]], first saw a rough cut of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' in the summer of 1967, he hated it. Distribution executives at Warner Brothers agreed, giving the film a low-key premiere and limited release. Their strategy appeared justified when [[Bosley Crowther]], [[middlebrow]] film critic at ''The New York Times'', gave the movie a scathing review. \"It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy,\" he wrote, \"that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cut-ups in ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]''...\" Other notices, including those from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''Newsweek'' magazines, were equally dismissive.<ref name=\"newwave\">[http://www.newwavefilm.com/international/new-hollywood.shtml NewWaveFilm.com], \"New Hollywood\" article, March 2013</ref>\n\nIts portrayal of violence and ambiguity in regard to moral values, and its startling ending, divided critics. Following one of the negative reviews, ''Time'' magazine received letters from fans of the movie, and according to journalist [[Peter Biskind]], the impact of critic [[Pauline Kael]] in her positive review of the film (October 1967, ''New Yorker'') led other reviewers to follow her lead and re-evaluate the film (notably ''Newsweek'' and ''Time'').<ref>{{harvp|Biskind|1998|pp=40\u201347}}</ref> Kael drew attention to the innocence of the characters in the film and the artistic merit of the contrast of that with the violence in the film: \"In a sense, it is the absence of sadism \u2014 it is the violence without sadism \u2014 that throws the audience off balance at ''Bonnie and Clyde''. The brutality that comes out of this innocence is far more shocking than the calculated brutalities of mean killers.\" Kael also noted the reaction of audiences to the violent climax of the movie, and the potential to empathise with the gang of criminals in terms of their naivet\u00e9 and innocence reflecting a change in expectations of American cinema.<ref>Pauline Kael, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" in, ''Pauline Kael, For Keeps'' (Plume, New York, 1994) pp. 141\u201357. Originally published in ''The New Yorker'', October 21, 1967</ref>\n\nThe cover story in ''Time'' magazine in December 1967, celebrated the movie and innovation in American New Wave cinema. This influential article by Stefan Kanfer claimed that ''Bonnie and Clyde'' represented a \"New Cinema\" through its blurred genre lines, and disregard for honoured aspects of plot and motivation, and that \"In both conception and execution, ''Bonnie and Clyde'' is a watershed picture, the kind that signals a new style, a new trend.\"<ref name=\"time.com\" /> Biskind states that this review and turnaround by some critics allowed the film to be re-released, thus proving its commercial success and reflecting the move to New Hollywood.<ref>{{harvp|Biskind|1998}}</ref> The impact of this film is important in understanding the rest of the American New Wave, as well as the conditions that were necessary for it.\n\nThese initial successes paved the way for the studio to relinquish almost complete control to these innovative young filmmakers. In the mid-1970s, idiosyncratic, startling original films such as ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' among others, enjoyed enormous critical and commercial success. These successes by the members of New Hollywood led each of them in turn to make more and more extravagant demands, both on the studio and eventually on the audience.<ref name=\"reelrundown2\">{{cite web|url=https://reelrundown.com/movies/12-Greatest-Films-of-the-New-Hollywood-Era|title=12 Greatest Films of the New Hollywood Era|website=ReelRundown|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThis new generation of Hollywood filmmaker was most importantly, from the point of view of the studios, young, therefore able to reach the youth audience they were losing. This group of young filmmakers\u2014[[actor]]s, [[screenwriter|writers]] and [[film director|directors]]\u2014dubbed the \"New Hollywood\" by the press, briefly changed the business from the [[film producer|producer]]-driven Hollywood system of the past.\n\nTodd Berliner has written about the period's unusual narrative practices. The 1970s, Berliner says, marks Hollywood's most significant formal transformation since the conversion to sound film and is the defining period separating the storytelling modes of the studio era and contemporary Hollywood. New Hollywood films deviate from classical narrative norms more than Hollywood films from any other era or movement. Their narrative and stylistic devices threaten to derail an otherwise straightforward narration. Berliner argues that five principles govern the narrative strategies characteristic of Hollywood films of the 1970s:\n* Seventies films show a perverse tendency to integrate, in narrative incidental ways, story information and stylistic devices counterproductive to the films' overt and essential narrative purposes.\n* Hollywood filmmakers of the 1970s often situate their film-making practices in between those of classical Hollywood and those of European and Asian art cinema.\n* Seventies films prompt spectator responses more uncertain and discomforting than those of more typical Hollywood cinema.\n* Seventies narratives place an uncommon emphasis on irresolution, particularly at the moment of climax or in epilogues, when more conventional Hollywood movies busy themselves tying up loose ends.\n* Seventies cinema hinders narrative linearity and momentum and scuttles its potential to generate suspense and excitement.<ref>{{harvp|Berliner|2010|pp=51\u201352}}</ref>\n\nThomas Schatz points to another difference with the Hollywood Golden Age, which deals with the relationship of characters and plot. He argues that plot in classical Hollywood films (and some of the earlier New Hollywood films like ''The Godfather'') \"tended to emerge more organically as a function of the drives, desires, motivations, and goals of the central characters\". However, beginning with mid-1970s, he points to a trend that \"characters became plot functions\".<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=22}}</ref>\n\nDuring the height of the studio system, films were made almost exclusively on set in isolated studios. The content of films was limited by the Motion Picture Production Code, and though golden-age film-makers found loopholes in its rules, the discussion of more taboo content through film was effectively prevented. The shift towards a \"new realism\" was made possible when the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]] was introduced and location shooting was becoming more viable.\n\nBecause of breakthroughs in film technology (e.g. the [[Panavision]] [[Panavision cameras|Panaflex]] camera, introduced in 1972), the New Hollywood filmmakers could shoot 35mm camera film in exteriors with relative ease. Since location shooting was cheaper (no sets need to be built) New Hollywood filmmakers rapidly developed the taste for location shooting, resulting in more naturalistic approach to filmmaking, especially when compared to the mostly stylized approach of classical Hollywood musicals and spectacles made to compete with television during the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nHowever, in editing New Hollywood filmmakers adhered to realism more liberally than most of their classical Hollywood predecessors, often using editing for artistic purposes rather than for continuity alone, a practice inspired by European art films and classical Hollywood directors such as [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Films with unorthodox editing included ''[[Easy Rider]]'''s use of editing to foreshadow the climax of the movie, as well as subtler uses, such as editing to reflect the feeling of frustration in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' and the subjectivity of the protagonist in ''[[The Graduate]]''.<ref>{{harvp|Monaco|2001|p=183}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the production code enabled New Hollywood films to feature anti-establishment political themes, the use of [[rock music]], and sexual freedom deemed \"counter-cultural\" by the studios.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|pp=12\u201322}}</ref> The youth movement of the 1960s turned anti-heroes like ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' into pop culture idols, and [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine called the characters in ''Easy Rider'' \"part of the fundamental myth central to the counterculture of the late 1960s.\"<ref name=\"Monaco_182_188\">{{harvp|Monaco|2001|pp=182\u2013188}}</ref> ''Easy Rider'' also affected the way studios looked to reach the youth market.<ref name=\"Monaco_182_188\"/> The success of ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', in spite of its X rating, was evidence for the interest in controversial themes at the time and also showed the weakness of the rating system and segmentation of the audience.<ref>{{harvp|Belton|1993|p=288}}</ref>\n\n==Interpretations on defining the movement==\nFor Peter Biskind, the new wave was foreshadowed by ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and began in earnest with ''Easy Rider''. Biskind's book ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'' argues that the New Hollywood movement marked a significant shift towards independently produced and innovative works by a new wave of directors, but that this shift began to reverse itself when the commercial success of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' led to the realization by studios of the importance of blockbusters, advertising and control over production.<ref>{{harvp|Biskind|1998|p=288}}</ref>\n\nWriting in 1968, critic [[Pauline Kael]] argued that the importance of ''The Graduate'' was in its social significance in relation to a new young audience, and the role of mass media, rather than any artistic aspects. Kael argued that college students identifying with ''The Graduate'' were not too different from audiences identifying with characters in dramas of the previous decade.<ref>Pauline Kael, \"Trash, Art, and the Movies\" in Going Steady, Film Writings 1968\u201369, Marion Boyers, New York, 1994, pp. 125\u20137</ref>\n\n[[John Belton]] points to the changing demographic to even younger, more conservative audiences in the mid 1970s (50% aged 12\u201320) and the move to less politically subversive themes in mainstream cinema<ref>{{harvp|Belton|1993|pp=292\u2013296}}</ref> as did Thomas Schatz who saw the mid to late 1970s as the decline of the art cinema movement as a significant industry force with its peak in 1974\u201375 with ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' and ''Chinatown''.<ref>{{harvp|Schatz|1993|p=20}}</ref>\n\nGeoff King sees the period as an interim movement in American cinema where a conjunction of forces led to a measure of freedom in filmmaking<ref>{{harvp|King|2002|p=48}}</ref> while Todd Berliner says that Seventies cinema resists the efficiency and harmony that normally characterize classical Hollywood cinema and tests the limits of Hollywood's classical model.<ref>{{harvp|Berliner|2010}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nBut New Hollywood was not without criticism as in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article, film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] described it as the \"halcyon age\" of the decade's filmmaking that \"was less revolution than business as usual, with rebel hype\".<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news|title=The '70s: Get over it|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2003/aug/17/entertainment/ca-dargis17|last=Dargis|first=Dargis|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 17, 2003|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref> She also pointed out in her ''[[NY Times]]'' article, its enthusiasts insisting this was \"when American movies grew up (or at least starred underdressed actresses);

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 23 January 1995. Toadie was created by writer Elizabeth Packett. Moloney had previously auditioned for another role in the show and had played a minor character, before being cast as Toadie. The actor was originally scheduled to play Toadie in one scene, but he went on to become a recurring cast member. When Toadie became popular with viewers, Moloney was promoted to the regular cast. In 2015, Moloney celebrated his 20th anniversary with ''Neighbours''.\n\nToadie was initially portrayed as a troubled teenager and a \"class clown\". After qualifying as a lawyer, Toadie matured and became a responsible member of the community. Despite being labelled \"unlucky in love\", Toadie has had several love interests and has been married three times. Toadie has received mostly positive attention from television critics and viewers. For his portrayal of Toadie, Moloney earned a nomination for Best Actor in a Soap at the 2004 [[Rose d'Or|Rose d'Or Awards]]. In 2010, Moloney won the very first Best Daytime Star award at the [[Inside Soap Awards]]. He has since won it three more times in 2011, 2012 and 2019. He has also been nominated for the [[Logie Award for Most Popular Actor]].\n\n==Creation and casting==\nThe character of Toadfish was created by writer Elizabeth Packett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/neighbours/news/quiz-neighbours-writer-elizabeth-packett-10290|title=Quiz Neighbours writer Elizabeth Packett!|date=14 October 2010|publisher=[[Holy Soap]]|accessdate=14 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024040055/http://holysoap.five.tv/neighbours/news/quiz-neighbours-writer-elizabeth-packett-10290|archivedate=24 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Actor [[Ryan Moloney]] was cast in the role after previously auditioning for the role of [[Brett Stark]] and appearing as a minor character called Cyborg, who vandalised the Willis family's property.<ref name=\"Show\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesoapshow.com/soap_stars/ryanmoloney.htm|title=Ryan Moloney Interview|publisher=The Soap Show|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> Moloney made his first appearance as Toadie during the episode broadcast on 23 January 1995.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 2306|series=Neighbours|serieslink=Neighbours|credits=Executive producer: Stanley Walsh; Director: Geoff Hunt; Writer: Karyn Noble|network=[[Network Ten]]|airdate=23 January 1995}}</ref><ref name=\"Wulff\">{{cite journal|last=Wulff|first=Alana|date=12\u201325 February 2015|title=My first day on set|journal=[[TV Week Soap Extra]]|issue=15}}</ref> He recalled that his first scene lasted for ten minutes and that it featured Toadie begging his brother, [[Stonefish Rebecchi|Stonefish]] (Anthony Engelman), to take him to the beach.<ref name=\"Wulff\"/> Moloney was originally contracted to play Toadie in that one scene, but he went on to become a recurring character.<ref name=\"LastBroadcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/interviews/v/3099-ryan-moloney-neighbours-toadie-rebecchi-interview.html |title=Ryan Moloney (Neighbours' Toadie Rebecchi) Interview |publisher=Last Broadcast |accessdate=1 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308184944/http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/interviews/v/3099-ryan-moloney-neighbours-toadie-rebecchi-interview.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}</ref> He thought the producers kept him on as he looked similar to Engelman when he was younger and they wanted to see more of the Rebecchi family.<ref name=\"Wulff\"/> Toadie proved to be popular with the ''Neighbours'' viewers and he was asked to continue on the show full-time.<ref name=\"LastBroadcast\"/><ref name=\"DSInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/interviews/a147657/ryan-moloney-toadie-neighbours.html|title=Ryan Moloney (Toadie 'Neighbours')|last=Balls|first=David|date=27 February 2009|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy 2003 Moloney said he had remained grounded and surpassed the \"big-headed stuff\" that comes with being in a soap opera.<ref name=teddy>{{cite web|last=Moynihan|first=Stephen|title=Toadfish to teddy bear|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/20/1047749869628.html|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=20 July 2011|date=20 March 2003}}</ref> Moloney celebrated his 15th year on ''Neighbours'' in 2010.

Toadie comes into conflict with Billy's father, [[Karl Kennedy|Karl]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) because of his behaviour and his mother [[Angie Rebecchi|Angie]] ([[Lesley Baker]]) later sends him to live with his aunt Coral ([[Denise Scott]]). A few months later, Toadie is sent back to Erinsborough and he decides to try to make a go of things at school. Toadie discovers that he has an above average IQ and is put into an accelerated learning class, but he keeps up his mischievous ways. Toadie becomes good friends with [[Hannah Martin]] ([[Rebecca Ritters]]) and [[Lance Wilkinson]] ([[Andrew Bibby]]). Toadie is horrified to learn that his mother and father plan to leave Erinsborough, so he and Billy convince Karl and [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) to let Toadie move in. Toadie passes his exams and studies law at Eden Hills University. He becomes a popular DJ on Uni FM, moves in with [[Lou Carpenter]] ([[Tom Oliver]]) and takes a job at Lou's Place. Toadie moves into Number 30 with [[Sarah Beaumont]] ([[Nicola Charles]]) and [[Joel Samuels]] ([[Daniel MacPherson]]). Toadie briefly becomes a guardian to his cousin, [[Tad Reeves|Tad]] ([[Jonathon Dutton]]). Toadie and Joel meet [[Dee Bliss]] ([[Madeleine West]]) and [[Vanessa Bradshaw]] (Julieanne Tait) on a night out. Dee later moves in with them.\n\nToadie is not happy when [[Geri Hallett]] ([[Isabella Dunwill]]) becomes his new Uni FM co-host and he plots to get her fired. His new co-host is Steph and Toadie develops feelings for her, but they decide to just be friends. Toadie is sacked from Uni FM, when he gives out some illegal advice. He is charged with inciting a crime and he decides to defend himself. Toadie becomes friends with law student [[Maggie Hancock]] (Sally Cooper) and she helps Toadie win his case. A romance develops between Toadie and [[Sheena Wilson]] ([[Zoe Stark]]), but when he tells her that her mother keeps coming onto him, Sheena breaks up with him. Toadie gets a job with a corporate law firm and becomes involved in Karl and Susan's divorce. He later works for [[Tim Collins (Neighbours)|Tim Collins]] ([[Ben Anderson (actor)|Ben Anderson]]). Toadie falls in love with Dee and the couple get engaged. Shortly after they wed, Toadie drives their car off a cliff into the sea and Dee goes missing, devastating Toadie. A while later, Toadie falls for [[Sindi Watts]] ([[Marisa Warrington]]) and they start dating. With his friend, Connor, Toadie becomes a wrestler. He meets Genevieve and they begin a relationship, but it ends when she goes on tour.\n\nToadie is left a bikini store by client and he runs it with Connor. When Connor goes missing, Toadie believes he has been killed by [[Robert Robinson (Neighbours)|Robert Robinson]] ([[Adam Hunter (actor)|Adam Hunter]]). Connor later sends Toadie some gifts and proves he is still alive. Toadie is shot in the back by [[Guy Sykes]] ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]) and he almost dies. Steph tells Toadie that she loves him, but she goes back to her husband. Toadie dates [[List of Neighbours characters (2007)#Abby Stafford|Abby Stafford]] ([[Louise Crawford]]), but their relationship ends when he realises that he is still in love with Steph. Toadie and Steph become a couple and they get engaged. However, on their wedding day, Toadie realises that Steph does not love him and he leaves her to go travelling. Toadie becomes Callum Jones's guardian after his grandmother is taken to hospital. Toadie briefly dates Callum's teacher, Kelly. Guy Sykes returns and holds Toadie and Callum hostage. Toadie helps Callum escape and wrestles Guy to the ground, before the police arrive. Toadie discovers that his dog [[Bob (Neighbours)|Bob]] has cancer and he has him put to sleep. Bob's ashes are scattered at the lake.\n\nToadie gets Callum a new dog called Rocky and they train him to be a guide dog. During Rocky's training, Toadie and Callum are visited by Sonya Mitchell. Toadie asks her out, but she initially turns him down. Toadie and [[Elle Robinson]] ([[Pippa Black]]) believe Sonya and [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]) are seeing each other, but Sonya reveals she is his Gamblers Anonymous sponsor. Sonya and Toadie begin a relationship. Toadie agrees to help Steph cover up the fact she is pregnant with [[Daniel Fitzgerald (Neighbours)|Daniel Fitzgerald]]'s ([[Brett Tucker]]) baby. They tell their family and friends that they are back together and they decide to get married. Toadie eventually tells Sonya the truth and asks her to wait for him. [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) starts blackmailing Toadie and later reveals Steph's secret during a public event, devastating Dan's wife [[Libby Kennedy]] ([[Kym Valentine]]). Toadie falls out with Libby, while Karl and Susan tell Toadie that he is no longer part of the family. Callum also becomes angry with Toadie, but Sonya gets them talking again.\n\nToadie defends Steph when she is charged with the accidental death of [[Ringo Brown]] ([[Sam Clark]]), but she is sent to prison. Sonya moves in, as does her sister, [[Jade Mitchell|Jade]] ([[Gemma Pranita]]), who clashes with Toadie. Callum tries to find his mother and realises that she is Sonya. Toadie asks her to leave and cuts off contact with her. Toadie calls [[Harold Bishop]] ([[Ian Smith (actor)|Ian Smith]]) for help, while Lucas convinces Toadie that Sonya loves him. Callum's father, [[Troy Miller (Neighbours)|Troy Miller]] ([[Dieter Brummer]]), arrives and Toadie allows Callum and Troy to spend time together. Sonya and Toadie get back together. Troy turns nasty and punches Toadie, before Callum tells him to leave. Toadie takes a job with law firm Simmons & Colbert, so he and Sonya can get a loan to purchase the community gardens. Toadie begins representing The Hamilton Group, who want to build a new shopping complex in Erinsborough. Toadie is forced into relocating the development's car park or risk being fired by [[Peter Noonan (Neighbours)|Peter Noonan]] (James Saunders).\n\nToadie offers Lucas, Lou and [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) money for their businesses, so the car park can be built in their place. Lou accepts the offer on Kyle's behalf, while Lucas declines it. Peter start putting pressure on Toadie to get Lucas to sell. Lucas declines all of Toadie's offers and he blames the law firm for sabotaging his garage. When Lucas's apprentice, [[Chris Pappas (Neighbours)|Chris Pappas]] (James Mason), is attacked, Toadie is questioned by the police and he realises that Peter is setting him up. Paul gives him an alibi, but the wrench Chris was attacked with is found in Toadie's car. [[Lewis Walton]] (Andy McPhee) is later arrested for attacking Chris, but he states that Toadie hired him. Toadie poses as Lewis' lawyer and when Lewis does not recognise him, the charges against him are dropped. [[Charlotte McKemmie]] (Meredith Penman) takes over Peter's job and informs Toadie that he is being let go from the law firm. However, after Toadie decides to sue for wrongful dismissal, he is given his job back.\n\nSonya and Toadie struggle to conceive a child and a fertility test shows that Toadie has a low sperm count. Toadie starts a health kick in a bid to increase his chances of conception, but test results indicate his count is still low. Toadie suggests they try IVF or a sperm donor, but Sonya tells him that she knows that it is not what he wants. Before donating blood at the hospital, Sonya takes a pregnancy test and learns that she is pregnant. Troy purchases Number 32 and makes it clear that he wants to be a part of Callum's life. He hires Toadie's friend [[Ajay Kapoor (Neighbours)|Ajay Kapoor]] (Sachin Joab) to help him gain access. When Troy goads Toadie about Sonya and the baby, Toadie punches him and is later served with an intervention order. He is forced to leave the street. Sonya collapses from the stress, but she and the baby are fine. Troy drops the custody case when Callum agrees to spend time with him.\n\nTroy holds Sonya and Jade hostage, but is injured during their escape. Toadie finds Troy unconscious on the floor, but when he returns with the paramedics, Troy is gone. He is later admitted to hospital, but he leaves early to go to the school to get Callum. Toadie finds them and tries to reason with Troy. When Callum tells him to go, Troy tries to drive away, but dies from a head injury. Toadie and Callum attend his funeral together. Toadie starts a [[Twitter]] account for the baby and tries to be Sonya's birthing coach as he feels left out of the pregnancy. When they learn they are having a daughter, Toadie and Sonya decide to name her Nell. Toadie's cousin, [[Georgia Brooks]] ([[Saskia Hampele]]), moves in and Connor turns up after six years. He and Toadie soon revert to their House of Trouser ways. Toadie proposes to Sonya and she accepts. Sonya gives birth to [[Nell Rebecchi|Nell]] (Scarlett Anderson) via caesarean section. She falls unconscious and has to undergo surgery, leaving Toadie and Callum to care for Nell on their own for a few days.\n\nDespite believing his wedding is jinxed, Toadie and Sonya marry. However, during the reception a gas bottle explodes, causing the marquee to collapse and injure Sonya, who suffers amnesia. Her memories return when Toadie organises a vow renewal ceremony for them. Steph returns to Erinsborough following her release from prison. She refuses to forgive Toadie for botching her case, but later apologises to him when she is arrested again. Ajay and Toadie go into partnership together. When Sonya is threatened by [[Robbo Slade]] (Aaron Jakubenko), as she is the witness in his court case, Toadie tries to protect his wife. After Robbo spikes Toadie's drink, he wakes up the next morning with no memory of the night before. Robbo dies after being involved in a hit-and-run and Toadie is convinced he did it. However, [[Hudson Walsh]] ([[Remy Hii]]) admits that he was responsible for Robbo's death. Toadie and Sonya's marriage becomes strained when she starts spending less time at home with her family to help out other people, including single father [[Jacob Holmes (Neighbours)|Jacob Holmes]] ([[Clayton Watson]]), who kisses her.\n\nToadie hires [[Naomi Canning]] ([[Morgana O'Reilly]]) as his executive assistant. He is impressed when she brings in new business and offers her comfort when she reveals that she is being stalked. Callum gets a scholarship to a school in the United States and Toadie convinces Sonya to let him go. Naomi admits she has feelings for Toadie and kisses him. He realises that she has been manipulating him and Sonya, and fires her. Sonya and Toadie agree to cut back on their work, so that they can spend more time together as a couple. Toadie is hit by a car driven by [[Kathy Carpenter]] ([[Tina Bursill]]) and he suffers a fractured [[coccyx]]. Toadie receives a [[poison pen letter]] detailing Sonya's addictions. After he and the neighbours receive more letters, Toadie asks [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) for his help in identifying the sender. It later emerges that Sonya's former best friend [[Erin Rogers]] ([[Adrienne Pickering]]) sent the letters, as she blames Sonya for introducing her to drugs. Sonya invites Erin to stay and her daughter [[Cat Rogers|Cat]] (Maleeka Gasbarri) visits. Cat bonds with Toadie and later asks to live with him and Sonya, but they help her to reconcile with her foster mother. Toadie helps Kyle out for the day, but accidentally causes a power outage.\n\nWhile attending an open day for the new childcare centre, Toadie is injured when he tries to rescue Nell from a bouncy castle that is not anchored to the ground. He is unable to feel his legs and undergoes surgery to stabilise a [[Thoracic spinal nerve 5|T5 vertebra]] fracture. Karl informs Sonya that the surgeon was unable to remove the bullet that is still there and that Toadie may be paralysed. Angie returns to help out. Toadie struggles to accept his condition and the fact that he will have to use a wheelchair. After learning that his clients are leaving him, Toadie considers suing Naomi for compensation, but decides against it. On his return home, Toadie's confidence is knocked when Nell refuses to hug him, as she is scared of his wheelchair. In a bid to prove to Sonya that he can cope without her, Toadie looks after Nell alone, but he is unable to go after her when she runs outside and is almost hit by Sonya's car. Toadie's brother Stonefish visits to offer his support, and he encourages Toadie to attend a benefit in his honour. Steph returns, trying to rebuild her life, and she and Toadie make a pact to support each other. Toadie has surgery to remove the bullet from his spine, which he hopes will enable him to walk again. [[Belinda Bell]] (Nikki Shiels) threatens Toadie, as she believes he reported her relationship with Steph to the hospital board. Sonya interrupts Toadie's operation, fearing Belinda will sabotage it, causing a complication that leaves Toadie unable to have more children.\n\nAfter he is discharged, Sonya asks Belinda to assist Toadie's rehabilitation, and he begins walking again. Sonya tells Toadie that she hired Belinda because she was worried about his bond with Steph, causing a brief rift in their marriage. Toadie is trapped inside Lassiter's following a boiler explosion, but is later rescued. Toadie tries to keep Sonya's uncle [[Walter Mitchell (2016 character)|Walter]] ([[Greg Stone]]) from meeting her, as he is not yet sober. However, Walter arrives in town and they are reunited. Steph tries to persuade Toadie to represent Paul in his trial for the Lassiter's explosion, but he only agrees to do it if Paul pleads guilty. Toadie is shocked when Sonya suggests that she act as a surrogate for Steph and Mark, as Steph cannot cope with a pregnancy on account of her mental health problems. He agrees to talk to the couple about the idea, but is relieved when they reject it. He starts looking into ways of him and Sonya having another baby, but his plans are thrown when Steph and Mark change their mind. Toadie gets back on board with the plan again, realising Nell is enough for him and Sonya. Stonie sends Toadie a photo he took of a woman that looks like Dee, leaving Toadie to wonder if she is still alive. He contemplates hiring a private investigator to look into her disappearance. Sonya announces she is pregnant with Mark's child.\n\nDee shows up at Number 30, and explains how she survived the car crash. Toadie helps Dee with her claim on her family's estate. She later reveals that she was pregnant at the time of the car accident and introduces Toadie to their daughter [[Willow Somers|Willow]] (Mieke Billing-Smith). Toadie bonds with Willow and helps her gain entry to a private school. He struggles with his feelings for Dee, and Sonya's closeness with Mark. Toadie hands over a bankers draft for $100,000 to Dee, and he later finds that she and Willow have left town for London. With Sonya's blessing, Toadie goes to London to find them. When Toadie calls home, Nell answers the phone and tells him Sonya is in bed with Mark. He assumes that Sonya has cheated on him and confronts her during a video call. He fails to close the call properly, and when Dee comes to his room to talk, Sonya sees him and Dee have sex. While Dee is in the shower, Toadie finds her passport with the name [[Andrea Somers]] (West) on it. She soon admits that she is not Dee, but she does love him. Toadie rejects her and quickly leaves the hotel. Willow tries to talk to him, but he walks into the road and is hit by a taxi. At the hospital, Karl visits him and reveals that Sonya has had a miscarriage and that she saw him have sex with Andrea.\n\nUpon his return to Erinsborough, he misses the memorial for Caitlin and rushes to see Sonya. Consumed by her grief, Sonya resolves to end their marriage and Toadie moves in with Shane and his family. Toadie vows to salvage his marriage and is devastated when a broken Sonya relapses. Angie urges him to fight Sonya for custody of Nell, but he refuses and brings Callum back to Australia in an attempt to pull Sonya back on track. She eventually agrees to return home and things improve between her and Toadie. Willow briefly returns to Erinsborough and Toadie forgives her for her part in Andrea's scheme. He helps her reconnect with her biological father and she moves away. Sonya urges Toadie to work through his grief for Dee and he begins seeing a psychologist, [[Sam Feldman]] (Alex Tsitsopoulos). He later learns Sam is a former boyfriend of Sonya and becomes jealous of their rekindled friendship. The situation makes Sonya realise she loves Toadie and they finally reconcile; he moves back into No.30 and they renew their wedding vows. Months after their reunion, Sonya convinces Toadie to hire a private detective to find Andrea and reclaim their missing $100,000. Willow urges them to stay away from Andrea; it later conspires that Toadie's one-night stand with Andrea resulted in her falling pregnant. Sindi Watts arrives in Erinsborough with Toadie and Andrea's six-month-old son, [[Hugo Somers]] (John Turner). While Toadie is quickly smitten with Hugo, Sonya struggles with the idea of raising Andrea's child, and she later tracks Andrea to a psychiatric facility in Hobart. Toadie visits Andrea, who is delusional and believes she is Dee. Sonya commits to raising Hugo and the Rebecchis agree to pay for Andrea's care on the condition she has no contact with them.\n\nToadie and Sonya struggle to raise Nell and Hugo alongside running their businesses and hire [[Alice Wells (Neighbours)|Alice Wells]] ([[Kerry Armstrong]]) as their live-in nanny. Sonya begins behaving strangely and Toadie worries that she may have relapsed. She later disappears, but it conspires that Alice \u2013 who is Andrea's biological mother \u2013 has been drugging Sonya with strong painkillers and has poisoned her. With the help of Willow, Toadie finds Sonya at the roadside and rushes her to hospital. Sonya is discharged but remains in pain for several weeks. She collapses and tests reveal she has stage four [[ovarian cancer]]. Toadie is devastated and supports his wife as she begins intensive chemotherapy. Sonya visits Andrea and convinces her to give Toadie full custody of Hugo. Sonya's cancer becomes public knowledge and both Callum and Jade return to Erinsborough to support the family. However, Sonya's health deteriorates rapidly and she dies in Toadie's arms during a visit to the beach. After Sonya's memorial, Toadie decides to take Nell and Hugo overseas, staying close to Callum as they work through their grief.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box|width=21%|align=right|bgcolor=#FDF5E6|quote=\"Who could be a better friend and neighbour than \"Toadfish\" Rebecchi?

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 23 January 1995. Toadie was created by writer Elizabeth Packett. Moloney had previously auditioned for another role in the show and had played a minor character, before being cast as Toadie. The actor was originally scheduled to play Toadie in one scene, but he went on to become a recurring cast member. When Toadie became popular with viewers, Moloney was promoted to the regular cast. In 2015, Moloney celebrated his 20th anniversary with ''Neighbours''.\n\nToadie was initially portrayed as a troubled teenager and a \"class clown\". After qualifying as a lawyer, Toadie matured and became a responsible member of the community. Despite being labelled \"unlucky in love\", Toadie has had several love interests and has been married three times. Toadie has received mostly positive attention from television critics and viewers. For his portrayal of Toadie, Moloney earned a nomination for Best Actor in a Soap at the 2004 [[Rose d'Or|Rose d'Or Awards]]. In 2010, Moloney won the very first Best Daytime Star award at the [[Inside Soap Awards]]. He has since won it three more times in 2011, 2012 and 2019. He has also been nominated for the [[Logie Award for Most Popular Actor]].\n\n==Creation and casting==\nThe character of Toadfish was created by writer Elizabeth Packett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/neighbours/news/quiz-neighbours-writer-elizabeth-packett-10290|title=Quiz Neighbours writer Elizabeth Packett!|date=14 October 2010|publisher=[[Holy Soap]]|accessdate=14 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024040055/http://holysoap.five.tv/neighbours/news/quiz-neighbours-writer-elizabeth-packett-10290|archivedate=24 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Actor [[Ryan Moloney]] was cast in the role after previously auditioning for the role of [[Brett Stark]] and appearing as a minor character called Cyborg, who vandalised the Willis family's property.<ref name=\"Show\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesoapshow.com/soap_stars/ryanmoloney.htm|title=Ryan Moloney Interview|publisher=The Soap Show|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> Moloney made his first appearance as Toadie during the episode broadcast on 23 January 1995.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 2306|series=Neighbours|serieslink=Neighbours|credits=Executive producer: Stanley Walsh; Director: Geoff Hunt; Writer: Karyn Noble|network=[[Network Ten]]|airdate=23 January 1995}}</ref><ref name=\"Wulff\">{{cite journal|last=Wulff|first=Alana|date=12\u201325 February 2015|title=My first day on set|journal=[[TV Week Soap Extra]]|issue=15}}</ref> He recalled that his first scene lasted for ten minutes and that it featured Toadie begging his brother, [[Stonefish Rebecchi|Stonefish]] (Anthony Engelman), to take him to the beach.<ref name=\"Wulff\"/> Moloney was originally contracted to play Toadie in that one scene, but he went on to become a recurring character.<ref name=\"LastBroadcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/interviews/v/3099-ryan-moloney-neighbours-toadie-rebecchi-interview.html |title=Ryan Moloney (Neighbours' Toadie Rebecchi) Interview |publisher=Last Broadcast |accessdate=1 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308184944/http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/interviews/v/3099-ryan-moloney-neighbours-toadie-rebecchi-interview.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}</ref> He thought the producers kept him on as he looked similar to Engelman when he was younger and they wanted to see more of the Rebecchi family.<ref name=\"Wulff\"/> Toadie proved to be popular with the ''Neighbours'' viewers and he was asked to continue on the show full-time.<ref name=\"LastBroadcast\"/><ref name=\"DSInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/interviews/a147657/ryan-moloney-toadie-neighbours.html|title=Ryan Moloney (Toadie 'Neighbours')|last=Balls|first=David|date=27 February 2009|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy 2003 Moloney said he had remained grounded and surpassed the \"big-headed stuff\" that comes with being in a soap opera.<ref name=teddy>{{cite web|last=Moynihan|first=Stephen|title=Toadfish to teddy bear|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/20/1047749869628.html|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=20 July 2011|date=20 March 2003}}</ref> Moloney celebrated his 15th year on ''Neighbours'' in 2010.

A few months later, Toadie is sent back to Erinsborough and he decides to try to make a go of things at school. Toadie discovers that he has an above average IQ and is put into an accelerated learning class, but he keeps up his mischievous ways. Toadie becomes good friends with [[Hannah Martin]] ([[Rebecca Ritters]]) and [[Lance Wilkinson]] ([[Andrew Bibby]]). Toadie is horrified to learn that his mother and father plan to leave Erinsborough, so he and Billy convince Karl and [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) to let Toadie move in. Toadie passes his exams and studies law at Eden Hills University. He becomes a popular DJ on Uni FM, moves in with [[Lou Carpenter]] ([[Tom Oliver]]) and takes a job at Lou's Place. Toadie moves into Number 30 with [[Sarah Beaumont]] ([[Nicola Charles]]) and [[Joel Samuels]] ([[Daniel MacPherson]]). Toadie briefly becomes a guardian to his cousin, [[Tad Reeves|Tad]] ([[Jonathon Dutton]]). Toadie and Joel meet [[Dee Bliss]] ([[Madeleine West]]) and [[Vanessa Bradshaw]] (Julieanne Tait) on a night out. Dee later moves in with them.\n\nToadie is not happy when [[Geri Hallett]] ([[Isabella Dunwill]]) becomes his new Uni FM co-host and he plots to get her fired. His new co-host is Steph and Toadie develops feelings for her, but they decide to just be friends. Toadie is sacked from Uni FM, when he gives out some illegal advice. He is charged with inciting a crime and he decides to defend himself. Toadie becomes friends with law student [[Maggie Hancock]] (Sally Cooper) and she helps Toadie win his case. A romance develops between Toadie and [[Sheena Wilson]] ([[Zoe Stark]]), but when he tells her that her mother keeps coming onto him, Sheena breaks up with him. Toadie gets a job with a corporate law firm and becomes involved in Karl and Susan's divorce. He later works for [[Tim Collins (Neighbours)|Tim Collins]] ([[Ben Anderson (actor)|Ben Anderson]]). Toadie falls in love with Dee and the couple get engaged. Shortly after they wed, Toadie drives their car off a cliff into the sea and Dee goes missing, devastating Toadie. A while later, Toadie falls for [[Sindi Watts]] ([[Marisa Warrington]]) and they start dating. With his friend, Connor, Toadie becomes a wrestler. He meets Genevieve and they begin a relationship, but it ends when she goes on tour.\n\nToadie is left a bikini store by client and he runs it with Connor. When Connor goes missing, Toadie believes he has been killed by [[Robert Robinson (Neighbours)|Robert Robinson]] ([[Adam Hunter (actor)|Adam Hunter]]). Connor later sends Toadie some gifts and proves he is still alive. Toadie is shot in the back by [[Guy Sykes]] ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]) and he almost dies. Steph tells Toadie that she loves him, but she goes back to her husband. Toadie dates [[List of Neighbours characters (2007)#Abby Stafford|Abby Stafford]] ([[Louise Crawford]]), but their relationship ends when he realises that he is still in love with Steph. Toadie and Steph become a couple and they get engaged. However, on their wedding day, Toadie realises that Steph does not love him and he leaves her to go travelling. Toadie becomes Callum Jones's guardian after his grandmother is taken to hospital. Toadie briefly dates Callum's teacher, Kelly. Guy Sykes returns and holds Toadie and Callum hostage. Toadie helps Callum escape and wrestles Guy to the ground, before the police arrive. Toadie discovers that his dog [[Bob (Neighbours)|Bob]] has cancer and he has him put to sleep. Bob's ashes are scattered at the lake.\n\nToadie gets Callum a new dog called Rocky and they train him to be a guide dog. During Rocky's training, Toadie and Callum are visited by Sonya Mitchell. Toadie asks her out, but she initially turns him down. Toadie and [[Elle Robinson]] ([[Pippa Black]]) believe Sonya and [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]) are seeing each other, but Sonya reveals she is his Gamblers Anonymous sponsor. Sonya and Toadie begin a relationship. Toadie agrees to help Steph cover up the fact she is pregnant with [[Daniel Fitzgerald (Neighbours)|Daniel Fitzgerald]]'s ([[Brett Tucker]]) baby. They tell their family and friends that they are back together and they decide to get married. Toadie eventually tells Sonya the truth and asks her to wait for him. [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) starts blackmailing Toadie and later reveals Steph's secret during a public event, devastating Dan's wife [[Libby Kennedy]] ([[Kym Valentine]]). Toadie falls out with Libby, while Karl and Susan tell Toadie that he is no longer part of the family. Callum also becomes angry with Toadie, but Sonya gets them talking again.\n\nToadie defends Steph when she is charged with the accidental death of [[Ringo Brown]] ([[Sam Clark]]), but she is sent to prison. Sonya moves in, as does her sister, [[Jade Mitchell|Jade]] ([[Gemma Pranita]]), who clashes with Toadie. Callum tries to find his mother and realises that she is Sonya. Toadie asks her to leave and cuts off contact with her. Toadie calls [[Harold Bishop]] ([[Ian Smith (actor)|Ian Smith]]) for help, while Lucas convinces Toadie that Sonya loves him. Callum's father, [[Troy Miller (Neighbours)|Troy Miller]] ([[Dieter Brummer]]), arrives and Toadie allows Callum and Troy to spend time together. Sonya and Toadie get back together. Troy turns nasty and punches Toadie, before Callum tells him to leave. Toadie takes a job with law firm Simmons & Colbert, so he and Sonya can get a loan to purchase the community gardens. Toadie begins representing The Hamilton Group, who want to build a new shopping complex in Erinsborough. Toadie is forced into relocating the development's car park or risk being fired by [[Peter Noonan (Neighbours)|Peter Noonan]] (James Saunders).\n\nToadie offers Lucas, Lou and [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) money for their businesses, so the car park can be built in their place. Lou accepts the offer on Kyle's behalf, while Lucas declines it. Peter start putting pressure on Toadie to get Lucas to sell. Lucas declines all of Toadie's offers and he blames the law firm for sabotaging his garage. When Lucas's apprentice, [[Chris Pappas (Neighbours)|Chris Pappas]] (James Mason), is attacked, Toadie is questioned by the police and he realises that Peter is setting him up. Paul gives him an alibi, but the wrench Chris was attacked with is found in Toadie's car. [[Lewis Walton]] (Andy McPhee) is later arrested for attacking Chris, but he states that Toadie hired him. Toadie poses as Lewis' lawyer and when Lewis does not recognise him, the charges against him are dropped. [[Charlotte McKemmie]] (Meredith Penman) takes over Peter's job and informs Toadie that he is being let go from the law firm. However, after Toadie decides to sue for wrongful dismissal, he is given his job back.\n\nSonya and Toadie struggle to conceive a child and a fertility test shows that Toadie has a low sperm count. Toadie starts a health kick in a bid to increase his chances of conception, but test results indicate his count is still low. Toadie suggests they try IVF or a sperm donor, but Sonya tells him that she knows that it is not what he wants. Before donating blood at the hospital, Sonya takes a pregnancy test and learns that she is pregnant. Troy purchases Number 32 and makes it clear that he wants to be a part of Callum's life. He hires Toadie's friend [[Ajay Kapoor (Neighbours)|Ajay Kapoor]] (Sachin Joab) to help him gain access. When Troy goads Toadie about Sonya and the baby, Toadie punches him and is later served with an intervention order. He is forced to leave the street. Sonya collapses from the stress, but she and the baby are fine. Troy drops the custody case when Callum agrees to spend time with him.\n\nTroy holds Sonya and Jade hostage, but is injured during their escape. Toadie finds Troy unconscious on the floor, but when he returns with the paramedics, Troy is gone. He is later admitted to hospital, but he leaves early to go to the school to get Callum. Toadie finds them and tries to reason with Troy. When Callum tells him to go, Troy tries to drive away, but dies from a head injury. Toadie and Callum attend his funeral together. Toadie starts a [[Twitter]] account for the baby and tries to be Sonya's birthing coach as he feels left out of the pregnancy. When they learn they are having a daughter, Toadie and Sonya decide to name her Nell. Toadie's cousin, [[Georgia Brooks]] ([[Saskia Hampele]]), moves in and Connor turns up after six years. He and Toadie soon revert to their House of Trouser ways. Toadie proposes to Sonya and she accepts. Sonya gives birth to [[Nell Rebecchi|Nell]] (Scarlett Anderson) via caesarean section. She falls unconscious and has to undergo surgery, leaving Toadie and Callum to care for Nell on their own for a few days.\n\nDespite believing his wedding is jinxed, Toadie and Sonya marry. However, during the reception a gas bottle explodes, causing the marquee to collapse and injure Sonya, who suffers amnesia. Her memories return when Toadie organises a vow renewal ceremony for them. Steph returns to Erinsborough following her release from prison. She refuses to forgive Toadie for botching her case, but later apologises to him when she is arrested again. Ajay and Toadie go into partnership together. When Sonya is threatened by [[Robbo Slade]] (Aaron Jakubenko), as she is the witness in his court case, Toadie tries to protect his wife. After Robbo spikes Toadie's drink, he wakes up the next morning with no memory of the night before. Robbo dies after being involved in a hit-and-run and Toadie is convinced he did it. However, [[Hudson Walsh]] ([[Remy Hii]]) admits that he was responsible for Robbo's death. Toadie and Sonya's marriage becomes strained when she starts spending less time at home with her family to help out other people, including single father [[Jacob Holmes (Neighbours)|Jacob Holmes]] ([[Clayton Watson]]), who kisses her.\n\nToadie hires [[Naomi Canning]] ([[Morgana O'Reilly]]) as his executive assistant. He is impressed when she brings in new business and offers her comfort when she reveals that she is being stalked. Callum gets a scholarship to a school in the United States and Toadie convinces Sonya to let him go. Naomi admits she has feelings for Toadie and kisses him. He realises that she has been manipulating him and Sonya, and fires her. Sonya and Toadie agree to cut back on their work, so that they can spend more time together as a couple. Toadie is hit by a car driven by [[Kathy Carpenter]] ([[Tina Bursill]]) and he suffers a fractured [[coccyx]]. Toadie receives a [[poison pen letter]] detailing Sonya's addictions. After he and the neighbours receive more letters, Toadie asks [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) for his help in identifying the sender. It later emerges that Sonya's former best friend [[Erin Rogers]] ([[Adrienne Pickering]]) sent the letters, as she blames Sonya for introducing her to drugs. Sonya invites Erin to stay and her daughter [[Cat Rogers|Cat]] (Maleeka Gasbarri) visits. Cat bonds with Toadie and later asks to live with him and Sonya, but they help her to reconcile with her foster mother. Toadie helps Kyle out for the day, but accidentally causes a power outage.\n\nWhile attending an open day for the new childcare centre, Toadie is injured when he tries to rescue Nell from a bouncy castle that is not anchored to the ground. He is unable to feel his legs and undergoes surgery to stabilise a [[Thoracic spinal nerve 5|T5 vertebra]] fracture. Karl informs Sonya that the surgeon was unable to remove the bullet that is still there and that Toadie may be paralysed. Angie returns to help out. Toadie struggles to accept his condition and the fact that he will have to use a wheelchair. After learning that his clients are leaving him, Toadie considers suing Naomi for compensation, but decides against it. On his return home, Toadie's confidence is knocked when Nell refuses to hug him, as she is scared of his wheelchair. In a bid to prove to Sonya that he can cope without her, Toadie looks after Nell alone, but he is unable to go after her when she runs outside and is almost hit by Sonya's car. Toadie's brother Stonefish visits to offer his support, and he encourages Toadie to attend a benefit in his honour. Steph returns, trying to rebuild her life, and she and Toadie make a pact to support each other. Toadie has surgery to remove the bullet from his spine, which he hopes will enable him to walk again. [[Belinda Bell]] (Nikki Shiels) threatens Toadie, as she believes he reported her relationship with Steph to the hospital board. Sonya interrupts Toadie's operation, fearing Belinda will sabotage it, causing a complication that leaves Toadie unable to have more children.\n\nAfter he is discharged, Sonya asks Belinda to assist Toadie's rehabilitation, and he begins walking again. Sonya tells Toadie that she hired Belinda because she was worried about his bond with Steph, causing a brief rift in their marriage. Toadie is trapped inside Lassiter's following a boiler explosion, but is later rescued. Toadie tries to keep Sonya's uncle [[Walter Mitchell (2016 character)|Walter]] ([[Greg Stone]]) from meeting her, as he is not yet sober. However, Walter arrives in town and they are reunited. Steph tries to persuade Toadie to represent Paul in his trial for the Lassiter's explosion, but he only agrees to do it if Paul pleads guilty. Toadie is shocked when Sonya suggests that she act as a surrogate for Steph and Mark, as Steph cannot cope with a pregnancy on account of her mental health problems. He agrees to talk to the couple about the idea, but is relieved when they reject it. He starts looking into ways of him and Sonya having another baby, but his plans are thrown when Steph and Mark change their mind. Toadie gets back on board with the plan again, realising Nell is enough for him and Sonya. Stonie sends Toadie a photo he took of a woman that looks like Dee, leaving Toadie to wonder if she is still alive. He contemplates hiring a private investigator to look into her disappearance. Sonya announces she is pregnant with Mark's child.\n\nDee shows up at Number 30, and explains how she survived the car crash. Toadie helps Dee with her claim on her family's estate. She later reveals that she was pregnant at the time of the car accident and introduces Toadie to their daughter [[Willow Somers|Willow]] (Mieke Billing-Smith). Toadie bonds with Willow and helps her gain entry to a private school. He struggles with his feelings for Dee, and Sonya's closeness with Mark. Toadie hands over a bankers draft for $100,000 to Dee, and he later finds that she and Willow have left town for London. With Sonya's blessing, Toadie goes to London to find them. When Toadie calls home, Nell answers the phone and tells him Sonya is in bed with Mark. He assumes that Sonya has cheated on him and confronts her during a video call. He fails to close the call properly, and when Dee comes to his room to talk, Sonya sees him and Dee have sex. While Dee is in the shower, Toadie finds her passport with the name [[Andrea Somers]] (West) on it. She soon admits that she is not Dee, but she does love him. Toadie rejects her and quickly leaves the hotel. Willow tries to talk to him, but he walks into the road and is hit by a taxi. At the hospital, Karl visits him and reveals that Sonya has had a miscarriage and that she saw him have sex with Andrea.\n\nUpon his return to Erinsborough, he misses the memorial for Caitlin and rushes to see Sonya. Consumed by her grief, Sonya resolves to end their marriage and Toadie moves in with Shane and his family. Toadie vows to salvage his marriage and is devastated when a broken Sonya relapses. Angie urges him to fight Sonya for custody of Nell, but he refuses and brings Callum back to Australia in an attempt to pull Sonya back on track. She eventually agrees to return home and things improve between her and Toadie. Willow briefly returns to Erinsborough and Toadie forgives her for her part in Andrea's scheme. He helps her reconnect with her biological father and she moves away. Sonya urges Toadie to work through his grief for Dee and he begins seeing a psychologist, [[Sam Feldman]] (Alex Tsitsopoulos). He later learns Sam is a former boyfriend of Sonya and becomes jealous of their rekindled friendship. The situation makes Sonya realise she loves Toadie and they finally reconcile; he moves back into No.30 and they renew their wedding vows. Months after their reunion, Sonya convinces Toadie to hire a private detective to find Andrea and reclaim their missing $100,000. Willow urges them to stay away from Andrea; it later conspires that Toadie's one-night stand with Andrea resulted in her falling pregnant. Sindi Watts arrives in Erinsborough with Toadie and Andrea's six-month-old son, [[Hugo Somers]] (John Turner). While Toadie is quickly smitten with Hugo, Sonya struggles with the idea of raising Andrea's child, and she later tracks Andrea to a psychiatric facility in Hobart. Toadie visits Andrea, who is delusional and believes she is Dee. Sonya commits to raising Hugo and the Rebecchis agree to pay for Andrea's care on the condition she has no contact with them.\n\nToadie and Sonya struggle to raise Nell and Hugo alongside running their businesses and hire [[Alice Wells (Neighbours)|Alice Wells]] ([[Kerry Armstrong]]) as their live-in nanny. Sonya begins behaving strangely and Toadie worries that she may have relapsed. She later disappears, but it conspires that Alice \u2013 who is Andrea's biological mother \u2013 has been drugging Sonya with strong painkillers and has poisoned her. With the help of Willow, Toadie finds Sonya at the roadside and rushes her to hospital. Sonya is discharged but remains in pain for several weeks. She collapses and tests reveal she has stage four [[ovarian cancer]]. Toadie is devastated and supports his wife as she begins intensive chemotherapy. Sonya visits Andrea and convinces her to give Toadie full custody of Hugo. Sonya's cancer becomes public knowledge and both Callum and Jade return to Erinsborough to support the family. However, Sonya's health deteriorates rapidly and she dies in Toadie's arms during a visit to the beach. After Sonya's memorial, Toadie decides to take Nell and Hugo overseas, staying close to Callum as they work through their grief.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box|width=21%|align=right|bgcolor=#FDF5E6|quote=\"Who could be a better friend and neighbour than \"Toadfish\" Rebecchi?

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]].

In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to [[Iowa]], where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klink's Curtiss JN-4C \"Canuck\" (the Canadian version of the Jenny).

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]].

{"title_page": "Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlog", "text_new": "'''Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlock''' (1520{{spaced ndash}}c.1587) was an  prominent and politically  influential lawyer in Ireland in  the mid-sixteenth century. He held the  office of [[Attorney General for Ireland]],  and was  the first  holder of the office  to be so described. He  was for a short time  the acting  [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]]. In  later life  he became a leading opponent of the Crown's  policies and was imprisoned as a result.\n\n==Background==\nHe was a native of [[Bective, County Meath]]. The family name is an early form of Sherlock. They were  originally from [[Wales]]: a branch of the family came to Ireland  with [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] in the twelfth century. The Irish Skurlocks are associated mainly with Meath, and gave their name to Skurlockstown. Barnaby's parentage is obscure.  Sir Henry Sidney in 1577 made a  reference to his \"father and grandfather\"  as  having acquired substantial estates, and his father  was probably the Barnabas Skurlock who received a grant of lands in Meath in 1529.<ref>Collins, Arian E.  ''The Sherlocks of  Ireland and Wales''  Bordertown Publishing  San Diego  2011 p.16.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBarnaby attended [[Lincoln's Inn]] and then  returned to practice law in Ireland.

He held the  office of [[Attorney General for Ireland]],  and was  the first  holder of the office  to be so described. He  was for a short time  the acting  [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]]. In  later life  he became a leading opponent of the Crown's  policies and was imprisoned as a result.\n\n==Background==\nHe was a native of [[Bective, County Meath]]. The family name is an early form of Sherlock. They were  originally from [[Wales]]: a branch of the family came to Ireland  with [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] in the twelfth century. The Irish Skurlocks are associated mainly with Meath, and gave their name to Skurlockstown. Barnaby's parentage is obscure.  Sir Henry Sidney in 1577 made a  reference to his \"father and grandfather\"  as  having acquired substantial estates, and his father  was probably the Barnabas Skurlock who received a grant of lands in Meath in 1529.<ref>Collins, Arian E.

This definitely tipped the scale of political influence in favor of the Storting, and it is not easy to see the reasons for the King's acceptance of this reform. The major reason was probably the growing necessity to get updated budgets, which was naturally the Storting's task to provide.\n\nDuring the 1860s, the views towards the ministers' participation in the parliamentary sessions had changed totally. The ministerials, as they were called, were now unanimously against, because they had seen the formation of the peasants' friends as a threat to what they deemed to be the ideal, the totally independent representative. The peasants and the radicals on the other hand, had drawn the obviously correct conclusion that this reform would further the influence of the elected towards the appointed ministers.\n\nIn 1870, the Storting passed a change in the constitution which granted the ministers admission to Parliament when asked, but the King refused to sanction the law, stating that it was premature so few years after the yearly sessions reform. In 1872 the new king, [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]], decided that Norway, in its precarious situation with the Council mostly convening in the capital, Christiania (now Oslo), while the king mostly lived in Sweden's capital Stockholm needed two Prime Ministers, one in each capital. Until then there had only been one in Stockholm, because the Council in Christiania was supposed to be led by an appointed governor, a position which had been vacant for 15 years because no Swedish king had dared or wished to appoint a new governor.\n\nThis made an extremely minor change in the suggested change in the constitution, when it was passed in 1873, necessary, namely that there were now two Prime Ministers, while there was only one in the previous law text. The changed constitution was not sanctioned this time either. The same happened in 1876 and 1879, and now a major problem had occurred, which made Norwegian politics extremely difficult for several years. The Constitution explicitly stated that the king had a veto three times in law and budget matters, but there was no mention of any kind of veto concerning constitutional matters.\n\nThis omission gave way to three possibilities:\n\n# The king had no veto at all\n# The king had an absolute veto\n# The king had the same veto rights as in all other matters\n\nThe opposition which made up a vast majority, had practically rejected the first possibility and decided upon the third, whereas the Council and the minority of the Storting was certain of the king's absolute veto.\n\n== The strife hardens ==\nThe strife which had started as a practical political reform had now turned into a political debacle which would have to change the checks and balances between the legislative and the executive branch. This had definitely become Sverdrup's goal. \"All power must be gathered in the halls of the Storting\" became his political program. In 1879 his party in the making made a coup by promulgating the new change in the constitution. This took the Council by surprise that the grand old man of the Council, Prime Minister [[Frederik Stang]], resigned. The new Prime Minister, [[Christian Selmer]], was not such a leader and force in the Council, and Sverdrup was ready for the next move, which should constitutionally have been taken in 1881. But Sverdrup's majority was not great enough to be certain of a victory in the forthcoming impeachment of the Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nbl.snl.no/Frederik_Stang|title=Frederik Stang|publisher= Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Paul Thyness|accessdate= April 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nbl.snl.no/Christian_Selmer|title=Christian Selmer\n|publisher = Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Paul Thyness|accessdate= April 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1882 general elections Sverdrup's party won a convincing majority.

In Norwegian tradition the transition from Montesquieu's ideal of checks and balances to a parliamentary system took place when he became Prime Minister. There is evidence that Sverdrup himself never really understood the consequences of a parliamentary system. Hence his five years in power with a vast majority in support, was no triumph march, but a row of defeats in Parliament. It is not far from a personal tragedy, and his resignation in 1889 was the only possible finale to a rather unworthy drama that took place within the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Venstre]].\n\n== Sverdrup's government ==\nIt turned out from the first day that Sverdrup as a Prime Minister was not the competent strategist that most Norwegians had either learned to fear or admire. He expected his adherents to follow him as they had done for almost 30 years. It also turns out that Venstre was a more loosely knit coalition than Sverdrup and the other leaders had expected. The fight against the powerful executive branch had created alliances that broke very quickly afterwards. Sverdrup and all his ministers belonged to the conservative faction of the party. They had strong support what the leading Norwegian sociologist, Stein Rokkan, labeled the periphery, adherents of lay Christianity in opposition to the clergy, adherents of the so-called New Norwegian in opposition to the Norwegian spoken in the cities, adherents of totalitarianism.\n\nHis great mistake was to refuse to include anyone from the radical faction and to further alienate them by not accepting their advice in any of the difficult political situations that arose in those years. In the 1885 general election the party's slogan was \"Have confidence in Johan Sverdrup\" which later has been deemed one of the most ridiculous slogans ever created. A party without ability to find anything to unite about will have no long life, and the breach in the party became evident throughout the three years before the next general elections.\n\nSverdrup and his colleagues and diminishing group in the Storting were more or less expelled from the party and had to start their own Venstre. The original party, now led by Sverdrup's leading opponents, Ullmann and Steen, voted against him and mocked the elder statesman for clinging to the \"Chair\", but he was saved by H\u00f8yre which had no intentions to diminish the strife within the Venstre, and believed that their best hope was to leave the Sverdrup ministry in peace until the general elections in 1888. After those elections, which proved fully that H\u00f8yre strategy had been a sound one, Sverdrup's ministry was quickly ousted.\n\n== Father of Parliamentarism ==\nThe views towards this controversial political leader will differ greatly with the political and historical affiliation of those expressing a view. It can not be denied that Sverdrup was an extremely skilled and able opposition leader and strategist whose influence of domestic politics was enormous for about 30 years. What can be said against such a viewpoint, is that most of the results of his opposition was destructive because he sold his radical and social liberal political views in order to gain influence in Jaab\u00e6k's loosely knit alliance of peasants. On the other hand one tends to forget that there was a class struggle between the peasants and the public servant and tradesmen classes, which in Norway with no nobility, were the most influential, and that Sverdrup, a public servant, joined the vast and less influential group of peasants in order to transform the society.\n\nHis weakness was his inability to bury hatchets and his apparent lack of flexibility in older age. His inability to understand the concept of parliamentarism, which seemed to be the ultimate goal of his policies. His clinging to the symbols of power can be ascribed to his age, but he was only about 70. Most historians would conclude that his fight against the king's appointed Council lasted too long. He was too old to harvest the fruits, but he paved the way for a new political situation in Norway.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Other sources==\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.stortinget.no/Stortinget-og-demokratiet/Historikk/Historiske-biografier/Johan-Sverdrup/|title=Johan Sverdrup \u2013 \"parlamentarismens far\"|work=stortinget.no |date=January 10, 2009|accessdate=21 January 2013|language=no}}\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/the-government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/ministries-and-offices/offices/prime-minister-since-1814/johan-sverdrup.html?id=440558|title= Johan Sverdrup|work=regjeringen.no|accessdate=21 January 2013}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{NIE Poster|year=1905|Sverdrup, Johan|Johan Sverdrup}}\n*[http://vestraat.net/TNG/getperson.php?personID=I94560&tree=IEA Family genealogy]\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Sverdrup, Johan |short=x}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box | before=[[Christian Homann Schweigaard]]| title=[[List of Norwegian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister of Norway]] | years=1884\u20131889| after=[[Emil Stang]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{NorwegianPrimeMinisters}}\n{{Liberal Party (Norway)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sverdrup, Johan}}\n[[Category:1816 births]]\n[[Category:1892 deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from T\u00f8nsberg]]\n[[Category:Norwegian lawyers]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (Norway) politicians]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Storting]]\n[[Category:Members of the Storting]]\n[[Category:19th-century Norwegian politicians]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Norway]]\n[[Category:Burials at V\u00e5r Frelsers gravlund]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the Norwegian politician|the oil field named after him|Johan Sverdrup oil field}}\n{{Infobox Prime Minister\n| honorific-prefix = \n| name = Johan Sverdrup\n| honorific-suffix = \n| image = Johan Sverdrup.jpg\n| order = [[Prime Minister of Norway]]\n| monarch = [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]]\n| term_start = 1884\n| term_end = 1889\n| predecessor = [[Christian Homann Schweigaard]]\n| successor = [[Emil Stang]]\n| order2 = [[Liberal Party (Norway)#Party leaders|Leader of the Liberal Party]]\n| predecessor2 = ''Office established''\n| successor2 = [[Ole Anton Qvam]]\n| term_start2 = 1884\n| term_end2 = 1884\n| order3 = [[Storting|Member of the Norwegian Parliament]]\n| term_start3 = 1 October 1851\n| term_end3 = 30 September 1884\n| constituency3 = [[Vestfold]]\n| birth_date = 30 July 1816\n| birth_place = [[Sem]], [[Norway]]\n| birthname = Johan Sverdrup\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|df=yes|1892|2|17|1816|7|30}}\n| death_place = [[Oslo|Christiania]]\n| nationality = [[Norway|Norwegian]]\n| party = [[Venstre (Norway)|Liberal Party]]\n| spouse = Caroline Sverdrup\n| relations = \n| children = \n| residence = \n| alma_mater = \n| occupation = [[Politician]]\n| profession = [[Lawyer]]\n| religion = \n| signature = \n| website = \n| footnotes = \n}}\n'''Johan Sverdrup''' (30 July 1816 \u2013 17 February 1892) was a Norwegian politician from the [[Venstre (Norway)|Liberal Party]].

After those elections, which proved fully that H\u00f8yre strategy had been a sound one, Sverdrup's ministry was quickly ousted.\n\n== Father of Parliamentarism ==\nThe views towards this controversial political leader will differ greatly with the political and historical affiliation of those expressing a view. It can not be denied that Sverdrup was an extremely skilled and able opposition leader and strategist whose influence of domestic politics was enormous for about 30 years. What can be said against such a viewpoint, is that most of the results of his opposition was destructive because he sold his radical and social liberal political views in order to gain influence in Jaab\u00e6k's loosely knit alliance of peasants. On the other hand one tends to forget that there was a class struggle between the peasants and the public servant and tradesmen classes, which in Norway with no nobility, were the most influential, and that Sverdrup, a public servant, joined the vast and less influential group of peasants in order to transform the society.\n\nHis weakness was his inability to bury hatchets and his apparent lack of flexibility in older age. His inability to understand the concept of parliamentarism, which seemed to be the ultimate goal of his policies. His clinging to the symbols of power can be ascribed to his age, but he was only about 70. Most historians would conclude that his fight against the king's appointed Council lasted too long. He was too old to harvest the fruits, but he paved the way for a new political situation in Norway.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Other sources==\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.stortinget.no/Stortinget-og-demokratiet/Historikk/Historiske-biografier/Johan-Sverdrup/|title=Johan Sverdrup \u2013 \"parlamentarismens far\"|work=stortinget.no |date=January 10, 2009|accessdate=21 January 2013|language=no}}\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/the-government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/ministries-and-offices/offices/prime-minister-since-1814/johan-sverdrup.html?id=440558|title= Johan Sverdrup|work=regjeringen.no|accessdate=21 January 2013}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{NIE Poster|year=1905|Sverdrup, Johan|Johan Sverdrup}}\n*[http://vestraat.net/TNG/getperson.php?personID=I94560&tree=IEA Family genealogy]\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Sverdrup, Johan |short=x}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box | before=[[Christian Homann Schweigaard]]| title=[[List of Norwegian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister of Norway]] | years=1884\u20131889| after=[[Emil Stang]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{NorwegianPrimeMinisters}}\n{{Liberal Party (Norway)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sverdrup, Johan}}\n[[Category:1816 births]]\n[[Category:1892 deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from T\u00f8nsberg]]\n[[Category:Norwegian lawyers]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (Norway) politicians]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Storting]]\n[[Category:Members of the Storting]]\n[[Category:19th-century Norwegian politicians]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Norway]]\n[[Category:Burials at V\u00e5r Frelsers gravlund]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toSEM(link changed toSem, Norway) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Sverdrup"}
