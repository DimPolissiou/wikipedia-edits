The film was later remade in Tamil as ''[[Bangalore Naatkal]]'' (2016), directed by [[Bhaskar (director)|Bommarillu Bhaskar]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around three cousins, Divya Prakash aka 'Kunju' ([[Nazriya Nazim]]), Krishnan P.P. aka 'Kuttan' ([[Nivin Pauly]]) and Arjun aka 'Aju' ([[Dulquer Salmaan]]), who have shared a close bond since their childhood. Aju, whose parents are divorced, is a bike mechanic who lives life on his own terms. Kuttan is a [[software engineering|software engineer]] whose heart and soul is back home in his village. Kunju has completed her graduation and aspires to do her [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Indian Institutes of Management|IIM]], but is compelled to marry the workaholic corporate executive Shivadas aka 'Das' ([[Fahadh Faasil]]) because of her parents' astrologer's suggestions. After their wedding, Divya moves to Bangalore as Das is settled there. Kuttan does the same for his job, while Aju joins a biker gang as a mechanic in the same city.\n\nKunju feels emotionally alone as Das continues to ignore her. Her only solace is the time she gets to spend with her cousins. Naive Kuttan, who wants a traditional, modest, [[saree]]-clad girl for a wife, falls in love with [[air hostess]] Meenakshi ([[Isha Talwar]]) on the Bangalore-[[Kochi]] flight. They date, and Kuttan changes from a reserved and shy person to a trendy person to impress her, but his dreams are shattered when her ex-boyfriend arrives at her flat and he realizes that she was only trying to get back with him. He breaks off his relationship with her.\n\nKunju and Das's personal life keeps falling into despair. After an argument, one day, Kunju, upon inspecting a room in their apartment that Das never lets anyone enter, is shocked to find it filled with photos, knickknacks, and possessions of a strange girl ([[Nithya Menen]]). In horror of not having a place in Das's heart and life, she leaves him and returns home to Kerala in sorrow, with Kuttan. There they are still pulled into despair as Kuttan's father ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]) has abandoned his rich family and gone for a permanent pilgrimage, willing all his wealth and its rights to Kuttan and his sister. Kuttan has to bring his mother ([[Kalpana (Malayalam actress)|Kalpana]]) to Bangalore, after she convinces him to.\n\nAju was a bike racer, but due to a foul incident, he is forced to serve a year's ban from racing. He falls for a [[radio jockey]] named Sarah ([[Parvathy Thiruvothu|Parvathy]]), but when he finally meets her in person, he finds that she is a [[paraplegic]]. He begins to like her attitude and follows her. They become good friends, but Aju is saddened when he learns that Sarah is to leave for [[Australia]] on a university scholarship.\n\nMeanwhile, as Kunju and Das are in the middle of getting a divorce, Aju learns that a few years back, Das was a former bike racer. He then went by the name Shiva and was the leader of his biking gang. Shiva had given up on racing after he was involved in an accident that killed his love Natasha Francis ([[Nithya Menen]]). Upon knowing what happened, Kunju decides to return to Bangalore and takes up her MBA while staying in the same house as Das. She gradually wins over a repentant Das and arranges for him to meet Natasha's parents. After the meeting, Das is able to let go of his past. Kunju forgives him and they get their marital life on track.\n\nKuttan's mother gets to know about the urban Indian culture with her neighbors, and after three months, decides to visit her daughter in [[Oklahoma]]. In the airport, Kuttan and his mother see Meenakshi, who will be an air hostess in Kuttan's mother's flight to London. Meenakshi approaches Kuttan and reveals that her relationship with the old boyfriend has broken permanently, and she will be waiting for his call. Just seconds after that, Kuttan goes by and talks with her. Though what he says is not revealed, it is clear that he used vulgar language, and he tells his mom to board the flight.\n\nAju gets a chance to race on the same day that Sarah has to leave for Australia. With Kunju, Kuttan, and Das cheering for him, he wins the race. After the race, Aju realizes how important Sarah is to him and that meeting her changed his life. He asks her not to leave for Australia. Sarah forgoes her scholarship to stay with Aju in Bangalore. In the end, Kuttan marries his neighbor in Bangalore, a foreigner named Michelle ([[Paris Laxmi]]), a European [[Bharathanatyam]] dancer who has embraced the culture of India. The film ends with Kunju, Das, Aju, and Sarah breaking into their room and all of them posing for a photo.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please note, The cast order in per the film's closing credits.

The film was later remade in Tamil as ''[[Bangalore Naatkal]]'' (2016), directed by [[Bhaskar (director)|Bommarillu Bhaskar]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around three cousins, Divya Prakash aka 'Kunju' ([[Nazriya Nazim]]), Krishnan P.P. aka 'Kuttan' ([[Nivin Pauly]]) and Arjun aka 'Aju' ([[Dulquer Salmaan]]), who have shared a close bond since their childhood. Aju, whose parents are divorced, is a bike mechanic who lives life on his own terms. Kuttan is a [[software engineering|software engineer]] whose heart and soul is back home in his village. Kunju has completed her graduation and aspires to do her [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Indian Institutes of Management|IIM]], but is compelled to marry the workaholic corporate executive Shivadas aka 'Das' ([[Fahadh Faasil]]) because of her parents' astrologer's suggestions. After their wedding, Divya moves to Bangalore as Das is settled there. Kuttan does the same for his job, while Aju joins a biker gang as a mechanic in the same city.\n\nKunju feels emotionally alone as Das continues to ignore her. Her only solace is the time she gets to spend with her cousins. Naive Kuttan, who wants a traditional, modest, [[saree]]-clad girl for a wife, falls in love with [[air hostess]] Meenakshi ([[Isha Talwar]]) on the Bangalore-[[Kochi]] flight. They date, and Kuttan changes from a reserved and shy person to a trendy person to impress her, but his dreams are shattered when her ex-boyfriend arrives at her flat and he realizes that she was only trying to get back with him. He breaks off his relationship with her.\n\nKunju and Das's personal life keeps falling into despair. After an argument, one day, Kunju, upon inspecting a room in their apartment that Das never lets anyone enter, is shocked to find it filled with photos, knickknacks, and possessions of a strange girl ([[Nithya Menen]]). In horror of not having a place in Das's heart and life, she leaves him and returns home to Kerala in sorrow, with Kuttan. There they are still pulled into despair as Kuttan's father ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]) has abandoned his rich family and gone for a permanent pilgrimage, willing all his wealth and its rights to Kuttan and his sister. Kuttan has to bring his mother ([[Kalpana (Malayalam actress)|Kalpana]]) to Bangalore, after she convinces him to.\n\nAju was a bike racer, but due to a foul incident, he is forced to serve a year's ban from racing. He falls for a [[radio jockey]] named Sarah ([[Parvathy Thiruvothu|Parvathy]]), but when he finally meets her in person, he finds that she is a [[paraplegic]]. He begins to like her attitude and follows her. They become good friends, but Aju is saddened when he learns that Sarah is to leave for [[Australia]] on a university scholarship.\n\nMeanwhile, as Kunju and Das are in the middle of getting a divorce, Aju learns that a few years back, Das was a former bike racer. He then went by the name Shiva and was the leader of his biking gang. Shiva had given up on racing after he was involved in an accident that killed his love Natasha Francis ([[Nithya Menen]]). Upon knowing what happened, Kunju decides to return to Bangalore and takes up her MBA while staying in the same house as Das. She gradually wins over a repentant Das and arranges for him to meet Natasha's parents. After the meeting, Das is able to let go of his past. Kunju forgives him and they get their marital life on track.\n\nKuttan's mother gets to know about the urban Indian culture with her neighbors, and after three months, decides to visit her daughter in [[Oklahoma]]. In the airport, Kuttan and his mother see Meenakshi, who will be an air hostess in Kuttan's mother's flight to London. Meenakshi approaches Kuttan and reveals that her relationship with the old boyfriend has broken permanently, and she will be waiting for his call. Just seconds after that, Kuttan goes by and talks with her. Though what he says is not revealed, it is clear that he used vulgar language, and he tells his mom to board the flight.\n\nAju gets a chance to race on the same day that Sarah has to leave for Australia. With Kunju, Kuttan, and Das cheering for him, he wins the race. After the race, Aju realizes how important Sarah is to him and that meeting her changed his life. He asks her not to leave for Australia. Sarah forgoes her scholarship to stay with Aju in Bangalore. In the end, Kuttan gets married to his neighbor in Bangalore, a foreigner named Michelle ([[Paris Laxmi]]), a European [[Bharathanatyam]] dancer who has embraced the culture of India. The film ends with Kunju, Das, Aju, and Sarah breaking into their room and all of them posing for a photo.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please note, The cast order in per the film's closing credits.
