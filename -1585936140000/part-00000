As of October 2017 there were at least 1,246 confirmed deaths in the UK of people who were killed by the clotting agents Factor VIII & Factor IX and the viruses they transmitted. Some have estimated that the total number of those who have died could be as high as 2,400 though exact figures are not known.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, some people were infected with Hepatitis C via blood transfusions under entirely different circumstances. However, the Factor Concentrate products used by people with haemophilia were processed pharmaceutical products which bore no resemblance to blood transfusion. The infections to those with haemophilia were principally caused by the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] derived product known as [[Factor VIII]], a medicinal product that was sourced from the United States and elsewhere. The creation of such products involved dangerous manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/aug/04/bad-blood-cautionary-tale/|title=Bad Blood: A Cautionary Tale|website=Kpbs.org}}</ref> Large groups of paid donors were used (as many as 60,000 per batch, and including prisoners and drug addicts); it only required one infected donor to contaminate an entire batch, which would then infect all of the patients that received that material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemophilia.in/index.php/patient-education/product-safety|title=Hemophilia Federation (India) \u2013 Product Safety|website=Hemophilia.in}}</ref> In contrast, this was at a time when the practice of paying donors for [[whole blood]] in the United States had effectively ceased; the UK did not import whole blood<ref>{{cite web|last1= Glenarthur |first1=Simon|title=Blood: Licensing Requirements|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1983/dec/05/blood-licensing-requirements|website=Hansard|publisher=House of Lords}}</ref> from abroad, but it did import large quantities of Factor VIII given to those infected (as described in the documentary ''[[Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal]]'').

The consequence is that Lord Owen has done his best to recollect details of events a quarter of a century ago, but both he, and we, have been deprived of the primary sources\", Archer reported. Lord Jenkin also voiced his difficulties obtaining documents for the inquiry, although the report stated: \"He subsequently received from the Department two bundles of documents.

As of October 2017 there were at least 1,246 confirmed deaths in the UK of people who were killed by the clotting agents Factor VIII & Factor IX and the viruses they transmitted. Some have estimated that the total number of those who have died could be as high as 2,400 though exact figures are not known.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, some people were infected with Hepatitis C via blood transfusions under entirely different circumstances. However, the Factor Concentrate products used by people with haemophilia were processed pharmaceutical products which bore no resemblance to blood transfusion. The infections to those with haemophilia were principally caused by the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] derived product known as [[Factor VIII]], a medicinal product that was sourced from the United States and elsewhere. The creation of such products involved dangerous manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/aug/04/bad-blood-cautionary-tale/|title=Bad Blood: A Cautionary Tale|website=Kpbs.org}}</ref> Large groups of paid donors were used (as many as 60,000 per batch, and including prisoners and drug addicts); it only required one infected donor to contaminate an entire batch, which would then infect all of the patients that received that material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemophilia.in/index.php/patient-education/product-safety|title=Hemophilia Federation (India) \u2013 Product Safety|website=Hemophilia.in}}</ref> In contrast, this was at a time when the practice of paying donors for [[whole blood]] in the United States had effectively ceased; the UK did not import whole blood<ref>{{cite web|last1= Glenarthur |first1=Simon|title=Blood: Licensing Requirements|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1983/dec/05/blood-licensing-requirements|website=Hansard|publisher=House of Lords}}</ref> from abroad, but it did import large quantities of Factor VIII given to those infected (as described in the documentary ''[[Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal]]'').

The Archer Report said, \"In July 1979, the Medicines Inspectorate visited BPL. They reported that the buildings were never designed for the scale of production envisaged. They commented: 'If this were a commercial operation we would have no hesitation in recommending that manufacture should cease until the facility was upgraded to a minimum acceptable level'. BPL was rescued by Crown Immunity. Among their recommendations the Inspectorate advised: 'Under no circumstances should production of any product be increased under the existing manufacturing conditions'. Meanwhile, the existing plant continued production, relying on Crown Immunity to dispense with all the requirements of the Medicines Act, but was able to meet only about 40% of the national requirements.\"\n\nA study published in December 1983 showed conclusively that the risk to a haemophiliac of contracting Hepatitis C by using untreated Factor products was 100% upon first exposure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fletcher |first1=M L |last2=Trowell |first2=J M |last3=Craske |first3=J |last4=Pavier |first4=K |last5=Rizza |first5=C R |title=Non-A non-B hepatitis after transfusion of factor VIII in infrequently treated patients. |journal=BMJ |date=10 December 1983 |volume=287 |issue=6407 |pages=1754\u20131757 |doi=10.1136/bmj.287.6407.1754 |pmid=6416577 |pmc=1549875 }}</ref>\n\n== 1981 - 1986 - HIV ==\nIn July 1982, the American [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that at least 3 haemophiliacs there had developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, 2 had died, and all 3 had used untreated Factor products.<ref>{{cite web |title=1982- AIDS is Discovered Among Hemophilia Patients |url=http://www.hemophiliafed.org/news-stories/2014/03/aids_and_hemophilia/ |website=Hemophilia Federation of America |date=17 March 2014}}</ref> The CDC said that \"the occurrence among the three hemophiliac cases suggests the possible transmission of an agent through blood products\".\n\nIn March 1983, the CDC reported that \"Blood products or blood appear responsible for AIDS among hemophilia patients\".<ref>{{cite web |title=1983\u2014CDC Determines that AIDS is Spread Through Infected Blood - Hemophilia Federation of America |url=http://www.hemophiliafed.org/news-stories/2014/03/1984-cdc-determines-that-aids-is-spreading-through-infected-blood/ |website=Hemophilia Federation of America |date=17 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1983 Dr N.

Galbraith stated: \"I have reviewed the literature and come to the conclusion that all blood products made from blood donated in the USA after 1978 should be withdrawn from use until the risk of AIDS transmission by these products has been clarified ...

They were unsuccessful.\n\nIn a 1990 episode of ''[[The Cook Report]]'', Owen said: \"I can see why some people would be unhappy with having all the facts revealed because it will show negligence\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cook Report \u2013 Profits Before Patients|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb1Kb-WvW2o|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> In September 2016 Owen gave a speech in London during which he said the scandal had been covered-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqt0xXz-saw|title=Lord David Owen \u2013 Bad Blood Speech 29/9/16|date=30 September 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nArcher chaired a privately funded independent investigation set up in 2007. The Archer Report was published in 2009 and aimed to uncover the causes of the events that led to the thousands of infections and deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/delays-led-to-thousands-receiving-contaminated-blood-1629555.html|title=Delays Led to Thousands Receiving Contaminated Blood|author=Sam Marsden|website=Independent.co.uk|date=23 February 2009|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> The report held no legal or official status and was unable to subpoena witnesses or demand the disclosure of documents.<ref name=PE1449/> Nonetheless, it sought to address the issue of missing evidence and documents relating to the scandal. For example, the ministerial papers of Lord Owen had been destroyed. \"We have been unable to ascertain who carried out the destruction of the papers, and who gave the instructions. But the conclusion appears inescapable that some official made a decision which he or she had no authority to make, or that someone was guilty of a serious error of judgement. The consequence is that Lord Owen has done his best to recollect details of events a quarter of a century ago, but both he, and we, have been deprived of the primary sources\", Archer reported. Lord Jenkin also voiced his difficulties obtaining documents for the inquiry, although the report stated: \"He subsequently received from the Department two bundles of documents. One of these was to be treated as confidential\". Lord Jenkin felt that the destruction of records was deliberate, and done \"in order to draw a line under the disaster\".<ref name=\"Archer Report\">{{Cite book |title=The Archer Inquiry |year=2009 |quote=On 13 April 2005 Lord Jenkin met Sir Nigel, who apologised for the original reply.

The report went on to state: \"They were in fact destroyed over a period from July 1994 to March 1998\". When summarising these events it is stated \"some of those who gave evidence to us suspected that there was an exercise in suppressing evidence of negligence or misconduct.\"\n\n== 2015 \u2013 Scottish Penrose Inquiry ==\n{{Main|Penrose Inquiry}}\nIn 2008 the Scottish government announced [[Penrose Inquiry|a public inquiry]] into the scandal covering Scotland only, to be chaired by [[George William Penrose, Lord Penrose|Lord Penrose]]. The inquiry's terms of reference outlined five deaths that were to be examined, but only one of those victims was a haemophiliac and that person had been infected with hepatitis C in the 1960s, before the factor concentrates were introduced.\n\nPublished in 2015, the inquiry was described as a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]] and waste of public money (over \u00a312 million) by critics after it made just one recommendation and failed to apportion any blame in the scandal. Its recommendation was to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who had not already been tested for hepatitis C.\n\n== 2017 \u2013 Legal action and UK public inquiry ==\nIn July 2017 a group legal action ''Jason Evans & Ors'' was brought against the government on behalf of more than 500 people by Collins Solicitors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Momentum in Contaminated Blood Scandal grows as Collins apply for a Group Litigation Order \u2013 Collins Solicitors Press Release dated 4 July 2017|url=http://www.collinslaw.co.uk/post.php?s=2017-07-04-momentum-in-contaminated-blood-scandal-grows-as-collins-apply-for-a-group-litigation-order-collins-solicitors-press-release-dated-4-july-2017|website=Collinslaw.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ITV News \u2013 Families seek justice in Blood Scandal \u2013 4th July 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vCLXW4Mm5o|date=4 July 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> After years of increasing pressure from campaigners and [[Member of parliament|MP]]s, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced a full UK-wide public inquiry into the scandal.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Peter|last2=Topping|first2=Alexandra|title=Theresa May orders contaminated blood scandal inquiry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/11/contaminated-blood-scandal-theresa-may-orders-inquiry|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40601013|title=Blood probe 'lessons must be learned'|work=BBC News|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref> In September 2017 a court ruling found in favour of the victims allowing them to launch a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] action to seek damages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41406105|title=Victims win contaminated blood ruling|date=26 September 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/uk/victims-and-families-can-bring-high-court-action-on-contaminated-blood-products/|title=Victims and families can bring High Court action on contaminated blood products|date=26 September 2017|work=Evening Express|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926200244/https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/uk/victims-and-families-can-bring-high-court-action-on-contaminated-blood-products/|archive-date=26 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2017-09-26/victims-and-families-win-high-court-ruling-to-seek-damages-over-contaminated-blood-products/|title=Victims and families win High Court ruling to seek damages over contaminated blood products|work=ITV News|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== 2018 \u2013 False ministerial statements withdrawn ==\nIn June 2018 the Department of Health issued an apology, because for two years Ministers had told Parliament that in relation to Contaminated Blood Scandal evidence: \"All documents up to 1995 are available through the National Archive\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Blood: Contamination:Written question \u2013 65851 |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2017-02-27/65851/ |website=UK Parliament |language=English}}</ref>\n\n== 2019 \u2013 Files still missing ==\nIn February 2019, it emerged that around 450 files had been taken from the archives by staff from the Department of Health and Social Security, and not returned, sparking concerns among campaigners that the department was attempting a cover-up.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/contaminated-blood-scandal-documents-nhs-hiv-hepatitis-haemophilia-factor-8-cover-up-a8773716.html|title=Cover-up fears as hundreds of contaminated blood files 'vanish' before inquiry can see them|date=11 February 2019|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Government support ==\nSuccessive governments, both [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], have been criticised for their handling of the case, limited support schemes and refusal to conduct a public inquiry (until 2017).
