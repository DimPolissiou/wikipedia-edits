From 1931 to 1935, he headed a [[National Government (1931\u20131935)|National Government]] dominated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and supported by only a few Labour members. MacDonald was later vehemently denounced by and expelled from the party he had helped to found.\n\nMacDonald, along with [[Keir Hardie]] and [[Arthur Henderson]], was one of the three principal founders of the Labour Party. He was chairman of the Labour MPs before 1914 and, after an eclipse in his career caused by his opposition to the First World War, he was [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1922. The second Labour Government (1929\u201331) was dominated by the [[Great Depression]]. He formed the National Government to carry out spending cuts to defend the [[gold standard]], but it had to be abandoned after the [[Invergordon Mutiny]], and he called a [[1931 United Kingdom general election|general election in 1931]] seeking a \"doctor's mandate\" to fix the economy. The National coalition won an overwhelming landslide and the Labour Party was reduced to a rump of around 50 seats in the House of Commons. His health deteriorated and he stood down as Prime Minister in 1935, remaining as [[Lord President of the Council]] until retiring in 1937. He died later that year.\n\nMacDonald's speeches, pamphlets and books made him an important theoretician. Historian John Shepherd states that \"MacDonald's natural gifts of an imposing presence, handsome features and a persuasive oratory delivered with an arresting Highlands accent made him the iconic Labour leader\". After 1931, MacDonald was repeatedly and bitterly denounced by the Labour movement as a traitor to its cause. Since the 1960s, historians have defended his reputation, emphasising his earlier role in building up the Labour Party, dealing with the Great Depression, and as a putative forerunner of the political realignments of the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>John Shepherd, \"The Lad from Lossiemouth.\" ''History today'' 57#11 (2007): 31+</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Lossiemouth===\nMacDonald was born at Gregory Place, [[Lossiemouth]], Morayshire, Scotland, the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son of John MacDonald, a farm labourer, and Anne Ramsay, a housemaid.<ref>Marquand, David: Ramsay MacDonald, London, 1977, pp. 4\u20135</ref> Registered at birth as James McDonald (sic) Ramsay, he was known as Jaimie MacDonald. Illegitimacy could be a serious handicap in 19th-century [[Presbyterian]] Scotland, but in the north and northeast farming communities this was less of a problem; in 1868 a report of the Royal Commission on the Employment of Children, Young Persons and Women in Agriculture noted that the illegitimacy rate was around 15%\u2014nearly every sixth person was born out of wedlock.<ref>Marquand, p. 6</ref> MacDonald's mother had worked as a domestic servant at Claydale farm, near [[Alves, Moray|Alves]], where his father was also employed. They were to have been married, but the wedding never took place, either because the couple quarrelled and chose not to marry, or because Anne's mother, Isabella Ramsay, stepped in to prevent her daughter from marrying a man she deemed unsuitable.<ref>Marquand, p. 5</ref>\n[[File:1887BloodySunday.jpg|thumb|left|Bloody Sunday.]]\n\nRamsay MacDonald received an elementary education at the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]] school in Lossiemouth from 1872 to 1875, and then at Drainie parish school. He left school at the end of the summer term in 1881, at the age of 15, and began work on a nearby farm. In December 1881, he was appointed a [[pupil teacher]] at Drainie parish school.<ref>Marquand, p. 12</ref> In 1885, he left to take up a position as an assistant to Mordaunt Crofton, a clergyman in [[Bristol]] who was attempting to establish a Boys' and Young Men's Guild at [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]].<ref>Marquand, p. 15</ref> In Bristol Ramsay MacDonald joined the Democratic Federation, a [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] organisation, which changed its name a few months later to the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF).<ref>Bryher, Samual: An Account of the Labour and Socialist Movement in Bristol, 1929</ref><ref>Elton, p.44</ref> He remained in the group when it left the SDF to become the [[Bristol Socialist Society]]. In early 1886 he moved to London.<ref>Marquand, pp. 9, 17</ref>\n\n===Young semi-socialist in London===\nFollowing a short period of work addressing envelopes at the [[National Cyclists' Union]] in [[Fleet Street]], he found himself unemployed and forced to live on the small amount of money he had saved from his time in Bristol. MacDonald eventually found employment as an invoice clerk in the warehouse of Cooper, Box and Co.<ref>Tracey, Herbert: J. Ramsay MacDonald, 1924, p. 29</ref> During this time he was deepening his socialist credentials, and engaged himself energetically in [[C. L. Fitzgerald]]'s [[Socialist Union (UK)|Socialist Union]] which, unlike the SDF, aimed to progress socialist ideals through the parliamentary system.<ref>Marquand, p. 20</ref> MacDonald witnessed the [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] of 13 November 1887 in [[Trafalgar Square]], and in response, had a pamphlet published by the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', entitled ''Remember Trafalgar Square: Tory Terrorism in 1887''.<ref>Marquand, p.21</ref>\n\nMacDonald retained an interest in Scottish politics. [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] [[first Irish Home Rule Bill]] inspired the setting-up of a Scottish Home Rule Association in Edinburgh. On 6 March 1888, MacDonald took part in a meeting of London-based Scots, who, upon his motion, formed the London General Committee of the Scottish Home Rule Association.<ref>Morgan, ''J. Ramsay MacDonald'' (1987) p.17</ref> For a while he supported home rule for Scotland, but found little support among London's Scots.<ref>Marquand, p.23</ref> However, MacDonald never lost his interest in Scottish politics and home rule, and in ''Socialism: critical and constructive'', published in 1921, he wrote: \"The Anglification of Scotland has been proceeding apace to the damage of its education, its music, its literature, its genius, and the generation that is growing up under this influence is uprooted from its past.\"<ref name=\"MacDonald1921\">{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=James Ramsay|title=Socialism: critical and constructive|url=https://archive.org/details/socialismcritica00macdiala|publisher=Cassell and Company Ltd|year=1921|series=Cassell's social economics series}}</ref>\n\nPolitics in the 1880s was still of less importance to MacDonald than furthering his education. From 1886-87, MacDonald studied botany, agriculture, mathematics, and physics.at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]] (now Birkbeck, University of London) but his health suddenly failed him due to exhaustion one week before his examinations, which put an end to any thought of a scientific career.<ref>Elton, pp.56\u201357</ref> He would however, later be appointed a Governor of the institution in 1895, and continued to have a great fondness for the mission of Birkbeck into his later years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/letter-from-ramsay-mcdonald-to-birkbeck-college-birkbeck-university-of-london/0gG6ATbzWgb9-A|title=Letter from Ramsay McDonald to Birkbeck College - Birkbeck, University of London|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888, MacDonald took employment as private secretary to [[Thomas Lough]] who was a tea merchant and a [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] politician.<ref>Conor Cruise O' Brien, ''Parnell and his Party'' 1957, p.275</ref> Lough was elected as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Islington West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Islington]], in 1892. Many doors now opened to MacDonald: he had access to the [[National Liberal Club]] as well as the editorial offices of Liberal and Radical newspapers; he made himself known to various London Radical clubs among Radical and labour politicians.  MacDonald gained valuable experience in the workings of electioneering.  At the same time he left Lough's employment to branch out as a freelance journalist.  Elsewhere, as a member of the [[Fabian Society]] for some time, MacDonald toured and lectured on its behalf at the [[London School of Economics]] and elsewhere.<ref>Marquand, p.22</ref>\n\n==Active politics==\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] had created the [[Labour Electoral Association]] (LEA) and entered into an unsatisfactory alliance with the Liberal Party in 1886.<ref>Marquand, p. 31</ref> In 1892, MacDonald was in Dover to give support to the candidate for the LEA in the General Election, who was well beaten.  MacDonald impressed the local press<ref>Dover Express, 17 June 1892; 12 August 1892</ref> and the Association and was adopted as its candidate, announcing that his candidature would be under a Labour Party banner.<ref>''Dover Express'', 7 October 1892</ref> He denied the Labour Party was a wing of the Liberal Party but saw merit in a working political relationship.  In May 1894, the local Southampton Liberal Association was trying to find a labour-minded candidate for the constituency. Two others joined MacDonald to address the Liberal Council: one was offered but turned down the invitation, while MacDonald failed to secure the nomination despite strong support among Liberals.<ref>Marquand, p. 35</ref>\n\nIn 1893, [[Keir Hardie]] had formed the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) which had established itself as a mass movement. In May 1894 MacDonald applied for membership, and was accepted.  He was officially adopted as the ILP candidate for one of the Southampton seats on 17 July 1894<ref>Southampton Times, 21 July 1894</ref> but was heavily defeated at the election of 1895. MacDonald stood for Parliament again in 1900 for one of the two Leicester seats and although he lost was generously accused of splitting the Liberal vote to allow the Conservative candidate to win.<ref>Marquand, p. 73</ref> That same year he became Secretary of the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee (1900)|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC), the forerunner of the Labour Party, allegedly in part because many delegates confused him with prominent London trade unionist [[James MacDonald (trade unionist)|Jimmie MacDonald]] when they voted for \"Mr. James R. MacDonald\".<ref name=\"gunther1940\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n357/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper & Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | pages=335, 337\u2013340}}</ref> MacDonald retained membership of the ILP; while it was not a [[Marxism|Marxist]] organisation it was more rigorously socialist than the once and future Labour Party in which the ILP members would operate as a \"[[ginger group]]\" for many years.{{sfn|Jennings|1962|page=457}}\n\nAs Party Secretary, MacDonald negotiated [[Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact|an agreement]] with the leading Liberal politician [[Herbert Gladstone]] (son of the late Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]), which allowed Labour to contest a number of working class seats without Liberal opposition,<ref>Mackintosh, John P. (Ed.): British Prime Ministers in the twentieth Century, London, 1977, p. 157</ref> thus giving Labour its first breakthrough into the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].  He married [[Margaret Ethel MacDonald|Margaret Ethel Gladstone]], who was unrelated to the Gladstones of the Liberal Party, in 1896. Although not wealthy, Margaret MacDonald was comfortably off,<ref>MacDonald Papers, P.R.O. 3/95</ref> and this allowed them to indulge in foreign travel, visiting Canada and the United States in 1897, South Africa in 1902, Australia and New Zealand in 1906 and India several times.\n\nIt was during this period that MacDonald and his wife began a long friendship with the social investigator and reforming civil servant [[Clara Collet]]<ref>McDonald, Deborah, ''Clara Collet 1860\u20131948: An Educated Working Woman''; Routledge: 2004</ref><ref>Diary of Clara Collet: Warwick Modern Records Office</ref> with whom he discussed women's issues.  She was an influence on MacDonald and other politicians in their attitudes towards women's rights.  In 1901, he was elected to the [[London County Council]] for Finsbury Central as a joint Labour\u2013[[Progressive Party (London)|Progressive Party]] candidate, but he was disqualified from the register in 1904 due to his absences abroad.{{sfn|Morgan|1987|page=30}}\n\n[[File:Labour Representation Committee leaders 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Macdonald (third from left) in 1906, with other leading figures in the party]]\nIn 1906, the LRC changed its name to the \"[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]\", amalgamating with the ILP.<ref>Clegg, H.A;, Fox, Alan; Thompson, A.F.: ''A History of British Trade Unions since 1889'', 1964, vol I, p. 388</ref> In that same year, MacDonald was elected MP for [[Leicester]] along with 28 others,<ref>Leicester Pioneer, 20 January 1906</ref> and became one of the leaders of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]]. These Labour MPs undoubtedly owed their election to the 'Progressive Alliance' between the Liberals and Labour, a minor party supporting the Liberal governments of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[H. H. Asquith]].  MacDonald became the leader of the left wing of the party, arguing that Labour must seek to displace the Liberals as the main party of the left.{{sfn|Morgan|1987|page=40}}\n\n==Party leader==\n[[Image:Ramsay MacDonald - Punch cartoon - Project Gutenberg eText 17629.png|thumb|'''Hoist with this own petard.'''<br />Mr. Ramsay MacDonald (''Champion of Independent Labour''). \"Of course I'm all for peaceful picketing\u2014on principle.

He was the chief intellectual leader of the party, paying little attention to class warfare and much more to the emergence of a powerful state as it exemplified the Darwinian evolution of an ever more complex society.  He was an Orthodox Edwardian progressive, keen on intellectual discussion, and averse to agitation.<ref>Kenneth Morgan (1987) pp 42\u201343</ref>\n\nWithin a short period, his wife became ill with blood poisoning and died. This deeply and permanently affected MacDonald.<ref>Thompson, Laurence: ''The Enthusiasts,'' (1971), p. 173</ref>\n\nMacDonald had always taken a keen interest in foreign affairs and knew from his visit to South Africa, just after the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] had ended, what the effects of modern conflict would be. Although the Parliamentary Labour Party generally held an anti-war opinion, when war was declared in August 1914, patriotism came to the fore.<ref name=\"Marquand, p. 168\">Marquand, pp. 77, 168</ref> After the Foreign Secretary, Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], warned the House of Commons on 3 August that war with Germany was likely, MacDonald responded by declaring that \"this country ought to have remained neutral\".<ref>Marquand, p. 168.</ref><ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1914/aug/03/statement-by-sir-edward-grey#column_1831 HC Deb 03 August 1914 vol 65 c. 1831]</ref> In the ''[[Labour Leader]]'' he claimed that the real cause of the war was the \"policy of the [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] through alliance\".<ref>Marquand, p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Party supported the government in its request for \u00a3100,000,000 of war credits and, as MacDonald could not, he resigned from the party Chairmanship. [[Arthur Henderson]] became the new leader, while MacDonald took the party Treasurer's post.<ref>MacKintosh, John P (Ed.): ''British Prime Ministers in the Twentieth Century'', (1977), p. 159.</ref> Despite his opposition to the war, MacDonald visited the Western Front in December 1914 with the approval of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. MacDonald and [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|General Seeley]] set off for the front at [[Battle of Ypres|Ypres]] and soon found themselves in the thick of an action in which both behaved with the utmost coolness. Later, MacDonald was received by the Commander-in-Chief at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] and made an extensive tour of the front. Returning home, he paid a public tribute to the courage of the French troops, but said nothing then or later of having been under fire himself.<ref>Elton, pp. 269\u201371</ref>\n\nDuring the early part of the war, he was extremely unpopular and was accused of treason and cowardice. Former Liberal Party MP and publisher [[Horatio Bottomley]] attacked him through his magazine ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'' in September 1915, by publishing an article carrying details of MacDonald's birth and his so-called deceit in not disclosing his real name.<ref>Marquand, p. 189.</ref><ref>Symons, Julian, ''Horatio Bottomley'', Cressett Press, London, 1955, pp. 168\u201369</ref> His illegitimacy was no secret and he had not seemed to have suffered by it, but, according to the journal he had, by using a false name, gained access to parliament falsely and should suffer heavy penalties and have his election declared void. MacDonald received much internal support, but the way in which the disclosures were made public had affected him.<ref name=\"Marquand, pp 190, 191\">Marquand, pp. 190, 191.</ref> He wrote in his diary:\n\n<blockquote>...I spent hours of terrible mental pain. Letters of sympathy began to pour in upon me. ... Never before did I know that I had been registered under the name of Ramsay, and cannot understand it now.

The election campaign in Leicester West focused on MacDonald's opposition to the war, with MacDonald writing after his defeat: \"I have become a kind of mythological demon in the minds of the people\".<ref>Marquand, p. 236.</ref>\n\nMacDonald denounced the [[Treaty of Versailles]]: \"We are beholding an act of madness unparalleled in history\".<ref>Marquand, p. 250.</ref>\n\n==1920\u20131924==\nMacDonald stood for Parliament in the [[1921 Woolwich East by-election]] and lost. His opponent, [[Robert Gee|Captain Robert Gee]], had been awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] at [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]]; MacDonald tried to counter this by having ex-soldiers appear on his platforms. MacDonald also promised to pressure the government into converting the [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] to civilian use.<ref>Marquand, p. 273.</ref> Horatio Bottomley intervened in the by-election, opposing MacDonald's election because of his anti-war record.<ref>Marquand, p. 274.</ref> Bottomley's influence may have been decisive in MacDonald's failure to be elected as there were under 700 votes difference between Gee and MacDonald.<ref>Marquand, pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nIn 1922, MacDonald was returned to the House as MP for [[Aberavon (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberavon]] in Wales, with a vote of 14,318 against 11,111 and 5,328 for his main opponents. His rehabilitation was complete; the Labour ''New Leader'' magazine opined that his election was, \"enough in itself to transform our position in the House. We have once more a voice which must be heard.\"<ref>Marquand, p 283</ref>\nBy now, the party was reunited and MacDonald was [[1922 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|re-elected as Leader]]. Historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] examines his newfound stature:\n: as dissolution set in with the Lloyd George coalition in 1921\u201322, and unemployment mounted,  MacDonald stood out as the leader of a new kind of broad-based left. His opposition to the war had given him a new charisma. More than anyone else in public life, he symbolised peace and internationalism, decency and social change.... [He] had become The voice of conscience.<ref>Kenneth Morgan (1987) pp 44\u201345</ref>\n\nAt the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 election]], Labour replaced the Liberals as the main opposition party to the Conservative government of [[Stanley Baldwin]], making MacDonald [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. By now, he had moved away from the Labour left and abandoned the socialism of his youth: he strongly opposed the wave of radicalism that swept through the labour movement in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and became a determined enemy of Communism. Unlike the [[French Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], the Labour Party did not split and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] remained small and isolated.\n\nIn 1922, MacDonald visited Palestine.<ref name=\"David Cesarani 2006\">David Cesarani. \"Anti-Zionism in Britain, 1922\u20132002: Continuities and Discontinuities\" The Journal of Israeli History 25.1 (2006): 141</ref> In a later account of his visit, he contrasted Zionist pioneers with 'the rich plutocratic Jew'.<ref name=\"David Cesarani 2006\"/> MacDonald believed the latter \"was the true economic materialist. He is the person whose views upon life make one anti-Semitic. He has no country, no kindred. Whether as a sweater or a financier, he is an exploiter of everything he can squeeze. He is behind every evil that Governments do, and his political authority, always exercised in the dark, is greater than that of Parliamentary majorities. He is the keenest of brains and the bluntest of consciences. He detests Zionism because it revives the idealism of his race, and has political implications which threaten his economic interests\"<ref name=\"David Cesarani 2006\"/>\n\nMacDonald became noted for \"woolly\" rhetoric such as the occasion at the Labour Party Conference of 1930 at [[Llandudno]] when he appeared to imply unemployment could be solved by encouraging the jobless to return to the fields \"where they till and they grow and they sow and they harvest\". Equally, there were times when it was unclear what his policies were. There was already some unease in the party about what he would do if Labour was able to form a government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neilson|first1=Keith|last2=Otte|first2=T.G.|title=The Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, 1854\u20131946|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1134231393|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]], the Conservatives had lost their majority, and when they lost a vote of confidence in the House in January 1924, [[George V|King George V]] called on MacDonald to form a minority Labour government, with the tacit support of the Liberals under Asquith from the corner benches.

He consulted widely within his party, making the Liberal [[Lord Haldane]] the [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[Philip Snowden]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He took the foreign office himself. Besides himself, ten other cabinet members came from working class origins, a dramatic breakthrough in British history.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History: 1914\u20131945'' (1965) p 209</ref> His first priority was to undo the perceived damage caused by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]], by settling the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] issue and coming to terms with Germany.

I wonder what she would have thought of a Labour Government!\"<ref>Sir Harold Nicolson, ''King George V: His life and reign'' (1952)</ref>\n\nWhile there were no major labour strikes during his term, MacDonald acted swiftly to end those that did erupt. When the Labour Party executive criticised the government, he replied that, \"public doles, [[Poplar Rates Rebellion|Poplarism]] [local defiance of the national government], strikes for increased wages, limitation of output, not only are not Socialism, but may mislead the spirit and policy of the Socialist movement\".<ref>Taylor, ''English History: 1914\u20131945'', pp. 213\u201314</ref> The Government lasted only nine months and did not have a majority in either House of the Parliament, but it was still able to support the unemployed with the extension of benefits and amendments to the Insurance Acts. In a personal triumph for [[John Wheatley]], Minister for Health, a [[Wheatley Housing Act|Housing Act]] was passed, which greatly expanded [[municipal housing]] for low paid workers.<ref name=\"MacDonald\">Morgan, Kevin.

He founded the Union of Democratic Control in early 1914 to promote international socialist aims, but it was overwhelmed by the war. His 1916 book, ''National Defence'', revealed his own long-term vision for peace. Although disappointed at the harsh terms of the Versailles Treaty, he supported the [[League of Nations]] \u2013 but, by 1930, he felt that the internal cohesion of the British Empire and a strong, independent British defence programme might turn out to be the wisest British government policy.<ref>Keith Robbins, \"Labour Foreign Policy and International Socialism: MacDonald and the League of Nations,\" in Robbins, ''Politicians, Diplomacy and War'' (2003) pp. 239\u201372</ref>\n\nMacDonald moved in March 1924 to end construction work on the Singapore military base, despite strong opposition from the Admiralty. He believed the building of the base would endanger the disarmament conference; the [[First Sea Lord]] [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]] considered the absence of such a base as dangerously imperilling British trade and territories East of [[Aden]] and could mean the security of the British Empire in the Far East being dependent on the goodwill of Japan.<ref>Marquand, pp. 315\u201317</ref>\n\nIn June 1924, MacDonald convened a conference in London of the wartime Allies and achieved an agreement on a new plan for settling the reparations issue and French occupation of the [[Ruhr]]. German delegates joined the meeting, and the [[London Settlement]] was signed. It was followed by an Anglo-German commercial treaty. Another major triumph for MacDonald was the conference held in London in July and August 1924 to deal with the implementation of the [[Dawes Plan]].<ref name=Marks248>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Sally | year = 1978 | title = The Myths of Reparations | journal = Central European History | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 231\u201355 | doi=10.1017/s0008938900018707}}</ref> MacDonald, who accepted the popular view of the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] of [[World War I reparations|German reparations]] as impossible to pay, pressured French Premier [[\u00c9douard Herriot]] until many concessions were made to Germany.<ref name=Marks248/>\n[[File:Ramsay MacDonald Christian Rakovsky 1924.jpg|left|thumb|290x290px|Ramsay MacDonald and [[Christian Rakovsky]], Head of the Soviet diplomatic delegation.

There were, in fact, two proposed treaties: one would cover commercial matters, and the other would cover a fairly vague future discussion on the problem of the bondholders. If the treaties were signed, the British government would conclude a further treaty and guarantee a loan to the Bolsheviks.  The treaties were popular neither with the Conservatives nor with the Liberals, who, in September, criticised the loan so vehemently that negotiation with them seemed impossible.<ref>Lyman, ''The First Labour Government, 1924'' pp. 195\u2013204</ref>  \n\nHowever, the government's fate was determined by the \"[[Campbell Case]]\", the abrogation of prosecuting the left-wing newspaper the ''[[Workers' Weekly (UK)|Workers' Weekly]]'' for inciting servicemen to mutiny. The Conservatives put down a censure motion, to which the Liberals added an amendment. MacDonald's Cabinet resolved to treat both motions as [[motion of confidence|matters of confidence]]. The Liberal amendment was carried, and the King granted MacDonald a dissolution of Parliament the following day.  The issues that dominated the election campaign were the Campbell Case and the Russian treaties, which soon combined into the single issue of the Bolshevik threat.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.J.P.

The letter was dated 15 September and so before the dissolution of parliament: it stated that it was imperative for the agreed treaties between Britain and the Bolsheviks to be ratified urgently. The letter said that those Labour members who could apply pressure on the government should do so. It went on to say that a resolution of the relationship between the two countries would \"assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat ... make it possible for us to extend and develop the ideas of Leninism in England and the Colonies\". \n\nThe government had received the letter before the publication in the newspapers. It had protested to the Bolsheviks' London charg\u00e9 d'affaires and had already decided to make public the contents of the letter with details of the official protest. But it had not been swift-footed enough.<ref>Marquand, p. 382</ref>  \n\nHistorians mostly agree the letter was a forgery, but it closely reflected attitudes current in the Comintern. In any case, it had little impact on the Labour vote, which actually increased. It was the collapse of the Liberal Party that led to the Conservative landslide. However, many Labourites for years blamed their defeat on the Letter by misunderstanding the political forces at work.<ref>Taylor, ''English History: 1914\u20131945'', pp. 219\u201320, 226\u20137</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=C.

The Conservatives were returned decisively, gaining 155 seats for a total of 413 members of parliament. Labour lost 40 seats, but held on to 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats (leaving them with only 40) and their vote fell by over a million. The real significance of the election was that the Liberal Party, which Labour had displaced as the second largest political party in 1922, was now clearly the third party.\n\n==Second government and National government (1929\u20131935)==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Second premiership of Ramsay MacDonald]], [[Second prime ministership of Ramsay MacDonald]] -->\n{{Further|Second MacDonald ministry}}\n\n===Second Labour government (1929\u20131931)===\nThe strong majority held by the Conservatives gave Baldwin a full term during which the government had to deal with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]].

The miners expected a wealthy man who would fund party operations, but he had no money. He disagreed with the increasingly radical activism of party leaders in the district, as well as the permanent agent, and the South Wales Mineworkers' Federation.

However, an attempt by the Education Minister [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]] to introduce an act to raise the school-leaving age to 15 was defeated by opposition from [[Roman Catholic]] Labour MPs, who feared that the costs would lead to increasing local authority control over faith schools.<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>\n\nIn international affairs he also convened the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table]] conferences in London with the political leaders of India, at which he offered them [[responsible government]], but not independence or even Dominion status.

[[Philip Snowden]] was a rigid exponent of orthodox finance and would not permit any [[Deficit spending#Government deficits|deficit spending]] to stimulate the economy, despite the urgings of Oswald Mosley, [[David Lloyd George]] and the economist John Maynard Keynes. Mosley put forward a memorandum in January 1930, calling for the public control of imports and banking as well as an increase in pensions to boost spending power. When this was repeatedly turned down, Mosley resigned from the government in February 1931 and formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]].

During 1931, the economic situation deteriorated, and pressure from orthodox economists for sharp cuts in government spending increased. Under pressure from its Liberal allies, as well as the Conservative opposition who feared that the budget was unbalanced, Snowden appointed a committee headed by Sir [[George May, 1st Baron May|George May]] to review the state of public finances. The [[May Report]] of July 1931, urged large public-sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending, notably in payments to the unemployed, to avoid a budget deficit.<ref>[[C. L.

With this unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, MacDonald submitted his resignation and then agreed, on the urging of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], to form a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] with the Conservatives and Liberals. With Henderson taking the lead, MacDonald, Snowden, and Thomas were quickly expelled from the Labour Party.<ref>Andrew Thorpe, \"Arthur Henderson and the British political crisis of 1931.\" ''Historical Journal'' 31#1 (1988): 117\u2013139.</ref> They responded by forming a new [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] group, which provided a nominal party base for the expelled MPs, but received little support in the country or the unions. Great anger in the labour movement greeted MacDonald's move. Riots took place in protest in [[Glasgow]] and [[Manchester]]. Many in the Labour Party viewed this as a cynical move by MacDonald to rescue his career, and accused him of 'betrayal'. MacDonald, however, argued that the sacrifice was for the common good.<ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] ''[[Speak for Britain!: A New History of the Labour Party]]'' (2010) pp 212\u201316</ref><ref>Reginald Bassett, ''1931 Political Crisis'' (MacMillan, 1958) defends MacDonald.</ref>\n\n===1931 general election===\nIn the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]], the National Government won 554 seats, comprising 473 Conservatives, 13 National Labour, 68 Liberals (Liberal National and Liberal) and various others, while Labour, now led by Arthur Henderson won only 52 and the Lloyd George Liberals four.  Henderson and his deputy [[J. R. Clynes]] both lost their seats in Labour's worst-ever rout. Labour's disastrous performance at the 1931 election greatly increased the bitterness felt by MacDonald's former colleagues towards him. MacDonald was genuinely upset to see the Labour Party so badly defeated at the election. He had regarded the National Government as a temporary measure, and had hoped to return to the Labour Party.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/>\n\n===Premiership of the National Government (1931\u20131935)===\n{{Further|National Government (1931\u20131935)}}\nThe National Government's huge majority left MacDonald with the largest mandate ever won by a British Prime Minister at a democratic election, but MacDonald had only a small following of National Labour men in Parliament. He was ageing rapidly, and was increasingly a figurehead. In control of domestic policy were Conservatives [[Stanley Baldwin]] as Lord President and [[Neville Chamberlain]] the chancellor of the exchequer, together with [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberal]] [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]] at the Board of Trade.<ref>{{cite book|author=Harford Montgomery Hyde|title=Baldwin; the unexpected Prime Minister|url=https://archive.org/details/baldwinunexpecte0000hyde|url-access=registration|year=1973|publisher=Hart-Davis MacGibbon|page=[https://archive.org/details/baldwinunexpecte0000hyde/page/345 345]}}</ref> MacDonald, Chamberlain and Runciman devised a compromise tariff policy, which stopped short of protectionism while ending free trade and, at the [[British Empire Economic Conference|1932 Ottawa Conference]], cementing commercial relations within the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wrench | first1 = David | year = 2000 | title = 'Very Peculiar Circumstances': Walter Runciman and the National Government, 1931-3 | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 61\u201382 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/11.1.61}}</ref>\n\nBesides his preference for a cohesive British Empire and a protective tariff, he felt an independent British defence programme would be the wisest policy. However, budget pressures and a strong popular pacifist sentiment, forced a reduction in the military and naval budgets.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History 1914\u20131945'' (1965), pp. 359\u201370</ref> MacDonald involved himself heavily in foreign policy.

Most important of all, he presided at the [[World Economic Conference (London)|world economic conference in London]] in June 1933.  Nearly every nation was represented, but no agreement was possible. The American president torpedoed the conference with a bombshell message that the US would not stabilise the depreciating dollar.  The failure marked the end of international economic co-operation for another decade.<ref>Taylor, ''English History: 1914\u20131945'' (1965), pp .334\u201335</ref>\n\nMacDonald was deeply affected by the anger and bitterness caused by the fall of the Labour government. He continued to regard himself as a true Labour man, but the rupturing of virtually all his old friendships left him an isolated figure. One of the only other leading Labour figures to join the government, Philip Snowden, was a firm believer in [[free trade]] and resigned from the government in 1932 following the introduction of tariffs after the [[Ottawa agreement]].{{sfn|Morgan|1987|page=213}}\n\n===Retirement===\nBy 1933 MacDonald's health was so poor that his doctor had to personally supervise his trip to Geneva. By 1934 MacDonald's mental and physical health declined further, and he became an increasingly ineffective leader as the international situation grew more threatening. His speeches in Commons and at international meetings became incoherent. One observer noted how \"Things ... got to the stage where nobody knew what the Prime Minister was going to say in the House of Commons, and, when he did say it, nobody understood it\". Newspapers did not report MacDonald denying to reporters that he was seriously ill because he only had \"loss of memory\".<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>{{r|gunther1940}} His pacifism, which had been widely admired in the 1920s, led [[Winston Churchill]] and others to accuse him of failure to stand up to the threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]. His government began the negotiations for the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]]. \n\nIn these years he was irritated by the attacks of Lucy, [[Lucy, Lady Houston|Lady Houston]], the strongly nationalistic proprietor of the ''Saturday Review''. [[Lady Houston]] believed that MacDonald was under the control of the Soviets and amused the nation by giving MacDonald such epithets as the 'Spider of Lossiemouth,' and hanging a large sign in electric lights from the rigging of her luxury yacht, the ''Liberty.'' According to some versions it read 'Down the Ramsay MacDonald,' and to others 'To Hell with Ramsay MacDonald.' Lady Houston also sent agents to disrupt his election campaigns. In 2020 new research revealed how she purchased three letters, supposedly written by Ramsay MacDonald to Soviet officials but actually the work of an American forger. In 1935 [[Lady Houston]] stated that she intended to publish them but eventually handed them over to Special Branch, and MacDonald's solicitors entered a legal battle with her.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adventuress, the Life and Loves of Lucy, Lady Houston|last=Crompton|first=Teresa|publisher=The History Press|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMacDonald was aware of his fading powers, and in 1935 he agreed to a timetable with Baldwin to stand down as Prime Minister after King George V's [[Silver Jubilee]] celebrations in May 1935.

The events of 1931, with the downfall of the Labour government and his coalition with the Conservatives, led to MacDonald becoming one of the most reviled figures in the history of the Labour Party, with many of his former supporters accusing him of betraying the party he had helped create.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=16 |title=Labour History |accessdate=9 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930213450/http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=16 |archivedate=30 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2765875.stm Blair makes moral case for war] BBC News, 15 February 2003</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/09/nick-clegg-liberal-democrats \"Nick Clegg and the ghost of Ramsay MacDonald\"], ''The Guardian'', 9 May 2010</ref> [[MacNeill Weir]], MacDonald's former parliamentary private secretary, published the first major biography ''The Tragedy of Ramsay MacDonald'' in 1938.

He argued also to place MacDonald's fateful decision in 1931 in the context of the crisis of the times and the limited choices open to him. Marquand praised the prime minister's decision to place national interests before that of party in 1931. He also emphasised MacDonald's lasting intellectual contribution to socialism and his pivotal role in transforming Labour from an outside protest group to an inside party of government.<ref>Martin (2003) p 837.</ref>\n\nScholarly analysis about the economic decisions taken in the inter-war period such as the return to the Gold Standard in 1925, and MacDonald's desperate efforts to defend it in 1931, has changed. [[Robert Skidelsky]], in his classic account of the 1929\u201331 government, ''Politicians and the Slump'' (1967), compared the orthodox policies advocated by leading politicians of both parties unfavourably with the more radical, proto-Keynesian measures proposed by David Lloyd George and Oswald Mosley. But in the preface to the 1994 edition Skidelsky argued that recent experience of currency crises and [[capital flight]] made it hard to be critical of politicians who wanted to achieve stability by cutting so-called \"labour costs\" and defending the value of the currency.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Skidelsky|title=Politicians and the slump: The Labour Government of 1929\u20131931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEW5AAAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Papermac|isbn=9780333605929}}</ref> In 2004 Marquand advanced a similar argument:\n<blockquote>In the harsher world of the 1980s and 1990s it was no longer obvious that Keynes was right in 1931 and the bankers wrong.  Pre-Keynesian orthodoxy had come in from the cold. Politicians and publics had learned anew that confidence crises feed on themselves; that currencies can collapse; that the public credit can be exhausted; that a plummeting currency can be even more painful than deflationary expenditure cuts; and that governments which try to defy the foreign exchange markets are apt to get their\u2014and their countries'\u2014fingers burnt.  Against that background MacDonald's response to the 1931 crisis increasingly seemed not just honourable and consistent, but right ... he was the unacknowledged precursor of the [[Tony Blair|Blairs]], the [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der|Schr\u00f6ders]], and the [[Bill Clinton|Clintons]] of the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>Marquand (2004)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n{{further|Cultural depictions of British prime ministers#Ramsay MacDonald}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Image:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain.29588.jpg|thumb|upright|MacDonald {{c.|1900s}}]]\nRamsay MacDonald married [[Margaret MacDonald (wife of Ramsay MacDonald)|Margaret Ethel Gladstone]] (no relation to Prime Minister William Gladstone) in 1896.

From 1931 to 1935, he headed a [[National Government (1931\u20131935)|National Government]] dominated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and supported by only a few Labour members. MacDonald was later vehemently denounced by and expelled from the party he had helped to found.\n\nMacDonald, along with [[Keir Hardie]] and [[Arthur Henderson]], was one of the three principal founders of the Labour Party. He was chairman of the Labour MPs before 1914 and, after an eclipse in his career caused by his opposition to the First World War, he was [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1922. The second Labour Government (1929\u201331) was dominated by the [[Great Depression]]. He formed the National Government to carry out spending cuts to defend the [[gold standard]], but it had to be abandoned after the [[Invergordon Mutiny]], and he called a [[1931 United Kingdom general election|general election in 1931]] seeking a \"doctor's mandate\" to fix the economy. The National coalition won an overwhelming landslide and the Labour Party was reduced to a rump of around 50 seats in the House of Commons. His health deteriorated and he stood down as Prime Minister in 1935, remaining as [[Lord President of the Council]] until retiring in 1937. He died later that year.\n\nMacDonald's speeches, pamphlets and books made him an important theoretician. Historian John Shepherd states that \"MacDonald's natural gifts of an imposing presence, handsome features and a persuasive oratory delivered with an arresting Highlands accent made him the iconic Labour leader\". After 1931, MacDonald was repeatedly and bitterly denounced by the Labour movement as a traitor to its cause. Since the 1960s, historians have defended his reputation, emphasising his earlier role in building up the Labour Party, dealing with the Great Depression, and as a putative forerunner of the political realignments of the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>John Shepherd, \"The Lad from Lossiemouth.\" ''History today'' 57#11 (2007): 31+</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Lossiemouth===\nMacDonald was born at Gregory Place, [[Lossiemouth]], Morayshire, Scotland, the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son of John MacDonald, a farm labourer, and Anne Ramsay, a housemaid.<ref>Marquand, David: Ramsay MacDonald, London, 1977, pp. 4\u20135</ref> Registered at birth as James McDonald (sic) Ramsay, he was known as Jaimie MacDonald. Illegitimacy could be a serious handicap in 19th-century [[Presbyterian]] Scotland, but in the north and northeast farming communities this was less of a problem; in 1868 a report of the Royal Commission on the Employment of Children, Young Persons and Women in Agriculture noted that the illegitimacy rate was around 15%\u2014nearly every sixth person was born out of wedlock.<ref>Marquand, p. 6</ref> MacDonald's mother had worked as a domestic servant at Claydale farm, near [[Alves, Moray|Alves]], where his father was also employed. They were to have been married, but the wedding never took place, either because the couple quarrelled and chose not to marry, or because Anne's mother, Isabella Ramsay, stepped in to prevent her daughter from marrying a man she deemed unsuitable.<ref>Marquand, p. 5</ref>\n[[File:1887BloodySunday.jpg|thumb|left|Bloody Sunday.]]\n\nRamsay MacDonald received an elementary education at the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]] school in Lossiemouth from 1872 to 1875, and then at Drainie parish school. He left school at the end of the summer term in 1881, at the age of 15, and began work on a nearby farm. In December 1881, he was appointed a [[pupil teacher]] at Drainie parish school.<ref>Marquand, p. 12</ref> In 1885, he left to take up a position as an assistant to Mordaunt Crofton, a clergyman in [[Bristol]] who was attempting to establish a Boys' and Young Men's Guild at [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]].<ref>Marquand, p. 15</ref> In Bristol Ramsay MacDonald joined the Democratic Federation, a [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] organisation, which changed its name a few months later to the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF).<ref>Bryher, Samual: An Account of the Labour and Socialist Movement in Bristol, 1929</ref><ref>Elton, p.44</ref> He remained in the group when it left the SDF to become the [[Bristol Socialist Society]]. In early 1886 he moved to London.<ref>Marquand, pp. 9, 17</ref>\n\n===Young semi-socialist in London===\nFollowing a short period of work addressing envelopes at the [[National Cyclists' Union]] in [[Fleet Street]], he found himself unemployed and forced to live on the small amount of money he had saved from his time in Bristol. MacDonald eventually found employment as an invoice clerk in the warehouse of Cooper, Box and Co.<ref>Tracey, Herbert: J. Ramsay MacDonald, 1924, p. 29</ref> During this time he was deepening his socialist credentials, and engaged himself energetically in [[C. L. Fitzgerald]]'s [[Socialist Union (UK)|Socialist Union]] which, unlike the SDF, aimed to progress socialist ideals through the parliamentary system.<ref>Marquand, p. 20</ref> MacDonald witnessed the [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] of 13 November 1887 in [[Trafalgar Square]], and in response, had a pamphlet published by the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', entitled ''Remember Trafalgar Square: Tory Terrorism in 1887''.<ref>Marquand, p.21</ref>\n\nMacDonald retained an interest in Scottish politics. [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] [[first Irish Home Rule Bill]] inspired the setting-up of a Scottish Home Rule Association in Edinburgh. On 6 March 1888, MacDonald took part in a meeting of London-based Scots, who, upon his motion, formed the London General Committee of the Scottish Home Rule Association.<ref>Morgan, ''J. Ramsay MacDonald'' (1987) p.17</ref> For a while he supported home rule for Scotland, but found little support among London's Scots.<ref>Marquand, p.23</ref> However, MacDonald never lost his interest in Scottish politics and home rule, and in ''Socialism: critical and constructive'', published in 1921, he wrote: \"The Anglification of Scotland has been proceeding apace to the damage of its education, its music, its literature, its genius, and the generation that is growing up under this influence is uprooted from its past.\"<ref name=\"MacDonald1921\">{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=James Ramsay|title=Socialism: critical and constructive|url=https://archive.org/details/socialismcritica00macdiala|publisher=Cassell and Company Ltd|year=1921|series=Cassell's social economics series}}</ref>\n\nPolitics in the 1880s was still of less importance to MacDonald than furthering his education. He took evening classes in science, botany, agriculture, mathematics, and physics at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]] but his health suddenly failed him due to exhaustion one week before his examinations, which put an end to any thought of a scientific career.<ref>Elton, pp.56\u201357</ref> In 1888, MacDonald took employment as private secretary to [[Thomas Lough]] who was a tea merchant and a [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] politician.<ref>Conor Cruise O' Brien, ''Parnell and his Party'' 1957, p.275</ref> Lough was elected as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Islington West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Islington]], in 1892. Many doors now opened to MacDonald: he had access to the [[National Liberal Club]] as well as the editorial offices of Liberal and Radical newspapers; he made himself known to various London Radical clubs among Radical and labour politicians.  MacDonald gained valuable experience in the workings of electioneering.  At the same time he left Lough's employment to branch out as a freelance journalist.  Elsewhere, as a member of the [[Fabian Society]] for some time, MacDonald toured and lectured on its behalf at the [[London School of Economics]] and elsewhere.<ref>Marquand, p.22</ref>\n\n==Active politics==\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] had created the [[Labour Electoral Association]] (LEA) and entered into an unsatisfactory alliance with the Liberal Party in 1886.<ref>Marquand, p. 31</ref> In 1892, MacDonald was in Dover to give support to the candidate for the LEA in the General Election, who was well beaten.

In May 1894, the local Southampton Liberal Association was trying to find a labour-minded candidate for the constituency.

He was officially adopted as the ILP candidate for one of the Southampton seats on 17 July 1894<ref>Southampton Times, 21 July 1894</ref> but was heavily defeated at the election of 1895. MacDonald stood for Parliament again in 1900 for one of the two Leicester seats and although he lost was generously accused of splitting the Liberal vote to allow the Conservative candidate to win.<ref>Marquand, p. 73</ref> That same year he became Secretary of the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee (1900)|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC), the forerunner of the Labour Party, allegedly in part because many delegates confused him with prominent London trade unionist [[James MacDonald (trade unionist)|Jimmie MacDonald]] when they voted for \"Mr. James R.

(Ed.): British Prime Ministers in the twentieth Century, London, 1977, p. 157</ref> thus giving Labour its first breakthrough into the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].  He married [[Margaret Ethel MacDonald|Margaret Ethel Gladstone]], who was unrelated to the Gladstones of the Liberal Party, in 1896. Although not wealthy, Margaret MacDonald was comfortably off,<ref>MacDonald Papers, P.R.O. 3/95</ref> and this allowed them to indulge in foreign travel, visiting Canada and the United States in 1897, South Africa in 1902, Australia and New Zealand in 1906 and India several times.\n\nIt was during this period that MacDonald and his wife began a long friendship with the social investigator and reforming civil servant [[Clara Collet]]<ref>McDonald, Deborah, ''Clara Collet 1860\u20131948: An Educated Working Woman''; Routledge: 2004</ref><ref>Diary of Clara Collet: Warwick Modern Records Office</ref> with whom he discussed women's issues.  She was an influence on MacDonald and other politicians in their attitudes towards women's rights.  In 1901, he was elected to the [[London County Council]] for Finsbury Central as a joint Labour\u2013[[Progressive Party (London)|Progressive Party]] candidate, but he was disqualified from the register in 1904 due to his absences abroad.{{sfn|Morgan|1987|page=30}}\n\n[[File:Labour Representation Committee leaders 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Macdonald (third from left) in 1906, with other leading figures in the party]]\nIn 1906, the LRC changed its name to the \"[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]\", amalgamating with the ILP.<ref>Clegg, H.A;, Fox, Alan; Thompson, A.F.: ''A History of British Trade Unions since 1889'', 1964, vol I, p. 388</ref> In that same year, MacDonald was elected MP for [[Leicester]] along with 28 others,<ref>Leicester Pioneer, 20 January 1906</ref> and became one of the leaders of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]]. These Labour MPs undoubtedly owed their election to the 'Progressive Alliance' between the Liberals and Labour, a minor party supporting the Liberal governments of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[H.

He was the chief intellectual leader of the party, paying little attention to class warfare and much more to the emergence of a powerful state as it exemplified the Darwinian evolution of an ever more complex society.  He was an Orthodox Edwardian progressive, keen on intellectual discussion, and averse to agitation.<ref>Kenneth Morgan (1987) pp 42\u201343</ref>\n\nWithin a short period, his wife became ill with blood poisoning and died.

[[Arthur Henderson]] became the new leader, while MacDonald took the party Treasurer's post.<ref>MacKintosh, John P (Ed.): ''British Prime Ministers in the Twentieth Century'', (1977), p. 159.</ref> Despite his opposition to the war, MacDonald visited the Western Front in December 1914 with the approval of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. MacDonald and [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|General Seeley]] set off for the front at [[Battle of Ypres|Ypres]] and soon found themselves in the thick of an action in which both behaved with the utmost coolness. Later, MacDonald was received by the Commander-in-Chief at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] and made an extensive tour of the front. Returning home, he paid a public tribute to the courage of the French troops, but said nothing then or later of having been under fire himself.<ref>Elton, pp. 269\u201371</ref>\n\nDuring the early part of the war, he was extremely unpopular and was accused of treason and cowardice. Former Liberal Party MP and publisher [[Horatio Bottomley]] attacked him through his magazine ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'' in September 1915, by publishing an article carrying details of MacDonald's birth and his so-called deceit in not disclosing his real name.<ref>Marquand, p. 189.</ref><ref>Symons, Julian, ''Horatio Bottomley'', Cressett Press, London, 1955, pp. 168\u201369</ref> His illegitimacy was no secret and he had not seemed to have suffered by it, but, according to the journal he had, by using a false name, gained access to parliament falsely and should suffer heavy penalties and have his election declared void. MacDonald received much internal support, but the way in which the disclosures were made public had affected him.<ref name=\"Marquand, pp 190, 191\">Marquand, pp. 190, 191.</ref> He wrote in his diary:\n\n<blockquote>...I spent hours of terrible mental pain. Letters of sympathy began to pour in upon me. ... Never before did I know that I had been registered under the name of Ramsay, and cannot understand it now.

The election campaign in Leicester West focused on MacDonald's opposition to the war, with MacDonald writing after his defeat: \"I have become a kind of mythological demon in the minds of the people\".<ref>Marquand, p. 236.</ref>\n\nMacDonald denounced the [[Treaty of Versailles]]: \"We are beholding an act of madness unparalleled in history\".<ref>Marquand, p. 250.</ref>\n\n==1920\u20131924==\nMacDonald stood for Parliament in the [[1921 Woolwich East by-election]] and lost. His opponent, [[Robert Gee|Captain Robert Gee]], had been awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] at [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]]; MacDonald tried to counter this by having ex-soldiers appear on his platforms. MacDonald also promised to pressure the government into converting the [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] to civilian use.<ref>Marquand, p. 273.</ref> Horatio Bottomley intervened in the by-election, opposing MacDonald's election because of his anti-war record.<ref>Marquand, p. 274.</ref> Bottomley's influence may have been decisive in MacDonald's failure to be elected as there were under 700 votes difference between Gee and MacDonald.<ref>Marquand, pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nIn 1922, MacDonald was returned to the House as MP for [[Aberavon (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberavon]] in Wales, with a vote of 14,318 against 11,111 and 5,328 for his main opponents. His rehabilitation was complete; the Labour ''New Leader'' magazine opined that his election was, \"enough in itself to transform our position in the House. We have once more a voice which must be heard.\"<ref>Marquand, p 283</ref>\nBy now, the party was reunited and MacDonald was [[1922 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|re-elected as Leader]]. Historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] examines his newfound stature:\n: as dissolution set in with the Lloyd George coalition in 1921\u201322, and unemployment mounted,  MacDonald stood out as the leader of a new kind of broad-based left. His opposition to the war had given him a new charisma. More than anyone else in public life, he symbolised peace and internationalism, decency and social change.... [He] had become The voice of conscience.<ref>Kenneth Morgan (1987) pp 44\u201345</ref>\n\nAt the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 election]], Labour replaced the Liberals as the main opposition party to the Conservative government of [[Stanley Baldwin]], making MacDonald [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. By now, he had moved away from the Labour left and abandoned the socialism of his youth: he strongly opposed the wave of radicalism that swept through the labour movement in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and became a determined enemy of Communism. Unlike the [[French Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], the Labour Party did not split and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] remained small and isolated.\n\nIn 1922, MacDonald visited Palestine.<ref name=\"David Cesarani 2006\">David Cesarani. \"Anti-Zionism in Britain, 1922\u20132002: Continuities and Discontinuities\" The Journal of Israeli History 25.1 (2006): 141</ref> In a later account of his visit, he contrasted Zionist pioneers with 'the rich plutocratic Jew'.<ref name=\"David Cesarani 2006\"/> MacDonald believed the latter \"was the true economic materialist. He is the person whose views upon life make one anti-Semitic. He has no country, no kindred. Whether as a sweater or a financier, he is an exploiter of everything he can squeeze. He is behind every evil that Governments do, and his political authority, always exercised in the dark, is greater than that of Parliamentary majorities. He is the keenest of brains and the bluntest of consciences. He detests Zionism because it revives the idealism of his race, and has political implications which threaten his economic interests\"<ref name=\"David Cesarani 2006\"/>\n\nMacDonald became noted for \"woolly\" rhetoric such as the occasion at the Labour Party Conference of 1930 at [[Llandudno]] when he appeared to imply unemployment could be solved by encouraging the jobless to return to the fields \"where they till and they grow and they sow and they harvest\". Equally, there were times when it was unclear what his policies were. There was already some unease in the party about what he would do if Labour was able to form a government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neilson|first1=Keith|last2=Otte|first2=T.G.|title=The Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, 1854\u20131946|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1134231393|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]], the Conservatives had lost their majority, and when they lost a vote of confidence in the House in January 1924, [[George V|King George V]] called on MacDonald to form a minority Labour government, with the tacit support of the Liberals under Asquith from the corner benches.

He consulted widely within his party, making the Liberal [[Lord Haldane]] the [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[Philip Snowden]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He took the foreign office himself. Besides himself, ten other cabinet members came from working class origins, a dramatic breakthrough in British history.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History: 1914\u20131945'' (1965) p 209</ref> His first priority was to undo the perceived damage caused by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]], by settling the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] issue and coming to terms with Germany.

I wonder what she would have thought of a Labour Government!\"<ref>Sir Harold Nicolson, ''King George V: His life and reign'' (1952)</ref>\n\nWhile there were no major labour strikes during his term, MacDonald acted swiftly to end those that did erupt. When the Labour Party executive criticised the government, he replied that, \"public doles, [[Poplar Rates Rebellion|Poplarism]] [local defiance of the national government], strikes for increased wages, limitation of output, not only are not Socialism, but may mislead the spirit and policy of the Socialist movement\".<ref>Taylor, ''English History: 1914\u20131945'', pp. 213\u201314</ref> The Government lasted only nine months and did not have a majority in either House of the Parliament, but it was still able to support the unemployed with the extension of benefits and amendments to the Insurance Acts. In a personal triumph for [[John Wheatley]], Minister for Health, a [[Wheatley Housing Act|Housing Act]] was passed, which greatly expanded [[municipal housing]] for low paid workers.<ref name=\"MacDonald\">Morgan, Kevin.

He founded the Union of Democratic Control in early 1914 to promote international socialist aims, but it was overwhelmed by the war. His 1916 book, ''National Defence'', revealed his own long-term vision for peace. Although disappointed at the harsh terms of the Versailles Treaty, he supported the [[League of Nations]] \u2013 but, by 1930, he felt that the internal cohesion of the British Empire and a strong, independent British defence programme might turn out to be the wisest British government policy.<ref>Keith Robbins, \"Labour Foreign Policy and International Socialism: MacDonald and the League of Nations,\" in Robbins, ''Politicians, Diplomacy and War'' (2003) pp. 239\u201372</ref>\n\nMacDonald moved in March 1924 to end construction work on the Singapore military base, despite strong opposition from the Admiralty. He believed the building of the base would endanger the disarmament conference; the [[First Sea Lord]] [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]] considered the absence of such a base as dangerously imperilling British trade and territories East of [[Aden]] and could mean the security of the British Empire in the Far East being dependent on the goodwill of Japan.<ref>Marquand, pp. 315\u201317</ref>\n\nIn June 1924, MacDonald convened a conference in London of the wartime Allies and achieved an agreement on a new plan for settling the reparations issue and French occupation of the [[Ruhr]]. German delegates joined the meeting, and the [[London Settlement]] was signed. It was followed by an Anglo-German commercial treaty. Another major triumph for MacDonald was the conference held in London in July and August 1924 to deal with the implementation of the [[Dawes Plan]].<ref name=Marks248>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Sally | year = 1978 | title = The Myths of Reparations | journal = Central European History | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 231\u201355 | doi=10.1017/s0008938900018707}}</ref> MacDonald, who accepted the popular view of the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] of [[World War I reparations|German reparations]] as impossible to pay, pressured French Premier [[\u00c9douard Herriot]] until many concessions were made to Germany.<ref name=Marks248/>\n[[File:Ramsay MacDonald Christian Rakovsky 1924.jpg|left|thumb|290x290px|Ramsay MacDonald and [[Christian Rakovsky]], Head of the Soviet diplomatic delegation.

There were, in fact, two proposed treaties: one would cover commercial matters, and the other would cover a fairly vague future discussion on the problem of the bondholders. If the treaties were signed, the British government would conclude a further treaty and guarantee a loan to the Bolsheviks.  The treaties were popular neither with the Conservatives nor with the Liberals, who, in September, criticised the loan so vehemently that negotiation with them seemed impossible.<ref>Lyman, ''The First Labour Government, 1924'' pp. 195\u2013204</ref>  \n\nHowever, the government's fate was determined by the \"[[Campbell Case]]\", the abrogation of prosecuting the left-wing newspaper the ''[[Workers' Weekly (UK)|Workers' Weekly]]'' for inciting servicemen to mutiny. The Conservatives put down a censure motion, to which the Liberals added an amendment. MacDonald's Cabinet resolved to treat both motions as [[motion of confidence|matters of confidence]]. The Liberal amendment was carried, and the King granted MacDonald a dissolution of Parliament the following day.  The issues that dominated the election campaign were the Campbell Case and the Russian treaties, which soon combined into the single issue of the Bolshevik threat.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.J.P.

The letter was dated 15 September and so before the dissolution of parliament: it stated that it was imperative for the agreed treaties between Britain and the Bolsheviks to be ratified urgently. The letter said that those Labour members who could apply pressure on the government should do so. It went on to say that a resolution of the relationship between the two countries would \"assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat ... make it possible for us to extend and develop the ideas of Leninism in England and the Colonies\". \n\nThe government had received the letter before the publication in the newspapers. It had protested to the Bolsheviks' London charg\u00e9 d'affaires and had already decided to make public the contents of the letter with details of the official protest. But it had not been swift-footed enough.<ref>Marquand, p. 382</ref>  \n\nHistorians mostly agree the letter was a forgery, but it closely reflected attitudes current in the Comintern. In any case, it had little impact on the Labour vote, which actually increased. It was the collapse of the Liberal Party that led to the Conservative landslide. However, many Labourites for years blamed their defeat on the Letter by misunderstanding the political forces at work.<ref>Taylor, ''English History: 1914\u20131945'', pp. 219\u201320, 226\u20137</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=C.

The Conservatives were returned decisively, gaining 155 seats for a total of 413 members of parliament. Labour lost 40 seats, but held on to 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats (leaving them with only 40) and their vote fell by over a million. The real significance of the election was that the Liberal Party, which Labour had displaced as the second largest political party in 1922, was now clearly the third party.\n\n==Second government and National government (1929\u20131935)==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Second premiership of Ramsay MacDonald]], [[Second prime ministership of Ramsay MacDonald]] -->\n{{Further|Second MacDonald ministry}}\n\n===Second Labour government (1929\u20131931)===\nThe strong majority held by the Conservatives gave Baldwin a full term during which the government had to deal with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]].

However, an attempt by the Education Minister [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]] to introduce an act to raise the school-leaving age to 15 was defeated by opposition from [[Roman Catholic]] Labour MPs, who feared that the costs would lead to increasing local authority control over faith schools.<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>\n\nIn international affairs he also convened the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table]] conferences in London with the political leaders of India, at which he offered them [[responsible government]], but not independence or even Dominion status.

[[Philip Snowden]] was a rigid exponent of orthodox finance and would not permit any [[Deficit spending#Government deficits|deficit spending]] to stimulate the economy, despite the urgings of Oswald Mosley, [[David Lloyd George]] and the economist John Maynard Keynes. Mosley put forward a memorandum in January 1930, calling for the public control of imports and banking as well as an increase in pensions to boost spending power. When this was repeatedly turned down, Mosley resigned from the government in February 1931 and formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]]. He later converted to [[Fascism]].\n\nBy the end of 1930, unemployment had doubled to over two and a half million.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\">Davies, A.J. (1996) ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus, {{ISBN|0-349-10809-9}}</ref> The government struggled to cope with the crisis and found itself attempting to reconcile two contradictory aims: achieving a balanced budget to maintain [[Pound sterling|sterling]] on the [[gold standard]], and maintaining assistance to the poor and unemployed, at a time when tax revenues were falling. During 1931, the economic situation deteriorated, and pressure from orthodox economists for sharp cuts in government spending increased. Under pressure from its Liberal allies, as well as the Conservative opposition who feared that the budget was unbalanced, Snowden appointed a committee headed by Sir [[George May, 1st Baron May|George May]] to review the state of public finances. The [[May Report]] of July 1931, urged large public-sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending, notably in payments to the unemployed, to avoid a budget deficit.<ref>[[C. L. Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars, 1918\u20131940'' (1955) pp 379\u2013401</ref>\n\n===Formation of the National Government===\n{{Further|National Government (1931)}}\nAlthough there was a narrow majority in the Cabinet for drastic reductions in spending, the minority included senior ministers such as [[Arthur Henderson]] who made it clear they would resign rather than acquiesce in the cuts. With this unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, MacDonald submitted his resignation and then agreed, on the urging of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], to form a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] with the Conservatives and Liberals. With Henderson taking the lead, MacDonald, Snowden, and Thomas were quickly expelled from the Labour Party.<ref>Andrew Thorpe, \"Arthur Henderson and the British political crisis of 1931.\" ''Historical Journal'' 31#1 (1988): 117\u2013139.</ref> They responded by forming a new [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] group, which provided a nominal party base for the expelled MPs, but received little support in the country or the unions. Great anger in the labour movement greeted MacDonald's move. Riots took place in protest in [[Glasgow]] and [[Manchester]]. Many in the Labour Party viewed this as a cynical move by MacDonald to rescue his career, and accused him of 'betrayal'. MacDonald, however, argued that the sacrifice was for the common good.<ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] ''[[Speak for Britain!: A New History of the Labour Party]]'' (2010) pp 212\u201316</ref><ref>Reginald Bassett, ''1931 Political Crisis'' (MacMillan, 1958) defends MacDonald.</ref>\n\n===1931 general election===\nIn the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]], the National Government won 554 seats, comprising 473 Conservatives, 13 National Labour, 68 Liberals (Liberal National and Liberal) and various others, while Labour, now led by Arthur Henderson won only 52 and the Lloyd George Liberals four.  Henderson and his deputy [[J. R. Clynes]] both lost their seats in Labour's worst-ever rout. Labour's disastrous performance at the 1931 election greatly increased the bitterness felt by MacDonald's former colleagues towards him. MacDonald was genuinely upset to see the Labour Party so badly defeated at the election. He had regarded the National Government as a temporary measure, and had hoped to return to the Labour Party.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/>\n\n===Premiership of the National Government (1931\u20131935)===\n{{Further|National Government (1931\u20131935)}}\nThe National Government's huge majority left MacDonald with the largest mandate ever won by a British Prime Minister at a democratic election, but MacDonald had only a small following of National Labour men in Parliament. He was ageing rapidly, and was increasingly a figurehead. In control of domestic policy were Conservatives [[Stanley Baldwin]] as Lord President and [[Neville Chamberlain]] the chancellor of the exchequer, together with [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberal]] [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]] at the Board of Trade.<ref>{{cite book|author=Harford Montgomery Hyde|title=Baldwin; the unexpected Prime Minister|url=https://archive.org/details/baldwinunexpecte0000hyde|url-access=registration|year=1973|publisher=Hart-Davis MacGibbon|page=[https://archive.org/details/baldwinunexpecte0000hyde/page/345 345]}}</ref> MacDonald, Chamberlain and Runciman devised a compromise tariff policy, which stopped short of protectionism while ending free trade and, at the [[British Empire Economic Conference|1932 Ottawa Conference]], cementing commercial relations within the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wrench | first1 = David | year = 2000 | title = 'Very Peculiar Circumstances': Walter Runciman and the National Government, 1931-3 | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 61\u201382 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/11.1.61}}</ref>\n\nBesides his preference for a cohesive British Empire and a protective tariff, he felt an independent British defence programme would be the wisest policy. However, budget pressures and a strong popular pacifist sentiment, forced a reduction in the military and naval budgets.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History 1914\u20131945'' (1965), pp. 359\u201370</ref> MacDonald involved himself heavily in foreign policy.

Most important of all, he presided at the [[World Economic Conference (London)|world economic conference in London]] in June 1933.  Nearly every nation was represented, but no agreement was possible. The American president torpedoed the conference with a bombshell message that the US would not stabilise the depreciating dollar.  The failure marked the end of international economic co-operation for another decade.<ref>Taylor, ''English History: 1914\u20131945'' (1965), pp .334\u201335</ref>\n\nMacDonald was deeply affected by the anger and bitterness caused by the fall of the Labour government. He continued to regard himself as a true Labour man, but the rupturing of virtually all his old friendships left him an isolated figure. One of the only other leading Labour figures to join the government, Philip Snowden, was a firm believer in [[free trade]] and resigned from the government in 1932 following the introduction of tariffs after the [[Ottawa agreement]].{{sfn|Morgan|1987|page=213}}\n\n===Retirement===\nBy 1933 MacDonald's health was so poor that his doctor had to personally supervise his trip to Geneva. By 1934 MacDonald's mental and physical health declined further, and he became an increasingly ineffective leader as the international situation grew more threatening. His speeches in Commons and at international meetings became incoherent. One observer noted how \"Things ... got to the stage where nobody knew what the Prime Minister was going to say in the House of Commons, and, when he did say it, nobody understood it\". Newspapers did not report MacDonald denying to reporters that he was seriously ill because he only had \"loss of memory\".<ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>{{r|gunther1940}} His pacifism, which had been widely admired in the 1920s, led [[Winston Churchill]] and others to accuse him of failure to stand up to the threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]. His government began the negotiations for the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]]. \n\nIn these years he was irritated by the attacks of Lucy, [[Lucy, Lady Houston|Lady Houston]], the strongly nationalistic proprietor of the ''Saturday Review''. [[Lady Houston]] believed that MacDonald was under the control of the Soviets and amused the nation by giving MacDonald such epithets as the 'Spider of Lossiemouth,' and hanging a large sign in electric lights from the rigging of her luxury yacht, the ''Liberty.'' According to some versions it read 'Down the Ramsay MacDonald,' and to others 'To Hell with Ramsay MacDonald.' Lady Houston also sent agents to disrupt his election campaigns. In 2020 new research revealed how she purchased three letters, supposedly written by Ramsay MacDonald to Soviet officials but actually the work of an American forger. In 1935 [[Lady Houston]] stated that she intended to publish them but eventually handed them over to Special Branch, and MacDonald's solicitors entered a legal battle with her.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adventuress, the Life and Loves of Lucy, Lady Houston|last=Crompton|first=Teresa|publisher=The History Press|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMacDonald was aware of his fading powers, and in 1935 he agreed to a timetable with Baldwin to stand down as Prime Minister after King George V's [[Silver Jubilee]] celebrations in May 1935.

The events of 1931, with the downfall of the Labour government and his coalition with the Conservatives, led to MacDonald becoming one of the most reviled figures in the history of the Labour Party, with many of his former supporters accusing him of betraying the party he had helped create.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=16 |title=Labour History |accessdate=9 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930213450/http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=16 |archivedate=30 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2765875.stm Blair makes moral case for war] BBC News, 15 February 2003</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/09/nick-clegg-liberal-democrats \"Nick Clegg and the ghost of Ramsay MacDonald\"], ''The Guardian'', 9 May 2010</ref> [[MacNeill Weir]], MacDonald's former parliamentary private secretary, published the first major biography ''The Tragedy of Ramsay MacDonald'' in 1938.

He argued also to place MacDonald's fateful decision in 1931 in the context of the crisis of the times and the limited choices open to him. Marquand praised the prime minister's decision to place national interests before that of party in 1931. He also emphasised MacDonald's lasting intellectual contribution to socialism and his pivotal role in transforming Labour from an outside protest group to an inside party of government.<ref>Martin (2003) p 837.</ref>\n\nScholarly analysis about the economic decisions taken in the inter-war period such as the return to the Gold Standard in 1925, and MacDonald's desperate efforts to defend it in 1931, has changed. [[Robert Skidelsky]], in his classic account of the 1929\u201331 government, ''Politicians and the Slump'' (1967), compared the orthodox policies advocated by leading politicians of both parties unfavourably with the more radical, proto-Keynesian measures proposed by David Lloyd George and Oswald Mosley. But in the preface to the 1994 edition Skidelsky argued that recent experience of currency crises and [[capital flight]] made it hard to be critical of politicians who wanted to achieve stability by cutting so-called \"labour costs\" and defending the value of the currency.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Skidelsky|title=Politicians and the slump: The Labour Government of 1929\u20131931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEW5AAAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Papermac|isbn=9780333605929}}</ref> In 2004 Marquand advanced a similar argument:\n<blockquote>In the harsher world of the 1980s and 1990s it was no longer obvious that Keynes was right in 1931 and the bankers wrong.  Pre-Keynesian orthodoxy had come in from the cold. Politicians and publics had learned anew that confidence crises feed on themselves; that currencies can collapse; that the public credit can be exhausted; that a plummeting currency can be even more painful than deflationary expenditure cuts; and that governments which try to defy the foreign exchange markets are apt to get their\u2014and their countries'\u2014fingers burnt.  Against that background MacDonald's response to the 1931 crisis increasingly seemed not just honourable and consistent, but right ... he was the unacknowledged precursor of the [[Tony Blair|Blairs]], the [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der|Schr\u00f6ders]], and the [[Bill Clinton|Clintons]] of the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>Marquand (2004)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n{{further|Cultural depictions of British prime ministers#Ramsay MacDonald}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Image:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain.29588.jpg|thumb|upright|MacDonald {{c.|1900s}}]]\nRamsay MacDonald married [[Margaret MacDonald (wife of Ramsay MacDonald)|Margaret Ethel Gladstone]] (no relation to Prime Minister William Gladstone) in 1896.
