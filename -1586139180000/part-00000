The community inherits the former name of the present-day municipality which it belongs to. \n\nNewcastle is located about 80&nbsp;km east of [[Toronto]], and about 18&nbsp;km east of [[Oshawa]] and [[Bowmanville]] on [[Macdonald-Cartier Freeway|Highway 401]]. It is also the southern terminus of [[Ontario Highway 35|Highway 35]] and [[Ontario Highway 115|Highway 115]]. It has been named one of the best small towns in Ontario, by ''Comfort Life'', a website for retirement living in Canada<ref>http://www.comfortlife.ca/best-small-towns-ontario.php</ref>.\n\n==History==\n\nNewcastle was incorporated as a town in 1856.  It remained a small community until the 1990s, when new residential development began and the population quickly swelled. Newcastle had a jail in the late 1800s. Maps of Newcastle from those years have not been discovered. Many have tried to find the location of this jail, but it is believed that it was either demolished or destroyed by the elements. There are jail cells in the Newcastle Community Hall.\n\nNewcastle is surrounded by farms raising cattle, pigs, apples, grain, and corn. The town has a community hall, donated by the [[Massey family]], one public high school (Clarke), two public elementary schools (Newcastle Public School and The Pines Senior Public School), one Catholic elementary school (St. Francis of Assisi), a post office, churches, a few plazas, several small parks, six restaurants, Tim Hortons, a recreation complex, an ice arena, a new fire hall, two grocery stores ([[Foodland_(Canada)| Foodland]] and [[No_Frills_(grocery_store)| No Frills]]), professional offices, hardware stores, a marina on Lake Ontario, and a golf course (Newcastle Golf Course).\n\n===Post office history===\n\nThe first Post office was opened in Newcastle in 1845 with John Short serving as Postmaster. Since that time, Newcastle has had ten postmasters with Charles Gray being the last (in 1991). Following Gray's retirement, Canada Post closed the Post Office since it was deemed too small. Most rural route and suburban mail is now handled by the Bowmanville Canada Post. \n\n==Notable residents==\n\n*[[Joseph E. Atkinson]] (December 23, 1865 \u2013 May 7, 1948) was a Canadian newspaper editor and activist. Under his leadership, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' became one of the largest and most influential newspapers in Canada.\n*[[Charles Brent]]- Bishop of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of the United States, born and raised in Newcastle in 1862.\n* [[Chalk Circle (Canadian band)|Chalk Circle]], a 1980s rock band, was formed in the village. They had hits in Canada with songs like ''[[April Fool (song)|April Fool]]'', ''[[Me, Myself and I (Chalk Circle song)|Me, Myself and I]]'' and ''Sons and Daughters'', a song about the negative effects of free trade with the United States.\n* Susan Kane Doyle, Author of the Nationally Award Winning book, Cooking Wild Style, and long time cooking editor of Ontario Out of Doors, winner of the Pete McGillen Award also lives in the village.\n* Louis G. Lalande (March 11, 1935 - ) is a retired [[pipefitter]] and community volunteer. In 1999, while manning a booth for the [[Knights of Columbus]]' annual charity raffle near a bank at a mall in [[Oshawa]], he foiled a bank robbery by striking the assailant about the head and shoulders with a metal folding chair. The pistol the assailant was brandishing at the time turned out to be a [[starting pistol]], but this was unknown to Lalande and the bank's occupants at the time. Lalande was subsequently awarded the [[Medal of Bravery (Canada)|Medal of Bravery]],<ref>[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2001/2001-03-03/html/gh-rg-eng.html],  Canada Gazette Vol. 135, No. 9 \u2014 March 3, 2001 Government House Canadian Bravery Decorations</ref> and the [[Carnegie Hero Fund#Carnegie Medal|Carnegie Medal for Heroism]].<ref>[http://carnegiehero.org/awardees/awardee-press-releases-1998-present/december-20-2000/#2], Carnegie Hero Fund Commission News Release - December 20, 2000</ref>\n*[[Daniel Massey (manufacturer)|Daniel Massey]], whose farm implement business eventually formed [[Massey-Ferguson]].\n* [[Tara Watchorn]], member of [[Canada women's national ice hockey team]] who won a gold medal at 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics\n* [[Samuel Wilmot]] was believed to live here. He had a great influence on the village, and became interested in the salmon in 1860 and built a \"fish hatchery\" at Newcastle - one of the world's first. [[Wilmot Creek]], a neighboring community, was named after him.\n\n==Town of Newcastle (1973\u201394)==\nThe name \"Town of Newcastle\" was used from 1973\u201394 for the municipality now called the Municipality of Clarington. The name was changed in 1994 to alleviate longstanding confusion between the municipality as a whole and the community of the same name. The community was commonly known as \"Newcastle Village\" to distinguish the two. It was also a confusing fact that Bowmanville had a larger population than \"Newcastle Village\", and it also housed the former Town of Newcastle's municipal offices, causing some to believe the town should have been called \"Bowmanville\" instead of \"Newcastle\" during that period.\n\n==Popular attractions==\n*[[Docville Wild West Park]] is a mock [[American frontier|Wild West]] town that offers its use to filmmakers and other paid visitors.\n* The Newcastle Santa Claus Parade held on a Sunday evening each November began in 2005.\n*[[Allin's Orchard & Country Market]] is an Apple farm which has been supplying produce since the early 1900s.\n*[[Algoma Orchards]] has moved from Whitby to Hwy 2,west of Newcastle in 2009. A large packing and storage facility was built and a retail store including a bakery is part of the large complex.\n*[[Shoppers Drug Mart]] store was built on the main south-east corner of the village in 2010-2011. This location housed many businesses over the last 100-150 including groceries, flower shop, furniture, bakery, woman's dress shop, offices and apartments on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The complete building was torn down and a house behind it to create the new complex in summer of 2010. The demolition was wildly unpopular with residents.  The new complex houses the pharmacy, cosmetics, grocery items and other drug store items as well as the post office.\n*[[Rona (company)|Rona]] hardware store was a tenant on the main south-west corner for many years and moved south to Toronto St. in 2009.

The community inherits the former name of the present-day municipality which it belongs to. \n\nNewcastle is located about 80&nbsp;km east of [[Toronto]], and about 18&nbsp;km east of [[Oshawa]] and [[Bowmanville]] on [[Macdonald-Cartier Freeway|Highway 401]]. It is also the southern terminus of [[Ontario Highway 35|Highway 35]] and [[Ontario Highway 115|Highway 115]]. It has been named one of the best small towns in Ontario, by ''Comfort Life'', a website for retirement living in Canada<ref>http://www.comfortlife.ca/best-small-towns-ontario.php</ref>.\n\n==History==\n\nNewcastle was incorporated as a town in 1856.  It remained a small community until the 1990s, when new residential development began and the population quickly swelled. Newcastle had a jail in the late 1800s. Maps of Newcastle from those years have not been discovered. Many have tried to find the location of this jail, but it is believed that it was either demolished or destroyed by the elements. There are jail cells in the Newcastle Community Hall.\n\nNewcastle is surrounded by farms raising cattle, pigs, apples, grain, and corn. The town has a community hall, donated by the [[Massey family]], one public high school (Clarke), two public elementary schools (Newcastle Public School and The Pines Senior Public School), one Catholic elementary school (St. Francis of Assisi), a post office, churches, a few plazas, several small parks, six restaurants, Tim Hortons, a recreation complex, an ice arena, a new fire hall, two grocery stores ([[Foodland_(Canada)| Foodland]] and [[No_Frills_(grocery_store)| No Frills]]), professional offices, hardware stores, a marina on Lake Ontario, and a golf course (Newcastle Golf Course).\n\n===Post office history===\n\nThe first Post office was opened in Newcastle in 1845 with John Short serving as Postmaster. Since that time, Newcastle has had ten postmasters with Charles Gray being the last (in 1991). Following Gray's retirement, Canada Post closed the Post Office since it was deemed too small. Most rural route and suburban mail is now handled by the Bowmanville Canada Post. \n\n==Notable residents==\n\n*[[Joseph E. Atkinson]] (December 23, 1865 \u2013 May 7, 1948) was a Canadian newspaper editor and activist. Under his leadership, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' became one of the largest and most influential newspapers in Canada.\n*[[Charles Brent]]- Bishop of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of the United States, born and raised in Newcastle in 1862.\n* [[Chalk Circle (Canadian band)|Chalk Circle]], a 1980s rock band, was formed in the village. They had hits in Canada with songs like ''[[April Fool (song)|April Fool]]'', ''[[Me, Myself and I (Chalk Circle song)|Me, Myself and I]]'' and ''Sons and Daughters'', a song about the negative effects of free trade with the United States.\n* Susan Kane Doyle, Author of the Nationally Award Winning book, Cooking Wild Style, and long time cooking editor of Ontario Out of Doors, winner of the Pete McGillen Award also lives in the village.\n* Louis G. Lalande (March 11, 1935 - ) is a retired [[pipefitter]] and community volunteer. In 1999, while manning a booth for the [[Knights of Columbus]]' annual charity raffle near a bank at a mall in [[Oshawa]], he foiled a bank robbery by striking the assailant about the head and shoulders with a metal folding chair. The pistol the assailant was brandishing at the time turned out to be a [[starting pistol]], but this was unknown to Lalande and the bank's occupants at the time. Lalande was subsequently awarded the [[Medal of Bravery (Canada)|Medal of Bravery]],<ref>[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2001/2001-03-03/html/gh-rg-eng.html],  Canada Gazette Vol. 135, No. 9 \u2014 March 3, 2001 Government House Canadian Bravery Decorations</ref> and the [[Carnegie Hero Fund#Carnegie Medal|Carnegie Medal for Heroism]].<ref>[http://carnegiehero.org/awardees/awardee-press-releases-1998-present/december-20-2000/#2], Carnegie Hero Fund Commission News Release - December 20, 2000</ref>\n*[[Daniel Massey (manufacturer)|Daniel Massey]], whose farm implement business eventually formed [[Massey-Ferguson]].\n* [[Tara Watchorn]], member of [[Canada women's national ice hockey team]] who won a gold medal at 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics\n* [[Samuel Wilmot]] was believed to live here. He had a great influence on the village, and became interested in the salmon in 1860 and built a \"fish hatchery\" at Newcastle - one of the world's first. [[Wilmot Creek]], a neighboring community, was named after him.\n\n==Town of Newcastle (1973\u201394)==\nThe name \"Town of Newcastle\" was used from 1973\u201394 for the municipality now called the Municipality of Clarington. The name was changed in 1994 to alleviate longstanding confusion between the municipality as a whole and the community of the same name. The community was commonly known as \"Newcastle Village\" to distinguish the two. It was also a confusing fact that Bowmanville had a larger population than \"Newcastle Village\", and it also housed the former Town of Newcastle's municipal offices, causing some to believe the town should have been called \"Bowmanville\" instead of \"Newcastle\" during that period.\n\n==Popular attractions==\n*[[Docville Wild West Park]] is a mock wild west town that offers its use to filmmakers and other paid visitors.\n* The Newcastle Santa Claus Parade held on a Sunday evening each November began in 2005.\n*[[Allin's Orchard & Country Market]] is an Apple farm which has been supplying produce since the early 1900s.\n*[[Algoma Orchards]] has moved from Whitby to Hwy 2,west of Newcastle in 2009. A large packing and storage facility was built and a retail store including a bakery is part of the large complex.\n*[[Shoppers Drug Mart]] store was built on the main south-east corner of the village in 2010-2011. This location housed many businesses over the last 100-150 including groceries, flower shop, furniture, bakery, woman's dress shop, offices and apartments on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The complete building was torn down and a house behind it to create the new complex in summer of 2010. The demolition was wildly unpopular with residents.  The new complex houses the pharmacy, cosmetics, grocery items and other drug store items as well as the post office.\n*[[Rona (company)|Rona]] hardware store was a tenant on the main south-west corner for many years and moved south to Toronto St. in 2009. They had also opened up a Lumber Center in September 2012. The site on King Street was vacant until July 2011 when a [[Home Hardware]] store opened.\n*[[A Gift of Art]] is a not-for-profit art gallery, shop, and teaching/events facility featuring the work of local artists.

It consists of nuns ([[Sannyasa|Sannyasinis]] and Brahmacharinis) belonging to a monastic order for women. It was formed as per the instructions given by [[Swami Vivekananda]], a patriot-saint of India.<ref>''Swami Vivekananda's Dream, Sri Sarada Math'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2005), p.7</ref> Fifty years after the passing away of Swami Vivekananda, in 1954, the Sri Sarada Math was established at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata with a group of eight nuns.\n\nThe headquarters of Sri Sarada Math is situated on the bank of Ganga in Dakshineshwar, Kolkata. Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\nThe organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta\u2013Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals\u2013jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organisation carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>ibid</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961.

This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>ibid</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>ibid</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity.
