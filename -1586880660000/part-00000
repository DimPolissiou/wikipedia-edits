In 1954 he became a home affairs correspondent in [[London]] before being appointed to the new post of political correspondent in 1960. In 1962 he interviewed the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Hugh Gaitskell]], on the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHf8fjUaOws&t=5s</ref> In 1970 he became the BBC's first political editor, a position he held until being succeeded by [[David Holmes (journalist)|David Holmes]] in 1975.

The party is a member of the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]].\n\nOriginating as the [[Revolutionary Workers' Groups]], located at Connolly House in [[Dublin]], the most prominent early member was [[James Larkin Jnr]] (son of [[James Larkin]]). After being outlawed under the government of [[W. T. Cosgrave]] in 1931 (as part of a wider crackdown on [[Peadar O'Donnell]]'s [[Saor \u00c9ire]] and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|IRA]]), it was legalised in 1932 under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s government and subsequently changed its name to the Communist Party of Ireland in 1933 under [[Sean Murray (politician)|Se\u00e1n Murray]], who had attended the [[Lenin School]] in Moscow.\n\nAfter flirting with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] for a while (a policy criticised by the [[Communist International]]), a strong anti-communist public backlash in Ireland occurred around the time of the [[Spanish Civil War]] due to the perception that the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] cause was anti-Catholic. The already small CPI subsequently found it very difficult to organise. Nevertheless, some CPI members would fight in the conflict, alongside [[Republican Congress]] members, under the [[XV International Brigade]].\n\nSome Irish communists opposed Ireland being brought into the [[Second World War]] and particularly conscription into the [[British Armed Forces]] being applied to [[Northern Ireland]] in the conflict. Some members were held in [[Curragh Camp]] by the government during [[The Emergency (Ireland)|the Emergency]]. As the [[Soviet Union]] became more involved in the war after 1941, this proved even more difficult, and the party split; the Protestant-dominated [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]] became a separate body, and the party's southern rump entered the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]] (before being expelled and forming the [[Irish Workers' Party|Irish Workers' League]]).\n\nThe post-war period would be dominated by the figure of [[Michael O'Riordan]], who eventually in 1970, oversaw the reunification of the Irish Workers' Party and the Communist Party of Northern Ireland, into a reunited Communist Party of Ireland. Throughout his career, O'Riordan kept the party close to a Moscow-line and during [[the Troubles]] was even able to procure some arms for the faction which became the [[Official IRA]]. The party closely supported the [[Cuban Revolution]] and campaigns such as the [[Birmingham Six]]. It suffered splinters such as the Eurocommunist-based [[Irish Marxist Society]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nThe earliest attempt to form a [[communist]] political party in Ireland was a result of the [[Socialist Party of Ireland (1904)|Socialist Party of Ireland]], founded by [[James Connolly]], changing its name to the Communist Party of Ireland and affiliating with the [[Communist International]] in 1921. This organisation was relatively small and included among its ranks figures such as [[Roddy Connolly]] and [[Nora Connolly O'Brien]] (children of James Connolly, who was killed in the aftermath of the [[Easter Rising]]), as well as writers [[Liam O'Flaherty]] and [[Peadar O'Donnell]]. In practice, this organisation was heavily allied to the [[anti-Treaty IRA]] but distinguished itself by calling for a [[workers' republic]]. It had one elected TD, [[Patrick Gaffney (politician)|Patrick Gaffney]], who switched from the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]].\n\nThis earlier group disbanded in 1923 and joined the [[Irish Worker League]] founded by [[James Larkin]] as the Irish representative of Comintern (along with Larkin's [[Workers' Union of Ireland]]). Larkin broke off his affiliation with Comintern in 1928 after a period of private disillusionment with the Soviet Union. The Connolly siblings attempted to set up a replacement, the ''Revolutionary Workers' and Working Farmers' Party'', but this lasted barely a month. Activists associated with [[James Larkin Jnr]] (who had attended the [[Lenin School]] in Moscow) founded the [[Revolutionary Workers' Groups]] in 1930 with their ''[[The Irish Workers' Voice]]'' (distinguished from Larkin Snr's ''[[The Irish Worker]]'') to fully replace the first Communist Party of Ireland.\n\n===Early years===\nThe present-day CPI was founded in 1933 by the [[Revolutionary Workers' Groups]]. In 1941 the part of the party in the [[Republic of Ireland]] suspended its activities, while in [[Northern Ireland]] it continued to operate under the name [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]]. The party was re-established in the Republic in 1948 under the name [[Irish Workers' League]], which changed its name in 1962 to the [[Irish Workers' Party]]. The two sections reunited as the Communist Party of Ireland in 1970.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the Communist Party failed to gain any traction. The party provided most of the Irish volunteers on the government side<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028112140/http://www.geocities.com/irelandscw]</ref> in the 1936\u201339 [[Spanish Civil War]], losing a number of members who were killed in action. The Communist Party of Ireland was also one of the key components in establishing the [[Republican Congress]] in 1934, bringing communists, republicans, trade unionists and tenants' organisations together.<ref>http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/sv2014-09/04-congress.html</ref>\n\n===O'Riordan years===\nHistorically, the party belonged to the wing of international communism that looked to the [[Soviet Union]] for inspiration. In the mid-1960s, the [[U.S. State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 100.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development]'', in ''the [[American Political Science Review]]'', vol. 62, no. 1. (Mar. 1968), p. 122.</ref> The party grew consistently through the 1960s and 1970s. In the late 1960s, some IWP members (notably [[Michael O'Riordan]]) became active in the [[Dublin Housing Action Committee]]. The IWP also condemned the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia]], although O'Riordan was opposed to this position.<ref>''Communism in Modern Ireland: The Pursuit of the Workers' Republic since 1916'', by Mike Milotte, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 1984 (p. 241, 250-1).</ref> In March 1970, following the CPNI/IWP merger, the new Communist Party of Ireland issued a manifesto called ''For Unity and Socialism'', advocating the election of left-wing governments in both parts of Ireland, and, eventually, the creation of a [[United Ireland]].<ref>Milotte, p. 281\u2013282.</ref>\n\nThe CPI strongly criticised the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], claiming the AIA \"underlined Partition and gave Britain a direct say in the affairs of the Republic\".<ref>\"Agreement attacked as imperialist\", [[Jim Cusack]], ''The Irish Times'', 3 February 1986, p. 9</ref> In the 1980s, its membership declined significantly during the electoral rise of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland]] and this trend continued after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. The party's aim is to win the support of the majority of the Irish people for ending the [[capitalist]] system and for building [[socialism]]. It is actively opposed to [[neo-liberalism]] and to the [[European Union]]. Internationally, it maintains fraternal relations with other communist and workers\u2019 parties and is a strong supporter of [[Cuba]] and [[Venezuela]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAutobiographical accounts of the party in this period have been written by Mick O'Reilly<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Lucifer to Lazarus|last=O'Reilly|first=Mick|publisher=Lilliput Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=}}</ref>, [[Helena Sheehan]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Navigating the Zeitgeist|last=Sheehan|first=Helena|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> and Kevin McMahon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organiser|last=McMahon|first=Kevin|publisher=SIPTU|year=2017 |isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===IMS split===\nOne notable split from the CPI was the [[Eurocommunist]] grouplet the [[Irish Marxist Society]], which left the CPI around 1976.

The CPI publishes two papers: a weekly paper called [http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/unity/index.html ''Unity''], and a monthly paper called ''[[Socialist Voice (Ireland)|Socialist Voice]]''. There are also branches in [[Cork city|Cork]], [[Galway]], [[Munster]], and Mid-[[Ulster]].\n\nWhile it is a registered party, the CPI has rarely run candidates in elections and has never had electoral success. The CPI operates a bookshop in [[Dublin]] called [http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/cbooks/index.html Connolly Books] and has the support of a youth organisation, the [[Connolly Youth Movement]]. Both are named after the Irish socialist [[James Connolly]].\n\nThe party and its members are prominent in a number of campaigns such as advocating a \"No\" vote in the [[Lisbon Treaty]] referendums.<ref>Conor McCabe, [http://dublinopinion.com/2009/10/03/lisbon-a-statement-by-the-communist-party-of-ireland/ \"Lisbon Treaty Referendum: A statement by the Communist Party of Ireland\"], 3 October 2009.</ref> The party has also advocated a referendum on the [[Irish bailout of banks]].<ref>Communists call for referendum on non-payment of debt to 'foreign banksers', by Mary Minihan, ''Irish Times'', Saturday, 5 March 2011</ref> It also continues to oppose the [[European Union]] and membership of the [[euro]] currency.<ref>http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/RD.pdf</ref> The CPI is active in [[Right2Water Ireland]] and has called for a constitutional amendment to enshrine ownership of water in the hands of the Irish people and not the state.<ref>http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/sv2014-11/01-water.html</ref> The party also supported the anti-war movement in Ireland as part of the [[Peace and Neutrality Alliance]].\n\nIn November 2017, the [[Standards in Public Office Commission]] stated that some statements of accounts had been received from the CPI, but they were found not to be compliant because the accounts were not audited.

The Communist Party of Ireland was also one of the key components in establishing the [[Republican Congress]] in 1934, bringing communists, republicans, trade unionists and tenants' organisations together.<ref>http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/sv2014-09/04-congress.html</ref>\n\n===O'Riordan years===\nHistorically, the party belonged to the wing of international communism that looked to the [[Soviet Union]] for inspiration. In the mid-1960s, the [[U.S. State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 100.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development]'', in ''the [[American Political Science Review]]'', vol. 62, no. 1. (Mar. 1968), p. 122.</ref> The party grew consistently through the 1960s and 1970s. In the late 1960s, some IWP members (notably [[Michael O'Riordan]]) became active in the [[Dublin Housing Action Committee]]. The IWP also condemned the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia]], although O'Riordan was opposed to this position.<ref>''Communism in Modern Ireland: The Pursuit of the Workers' Republic since 1916'', by Mike Milotte, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 1984 (p. 241, 250-1).</ref> In March 1970, following the CPNI/IWP merger, the new Communist Party of Ireland issued a manifesto called ''For Unity and Socialism'', advocating the election of left-wing governments in both parts of Ireland, and, eventually, the creation of a [[United Ireland]].<ref>Milotte, p. 281-2.</ref>\n\nThe CPI strongly criticised the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], claiming the AIA \"underlined Partition and gave Britain a direct say in the affairs of the Republic\".<ref>\"Agreement attacked as imperialist\", [[Jim Cusack]], ''The Irish Times'', 3 February 1986, p. 9</ref>\nIn the 1980s, its membership declined significantly during the electoral rise of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland]] and this trend continued after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. The party\u2019s aim is to win the support of the majority of the Irish people for ending the [[capitalist]] system and for building [[socialism]]. It is actively opposed to [[neo-liberalism]] and to the [[European Union]]. Internationally, it maintains fraternal relations with other communist and workers\u2019 parties and is a strong supporter of [[Cuba]] and [[Venezuela]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAutobiographical accounts of the party in this period have been written by Mick O'Reilly<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Lucifer to Lazarus|last=O'Reilly|first=Mick|publisher=Lilliput Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=}}</ref>, [[Helena Sheehan]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Navigating the Zeitgeist|last=Sheehan|first=Helena|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> and Kevin McMahon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organiser|last=McMahon|first=Kevin|publisher=SIPTU|year=2017|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===IMS split===\nOne notable split from the CPI was the [[Eurocommunist]] grouplet the [[Irish Marxist Society]], which left the CPI around 1976. The IMS was founded by Joe Deasy (1922\u20132013), Sam Nolan (1930-), Paddy Carmody, George Jeffares, Mick O'Reilly (1946-) and other former CPI members.<ref>\"With other former members he established the Irish Marxist Society.

The CPI publishes two papers: a weekly paper called [http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/unity/index.html ''Unity''], and a monthly paper called ''[[Socialist Voice (Ireland)|Socialist Voice]]''. There are also branches in [[Cork city|Cork]], [[Galway]], [[Munster]], and Mid-[[Ulster]].\n\nWhile it is a registered party, the CPI has rarely run candidates in elections and has never had electoral success. The CPI operates a bookshop in [[Dublin]] called [http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/cbooks/index.html Connolly Books] and has the support of a youth organisation, the [[Connolly Youth Movement]]. Both are named after the Irish socialist [[James Connolly]].\n\nThe party and its members are prominent in a number of campaigns such as advocating a \"No\" vote in the [[Lisbon Treaty]] referendums.<ref>Conor McCabe, [http://dublinopinion.com/2009/10/03/lisbon-a-statement-by-the-communist-party-of-ireland/ \"Lisbon Treaty Referendum: A statement by the Communist Party of Ireland\"], 3 October 2009.</ref> The party has also advocated a referendum on the [[Irish bailout of banks]].<ref>Communists call for referendum on non-payment of debt to 'foreign banksers', by Mary Minihan, Irish Times, Saturday, 5 March 2011</ref> It also continues to oppose the [[European Union]] and membership of the [[euro]] currency.<ref>http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/RD.pdf</ref> The CPI is active in [[Right2Water Ireland]] and has called for a constitutional amendment to enshrine ownership of water in the hands of the Irish people and not the state.<ref>http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/sv2014-11/01-water.html</ref> The party also supported the anti-war movement in Ireland as part of the [[Peace and Neutrality Alliance]].\n\nIn November 2017, the [[Standards in Public Office Commission]] stated that some statements of accounts had been received from the CPI, but they were found not to be compliant because the accounts were not audited.  It decided against appointing a public auditor as the CPI did not receive any funding from the exchequer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/political-parties-statements-accounts-sipo-3722678-Nov2017/|title=Nearly half of Ireland's political parties failed to submit accounts to watchdog|publisher=TheJournal.ie|last=Burke|first=Ceimin|date=29 November 2017|accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==General secretaries==\n:1933\u20131941: [[Sean Murray (politician)|Sean Murray]]\n:1941: Tommy Watters\n:1970\u20131983: [[Michael O'Riordan]]\n:1984\u20132001: [[James Stewart (Irish politician)|Jimmy Stewart]]\n:2002\u2013present: Eugene McCartan\n\n==Chairperson==\n* 1970\u20131983 [[Andy Barr (Irish politician)|Andy Barr]]\n* 1983\u20131989 [[Michael O'Riordan]]\n* 1989\u20132001 Eugene McCartan\n* 2001\u20132004 [[James Stewart (Irish politician)|Jimmy Stewart]]\n* 2004\u20132017 Lynda Walker\n* 2018\u2013present John Pinkerton\n\n==Timeline==\n* 1933 \u2013 Revolutionary Workers' Group disbanded and '''Communist Party of Ireland''' created\n* 1936 - A number of CPI members take part in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n* 1941 \u2013 National Committee suspends independent activity and urges members to join the labour and trade union movements, members in [[Northern Ireland]] form the [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]]\n* 1948 \u2013 [[Irish Workers' League]] established\n* 1962 \u2013 Irish Worker's League renamed [[Irish Workers' Party]]\n* 1970 \u2013 Irish Workers' Party and Communist Party of Northern Ireland merge to form the '''Communist Party of Ireland'''.\n* 1976 \u2013 A number of members left to form the [[Irish Marxist Society]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|communistpartyofireland.ie}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/ConnollyMediaGroup Connolly Media Group] at [[YouTube]]\n*[http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/pairti.html History of the Communist Movement in Ireland]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028114127/http://geocities.com/IrelandSCW/docs-CHsiege.htm  The storming of CPI headquarters, Connolly House (1933)]\n*[http://cedarlounge.wordpress.com/archive-index/ Irish Left Online Document Archive] \u2014 Contains PDF documents of CPI material, with commentary\n\n{{Political parties in Ireland}}\n{{Political parties in Northern Ireland}}\n{{XV International Brigade}}\n{{European communist parties}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Communist Party of Ireland}}\n[[Category:Communist Party of Ireland| ]]\n[[Category:Far-left politics in Ireland]]\n", "name_user": "Jprg1966", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Ireland"}
