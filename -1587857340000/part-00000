He was criticized for his subsequent denial of [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Choma|first1=Lidia|title=Holodomor Facts and History|url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html|ref=Uncovering the Truth}}</ref> most particularly the [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, ''The New York Times'', which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer |first=Karl E. |authorlink=Karl E.

His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C. Clarage, ''Who's who of Pulitzer Prize Winners'', p. 71 [https://books.google.com/books?id=63nvmt4HqTEC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=Emmeline+Hutchins+Duranty&source=bl&ots=VosiR2nfEc&sig=LZKWPDVUaMsurFdUJTqJu4gzgtw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mzl2UpDnAoSl2wW6oIDQBA&redir_esc=y].</ref>\n\nAfter completing his education, Duranty moved to [[Paris]]. Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met [[Aleister Crowley]] and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = <!--Sally J.

Taylor--> | title=Stalin's Apologist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=1990}}</ref> A story Duranty filed about the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] gained him wider notice as a journalist. He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic States]].\n\n==Career in Moscow, 1922\u20131934==\nDuranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After an operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936\u20131938.\n\n===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name.\"<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)</ref> [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\",<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.</ref> which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=The New York Times |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result\u2014the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than\u2014or a different class from\u2014your fellows by individual, self\u2014helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White (Russian) \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] during the same period,<ref>[https://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d, \u0412.\u0417. \u00ab\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u00bb. \u0422\u043e\u043c 6.

(Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.</ref>\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation\".</blockquote>\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the [[Metro-Vickers Affair|arrest of engineers]] from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.</ref> during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda. The food shortage, however, which has affected the whole population in the last year and particularly in the grain-producing provinces&nbsp;\u2014 the Ukraine, [[North Caucasus Krai|North Caucasus]] [i.e. Kuban Region], and the [[Volga region|Lower Volga]]&nbsp;\u2014 has, however, caused heavy loss of life.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty concluded \"it is conservative to suppose\" that, in certain provinces with a total population of over 40 million, mortality had \"at least trebled.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&pg=PA573&dq=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year,+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces&lr=#v=onepage&q=The%20food%20shortage%20which%20has%20affected%20almost%20the%20whole%20population%20in%20the%20last%20year%2C%20and%20particularly%20in%20the%20grain-producing%20provinces&f=false ''Assignment in Utopia'' By Eugene Lyons].</ref> The duel in the press over the famine stories did not damage esteem for Duranty. ''[[The Nation]]'' then described his reporting as \"the most enlightened, dispassionate dispatches from a great nation in the making which appeared in any newspaper in the world.\"<ref name=ConqRav>Conquest, R. ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.</ref>\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"<ref name=\"ConqRav\" />\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.<ref name=Taylor />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.<ref>John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nDuranty died in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\n==Scholarship on Duranty's work==\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936\u20131938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"<ref>Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941</ref>\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" />\n\n===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.</ref>\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932\u201333 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\". He published reports stating \"there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be\" and \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\".<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/pulitzer-winning-lies/article/4040 Pulitzer-Winning Lies] the Weekly Standard</ref> In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the [[Holodomor]].\n\nSince the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. [[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990).

Murphy, ''The Collective Imagination: The Creative Spirit of Free Societies'', Ashgate Publishing, 2012, p. 25.</ref>\n\nIn his 1944 book, Duranty wrote in a chastened tone about his 1932\u201334 reporting, but he offered only a Stalinist defense of it.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\">{{Harvnb|Duranty|1944|pp=188\u2013199}}</ref> He admits that people starved, including not just \"class enemies\" but also loyal communists,<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> but he says that Stalin was forced to order the requisitions to equip the Red Army enough to deter an imminent Japanese invasion<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> (a reprise of the [[Siberian Intervention]] of a decade earlier)\u2014in other words, to save the Soviet Union from impending military doom, not because Stalin wanted to collectivize the population at gunpoint, on pain of death.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> Although it is likely that Stalin ''did'' expect a Japanese invasion (expecting foreign attacks all the time), most historians today do not accept the view that it was his ''sole'' motivation and that Stalin did not intend any cruel and ruthless political dominance of the Soviet population. Of the notion that Stalin did intend the latter, Duranty said, \"What a misconception!\"<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/>\n\n==Calls for revocation of Pulitzer Prize, 1990\u20132003==\nThe concern over Duranty's reporting on the famine in Soviet Ukraine led to a move to posthumously and symbolically strip him of the Pulitzer Prize he received in 1932.\n\nIn response to ''Stalin's Apologist'' (1990), the critical biography by Sally J. Taylor,<ref name=Taylor /> ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\"<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" /> The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.<ref>anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y.

Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of ''The New York Times''{{'}} honor, they should take the prize away.\"<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm \"N.Y.

He was criticized for his subsequent denial of [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Choma|first1=Lidia|title=Holodomor Facts and History|url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html|ref=Uncovering the Truth}}</ref> most particularly the [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, ''The New York Times'', which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer |first=Karl E. |authorlink=Karl E.

His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C.

Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met [[Aleister Crowley]] and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = <!--Sally J.

He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic States]].\n\n==Career in Moscow, 1922\u20131934==\nDuranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After an operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936\u20131938.\n\n===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name.\"<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)</ref> [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\",<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.</ref> which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=The New York Times |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result\u2014the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than\u2014or a different class from\u2014your fellows by individual, self\u2014helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White (Russian) \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] during the same period,<ref>[https://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d, \u0412.\u0417. \u00ab\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u00bb. \u0422\u043e\u043c 6.

(Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.</ref>\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation\".</blockquote>\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the [[Metro-Vickers Affair|arrest of engineers]] from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.</ref> during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda. The food shortage, however, which has affected the whole population in the last year and particularly in the grain-producing provinces&nbsp;\u2014 the Ukraine, [[North Caucasus Krai|North Caucasus]] [i.e. Kuban Region], and the [[Volga region|Lower Volga]]&nbsp;\u2014 has, however, caused heavy loss of life.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty concluded \"it is conservative to suppose\" that, in certain provinces with a total population of over 40 million, mortality had \"at least trebled.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&pg=PA573&dq=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year,+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces&lr=#v=onepage&q=The%20food%20shortage%20which%20has%20affected%20almost%20the%20whole%20population%20in%20the%20last%20year%2C%20and%20particularly%20in%20the%20grain-producing%20provinces&f=false ''Assignment in Utopia'' By Eugene Lyons].</ref> The duel in the press over the famine stories did not damage esteem for Duranty. ''[[The Nation]]'' then described his reporting as \"the most enlightened, dispassionate dispatches from a great nation in the making which appeared in any newspaper in the world.\"<ref name=ConqRav>Conquest, R. ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.</ref>\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"<ref name=\"ConqRav\" />\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.<ref name=Taylor />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.<ref>John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nDuranty died in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\n==Scholarship on Duranty's work==\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936\u20131938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"<ref>Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941</ref>\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" />\n\n===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.</ref>\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932\u201333 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\". He published reports stating \"there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be\" and \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\".<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/pulitzer-winning-lies/article/4040 Pulitzer-Winning Lies] the Weekly Standard</ref> In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the [[Holodomor]].\n\nSince the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. [[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990).

In 1934 he privately reported to the British embassy in Moscow that as many as 10 million people may have died, directly or indirectly, from famine in the Soviet Union in the previous year.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/05/fellow-travellers-and-useful-idiots \"Fellow travelers and useful idiots\", ''The New Statesman'', 8 May 2017].</ref>\n\nBoth [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jQcPAQAAMAAJ ''The Foreign Office and the famine: British documents on Ukraine and the Great Famine of 1932\u20131933''] (Studies in East European nationalisms). \"Duranty&nbsp;... manipulated the official palaver so successfully that it was possible to interpret his article in several ways\", p. xxx.</ref> and American engineer Zara Witkin (1900\u20131940),<ref>{{cite web|first=Joyce |last=Ingraham |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9951419 |title=Zara Witkin |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=November 23, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> who worked in the USSR from 1932 to 1934,<ref>''An American Engineer in Stalin's Russia: The Memoirs of Zara Witkin, 1932\u20131934'', University of California Press.</ref> confirmed that Duranty knowingly misrepresented information about the nature and scale of the famine.\n\nThere are some indications that Duranty's deliberate misdirection concerning the famine may have been the result of duress. Conquest believed Duranty was being blackmailed over his sexual proclivities.<ref>P. Murphy, ''The Collective Imagination: The Creative Spirit of Free Societies'', Ashgate Publishing, 2012, p. 25.</ref>\n\nIn his 1944 book, Duranty wrote in a chastened tone about his 1932\u201334 reporting, but he offered only a Stalinist defense of it.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\">{{Harvnb|Duranty|1944|pp=188\u2013199}}</ref> He admits that people starved, including not just \"class enemies\" but also loyal communists,<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> but he says that Stalin was forced to order the requisitions to equip the Red Army enough to deter an imminent Japanese invasion<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> (a reprise of the [[Siberian Intervention]] of a decade earlier)\u2014in other words, to save the Soviet Union from impending military doom, not because Stalin wanted to collectivize the population at gunpoint, on pain of death.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> Although it is likely that Stalin ''did'' expect a Japanese invasion (expecting foreign attacks all the time), most historians today do not accept the view that it was his ''sole'' motivation and that Stalin did not intend any cruel and ruthless political dominance of the Soviet population. Of the notion that Stalin did intend the latter, Duranty said, \"What a misconception!\"<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/>\n\n==Calls for revocation of Pulitzer Prize, 1990\u20132003==\nThe concern over Duranty's reporting on the famine in Soviet Ukraine led to a move to posthumously and symbolically strip him of the Pulitzer Prize he received in 1932.\n\nIn response to ''Stalin's Apologist'' (1990), the critical biography by Sally J. Taylor,<ref name=Taylor /> ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\"<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" /> The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.<ref>anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y.

Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of ''The New York Times''{{'}} honor, they should take the prize away.\"<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm \"N.Y.

In a press release of November 21, 2003, he stated that with regard to the 13 articles by Duranty from 1931 submitted for the award \"there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception, the relevant standard in this case.\"<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-walter-duranty \"Statement on Walter Duranty's 1932 Prize\"]</ref>\n\n==Literary awards==\n(''other than Pulitzer'')\n* O.

From left: Dirk Benedict, [[Ted Hartley]], [[Jim McMullan]].]]\n\nBenedict's film debut was in the 1972 film ''[[Georgia, Georgia]]''. When the New York run for ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' ended, he received an offer to repeat his performance in [[Hawaii]], opposite [[Barbara Rush]]. While there, he appeared as a guest lead on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''. The producers of a horror film called ''[[Sssssss]]'' (1973) saw Benedict's performance in ''Hawaii Five-O'' and promptly cast him as the lead in that movie. He next played the psychotic wife-beating husband of [[Twiggy]] in her American film debut, ''[[W (1974 film)|W]]'' (1974). Benedict starred in the television series ''[[Chopper One]]'', which aired for one season in 1974. He made two appearances in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''. He also appeared on the \"Donny & Marie\" variety show.\n\nBenedict's career break came in 1978 when he appeared as [[Lieutenant Starbuck]] in the movie and television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. The same year Benedict starred in the TV movie ''Cruise Into Terror'', and appeared in the ensemble movie ''[[Scavenger Hunt]]'' the following year.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nIn 1980, Benedict starred alongside [[Linda Blair]] in an action-comedy movie called ''[[Ruckus (film)|Ruckus]]''. In 1983, Dirk gained further popularity as con-man Lieutenant Templeton \"Face\" Peck in 1980s action television series ''[[The A-Team]]''. He played \"Faceman\" from {{start date|1982}} to {{end date|1986}}, although the series didn't air until January 1983, and the final episode wasn't shown until 1987 rebroadcasts. The [[List of The A-Team episodes#Season 2: 1983\u20131984|second season]] episode \"Steel\" includes a scene at [[Universal Studios]] where Face is seen looking bemused as a [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] walks by him as an in-joke to his previous role in ''Battlestar Galactica''. The clip is incorporated into the series' opening credit sequence from season 3 onward.\n\nIn 1986, Benedict starred as low-life band manager Harry Smilac in the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]'' along with [[Lou Albano]], [[Roddy Piper]], and cameo appearances by [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bruno Sammartino]]. His character Smilac ends up managing the pro-wrestler \"Quick Rick\" Roberts (Piper) and faces opposition by Captain Lou and his wrestling tag-team \"[[The Wild Samoans|the Cannibals]]\".\n\nIn 1987, Benedict took the title role of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Classic Stage Company|Abbey Theatre]] in Manhattan. Both his performance and the entire production were lambasted by critics.<ref>Brucker, D.J.R.

From left: Dirk Benedict, [[Ted Hartley]], [[Jim McMullan]].]]\n\nBenedict's film debut was in the 1972 film ''[[Georgia, Georgia]]''. When the New York run for ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' ended, he received an offer to repeat his performance in [[Hawaii]], opposite [[Barbara Rush]]. While there, he appeared as a guest lead on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''. The producers of a horror film called ''[[Sssssss]]'' (1973) saw Benedict's performance in ''Hawaii Five-O'' and promptly cast him as the lead in that movie. He next played the psychotic wife-beating husband of [[Twiggy]] in her American film debut, ''[[W (1974 film)|W]]'' (1974). Benedict starred in the television series ''[[Chopper One]]'', which aired for one season in 1974. He made two appearances in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''. He also appeared on the \"Donny & Marie\" variety show.\n\nBenedict's career break came in 1978 when he appeared as [[Lieutenant Starbuck]] in the movie and television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.

He played \"Faceman\" from {{start date|1982}} to {{end date|1986}}, although the series didn't air until January 1983, and the final episode wasn't shown until 1987 rebroadcasts. The [[List of The A-Team episodes#Season 2: 1983\u20131984|second season]] episode \"Steel\" includes a scene at [[Universal Studios]] where Face is seen looking bemused as a [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] walks by him as an in-joke to his previous role in ''Battlestar Galactica''. The clip is incorporated into the series' opening credit sequence from season 3 onward.\n\nIn 1986, Benedict starred as low-life band manager Harry Smilac in the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]'' along with [[Lou Albano]], [[Roddy Piper]], and cameo appearances by [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bruno Sammartino]].

The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles. A major influence was the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound. Another feature of the style is the complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]].<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac|title=Video explains the world's most important 6-sec drum loop|last=Proctor|first=Landon|date=21 February 2006|website=|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDrum and bass subgenres include [[breakcore]], [[ragga jungle]], [[hardstep]], [[darkstep]], [[techstep]], [[neurofunk]], ambient drum and bass, [[liquid funk]] (aka liquid drum and bass), jump up, drumfunk, [[funkstep]], [[sambass]], and [[drill 'n' bass]]. From its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. Major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene until [[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]] in February 2016.<ref name=\"bmg.com\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.bmg.com/uk/news/bmg-invests-ram-records.html| title=BMG Invests In Drum & Bass Powerhouse RAM | work=BMG | number= | date=3 February 2016 | accessdate= 18 August 2017}}</ref> Since then the genre has seen a significant growth in exposure. Drum and bass remains most popular in New Zealand, although it has developed smaller satellite scenes all around the world, with countries like Austria, Russia, Estonia, Czech republic, the Netherlands and even the United Kingdom having significant concentrations of DnB artists with the biggest Drum and bass festival [https://letitroll.cz/ Let It Roll ] being hosted in said Czech republic.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of drum and bass}}\n{{See also|Breakbeat hardcore|hardcore jungle}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing [[nightclub]] and overnight outdoor event culture gave birth to new genres in the [[rave]] scene including [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[darkcore]], and [[hardcore jungle]], which combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats, or breakbeats, and other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. From as early as 1991, tracks were beginning to strip away some of the heavier sampling and \"hardcore noises\" and create more bassline and breakbeat led tracks. Some tracks increasingly took their influence from reggae and this style would become known as [[hardcore jungle]] (later to become simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]]), whilst [[darkcore]] (with producers such as [[Goldie]], [[Doc Scott]], Jack Smooth, Foul Play, [[4hero]], and [[2 Bad Mice]]) were experimenting with sounds and creating a blueprint for drum and bass, especially noticeable by late 1993.\n\nBy 1994, [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-fuelled rave scene, jungle also inherited associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995\u20131997). It also began to split into recognisable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a lighter and often jazz-influenced style of drum and bass called \"intelligent drum and bass\" gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996\u20131997), which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.\n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other genres native to the UK, including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. Towards the turn of the millennium, however, its popularity was deemed to have dwindled, as the [[UK garage]] offshoot known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of \"house music\", with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. di Vogli says, \"It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called \"[[garage house]]\" existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music.\" He continues, \"This new garage of the mid-90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage.\"\n\nDespite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day, drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]],<ref name=\"Global Bass landscape\">[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]</ref> and producing successful artists including [[Chase & Status]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], [[Metrik]], and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].\n\n==Musical features==\nDrum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterise the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"SimonReynoldsOnTechstep\"/> The sounds of drum and bass are extremely varied due to the range of influences behind the music. Drum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre, with the only \"live\" element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. \"Live\" drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.<ref>New Dawn \u2013 City Clubs Take Back The Night article,

A more recent commonly used break is the \"Tramen\", which combines the [[Amen break]], a [[James Brown]] funk breakbeat (\"[[Tighten Up (Archie Bell & the Drells song)|Tighten Up]]\" or \"Samurai\" break) and an [[Alex Reece]] drum and bass breakbeat.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Dom & Roland interview by Ben Willmott at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724011252/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archivedate = 24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe relatively fast drum beat forms a canvas on which a producer can create tracks to appeal to almost any taste and often will form only a background to the other elements of the music. [[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807102130/http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| archive-date = 7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]] is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\" />\n\n===Bass elements===\nThe genre places great importance on the [[bassline]], in this case a deep [[sub-bass]] musical pattern which can be felt physically through powerful sound systems due to the low-range frequencies favoured. There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common, but examples can be found in the work of artists such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].\n\n===Atmospheric elements===\nAtmospheric pads and samples may be added over the fundamental drum and bass to provide different feels.   These have included \"light\" elements such as ambient pads as found in ambient electronica and samples of jazz and world musics, or \"dark\" elements such as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] pads and sci-fi samples to induce anxiety in the dancer.\n\n===Vocal and Melody elements===\nOld-school DnB usually included an MC providing vocals.   Some styles (such as jazz influenced DnB) also include melodic instruments soloing over the music.\n\n===Tempo===\nDrum and bass is usually between 160\u2013180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130\u2013140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155\u2013165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170\u2013180 range. Recently, some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150-170 bpm range), but the mid-170s tempo is still a hallmark of the drum and bass sound.<ref name = \"Zinc\"/><ref name = \"Fabio3\"/>\n\nA track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass, but  instead may qualify as a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = 5 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| archivedate = 7 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Drop===\nMany mixing points begin or end with a \"[[drop (music)|drop]]\". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Sometimes, the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point. Some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will \"rewind\" or \"reload\" or \"lift up\" the record by spinning it back and restarting it at the build. The drop is often a key point from the point of view of the dance floor, since the drum breaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to begin dancing.\n\n==Live performance==\n\n[[File:Pendulumsamuelnordstrom.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] performing live in 2010]]\n\nDrum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can sometimes only be fully appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies, including [[sub-bass]] frequencies that are often felt more than heard. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.\n\nThere are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The DJ mix is a particularly popular form of release, with a popular DJ or producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.<ref>\"The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society\", ''The Independent'', 23 July 2003</ref>\n\n===DJ performance===\n\nAlthough this practice has declined in popularity,<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = When the drum and bass gradually fell into the orbit of techno, the MC \u2014 both as a samplesource taken from dancehall and rap records and as a live partner of the DJ in the club \u2014 began to disappear from the music.\n}}</ref> DJs are often accompanied by one or more [[Master of Ceremonies|MCs]], drawing on the genre's roots in [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]]/[[ragga]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD2OTWHppzs | title = Goldie in Shanghai on youtube.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nMCs do not generally receive the same level of recognition as producer/DJs, and some events are specifically marketed as being MC-free.

With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.\n\n====Distributors (wholesale)====\nThe bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, & Nu Urban Music Limited.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309024815/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archive-date = 9 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator.

There are strong scenes in other English-speaking countries including Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States.<ref>\"Drum & Bass Keeps The Beat\", ''Boston Globe'', 6 February 2003.</ref>\n\n====Continental Europe====\nDnB is popular in continental [[Europe]]. The [[Czech Republic]] currently hosts the largest drum and bass festival in the world, LET IT ROLL, with an annual attendance of approximately 30,000. The genre is also encountered in [[Slovakia]], and local producers in both countries such as A-Cray, Rido, Forbidden Society, L Plus, B-Complex, Changing Faces, Lixx, Dephzac, and Gabanna are becoming well known worldwide. There are several other drum and bass festivals being held each year in these countries, including Trident Festival, Exploration Festival, or Hoofbeats Open Air in the summer, or one-night events such as LET IT ROLL Winter, Imagination Festival, and LET IT ROLL Winter [[Slovakia]] in the colder months. During club season, promoters race between each other to organise better events, often resulting in up to ten parties being held during one weekend, with no more than a two-hour travel between them.\n\nAustria has a large emerging DnB scene with many artists such as [[Camo & Krooked]], Mefjus, Fourward, Body & Soul, [[Ill.Skillz]] and mainly the Mainframe record label being all based in or around [[Vienna]]. Notable venues and events include \"The Hive\" and \"Beat It\" held at [[Flex (club)|Flex]] almost every Thursday and Saturday, \"Vollkontakt\" at Fluc, \"Switch\" at Flex, and the monthly Mainframe Recordings Label Night hosted at Arena by label head Disaszt.\n\nIn Ireland, the biggest scene by far is in Dublin, with a night every Sunday by the Initial Kru mostly showcasing local DJ's but occasionally bringing over international guests such as Spirit and Seba. Record label Boey Audio also run events showcasing local, national and international acts, as well as promoters such as S\u00f3l F\u00fad, Ragga Jungle Dublin and Springfield Crew Massive. There are much smaller regional scenes in areas such as Limerick, Cork and Galway which usually have monthly nights.\n\n====South America====\nBrazilian drum and bass is sometimes referred to as \"[[sambass]]\", with a specific [[samba]]-influenced style and sound made popular by artists like [[DJ Marky]] and [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]].\n\nIn Venezuela and Mexico, artists have created their own forms of drum and bass, combining it with experimental musical forms.\n\nIn Colombia, there is a large underground scene. RE.set and Bogot\u00e1 Project are two collectives that organise drum and bass events in the city, as well as a bi-annual event called Radikal Styles that brings together local talent and international big names.\n\n===Media presence===\nToday, drum and bass is widely promoted using different methods such as [[video sharing service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]], [[blog]]s, [[radio]], and [[television]], the latter being the most uncommon method. More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and [[Mixcloud]] have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|title=Pirate Radio Stations - A Brief Timeline of the UK scene|website=www.fantazia.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104728/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Radio====\nThe three highest-profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show - formerly with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], who was replaced with [[Ren\u00e9 LaVice]] in 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukf.com/news/friction-announces-departure-from-radio-1-1xtra-rene-lavice-to-takeover-from-november/20518|title=Friction announces departure from Radio 1 & 1Xtra, Rene LaVice to takeover from November|website=www.ukf.com|access-date=8 January 2018|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London.

Radio 1 also had a 'One in the Jungle' show.\n\nThe BBC's \"urban\" station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29 August 2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00|title=27/08/2014, D&B with Crissy Criss - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref> as its advocates. The network also organises a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of drum and bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only drum and bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal licence), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax FM and Eruption among the most influential.\n\nAs of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way into UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1|title=D&B Soundclash Special, MistaJam - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2014, there have been 6 drum & bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialisation of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] and [[DJ Fresh]] (all have had two No.1 hits).\n\n=====Internet radio=====\nInternet radio stations, acting in the same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.\n\nDrum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014 and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Fabio]] & [[Grooverider]], DJ Marky, Viper Recordings, [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]]. From September 2014, Ministry abruptly dropped all non-mainstream genres to focus on mainstream EDM, causing disappointment amongst the fans of the D&B community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kmag.co.uk/ministry-of-sound-radio-drops-drum-bass/|title=Ministry Of Sound Radio Drops Drum & Bass|last1=Steven|first1=Colin|date=26 September 2014|website=K Mag|access-date=}}</ref> The leading Drum & Bass radio Station is now Denver's [https://dnbradio.com DnB Radio], established in 2003 by M.

The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles. A major influence was the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound. Another feature of the style is the complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]].<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac|title=Video explains the world's most important 6-sec drum loop|last=Proctor|first=Landon|date=21 February 2006|website=|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDrum and bass subgenres include [[breakcore]], [[ragga jungle]], [[hardstep]], [[darkstep]], [[techstep]], [[neurofunk]], ambient drum and bass, [[liquid funk]] (aka liquid drum and bass), jump up, drumfunk, [[funkstep]], [[sambass]], and [[drill 'n' bass]]. From its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. Major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene until [[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]] in February 2016.<ref name=\"bmg.com\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.bmg.com/uk/news/bmg-invests-ram-records.html| title=BMG Invests In Drum & Bass Powerhouse RAM | work=BMG | number= | date=3 February 2016 | accessdate= 18 August 2017}}</ref> Since then the genre has seen a significant growth in exposure. Drum and bass remains most popular in New Zealand, although it has developed smaller satellite scenes all around the world, with countries like Austria, Russia, Estonia, Czech republic, the Netherlands and even the United Kingdom having significant concentrations of DnB artists with the biggest Drum and bass festival [https://letitroll.cz/ Let It Roll ] being hosted in said Czech republic.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of drum and bass}}\n{{See also|Breakbeat hardcore|hardcore jungle}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing [[nightclub]] and overnight outdoor event culture gave birth to new genres in the [[rave]] scene including [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[darkcore]], and [[hardcore jungle]], which combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats, or breakbeats, and other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. From as early as 1991, tracks were beginning to strip away some of the heavier sampling and \"hardcore noises\" and create more bassline and breakbeat led tracks. Some tracks increasingly took their influence from reggae and this style would become known as [[hardcore jungle]] (later to become simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]]), whilst [[darkcore]] (with producers such as [[Goldie]], [[Doc Scott]], Jack Smooth, Foul Play, [[4hero]], and [[2 Bad Mice]]) were experimenting with sounds and creating a blueprint for drum and bass, especially noticeable by late 1993.\n\nBy 1994, [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-fuelled rave scene, jungle also inherited associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995\u20131997). It also began to split into recognisable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a lighter and often jazz-influenced style of drum and bass called \"intelligent drum and bass\" gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996\u20131997), which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.\n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other genres native to the UK, including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. Towards the turn of the millennium, however, its popularity was deemed to have dwindled, as the [[UK garage]] offshoot known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of \"house music\", with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. di Vogli says, \"It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called \"[[garage house]]\" existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music.\" He continues, \"This new garage of the mid-90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage.\"\n\nDespite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day, drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]],<ref name=\"Global Bass landscape\">[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]</ref> and producing successful artists including [[Chase & Status]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], [[Metrik]], and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].\n\n==Musical features==\nDrum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterise the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"SimonReynoldsOnTechstep\"/> The sounds of drum and bass are extremely varied due to the range of influences behind the music. Drum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre, with the only \"live\" element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. \"Live\" drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.<ref>New Dawn \u2013 City Clubs Take Back The Night article,

He followed these up with equally influential (and bassline-heavy) tracks in the UK hardcore style as Tronik House in 1991\u20131992.

A more recent commonly used break is the \"Tramen\", which combines the [[Amen break]], a [[James Brown]] funk breakbeat (\"[[Tighten Up (Archie Bell & the Drells song)|Tighten Up]]\" or \"Samurai\" break) and an [[Alex Reece]] drum and bass breakbeat.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Dom & Roland interview by Ben Willmott at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724011252/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archivedate = 24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe relatively fast drum beat forms a canvas on which a producer can create tracks to appeal to almost any taste and often will form only a background to the other elements of the music. [[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807102130/http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| archive-date = 7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]] is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\" />\n\n===Bass elements===\nThe genre places great importance on the [[bassline]], in this case a deep [[sub-bass]] musical pattern which can be felt physically through powerful sound systems due to the low-range frequencies favoured. There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common, but examples can be found in the work of artists such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].\n\n===Atmospheric elements===\nAtmospheric pads and samples may be added over the fundamental drum and bass to provide different feels.   These have included \"light\" elements such as ambient pads as found in ambient electronica and samples of jazz and world musics, or \"dark\" elements such as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] pads and sci-fi samples to induce anxiety in the dancer.\n\n===Vocal and Melody elements===\nOld-school DnB usually included an MC providing vocals.   Some styles (such as jazz influenced DnB) also include melodic instruments soloing over the music.\n\n===Tempo===\nDrum and bass is usually between 160\u2013180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130\u2013140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155\u2013165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170\u2013180 range. Recently, some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150-170 bpm range), but the mid-170s tempo is still a hallmark of the drum and bass sound.<ref name = \"Zinc\"/><ref name = \"Fabio3\"/>\n\nA track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass, but  instead may qualify as a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = 5 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| archivedate = 7 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Drop===\nMany mixing points begin or end with a \"[[drop (music)|drop]]\". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Sometimes, the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point. Some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will \"rewind\" or \"reload\" or \"lift up\" the record by spinning it back and restarting it at the build. The drop is often a key point from the point of view of the dance floor, since the drum breaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to begin dancing.\n\n==Live performance==\n\n[[File:Pendulumsamuelnordstrom.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] performing live in 2010]]\n\nDrum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can sometimes only be fully appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies, including [[sub-bass]] frequencies that are often felt more than heard. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.\n\nThere are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The DJ mix is a particularly popular form of release, with a popular DJ or producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.<ref>\"The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society\", ''The Independent'', 23 July 2003</ref>\n\n===DJ performance===\n\nAlthough this practice has declined in popularity,<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = When the drum and bass gradually fell into the orbit of techno, the MC \u2014 both as a samplesource taken from dancehall and rap records and as a live partner of the DJ in the club \u2014 began to disappear from the music.\n}}</ref> DJs are often accompanied by one or more [[Master of Ceremonies|MCs]], drawing on the genre's roots in [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]]/[[ragga]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD2OTWHppzs | title = Goldie in Shanghai on youtube.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nMCs do not generally receive the same level of recognition as producer/DJs, and some events are specifically marketed as being MC-free.

With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.\n\n====Distributors (wholesale)====\nThe bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, & Nu Urban Music Limited.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309024815/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archive-date = 9 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator.

There are strong scenes in other English-speaking countries including Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States.<ref>\"Drum & Bass Keeps The Beat\", ''Boston Globe'', 6 February 2003.</ref>\n\n====Continental Europe====\nDnB is popular in continental [[Europe]]. The [[Czech Republic]] currently hosts the largest drum and bass festival in the world, LET IT ROLL, with an annual attendance of approximately 30,000. The genre is also encountered in [[Slovakia]], and local producers in both countries such as A-Cray, Rido, Forbidden Society, L Plus, B-Complex, Changing Faces, Lixx, Dephzac, and Gabanna are becoming well known worldwide. There are several other drum and bass festivals being held each year in these countries, including Trident Festival, Exploration Festival, or Hoofbeats Open Air in the summer, or one-night events such as LET IT ROLL Winter, Imagination Festival, and LET IT ROLL Winter [[Slovakia]] in the colder months. During club season, promoters race between each other to organise better events, often resulting in up to ten parties being held during one weekend, with no more than a two-hour travel between them.\n\nAustria has a large emerging DnB scene with many artists such as [[Camo & Krooked]], Mefjus, Fourward, Body & Soul, [[Ill.Skillz]] and mainly the Mainframe record label being all based in or around [[Vienna]]. Notable venues and events include \"The Hive\" and \"Beat It\" held at [[Flex (club)|Flex]] almost every Thursday and Saturday, \"Vollkontakt\" at Fluc, \"Switch\" at Flex, and the monthly Mainframe Recordings Label Night hosted at Arena by label head Disaszt.\n\nIn Ireland, the biggest scene by far is in Dublin, with a night every Sunday by the Initial Kru mostly showcasing local DJ's but occasionally bringing over international guests such as Spirit and Seba. Record label Boey Audio also run events showcasing local, national and international acts, as well as promoters such as S\u00f3l F\u00fad, Ragga Jungle Dublin and Springfield Crew Massive. There are much smaller regional scenes in areas such as Limerick, Cork and Galway which usually have monthly nights.\n\n====South America====\nBrazilian drum and bass is sometimes referred to as \"[[sambass]]\", with a specific [[samba]]-influenced style and sound made popular by artists like [[DJ Marky]] and [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]].\n\nIn Venezuela and Mexico, artists have created their own forms of drum and bass, combining it with experimental musical forms.\n\nIn Colombia, there is a large underground scene. RE.set and Bogot\u00e1 Project are two collectives that organise drum and bass events in the city, as well as a bi-annual event called Radikal Styles that brings together local talent and international big names.\n\n===Media presence===\nToday, drum and bass is widely promoted using different methods such as [[video sharing service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]], [[blog]]s, [[radio]], and [[television]], the latter being the most uncommon method. More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and [[Mixcloud]] have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|title=Pirate Radio Stations - A Brief Timeline of the UK scene|website=www.fantazia.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104728/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Radio====\nThe three highest-profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show - formerly with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], who was replaced with [[Ren\u00e9 LaVice]] in 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukf.com/news/friction-announces-departure-from-radio-1-1xtra-rene-lavice-to-takeover-from-november/20518|title=Friction announces departure from Radio 1 & 1Xtra, Rene LaVice to takeover from November|website=www.ukf.com|access-date=8 January 2018|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London.

Radio 1 also had a 'One in the Jungle' show.\n\nThe BBC's \"urban\" station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29 August 2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00|title=27/08/2014, D&B with Crissy Criss - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref> as its advocates. The network also organises a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of drum and bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only drum and bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal licence), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax FM and Eruption among the most influential.\n\nAs of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way into UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1|title=D&B Soundclash Special, MistaJam - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2014, there have been 6 drum & bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialisation of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] and [[DJ Fresh]] (all have had two No.1 hits).\n\n=====Internet radio=====\nInternet radio stations, acting in the same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.\n\nDrum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014 and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Fabio]] & [[Grooverider]], DJ Marky, Viper Recordings, [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]]. From September 2014, Ministry abruptly dropped all non-mainstream genres to focus on mainstream EDM, causing disappointment amongst the fans of the D&B community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kmag.co.uk/ministry-of-sound-radio-drops-drum-bass/|title=Ministry Of Sound Radio Drops Drum & Bass|last1=Steven|first1=Colin|date=26 September 2014|website=K Mag|access-date=}}</ref> The leading Drum & Bass radio Station is now Denver's [https://dnbradio.com DnB Radio], established in 2003 by M.
