Jung's work was influential in the fields of [[psychiatry]], anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous [[Burgh\u00f6lzli]] hospital, under [[Eugen Bleuler]].\n\nFreud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his \"new science\" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as President of his newly founded [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to bend to his older colleague's doctrine, and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung, and it was to have historic repercussions lasting well into the modern day.\n\nAmong the central concepts of analytical psychology is [[Individuation#Carl Jung|individuation]]\u2014the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including [[synchronicity]], [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal phenomena]], the [[collective unconscious]], the [[Complex (psychology)|psychological complex]], and [[extraversion and introversion]].\n\nJung was also an artist, craftsman and builder as well as a prolific writer.

Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished [[Basel]] churchman and academic, {{Interlanguage link multi|Samuel Preiswerk|de}} (1799\u20131871), and his second wife. Preiswerk was ''[[antistes]]'', the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a [[Hebraist]], author and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at [[Basel University]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Gerhard|title=Jung: A Biography|year=1987|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston/Shaftesbury, Dorset|isbn=978-0-87773-455-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17 17\u201319]|url=https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jung was six months old, his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in [[Laufen-Uhwiesen|Laufen]], but the tension between his parents was growing.

His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence.

He was an Arabist; but the family money ran out for his studies.

Paul Jung therefore had his career determined by a will, not his will. See page 20.</ref>\n\nA number of childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny [[mannequin]] into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic.

Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with [[totem]]s in [[indigenous cultures]], such as the collection of soul-stones near [[Arlesheim]] or the ''[[tjurunga]]s'' of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=22\u201323}}</ref> His observations about symbols, [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], and the [[collective unconscious]] were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.<ref>Wehr, G. p. 144</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 12, shortly before the end of his first year at the [[:de:Gymnasium am M\u00fcnsterplatz|Humanistisches Gymnasium]] in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he momentarily lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized that the incident was indirectly his fault.) A thought then came to him\u2014\"now you won't have to go to school anymore.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=30}}</ref> From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had [[epilepsy]]. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over [[Latin grammar]]. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, \"was when I learned what a [[neurosis]] is.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=32}}</ref>\n\n====University studies and early career====\nInitially, Jung had aspirations of becoming a preacher or minister in his early life. There was a strong moral sense in his household and several of his family members were clergymen as well. For a time, Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach archaeology. After studying philosophy in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided instead to pursue psychiatry and medicine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=9 April 2019}}</ref> His interest was immediately captured\u2014it combined the biological and the spiritual, exactly what he was searching for.<ref name=\"jungbio1\">[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/carl-jung.html Carl Jung].

For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'', which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured\u2014each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. [[Henri Ellenberger]] called Jung's intense experience a \"creative illness\" and compared it favorably to Freud's own period of what he called [[neurasthenia]] and [[hysteria]].<ref name=\"hayman2001\">{{cite book|last=Hayman|first=Ronald|title=A Life of Jung|year=2001|edition=1st American|publisher=W.W.

Jung had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]. In 1900, Jung completed his degree, and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist, [[Eugen Bleuler]] at Burgh\u00f6lzli Hospital.<ref>Wehr, Gerhard. (1987). ''Jung \u2013 A Biography''. Boston/Shaftesbury: Shambhala. {{ISBN|0 87773 455 0}}. p.&nbsp;77</ref> It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899). In the early 1900s [[psychology]] as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud's new \"psycho-analysis.\" At the time, Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burgh\u00f6lzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich and Jung's research had already gained him international recognition. In 1906 he published ''Diagnostic Association Studies'', and later sent a copy of this book to Freud\u2014who had already bought a copy.<ref name=diagnostic/> Preceded by a lively correspondence, Jung met Freud for the first time, in Vienna on 3 March 1907.<ref>Wehr, p. 105-6.</ref> In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded ''Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research.''\n\nIn 1909, Jung travelled with Freud and Hungarian psychoanalyst [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] to the United States; they took part in a conference at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts. The conference at [[Clark University]] was planned by the psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]] and included twenty-seven distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America.

However, after forceful objections from his Viennese colleagues, it was agreed Jung would be elected to serve a two-year term of office.<ref>{{cite book|last=Makari|first=George|title=Revolution in Mind: The Creation of Psychoanalysis|publisher=Duckworth|date=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/revolutioninmind0000maka/page/249 249]|isbn=9780715637593|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/revolutioninmind0000maka/page/249}}</ref>\n\n====Divergence and break====\n[[File:Jung 1910-crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jung outside Burgh\u00f6lzli in 1910]]\nWhile Jung worked on his ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido'', tensions manifested between him and Freud because of various disagreements, including those concerning the nature of [[libido]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Carl|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections|url=https://archive.org/details/memoriesdreamsre00jung|url-access=registration|year=1963|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoriesdreamsre00jung/page/206 206]}}</ref> Jung {{nowrap|de-emphasized}} the importance of sexual development and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors.

Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the United States and gave the [[Fordham University]] lectures, a six-week series, which were published later in the year as ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido'', (subsequently republished as ''[[Symbols of Transformation]]''). While they contain some remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the libido, they represent largely a \"psychoanalytical Jung\" and not the theory of analytical psychology, for which he became famous in the following decades. Nonetheless it was their publication which, Jung declared, \"cost me my friendship with Freud\".<ref name=\"Gay 2006 225\">{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Gay|title= Freud: A Life for Our Time|publisher=Norton| date =2006 | pages = 225|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAnother primary disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious.<ref>Mary Williams, \"The Indivisibility of the Personal and Collective Unconscious\", ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'' 8.1, January 1963.

Letters they exchanged show Freud's refusal to consider Jung's ideas. This rejection caused what Jung described in his (posthumous) 1962 autobiography, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', as a \"resounding censure\". Everyone he knew dropped away except for two of his colleagues. Jung described his book as \"an attempt, only partially successful, to create a wider setting for medical psychology and to bring the whole of the psychic phenomena within its purview.\" The book was later revised and retitled ''Symbols of Transformation'' in 1922.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=====London 1913\u201314=====\nJung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914.

He worried at times that he was \"menaced by a psychosis\" or was \"doing a schizophrenia\". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, \"[[active imagination]]s\". He recorded everything he felt in small journals.

In Jung's ''Psychological Types'', he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychological Types|author=C.G.

William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1977; Robert H. Hopcke, ''Persona''. Berkeley: Shambhala Publications, 1995.</ref> Jung applied the term ''[[persona]]'', explicitly because, in Latin, it means both ''personality'' and the ''masks'' worn by Roman actors of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], expressive of the individual roles played.\n\nThe ''persona'', he argues, is a mask for the \"collective psyche\", a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played ''role'' through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the \"persona-mask\" as a complicated system which ''mediates'' between individual consciousness and the social community: it is \"a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be\".<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]]\", The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious\", in: [[Joseph Campbell]] (ed.), ''The Portable Jung''. New York: Viking Press, 1971, p. 106.</ref> But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a ''character mask'' in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]], ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2nd ed. 1977, p. 157.</ref> The therapist then aims to assist the [[individuation]] process through which the client (re)gains their \"own self\" \u2013 by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the ''persona'', and from the power of unconscious impulses.\n\nJung has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate \"management persona\" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,<ref>Joann S. Lublin, \"How to Look and Act Like a Leader\", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 12 September 2011.</ref> but also because they have to evaluate ''what sort of people'' the workers are, in order to manage them (for example, using [[personality test]]s and [[peer review]]s).<ref>[[Kees van der Pijl]], \"May 1968 and the Alternative Globalist Movement \u2013 Cadre Class Formation and the Transition to Socialism\".

The shadow is the result of an individual's attempt to adapt to cultural norms and expectations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society, but also those  that are not aligned with one's own personal morals and values.\n\nJung argues that the ''shadow'' plays an important role in balancing one's overall psyche - \"where there is light, there must also be shadow\u201d. Without a well-developed ''shadow'', an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others - i.e., a walking [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']].<ref name=\":0\" /> Not wanting to look at their shadow's directly, Jung argues, causes many individuals to project them onto others. Basically, the qualities an individual may hate in another, are actually also present in that individual, who wishes not to see them.<ref name=\":0\" /> In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']] and ''[[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]]'' should be balanced.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe shadow can appear in dreams or visions, often taking the form of a dark, wild, exotic figure.\n\n===Spirituality===\nJung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp_djvu.txt Aniela Jaffe, foreword to ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'']</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dunne|first=Clare |title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|year=2002|page=3|chapter=Prelude|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=uegLZklR0fEC&pg=PA3 | isbn=978-0-8264-6307-4 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}</ref> Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep, innate potential.

After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed.\n\nHazard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal, spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a Christian [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement known as the [[Oxford Group]] (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was [[Ebby Thacher]], a long-time friend and drinking buddy of [[William Griffith Wilson|Bill Wilson]], later co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group and, through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original [[twelve-step program]].\n\nThe above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill Wilson, excerpts of which can be found in ''Pass It On'', published by Alcoholics Anonymous.<ref>Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.

Jung's work was influential in the fields of [[psychiatry]], anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous [[Burgh\u00f6lzli]] hospital, under [[Eugen Bleuler]]. During this time, he came to the attention of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]]. The two men conducted a [[The Freud/Jung Letters|lengthy correspondence]] and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.\n\nFreud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his \"new science\" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as President of his newly founded [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to bend to his older colleague's doctrine, and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung, and it was to have historic repercussions lasting well into the modern day.\n\nAmong the central concepts of analytical psychology is [[Individuation#Carl Jung|individuation]]\u2014the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including [[synchronicity]], [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal phenomena]], the [[collective unconscious]], the [[Complex (psychology)|psychological complex]], and [[extraversion and introversion]].\n\nJung was also an artist, craftsman and builder as well as a prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some are still awaiting publication.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\n====Childhood====\n[[File:Pfarrhaus Kleinh\u00fcningen.jpg|thumb|The clergy house in Kleinh\u00fcningen, Basel where Jung grew up]]\nCarl Gustav Jung{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As a university student Jung changed the modernized spelling of Karl to the original family form of Carl. {{cite book|last=Bair|first=Deirdre|authorlink=Deirdre Bair|title=Jung: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=Back Bay Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-316-15938-8|pages=7, 53}}}} was born in [[Kesswil]], in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss canton]] of [[Thurgau]], on 26 July 1875 as the second and first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842\u20131896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848\u20131923).

Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished [[Basel]] churchman and academic, {{Interlanguage link multi|Samuel Preiswerk|de}} (1799\u20131871), and his second wife. Preiswerk was ''[[antistes]]'', the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a [[Hebraist]], author and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at [[Basel University]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Gerhard|title=Jung: A Biography|year=1987|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston/Shaftesbury, Dorset|isbn=978-0-87773-455-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17 17\u201319]|url=https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jung was six months old, his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in [[Laufen-Uhwiesen|Laufen]], but the tension between his parents was growing. Emilie Jung was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom where she said that spirits visited her at night.<ref name=\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\">{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=18}}</ref> Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father.<ref name=\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\"/>\n\nJung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near [[Basel]] for an unknown physical ailment. His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and depression deeply troubled her son and caused him to associate women with \"innate unreliability\", whereas \"father\" meant for him reliability but also powerlessness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|page=5|last=Dunne|first=Claire|publisher=Continuum|year=2002}}</ref> In his memoir, Jung would remark that this parental influence was the \"handicap I started off with.

Although Jung was close to both parents, he was disappointed by his father's academic approach to faith.<ref>Wehr records that Paul Jung's chosen career path was to achieve a doctorate in philology. He was an Arabist; but the family money ran out for his studies. Relief came from a family legacy, however, a condition of the will was that it should only be offered to a family member who intended to study theology and become a pastor. Paul Jung therefore had his career determined by a will, not his will. See page 20.</ref>\n\nA number of childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny [[mannequin]] into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language.<ref name=\"art-therapy\">{{cite book|last=Malchiodi|first=Cathy A.|title=The Art Therapy Sourcebook|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vno0XgRuRhcC&pg=PA134|isbn=978-0-07-146827-5|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional}}</ref> He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with [[totem]]s in [[indigenous cultures]], such as the collection of soul-stones near [[Arlesheim]] or the ''[[tjurunga]]s'' of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=22\u201323}}</ref> His observations about symbols, [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], and the [[collective unconscious]] were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.<ref>Wehr, G. p. 144</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 12, shortly before the end of his first year at the [[:de:Gymnasium am M\u00fcnsterplatz|Humanistisches Gymnasium]] in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he momentarily lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized that the incident was indirectly his fault.) A thought then came to him\u2014\"now you won't have to go to school anymore.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=30}}</ref> From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had [[epilepsy]]. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over [[Latin grammar]]. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, \"was when I learned what a [[neurosis]] is.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=32}}</ref>\n\n====University studies and early career====\nInitially, Jung had aspirations of becoming a preacher or minister in his early life. There was a strong moral sense in his household and several of his family members were clergymen as well. For a time, Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach archaeology. After studying philosophy in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided instead to pursue psychiatry and medicine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=9 April 2019}}</ref> His interest was immediately captured\u2014it combined the biological and the spiritual, exactly what he was searching for.<ref name=\"jungbio1\">[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/carl-jung.html Carl Jung].

They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies.<ref>Wehr, G. p. 57.</ref> During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of [[Goethe]] and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Gerhard|title=Jung: A Biography|year=1987|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston/Shaftesbury, Dorset|isbn=978-0-87773-455-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1900, Jung moved to [[Z\u00fcrich]] and began working at the [[Burgh\u00f6lzli]] psychiatric hospital under [[Eugen Bleuler]].{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|pp=234, 259}} Bleuler was already in communication with the Austrian neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]]. Jung's [[dissertation]], published in 1903, was titled ''On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena.'' In 1905 Jung was appointed as a permanent 'senior' doctor at the hospital and also became a lecturer ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in the medical faculty of Zurich University.<ref>Wehr, pp. 79\u201385.</ref> In 1906 he published ''Diagnostic Association Studies'', which Freud obtained a copy of.<ref name=diagnostic>{{cite book|last=McGuire|first=William|title=The Freud/Jung Letters|year=1979|publisher=Picador|pages=12\u201313|isbn=978-0330258913}}</ref> In 1909, Jung left the psychiatric hospital and began a private practice in his home in [[K\u00fcsnacht]].{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|p=259}}\n\nEventually a close friendship and a strong professional association developed between the elder [[#Relationship with Freud|Freud and Jung]], which left a sizeable [[Freud-Jung Letters|correspondence]]. For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'', which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured\u2014each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the [[First World War]].

Jung had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]. In 1900, Jung completed his degree, and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist, [[Eugen Bleuler]] at Burgh\u00f6lzli Hospital.<ref>Wehr, Gerhard. (1987). ''Jung \u2013 A Biography''. Boston/Shaftesbury: Shambhala. {{ISBN|0 87773 455 0}}. p.&nbsp;77</ref> It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899). In the early 1900s [[psychology]] as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud's new \"psycho-analysis.\" At the time, Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burgh\u00f6lzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich and Jung's research had already gained him international recognition. In 1906 he published ''Diagnostic Association Studies'', and later sent a copy of this book to Freud\u2014who had already bought a copy.<ref name=diagnostic/> Preceded by a lively correspondence, Jung met Freud for the first time, in Vienna on 3 March 1907.<ref>Wehr, p. 105-6.</ref> In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded ''Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research.''\n\nIn 1909, Jung travelled with Freud and Hungarian psychoanalyst [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] to the United States; they took part in a conference at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts. The conference at [[Clark University]] was planned by the psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]] and included twenty-seven distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America.

While he did think that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not believe that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Heth|title=Psychology: The Science of Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/434 434]|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/434}}</ref> Jung believed his personal development was influenced by factors he felt were unrelated to sexuality.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1912 these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague [[Ludwig Binswanger]] in [[Kreuzlingen]] without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as \"the Kreuzlingen gesture\". Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the United States and gave the [[Fordham University]] lectures, a six-week series, which were published later in the year as ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido'', (subsequently republished as ''[[Symbols of Transformation]]''). While they contain some remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the libido, they represent largely a \"psychoanalytical Jung\" and not the theory of analytical psychology, for which he became famous in the following decades. Nonetheless it was their publication which, Jung declared, \"cost me my friendship with Freud\".<ref name=\"Gay 2006 225\">{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Gay|title= Freud: A Life for Our Time|publisher=Norton| date =2006 | pages = 225|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAnother primary disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious.<ref>Mary Williams, \"The Indivisibility of the Personal and Collective Unconscious\", ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'' 8.1, January 1963.

This constituted the introduction of some of the key concepts which came to distinguish Jung's work from Freud's in the next half century.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Midlife isolation====\nIt was the publication of Jung's book ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' in 1912 that led to the break with Freud. Letters they exchanged show Freud's refusal to consider Jung's ideas. This rejection caused what Jung described in his (posthumous) 1962 autobiography, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', as a \"resounding censure\". Everyone he knew dropped away except for two of his colleagues. Jung described his book as \"an attempt, only partially successful, to create a wider setting for medical psychology and to bring the whole of the psychic phenomena within its purview.\" The book was later revised and retitled ''Symbols of Transformation'' in 1922.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=====London 1913\u201314=====\nJung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914.

He worried at times that he was \"menaced by a psychosis\" or was \"doing a schizophrenia\". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, \"[[active imagination]]s\". He recorded everything he felt in small journals.

Jung's interest in philosophy and spiritual subjects led many to view him as a mystic, although his preference was to be seen as a man of science.<ref name=\"Lachmanpage258\">{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|title=Jung the Mystic|year=2010|publisher=Tarcher/Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58542-792-5|page=258}}</ref>\n\n===Key concepts===\nThe major concepts of [[analytical psychology]] as developed by Jung include:<ref>Anthony Stevens (1991) ''On Jung'' London: Penguin Books, pp. 27\u201353</ref>\n\n'''[[Jungian archetypes|Archetype]]''' \u2013  a concept \"borrowed\" from [[anthropology]] to denote supposedly universal and recurring mental images or themes.

In Jung's ''Psychological Types'', he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychological Types|author=C.G.

William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1977; Robert H. Hopcke, ''Persona''. Berkeley: Shambhala Publications, 1995.</ref> Jung applied the term ''[[persona]]'', explicitly because, in Latin, it means both ''personality'' and the ''masks'' worn by Roman actors of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], expressive of the individual roles played.\n\nThe ''persona'', he argues, is a mask for the \"collective psyche\", a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played ''role'' through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the \"persona-mask\" as a complicated system which ''mediates'' between individual consciousness and the social community: it is \"a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be\".<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]]\", The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious\", in: [[Joseph Campbell]] (ed.), ''The Portable Jung''. New York: Viking Press, 1971, p. 106.</ref> But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a ''character mask'' in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]], ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2nd ed. 1977, p. 157.</ref> The therapist then aims to assist the [[individuation]] process through which the client (re)gains their \"own self\" \u2013 by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the ''persona'', and from the power of unconscious impulses.\n\nJung has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate \"management persona\" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,<ref>Joann S. Lublin, \"How to Look and Act Like a Leader\", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 12 September 2011.</ref> but also because they have to evaluate ''what sort of people'' the workers are, in order to manage them (for example, using [[personality test]]s and [[peer review]]s).<ref>[[Kees van der Pijl]], \"May 1968 and the Alternative Globalist Movement \u2013 Cadre Class Formation and the Transition to Socialism\".

Vienna: Akademische Verlagsanstalt, 2009, pp. 192, 193, 194.</ref>\n\n=== Shadow ===\n''See also: [[shadow (psychology)]]''\n\nThe ''shadow'' exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of the traits individuals dislike/would rather ignore: repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. The shadow is the result of an individual's attempt to adapt to cultural norms and expectations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society, but also those  that are not aligned with one's own personal morals and values.\n\nJung argues that the ''shadow'' plays an important role in balancing one's overall psyche - \"where there is light, there must also be shadow\u201d. Without a well-developed ''shadow'', an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others - i.e., a walking [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']].<ref name=\":0\" /> Not wanting to look at their shadow's directly, Jung argues, causes many individuals to project them onto others. Basically, the qualities an individual may hate in another, are actually also present in that individual, who wishes not to see them.<ref name=\":0\" /> In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']] and ''[[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]]'' should be balanced.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe shadow can appear in dreams or visions, often taking the form of a dark, wild, exotic figure.\n\n===Spirituality===\nJung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp_djvu.txt Aniela Jaffe, foreword to ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'']</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dunne|first=Clare |title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|year=2002|page=3|chapter=Prelude|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=uegLZklR0fEC&pg=PA3 | isbn=978-0-8264-6307-4 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}</ref> Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep, innate potential. Based on his study of [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Taoism]], and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called [[individuation]], is at the mystical heart of all religions.

After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed.\n\nHazard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal, spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a Christian [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement known as the [[Oxford Group]] (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was [[Ebby Thacher]], a long-time friend and drinking buddy of [[William Griffith Wilson|Bill Wilson]], later co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group and, through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original [[twelve-step program]].\n\nThe above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill Wilson, excerpts of which can be found in ''Pass It On'', published by Alcoholics Anonymous.<ref>Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (1984) ''Pass It On: The Story of Bill Wilson and How the A.A. Message Reached the World.'' New York: Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. {{ISBN|0-916856-12-7}}, page. 381\u2013386.</ref> Although the detail of this story is disputed by some historians, Jung himself discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks given around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in Volume 18 of his ''Collected Works'', ''The Symbolic Life,''\n\n{{blockquote|For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, 'You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group.

For decades he attended [[seance]]s and claimed to have witnessed \"parapsychic phenomena\". Initially he attributed these to psychological causes, even delivering a 1919 lecture in England for the Society for Psychical Research on \"The Psychological Foundations for the belief in spirits\".<ref name=\"Jung1997\">{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=6|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}</ref> However, he began to \"doubt whether an exclusively psychological approach can do justice to the phenomena in question\"<ref name=\"Jung1997\"/> and stated that \"the spirit hypothesis yields better results\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=7|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}</ref>\n\nJung's ideas about the paranormal culminated in \"[[synchronicity]]\", his idea that meaningful connections in the world manifest through coincidence with no apparent causal link.

However, until 1939, he also maintained professional relations with psychotherapists in Germany who had declared their support for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime and there were allegations that he himself was a Nazi sympathizer.\n\nIn 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung took part in restructuring of the [[International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy|General Medical Society for Psychotherapy]] (''Allgemeine \u00c4rztliche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychotherapie''), a German-based professional body with an international membership. The society was reorganized into two distinct bodies:\n# A strictly German body, the Deutsche Allgemeine \u00c4rztliche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychotherapie, led by [[Matthias G\u00f6ring]], an [[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] psychotherapist<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/books/psychotherapy-in-the-third-reich.html Lifton, Robert Jay (27 January 1985) \"Psychotherapy in the Third Reich\"] ''The New York Times''</ref> and a cousin of the prominent Nazi [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]\n# International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, led by Jung.

He wrote that because of the speeches he delivered he was blacklisted by the Nazis.

Dulles referred to Jung as \"Agent 488\" and offered the following description of his service: \"Nobody will probably ever know how much Professor Jung contributed to the Allied Cause during the war, by seeing people who were connected somehow with the other side\".

Jung is one of the best known contemporary contributors to [[dream interpretation|dream analysis]] and symbolization. His influence on popular psychology, the \"psychologization of religion\", [[spirituality]] and the [[New Age]] movement has been immense.

R. Hamilton]] about 1843 as he revealed [[quaternion]]s, a system using vectors and scalars to span a four-dimensional space. For a quaternion ''q'' = ''a'' + ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, Hamilton used two projections: '''S''' ''q'' = ''a'', for the scalar part of ''q'', and '''V''' ''q'' = ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, the vector part. Using the modern terms ''cross product'' (\u00d7) and ''dot product'' (.), the ''quaternion product'' of two vectors ''p'' and ''q'' can be written ''pq'' = \u2013''p''.''q'' + ''p''\u00d7''q''. In 1878 [[W. K. Clifford]] severed the two products to make the quaternion operation useful for students in his textbook ''[[Elements of Dynamic]]''. Lecturing at [[Yale University]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] supplied notation for the [[scalar product]] and [[vector product]]s, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''.<ref>[[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] (1901) [https://archive.org/details/117714283 Vector Analysis, based on the Lectures of J.

Kuerti\u2019s translation of the second edition of volume 2 of ''Lectures on Theoretical Physics'' by Sommerfeld, vector notation was the subject of a footnote: \"In the original German text, vectors ''and'' their components are printed in the same Gothic types. The more usual way of making a typographical distinction between the two has been adopted for this translation.\"<ref>{{Google books|L6RmDAAAQBAJ|Mechanics of Deformable Bodies|page=10}}</ref>\n\n==Rectangular vectors==\n[[File:Rectangle Geometry Vector.svg|thumb|Rectangle]]\n[[File:Cuboid simple.svg|thumb|Rectangular cuboid]]\nA rectangular vector is a [[coordinate vector]] specified by components that define a [[rectangle]] (or [[rectangular prism]] in three dimensions, and similar shapes in greater dimensions).  The starting point and terminal point of the vector lie at opposite ends of the rectangle (or prism, etc.).\n\n===Ordered set notation===\nA rectangular vector in [[real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]] can be specified using an ordered [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of components, enclosed in either parentheses or angle brackets.\n\nIn a general sense, an ''n''-dimensional vector '''v''' can be specified in either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\langle v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n \\rangle</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''.\n\n===Matrix notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> can also be specified as a row or column [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] containing the ordered set of components.  A vector specified as a row matrix is known as a [[row vector]]; one specified as a column matrix is known as a [[column vector]].\n\nAgain, an ''n''-dimensional vector <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> can be specified in either of the following forms using matrices:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right] = \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right]= \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''. In some advanced contexts, a row and a column vector have different meaning; see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]].\n\n===Unit vector notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> (or fewer dimensions, such as <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> where <math>v_z</math> below is zero) can be specified as the sum of the scalar multiples of the components of the vector with the members of the standard [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>.  The basis is represented with the [[unit vector]]s <math>\\mathbf{i} = (1, 0, 0)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{j} = (0, 1, 0)</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1)</math>.\n\nA three-dimensional vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be specified in the following form, using unit vector notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = v_x \\mathbf{i} + v_y \\mathbf{j} + v_z \\mathbf{k}</math>\n\nWhere <math>v_x</math>, <math>v_y</math>, and <math>v_z</math> are the scalar components of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>.  Scalar components may be positive or negative; the absolute value of a scalar component is a magnitude.\n\n==Polar vectors==\n{{distinguish|text=[[Polar vector]], a true vector, in a context where pseudo vectors or axial vectors are considered}} \n[[Image:CircularCoordinates.svg|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees, or (3,60\u00b0). In blue, the point (4,210\u00b0).]]\nThe two [[polar coordinates]] of a point in a plane may be considered as a two dimensional vector. Such a \n''polar vector'' consists of a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (or length) and a direction (or angle). The magnitude, typically represented as ''r'', is the distance from a starting point, the [[origin (geometry)|origin]], to the point which is represented. The angle, typically represented as ''\u03b8'' (the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[theta]]), is the angle, usually measured {{shy|counter|clockwise}}, between a fixed direction, typically that of the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction from the origin to the point. The angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math> radians or <math>0 \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}</math>.\n\nIt must be emphasized that a ''polar vector'' is not really a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]], since the [[addition]] of two polar vectors is not defined.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nPolar vectors can be specified using either ordered pair notation (a subset of ordered set notation using only two components) or matrix notation, as with rectangular vectors.  In these forms, the first component of the vector is ''r'' (instead of ''v''<sub>1</sub>) and the second component is ''\u03b8'' (instead of ''v''<sub>2</sub>).  To differentiate polar vectors from rectangular vectors, the angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol, <math>\\angle</math>.\n\nA two-dimensional polar vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered pair or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the angle, and the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nPolar vectors can also be specified using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' and ''\u03b8'' explicitly.  This can be unwieldy, but is useful for avoiding the confusion with two-dimensional rectangular vectors that arises from using ordered pair or matrix notation.\n\nA two-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units and whose direction is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0) can be specified using either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Cylindrical vectors==\n[[Image:Coord system CY 1.svg|thumb|240px|A cylindrical coordinate system with origin ''O'', polar axis ''A'', and longitudinal axis ''L''. The dot is the point with radial distance ''\u03c1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, angular coordinate ''\u03c6''&nbsp;=&nbsp;130\u00b0, and height ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.]]\nA cylindrical vector is an extension of the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions.  It is akin to an arrow in the [[cylindrical coordinate system]].  A cylindrical vector is specified by a distance in the ''xy''-plane, an angle, and a distance from the ''xy''-plane (a height).  The first distance, usually represented as ''r'' or ''\u03c1'' (the Greek letter [[rho]]), is the magnitude of the projection of the vector onto the ''xy''-plane.  The angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'' or ''\u03c6'' (the Greek letter [[phi]]), is measured as the offset from the line collinear with the ''x''-axis in the positive direction; the angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math>.  The second distance, usually represented as ''h'' or ''z'', is the distance from the ''xy''-plane to the endpoint of the vector.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nCylindrical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the second distance component is [[Concatenation|concatenated]] as a third component to form ordered triplets (again, a subset of ordered set notation) and matrices.  The angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the distance-angle-distance combination distinguishes cylindrical vectors in this notation from spherical vectors in similar notation.\n\nA three-dimensional cylindrical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta, h)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta, h \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta & h \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ h \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude of the projection of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> onto the ''xy''-plane, ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>, and ''h'' is the height from the ''xy''-plane to the endpoint of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>.  Again, the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nA cylindrical vector can also be specified directly, using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' (or ''\u03c1''), ''\u03b8'' (or ''\u03c6''), and ''h'' (or ''z'').  Consistency should be used when choosing the names to use for the variables; ''\u03c1'' should not be mixed with ''\u03b8'' and so on.\n\nA three-dimensional vector, the magnitude of whose projection onto the ''xy''-plane is 5 units, whose angle from the positive ''x''-axis is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose height from the ''xy''-plane is 3 units can be specified in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  h=3</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  h=3</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  z=3</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\phi=20^{\\circ}, \\  z=3</math>\n\n==Spherical vectors==\n[[File:3D Spherical 2.svg|thumb|240px|right|Spherical coordinates (''r'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u03c6'') as often used in ''mathematics'': radial distance ''r'', azimuthal angle ''\u03b8'', and polar angle ''\u03c6''. The meanings of ''\u03b8'' and ''\u03c6'' have been swapped compared to the physics convention.]]\nA spherical vector is another method for extending the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions.  It is akin to an arrow in the [[spherical coordinate system]].  A spherical vector is specified by a magnitude, an azimuth angle, and a zenith angle.  The magnitude is usually represented as ''\u03c1''.  The azimuth angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'', is the ({{shy|counter|clockwise}}) offset from the positive ''x''-axis.  The zenith angle, usually represented as ''\u03c6'', is the offset from the positive ''z''-axis.  Both angles are typically reduced to lie within the range from zero (inclusive) to 2''\u03c0'' (exclusive).\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nSpherical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the zenith angle is concatenated as a third component to form ordered triplets and matrices.  The azimuth and zenith angles may be both prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the prefix should be used consistently to produce the distance-angle-angle combination that distinguishes spherical vectors from cylindrical ones.\n\nA three-dimensional spherical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (\\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle \\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho & \\angle \\theta & \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''\u03c1'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the azimuth angle, and ''\u03c6'' is the zenith angle.\n\n===Direct notation===\nLike polar and cylindrical vectors, spherical vectors can be specified using simplified autonomous equations, in this case for ''\u03c1'', ''\u03b8'', and ''\u03c6''.\n\nA three-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units, whose azimuth angle is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose zenith angle is ''\u03c0''/4 radians (45\u00b0) can be specified as:\n\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 4}</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  \\phi=45^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Operations==\nIn any given [[vector space]], the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined. [[Normed vector space]]s also define an operation known as the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (or determination of magnitude). [[Inner product space]]s also define an operation known as the inner product.  In [[Real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]], the inner product is known as the [[dot product]].  In <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}^7</math>, an additional operation known as the [[cross product]] is also defined.\n\n===Vector addition===\n[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|Vector addition]] is represented with the plus sign used as an operator between two vectors.  The sum of two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\n===Scalar multiplication===\n[[Scalar multiplication]] is represented in the same manners as algebraic multiplication.  A scalar beside a vector (either or both of which may be in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication.  The two common operators, a dot and a rotated cross, are also acceptable (although the rotated cross is almost never used), but they risk confusion with dot products and cross products, which operate on two vectors.  The product of a scalar ''c'' with a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented in any of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>c \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>c \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\n====Vector subtraction and scalar division====\nUsing the algebraic properties of subtraction and division, along with scalar multiplication, it is also possible to \u201csubtract\u201d two vectors and \u201cdivide\u201d a vector by a scalar.\n\nVector subtraction is performed by adding the scalar multiple of \u22121 with the second vector operand to the first vector operand.  This can be represented by the use of the minus sign as an operator. The difference between two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented in either of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{u} + -\\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nScalar division is performed by multiplying the vector operand with the numeric inverse of the scalar operand.  This can be represented by the use of the fraction bar or division signs as operators.  The quotient of a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> and a scalar ''c'' can be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>{1 \\over c} \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>{\\boldsymbol{v} \\over c}</math>\n*<math>{\\boldsymbol{v} \\div c}</math>\n\n===Norm===\nThe [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a vector is represented with double bars on both sides of the vector.  The norm of a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented as:\n:<math>\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|</math>\n\nThe norm is also sometimes represented with single bars, like <math>|\\boldsymbol{v}|</math>, but this can be confused with [[absolute value]] (which is a type of norm).\n\n===Inner product===\nThe [[inner product space|inner product]] (also known as the scalar product, not to be confused with scalar multiplication) of two vectors is represented as an ordered pair enclosed in angle brackets.  The inner product of two vectors \\boldsymbol{u} and \\boldsymbol{v} would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\langle \\boldsymbol{u}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\rangle</math>\n\n====Dot product====\nIn <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the inner product is also known as the [[dot product]].  In addition to the standard inner product notation, the dot product notation (using the dot as an operator) can also be used (and is more common).  The dot product of two vectors \\boldsymbol{u} and \\boldsymbol{v} can be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the dot product is implied between two vectors written side-by-side. This notation can be confused with the [[dyadic product]] between two vectors.\n\n===Cross product===\nThe [[cross product]] of two vectors (in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>) is represented using the rotated cross as an operator.  The cross product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nBy some conventions (e.g. in France and some areas of higher mathematics) this is also denoted by a wedge,<ref>{{cite book |last=Cajori |first=Florian |title=A History of Mathematical Notations |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2011 |page=134 (Vol. 2) |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA134}}</ref> which avoids confusion with the [[wedge product]] since the two are functionally equivalent in three dimensions:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the following notation is used for the cross product between '''u''' and '''v''':\n\n:<math>[\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}]</math>\n\n==Nabla==\n{{main|Del|Nabla symbol}}\nVector notation is used with [[calculus]] through the '''Nabla operator''':\n:<math> \\mathbf{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\mathbf{j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\mathbf{k}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}</math>\nWith a scalar function ''f'', the [[gradient]] is expressed <math>\\nabla f \\ ,</math>\n\nwith a vector field, ''F'' the [[ divergence]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\cdot F ,</math>\n\nand with a vector field, ''F'' the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\times F .</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ISO 31-11#Vectors and tensors]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Linear algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vector Notation}}\n[[Category:Mathematical notation]]\n[[Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics)]]\n", "text_old": "{|align=right style=\"clear:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"color:#black; background:#dddddd; font-size:100%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Vector notation\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nImage:vector from A to B.svg|Vector arrow<br /><small>Pointing from ''A'' to ''B''</small>\nFile:Vector components.svg|[[Vector component]]s<br /><small>Describing an arrow vector '''v''' by its coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' yields an [[isomorphism]] of vector spaces.</small>\n</gallery>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Dot Product.svg|[[Scalar product]]<br /><small>Two equal-length sequences of coordinate vectors and returns a single number</small>\nImage:Cross product vector.svg|[[Vector product]]<br /><small>The cross-product in respect to a right-handed coordinate system</small>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\n'''Vector notation'''<ref>{{cite book |title=Principles and Applications of Mathematics for Communications-electronics |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNUXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA123 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Notes on fundamentals of telephone transmission |publisher=American Telephone and Telegraph Company.

R. Hamilton]] about 1843 as he revealed [[quaternion]]s, a system using vectors and scalars to span a four-dimensional space. For a quaternion ''q'' = ''a'' + ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, Hamilton used two projections: '''S''' ''q'' = ''a'', for the scalar part of ''q'', and '''V''' ''q'' = ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, the vector part. Using the modern terms ''cross product'' (\u00d7) and ''dot product'' (.), the ''quaternion product'' of two vectors ''p'' and ''q'' can be written ''pq'' = \u2013''p''.''q'' + ''p''\u00d7''q''. In 1878 [[W. K. Clifford]] severed the two products to make the quaternion operation useful for students in his textbook ''[[Elements of Dynamic]]''. Lecturing at [[Yale University]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] supplied notation for the [[scalar product]] and [[vector product]]s, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''.<ref>[[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] (1901) [https://archive.org/details/117714283 Vector Analysis, based on the Lectures of J.

The starting point and terminal point of the vector lie at opposite ends of the rectangle (or prism, etc.).\n\n===Ordered set notation===\nA rectangular vector in [[real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]] can be specified using an ordered [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of components, enclosed in either parentheses or angle brackets.\n\nIn a general sense, an ''n''-dimensional vector '''v''' can be specified in either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\langle v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n \\rangle</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''.\n\n===Matrix notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> can also be specified as a row or column [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] containing the ordered set of components.  A vector specified as a row matrix is known as a [[row vector]]; one specified as a column matrix is known as a [[column vector]].\n\nAgain, an ''n''-dimensional vector <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> can be specified in either of the following forms using matrices:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right] = \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right]= \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''. In some advanced contexts, a row and a column vector have different meaning; see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]].\n\n===Unit vector notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> (or fewer dimensions, such as <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> where <math>v_z</math> below is zero) can be specified as the sum of the scalar multiples of the components of the vector with the members of the standard [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>.  The basis is represented with the [[unit vector]]s <math>\\mathbf{i} = (1, 0, 0)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{j} = (0, 1, 0)</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1)</math>.\n\nA three-dimensional vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be specified in the following form, using unit vector notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = v_x \\mathbf{i} + v_y \\mathbf{j} + v_z \\mathbf{k}</math>\n\nWhere <math>v_x</math>, <math>v_y</math>, and <math>v_z</math> are the scalar components of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>.  Scalar components may be positive or negative; the absolute value of a scalar component is a magnitude.\n\n==Polar vectors==\n{{distinguish|text=[[Polar vector]], a true vector, in a context where pseudo vectors or axial vectors are considered}} \n[[Image:CircularCoordinates.svg|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees, or (3,60\u00b0). In blue, the point (4,210\u00b0).]]\nThe two [[polar coordinates]] of a point in a plane may be considered as a two dimensional vector. Such a \n''polar vector'' consists of a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (or length) and a direction (or angle). The magnitude, typically represented as ''r'', is the distance from a starting point, the [[origin (geometry)|origin]], to the point which is represented. The angle, typically represented as ''\u03b8'' (the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[theta]]), is the angle, usually measured {{shy|counter|clockwise}}, between a fixed direction, typically that of the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction from the origin to the point. The angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math> radians or <math>0 \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}</math>.\n\nIt must be emphasized that a ''polar vector'' is not really a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]], since the [[addition]] of two polar vectors is not defined.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nPolar vectors can be specified using either ordered pair notation (a subset of ordered set notation using only two components) or matrix notation, as with rectangular vectors.  In these forms, the first component of the vector is ''r'' (instead of ''v''<sub>1</sub>) and the second component is ''\u03b8'' (instead of ''v''<sub>2</sub>).  To differentiate polar vectors from rectangular vectors, the angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol, <math>\\angle</math>.\n\nA two-dimensional polar vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered pair or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the angle, and the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nPolar vectors can also be specified using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' and ''\u03b8'' explicitly.  This can be unwieldy, but is useful for avoiding the confusion with two-dimensional rectangular vectors that arises from using ordered pair or matrix notation.\n\nA two-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units and whose direction is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0) can be specified using either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Cylindrical vectors==\n[[Image:Coord system CY 1.svg|thumb|240px|A cylindrical coordinate system with origin ''O'', polar axis ''A'', and longitudinal axis ''L''. The dot is the point with radial distance ''\u03c1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, angular coordinate ''\u03c6''&nbsp;=&nbsp;130\u00b0, and height ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.]]\nA cylindrical vector is an extension of the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions.  It is akin to an arrow in the [[cylindrical coordinate system]].  A cylindrical vector is specified by a distance in the ''xy''-plane, an angle, and a distance from the ''xy''-plane (a height).  The first distance, usually represented as ''r'' or ''\u03c1'' (the Greek letter [[rho]]), is the magnitude of the projection of the vector onto the ''xy''-plane.  The angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'' or ''\u03c6'' (the Greek letter [[phi]]), is measured as the offset from the line collinear with the ''x''-axis in the positive direction; the angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math>.  The second distance, usually represented as ''h'' or ''z'', is the distance from the ''xy''-plane to the endpoint of the vector.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nCylindrical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the second distance component is [[Concatenation|concatenated]] as a third component to form ordered triplets (again, a subset of ordered set notation) and matrices.  The angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the distance-angle-distance combination distinguishes cylindrical vectors in this notation from spherical vectors in similar notation.\n\nA three-dimensional cylindrical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta, h)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta, h \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta & h \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ h \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude of the projection of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> onto the ''xy''-plane, ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>, and ''h'' is the height from the ''xy''-plane to the endpoint of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>.  Again, the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nA cylindrical vector can also be specified directly, using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' (or ''\u03c1''), ''\u03b8'' (or ''\u03c6''), and ''h'' (or ''z'').  Consistency should be used when choosing the names to use for the variables; ''\u03c1'' should not be mixed with ''\u03b8'' and so on.\n\nA three-dimensional vector, the magnitude of whose projection onto the ''xy''-plane is 5 units, whose angle from the positive ''x''-axis is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose height from the ''xy''-plane is 3 units can be specified in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  h=3</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  h=3</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  z=3</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\phi=20^{\\circ}, \\  z=3</math>\n\n==Spherical vectors==\n[[File:3D Spherical 2.svg|thumb|240px|right|Spherical coordinates (''r'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u03c6'') as often used in ''mathematics'': radial distance ''r'', azimuthal angle ''\u03b8'', and polar angle ''\u03c6''. The meanings of ''\u03b8'' and ''\u03c6'' have been swapped compared to the physics convention.]]\nA spherical vector is another method for extending the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions.  It is akin to an arrow in the [[spherical coordinate system]].  A spherical vector is specified by a magnitude, an azimuth angle, and a zenith angle.  The magnitude is usually represented as ''\u03c1''.  The azimuth angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'', is the ({{shy|counter|clockwise}}) offset from the positive ''x''-axis.  The zenith angle, usually represented as ''\u03c6'', is the offset from the positive ''z''-axis.  Both angles are typically reduced to lie within the range from zero (inclusive) to 2''\u03c0'' (exclusive).\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nSpherical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the zenith angle is concatenated as a third component to form ordered triplets and matrices.  The azimuth and zenith angles may be both prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the prefix should be used consistently to produce the distance-angle-angle combination that distinguishes spherical vectors from cylindrical ones.\n\nA three-dimensional spherical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (\\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle \\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho & \\angle \\theta & \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''\u03c1'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the azimuth angle, and ''\u03c6'' is the zenith angle.\n\n===Direct notation===\nLike polar and cylindrical vectors, spherical vectors can be specified using simplified autonomous equations, in this case for ''\u03c1'', ''\u03b8'', and ''\u03c6''.\n\nA three-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units, whose azimuth angle is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose zenith angle is ''\u03c0''/4 radians (45\u00b0) can be specified as:\n\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 4}</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  \\phi=45^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Operations==\nIn any given [[vector space]], the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined. [[Normed vector space]]s also define an operation known as the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (or determination of magnitude). [[Inner product space]]s also define an operation known as the inner product.  In [[Real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]], the inner product is known as the [[dot product]].  In <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}^7</math>, an additional operation known as the [[cross product]] is also defined.\n\n===Vector addition===\n[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|Vector addition]] is represented with the plus sign used as an operator between two vectors.  The sum of two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\n===Scalar multiplication===\n[[Scalar multiplication]] is represented in the same manners as algebraic multiplication.  A scalar beside a vector (either or both of which may be in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication.  The two common operators, a dot and a rotated cross, are also acceptable (although the rotated cross is almost never used), but they risk confusion with dot products and cross products, which operate on two vectors.  The product of a scalar ''c'' with a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented in any of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>c \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>c \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\n====Vector subtraction and scalar division====\nUsing the algebraic properties of subtraction and division, along with scalar multiplication, it is also possible to \u201csubtract\u201d two vectors and \u201cdivide\u201d a vector by a scalar.\n\nVector subtraction is performed by adding the scalar multiple of \u22121 with the second vector operand to the first vector operand.  This can be represented by the use of the minus sign as an operator. The difference between two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented in either of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{u} + -\\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nScalar division is performed by multiplying the vector operand with the numeric inverse of the scalar operand.  This can be represented by the use of the fraction bar or division signs as operators.  The quotient of a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> and a scalar ''c'' can be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>{1 \\over c} \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>{\\boldsymbol{v} \\over c}</math>\n*<math>{\\boldsymbol{v} \\div c}</math>\n\n===Norm===\nThe [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a vector is represented with double bars on both sides of the vector.  The norm of a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented as:\n:<math>\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|</math>\n\nThe norm is also sometimes represented with single bars, like <math>|\\boldsymbol{v}|</math>, but this can be confused with [[absolute value]] (which is a type of norm).\n\n===Inner product===\nThe [[inner product space|inner product]] (also known as the scalar product, not to be confused with scalar multiplication) of two vectors is represented as an ordered pair enclosed in angle brackets.  The inner product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle</math>\n\n====Dot product====\nIn <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the inner product is also known as the [[dot product]].  In addition to the standard inner product notation, the dot product notation (using the dot as an operator) can also be used (and is more common).  The dot product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' can be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the dot product is implied between two vectors written side-by-side. This notation can be confused with the [[dyadic product]] between two vectors.\n\n===Cross product===\nThe [[cross product]] of two vectors (in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>) is represented using the rotated cross as an operator.  The cross product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nBy some conventions (e.g. in France and some areas of higher mathematics) this is also denoted by a wedge,<ref>{{cite book |last=Cajori |first=Florian |title=A History of Mathematical Notations |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2011 |page=134 (Vol. 2) |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA134}}</ref> which avoids confusion with the [[wedge product]] since the two are functionally equivalent in three dimensions:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the following notation is used for the cross product between '''u''' and '''v''':\n\n:<math>[\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}]</math>\n\n==Nabla==\n{{main|Del|Nabla symbol}}\nVector notation is used with [[calculus]] through the '''Nabla operator''':\n:<math> \\mathbf{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\mathbf{j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\mathbf{k}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}</math>\nWith a scalar function ''f'', the [[gradient]] is expressed <math>\\nabla f \\ ,</math>\n\nwith a vector field, ''F'' the [[ divergence]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\cdot F ,</math>\n\nand with a vector field, ''F'' the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\times F .</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ISO 31-11#Vectors and tensors]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Linear algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vector Notation}}\n[[Category:Mathematical notation]]\n[[Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics)]]\n", "name_user": "Skvery", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInner product:\\boldsymbol", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_notation"}

Overall, IPCC (2007d:48) expected that benefits would be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries.\n\nWith very high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.'' (2007:393) concluded that economic development was an important component of possible [[adaptation to climate change]]. Economic growth on its own, however, was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change. The manner in which economic growth occurs was judged to be important, along with how the benefits of growth are distributed in society. Examples of other important factors in determining the health of populations were listed as: education, health care, and public-health infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a 2009 journal paper by [[University College London|UCL]] academics, climate change and [[global warming]] pose the biggest threat to human health in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite news\n|date=May 14, 2009\n|title=Professor Anthony Costello: climate change biggest threat to humans\n|work=[[The Times]]\n|author=Lister, S.\n|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article6283681.ece\n|accessdate=2009-08-08 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|date=May 14, 2009\n|title=Climate change: The biggest global-health threat of the 21st century\n|work=[[University College London|UCL]] News\n|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0905/09051501\n|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>\n\n====Malnutrition====\nWith high confidence, Confalonieri ''et al.''

There is still much uncertainty about the potential impact of climate change on malaria at local and global scales.\n\n{{Undue weight|paragraph|date=May 2010}}\n\nA paper by researchers from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Florida]] published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in May 2010 concluded that claims that a warming climate has led to more widespread disease and death due to malaria are largely at odds with the evidence, and that \"''predictions of an intensification of malaria in a warmer world, based on extrapolated empirical relationships or biological mechanisms, must be set against a context of a century of warming that has seen marked global declines in the disease and a substantial weakening of the global correlation between malaria endemicity and climate.''\"<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author1=Peter W.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.
