In 1975, he played on [[George Harrison]]'s album ''[[Extra Texture]]''. He followed that up by playing the Fender Rhodes and [[clavinet]] on Harrison's album ''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'' a year later. In 1976 Foster joined Guthrie Thomas on Thomas' second Capitol Records album, ''Lies and Alibis'', with Ringo Starr and a host of many other famed performers. Foster was a major contributor to the 1979 [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] album ''[[I Am (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|I Am]]'', as a studio player and arranger, as well as being a co-writer on six of the album's tracks. The most noteworthy being the song \"[[After the Love Has Gone]]\", for which Foster and his co-writers, Graydon and [[Bill Champlin]], won the 1980 [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song]].\n\nFoster worked as an album producer on albums for [[The Tubes]]: 1981's ''[[The Completion Backward Principle]]'', and 1983's ''[[Outside Inside (The Tubes album)|Outside Inside]]''.

The 1980 [[Boz Scaggs]] album ''[[Middle Man (album)|Middle Man]]'' saw Foster cowrite and play keyboard on some of Scaggs's most successful songs, including \"[[Breakdown Dead Ahead]]\", \"Jojo\", and \"Simone\", followed by \"[[Look What You've Done to Me]]\" from the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''.\n\nFoster was a major contributor to Chicago's career in the early and middle 1980s, having worked as the band's producer on ''[[Chicago 16]]'' (1982), their biggest-selling multi-platinum album ''[[Chicago 17]]'' (1984), and ''[[Chicago 18]]'' (1986).

In 1975, he played on [[George Harrison]]'s album ''[[Extra Texture]]''. He followed that up by playing the Fender Rhodes and [[clavinet]] on Harrison's album ''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'' a year later. In 1976 Foster joined Guthrie Thomas on Thomas' second Capitol Records album, ''Lies and Alibis'', with Ringo Starr and a host of many other famed performers. Foster was a major contributor to the 1979 [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] album ''[[I Am (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|I Am]]'', as a studio player and arranger, as well as being a co-writer on six of the album's tracks. The most noteworthy being the song \"[[After the Love Has Gone]]\", for which Foster and his co-writers, Graydon and [[Bill Champlin]], won the 1980 [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song]].\n\nFoster worked as an album producer on albums for [[The Tubes]]: 1981's ''[[The Completion Backward Principle]]'', and 1983's ''[[Outside Inside (The Tubes album)|Outside Inside]]''. Foster cowrote such songs as \"Talk to Ya Later\" co-written with Tubes and [[Steve Lukather]] from [[Toto (band)|Toto]], the Top 40 hit \"Don't Want to Wait Anymore,\" and the number 10 US hit \"[[She's a Beauty]]\". The 1980 [[Boz Scaggs]] album ''[[Middle Man (album)|Middle Man]]'' saw Foster cowrite and play keyboard on some of Scaggs's most successful songs, including \"[[Breakdown Dead Ahead]]\", \"Jojo\", and \"Simone\", followed by \"[[Look What You've Done to Me]]\" from the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''.\n\nFoster was a major contributor to Chicago's career in the early and middle 1980s, having worked as the band's producer on ''[[Chicago 16]]'' (1982), their biggest-selling multi-platinum album ''[[Chicago 17]]'' (1984), and ''[[Chicago 18]]'' (1986). As was typical of his producing projects from this time period, Foster was a cowriter on songs such as the US Chart No. 1 hit \"[[Hard to Say I'm Sorry]]\", \"[[Love Me Tomorrow]]\" (US No. 22), \"[[Stay the Night (Chicago song)|Stay the Night]]\" (US No. 16), and \"[[You're the Inspiration]]\" (US No. 3). These four songs were cowritten with the band's bassist [[Peter Cetera]]. Foster also helped Cetera co-write (along with Cetera's wife Diane Nini) his US No. 1 solo hit \"[[Glory of Love]]\" in 1986. Foster cowrote [[Kenny Loggins]]'s songs \"[[Forever (Kenny Loggins song)|Forever]]\" (US No. 40), from the 1985 album ''[[Vox Humana (Kenny Loggins album)|Vox Humana]]'', and \"Heart to Heart\" (US No. 15), from the 1982 album ''[[High Adventure]]''.

In the following years, Foster continued turning out occasional film scores, including for the [[Michael J.

He is multilingual and sings in Greek, French, English, and Spanish.\n\n==Early life==\nPerris was born and raised in [[Athens]], Greece, to a French mother, the novel writer Joelle Lopinot - Mastrantoni and a Greek father. From a very young age he wanted to become a singer and started piano lessons from the age of 4. He studied Greek literature, Ancient Greek and Latin at Athens University.<ref>http://georgeperris.com/biography/</ref>\n\n==Career==\n=== 2005\u20132008: Debut solo album and early years ===\nPerris' performing career began at the age of 18, when he was invited to tour with composer [[Mimis Plessas]]. He was featured on Plessas' 2006 album '''Mimis Plessas and the Jazz Quartet Live'''. His first solo album, '''Kainouria mou mera''' (My new day) was released in 2005 by [[EMI]] and included the hit songs \"Pezi o erotas\" which was the theme song from the TV series \"Erotas\", as well as \"Karavani\" which was included in a compilation created by [[Radio France|Radio Fran\u00e7aise]].\n\nThe following year he toured with acclaimed Greek tenor [[Mario Frangoulis]]. Frangoulis invited him back for his \"Mario & Friends\" performance series at the [[Athens Arena]] where he appeared on stage with international artists such as [[Lucio Dalla]], [[Justin Hayward]], [[Madeleine Peyroux]], [[Lara Fabian]] and [[Frances Ruffelle]]. As a result, 2 live albums were released in 2008 and 2009, '''Mario & Friends 1''' and '''Mario & Friends 2''' which were both certified platinum album.

Some 2000 different taxa can be seen on the 20 hectare grounds.\n\n== Collection ==\nThe arboretum brings together trees and shrubs from around the world which can survive in the temperate Belgian climate. Arboretum Wespelaar houses many woody species large and small, including common and rare species, especially those that are threatened in the wild.\n\nSome genera are particularly well represented: [[Acer (genus)|''Acer'']], ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'' and ''[[Stewartia]]''. In addition to these, you will find good collections of other genera such as: ''[[Betula]]'', ''[[Carpinus]]'', ''[[Euonymus]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Tilia]]'', ''[[Viburnum]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Styrax]]'' etc.\n\nThe Arboretum is also known for its yellow flowering Magnolias. Many Magnolias have been selected and named at the Arboretum, with the yellow ''Magnolia'' 'Daphne' being the most famous.<ref name=\"camelbeke\">Camelbeke, K. and Foster, M. (2015). The best yellow Magnolias. ''The Plantsman'', June 2015. </ref>\n\nMany of Arboretum Wespelaar's trees and shrubs are to be found on the Red List of the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature). By giving priority to wild collected plants, identified as endangered or critically endangered on these lists, the Arboretum hopes to contribute to the\nconservation of such plants. \n\nArboretum Wespelaar gives much attention to the correct labelling of all woody species. In addition, a catalogue of plants is updated yearly and made\navailable on the website. \n\nArboretum Wespelaar is a member of [[Botanic Gardens Conservation International]], an international non-profit organisation that exists to ensure the worldwide conservation of threatened plants.\n\nArboretum Wespelaar is a part of [[ArbNet]], an interactive, collaborative, international community of arboreta. Through ArbNet, arboreta around the world collaborate to conserve trees and tree collections.

Some 2000 different taxa can be seen on the 20 hectare grounds.\n\n== Collection ==\nThe arboretum brings together trees and shrubs from around the world which can survive in the temperate Belgian climate. Arboretum Wespelaar houses many woody species large and small, including common and rare species, especially those that are threatened in the wild.\n\nSome genera are particularly well represented: [[Acer (genus)|''Acer'']], ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'' and ''[[Stewartia]]''. In addition to these, you will find good collections of other genera such as: ''[[Betula]]'', ''[[Carpinus]]'', ''[[Euonymus]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Tilia]]'', ''[[Viburnum]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Styrax]]'' etc.\n\nThe Arboretum is also known for its yellow flowering Magnolias. Many Magnolias have been selected and named at the Arboretum, with the yellow ''Magnolia'' 'Daphne' being the most famous.<ref name=\"camelbeke\">Camelbeke, K. and Foster, M. (2015). The best yellow Magnolias. ''The Plantsman'', June 2015. </ref>\n\nMany of Arboretum Wespelaar's trees and shrubs are to be found on the Red List of the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature). By giving priority to wild collected plants, identified as endangered or critically endangered on these lists, the Arboretum hopes to contribute to the\nconservation of such plants. \n\nArboretum Wespelaar is a member of [[Botanic Gardens Conservation International]], an international non-profit organisation that exists to ensure the worldwide conservation of threatened plants.\n\nArboretum Wespelaar is a part of [[ArbNet]], an interactive, collaborative, international community of arboreta. Through ArbNet, arboreta around the world collaborate to conserve trees and tree collections.

For example, when we read [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' we decode it as a [[modernist]] literary experiment, or as a response to the epic tradition, or as part of some other [[conversation]], or as part of all of these conversations at once. This intertextual view of literature, as shown by [[Roland Barthes]], supports the concept that the meaning of a text does not reside in the text, but is produced by the reader in relation not only to the text in question, but also the complex network of texts invoked in the reading process.\n\nWhile the theoretical concept of intertextuality is associated with [[post-modernism]], the device itself is not new. [[New Testament]] passages quote from the [[Old Testament]] and Old Testament books such as [[Deuteronomy]] or the [[Nevi'im|prophet]]s refer to the events described in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] (for discussions on using 'intertextuality' to describe the use of the Old Testament in the New Testament, see Porter 1997; Oropeza 2013; Oropeza & Moyise, 2016). Whereas a redaction critic would use such intertextuality to argue for a particular order and process of the authorship of the books in question, [[literary criticism]] takes a synchronic view that deals with the texts in their final form, as an interconnected body of [[literature]]. This interconnected body extends to later poems and paintings that refer to Biblical narratives, just as other texts build networks around Greek and Roman [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] history and mythology. Bullfinch's 1855 work ''[[The Age Of Fable]]'' served as an introduction to such an intertextual network;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} according to its author, it was intended \"...for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets...\".\n\nSometimes intertextuality is taken as [[plagiarism]] as in the case of Spanish writer [[Luc\u00eda Etxebarria]] whose poem collection ''Estaci\u00f3n de infierno'' (2001) was found to contain metaphors and verses from [[Antonio Colinas]].\nEtxebarria claimed that she admired him and applied intertextuality.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Post-structuralism ===\nMore recent [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] theory, such as that formulated in Daniela Caselli's ''[[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s [[Dante]]s: Intertextuality in the Fiction and Criticism'' (MUP 2005), re-examines \"intertextuality\" as a production within texts, rather than as a series of relationships between different texts. Some postmodern theorists <ref>Gerard Genette, ''Palimpsests: literature in the second degree'', Channa Newman and Claude Doubinsky (trans.), University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln NE and London.</ref> like to talk about the relationship between \"intertextuality\" and \"[[hypertext]]uality\" (not to be confused with [[Hypertext (semiotics)|hypertext]], another semiotic term coined by [[G\u00e9rard Genette]]); intertextuality makes each text a \"living hell of hell on earth\" <ref>Kristeva, 66.</ref> and part of a larger mosaic of texts, just as each [[hypertext]] can be a web of links and part of the whole [[World-Wide Web]]. The [[World-Wide Web]] has been theorized as a unique realm of reciprocal intertextuality, in which no particular text can claim centrality, yet the Web text eventually produces an image of a community\u2014the group of people who write and read the text using specific discursive strategies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mitra|first=Ananda|year=1999|title=Characteristics of the WWW Text: Tracing Discursive Strategies|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol5/issue1/mitra.html|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=5|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1999.tb00330.x}}</ref>\n\nOne can also make distinctions between the notions of \"intertext\", \"hypertext\" and \"supertext\".{{Citation needed|reason=supertext is not a term in Wikipedia; what does it mean?|date=August 2014}} Take for example the ''[[Dictionary of the Khazars]]'' by [[Milorad Pavi\u0107 (writer)|Milorad Pavi\u0107]]. As an intertext, it employs quotations from the scriptures of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s. As a hypertext, it consists of links to different articles within itself and also every individual trajectory of reading it. As a supertext, it combines male and female versions of itself, as well as three mini-dictionaries in each of the versions.\n\n== Examples in literature ==\nSome examples of intertextuality in literature include:\n* ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' (1952) by [[John Steinbeck]]: A retelling of the account of Genesis, set in the Salinas Valley of Northern California.\n* ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) by [[James Joyce]]: A retelling of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', set in Dublin.\n* ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936) by [[William Faulkner]]: A retelling of the [[Absalom]] story from [[Samuel]], set in antebellum Mississippi.\n* ''[[Earthly Powers]]'' (1980) by [[Anthony Burgess]]: A retelling of [[Anatole France]]'s Le Miracle du grand saint Nicolas during the 20th century.\n* ''[[The Dead Fathers Club]]'' (2006) by [[Matt Haig]]: A retelling of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', set in modern England.\n* ''[[A Thousand Acres]]'' (1991) by [[Jane Smiley]]: A retelling of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'', set in rural Iowa.\n* ''[[Perelandra]]'' (1943) by [[C. S. Lewis]]: Another retelling of the account of Genesis, also leaning on Milton's [[Paradise Lost]], but set on the planet Venus.\n* ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966) by [[Jean Rhys]]: A [[textual intervention]] on [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', the story of the \"[[Bertha Mason|mad woman in the attic]]\" told from her perspective.\n* ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (1996) by [[Steven Pressfield]]: A retelling of the Bhagavad Gita, set in 1931 during an epic golf game.\n* ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (1996) by [[Helen Fielding]]: A modern [[chick lit]] romantic comedy replaying and referencing [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.\n* ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' (1935) by [[John Steinbeck]]: A retelling of the Arthurian legends, set in ''[[Monterey, CA]]'' during the interwar period.\n* ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1931) by [[Eugene O'Neill]]: A retelling of Aeschylus' ''[[The Oresteia]]'', set in post-American Civil War New England.\n\n== Types ==\nIntertextuality and intertextual relationships can be separated into three types: obligatory, optional and accidental.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://moodle.cqu.edu.au|title=Romantic and contemporary poetry: readings|last=Fitzsimmons|first=John|date=2013|website=moodle.cqu.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}</ref> These variations depend on two key factors: the intention of the writer, and the significance of the reference.  The distinctions between these types and those differences between categories are not absolute and exclusive but instead, are manipulated in a way that allows them to co-exist within the same text.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Italy, and intertextuality|date=2004|publisher=Manchester University Press|others=Marrapodi, Michele.|isbn=9780719066672|location=Manchester|oclc=56657010}}</ref>\n\n===Obligatory===\nObligatory intertextuality is when the writer deliberately invokes a comparison or association between two (or more) texts. Without this pre-understanding or success to 'grasp the link', the reader's understanding of the text is regarded as inadequate.<ref name=\":1\" /> Obligatory intertextuality relies on the reading or understanding of a prior hypotext, before full comprehension of the hypertext can be achieved.<ref>Jacobmeyer, Hannah. [http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/edoc/ia/eese/artic98/jacobm/88_98.html \"Ever After: A study in intertextuality\"], Carl Hanser Verlag, 1998. Retrieved on 15 March 2018.</ref> \n\nAs an example, Maria Mitchell analyzes the obligatory intertexuality of Tom Stoppard's 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' with Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Marea|date=2007|title=Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: transformations and adaptation.|url=https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/hamlet-and-rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead-transformations-|journal=Sydney Studies in English|volume=33|pages=39\u201355|via=}}</ref> It is in Hamlet where we first meet Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and as the plot of ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead'' unravels, specific scenes from Hamlet are actually performed and viewed from a different perspective. According to Mitchell, this understanding of the hypotext Hamlet, gives deeper meaning to the pretext as many of the implicit themes from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are more recognizable.\n\n===Optional===\nOptional intertextuality has a less vital impact on the significance of the hypertext. It is a possible, but not essential, intertextual relationship that if recognized, the connection will slightly shift the understanding of the text.<ref name=\":1\" /> Optional Intertextuality means it is possible to find a connection to multiple texts of a single phrase, or no connection at all.<ref name=\":0\" /> The intent of the writer when using optional intertextuality, is to pay homage to the 'original' writers, or to reward those who have read the hypotext. However, the reading of this hypotext is not necessary to the understanding of the hypertext.\n\nThe use of optional intertextuality may be something as simple as parallel characters or plotlines. According to Emily Keller, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series shares many similarities with J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Keller says that they both apply the use of an aging wizard mentor (Professor Dumbledore and Gandalf) and a key friendship group is formed to assist the protagonist (an innocent young boy) on their arduous quest to defeat a powerful wizard and to destroy a powerful being.<ref>Keller, Emily. [http://www.jmu.edu/evision/Volume10/Keller.html \"Crafting a Masterpiece: The Genre Mosaic of Harry Potter\"] e-Vision, 2013.</ref>\n\n===Accidental===\nAccidental intertextuality is when readers often connect a text with another text, cultural practice or a personal experience, without there being any tangible anchorpoint within the original text.<ref name=\":1\" /> The writer has no intention of making an intertextual reference and it is completely upon the reader's own prior knowledge that these connections are made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Perspectives on the formation of the Book of the Twelve : methodological foundations, redactional processes, historical insights|others=Albertz, Rainer, 1943-, Nogalski, James., W\u00f6hrle, Jakob.|isbn=9783110283761|location=Berlin|oclc=961557000|last1 = Albertz|first1 = Rainer|last2 = Nogalski|first2 = James D.|last3 = W\u00f6hrle|first3 = Jakob|date = 2012-07-04}}</ref> Often when reading a book or viewing a film a memory will be triggered in the viewers' mind. For example, when reading Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick', a reader may use his or her prior experiences to make a connection between the size of the whale and the size of the ship.\n\n==Competing terms==\nSome critics have complained that the ubiquity of the term \"intertextuality\" in postmodern criticism has crowded out related terms and important nuances. Irwin (227) laments that intertextuality has eclipsed [[allusion]] as an object of literary study while lacking the latter term's clear definition.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Linda Hutcheon]] argues that excessive interest in intertextuality rejects the role of the author, because intertextuality can be found \"in the eye of the beholder\" and does not entail a communicator's intentions. By contrast, in ''A Theory of Parody'' Hutcheon notes [[parody]] always features an author who actively encodes a text as an imitation with critical difference.<ref>Hutcheon, Linda. A Theory of Parody: The Teachings of Twentieth-Century Art Forms. New York: Methuen, 1985.</ref> However, there have also been attempts at more closely defining different types of intertextuality. The Australian media scholar [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] has made a distinction between what he labels 'vertical' and 'horizontal' intertextuality. Horizontal intertextuality denotes references that are on the 'same level' i.e. when books make references to other books, whereas vertical intertextuality is found when, say, a book makes a reference to film or song or vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011|reason=Which Fiske does this come from?}} Similarly, Linguist [[Norman Fairclough]] distinguishes between 'manifest intertextuality' and 'constitutive intertextuality'.<ref>Fairclough, Norman (1992). Discourse and Social Change. Cambridge: Polity Press, 117.</ref> The former signifies intertextual elements such as presupposition, negation, parody, irony, etc. The latter signifies the interrelationship of discursive features in a text, such as structure, form, or genre. Constitutive Intertextuality is also referred to [[interdiscourse|interdiscursivity]],<ref>Agger, Gunhild Intertextuality Revisited: Dialogues and Negotiations in Media Studies. Canadian Journal of Aesthetics, 4, 1999.</ref> though, generally  [[interdiscourse|interdiscursivity]] refers to relations between larger formations of texts.\n\n=== Related concepts ===\nLinguist Norman Fairclough states that \"intertextuality is a matter of [[recontextualization]]\".<ref>Fairclough, Norman. ''Analysing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research.'' New York: Routledge, 2003, p. 51.</ref> According to Per Linell, recontextualization can be defined as the \"dynamic transfer-and-transformation of something from one discourse/text-in-context ... to another\".<ref>Linell, Per. \"Discourse across boundaries: On recontextualizations and the blending of voices in professional discourse,\" ''Text'', 18, 1998, p. 154.</ref> Recontextualization can be relatively explicit\u2014for example, when one text directly quotes another\u2014or relatively implicit\u2014as when the \"same\" generic meaning is rearticulated across different texts.<ref name=\"Oddo2014\">Oddo, John. ''Intertextuality and the 24-Hour News Cycle: A Day in the Rhetorical Life of Colin Powell's U.N. Address.'' East Lansing, MI: Michigan State University Press, 2014.</ref>{{rp|132\u2013133}}\n\nA number of scholars have observed that recontextualization can have important ideological and political consequences. For instance, Adam Hodges has studied how White House officials recontextualized and altered a military general's comments for political purposes, highlighting favorable aspects of the general's utterances while downplaying the damaging aspects.<ref>Hodges, Adam. \"The Politics of Recontextualization: Discursive Competition over Claims of Iranian Involvement in Iraq, \" ''Discourse & Society'', 19(4), 2008, 483-505.</ref> Rhetorical scholar Jeanne Fahnestock has found that when popular magazines recontextualize scientific research they enhance the uniqueness of the scientific findings and confer greater certainty on the reported facts.<ref>Fahnestock, Jeanne. \"Accommodating Science: The Rhetorical life of Scientific Facts,\" ''Written Communication'', 3(3), 1986, 275-296.</ref> Similarly, John Oddo stated that American reporters covering Colin Powell's 2003 U.N. speech transformed Powell's discourse as they recontextualized it, bestowing Powell's allegations with greater certainty and warrantability and even adding new evidence to support Powell's claims.<ref name=\"Oddo2014\" />\n\nOddo has also argued that recontextualization has a future-oriented counterpoint, which he dubs \"precontextualization\".<ref>Oddo, John. \"Precontextualization and the Rhetoric of Futurity:  Foretelling Colin Powell's U.N. Address on NBC News,\" ''Discourse & Communication'', 7(1), 2013, 25-53.</ref> According to Oddo, precontextualization is a form of anticipatory intertextuality wherein \"a text introduces and predicts elements of a symbolic event that is yet to unfold\".<ref name=\"Oddo2014\" />{{rp|78}} For example, Oddo contends, American journalists anticipated and previewed Colin Powell's U.N. address, drawing his future discourse into the normative present.\n\n===Allusion===\nWhile intertextuality is a complex and multileveled literary term, it is often confused with the more casual term 'allusion'. Allusion is a passing or casual reference; an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/plagiarism|title=the definition of plagiarism|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> This means it is most closely linked to both obligatory and accidental intertextuality, as the 'allusion' made relies on the listener or viewer knowing about the original source. It is also seen as accidental, however, as they are normally phrases that are so frequently or casually used, that the true significance of the words is not fully appreciated. Allusion is most often used in conversation, dialogue or metaphor. For example, \"I was surprised his nose was not growing like Pinocchio's.\" This makes a reference to ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', written by [[Carlo Collodi]] when the little wooden puppet lies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/allusion|title=Allusion dictionary definition {{!}} allusion defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> If this was obligatory intertextuality in a text, multiple references to this (or other novels of the same theme) would be used throughout the hypertext.\n\n==Plagiarism==\n[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943), Parsifal Act 3, Picture composition.jpg|thumb|Intertextuality in art: \"Nur eine Waffe taugt\" (Richard Wagner, Parsifal, act III), by [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], ca. 1930]]\n\"Intertextuality is an area of considerable ethical complexity\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Share|first=Perry|date=January 2005|title=Managing intertextuality\u2013meaning, plagiarism and power|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228770980|journal=ResearchGate|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> As intertextuality, by definition, involves the (sometimes) purposeful use of other's work without proper citation, it is often mistaken for plagiarism. Plagiarism is the act of \"using or closely imitating the language and thoughts of another author without authorization-\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Whilst this does seem to include intertextuality, the intention and purpose of using of another's work, is what allows intertextuality to be excluded from this definition.

Intertextuality is based on the 'creation of new ideas', whilst plagiarism is often found in projects based on research to confirm your ideas.\n\n== Non-literary uses ==\nIn addition, the concept of intertextuality has been used analytically outside the sphere of literature and art. For example, Christensen (2016) <ref>Christensen, L.R. (2016). On Intertext in Chemotherapy: an Ethnography of Text in Medical Practice. Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): The Journal of Collaborative Computing and Work Practices. Volume 25, Issue 1, pp 1-38</ref> introduces the concept of intertextuality to the analysis of work practice at a hospital. The study shows that the ensemble of documents used and produced at a hospital department can be said to form a corpus of written texts. On the basis of the corpus, or subsections thereof, the actors in cooperative work create intertext between relevant (complementary) texts in a particular situation, for a particular purpose. The intertext of a particular situation can be constituted by several kinds of intertextuality, including the complementary type, the intratextual type and the mediated type. In this manner the concept of intertext has had an impact beyond literature and art studies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[D\u00e9tournement]]\n* [[Honkadori]]\n* [[Interdiscursivity]]\n* [[Julia Kristeva]]\n* [[Literary theory]]\n* [[Meta]]\n* [[Post-structuralism]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n* ''[[The Shape of Time|The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things]]''\n* [[Transmedia storytelling]]\n* [[Transtextuality]]\n* [[Type scene]]\n* [[Umberto Eco]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Additional citations===\n*Comhrink, A.

For example, when we read [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' we decode it as a [[modernist]] literary experiment, or as a response to the epic tradition, or as part of some other [[conversation]], or as part of all of these conversations at once. This intertextual view of literature, as shown by [[Roland Barthes]], supports the concept that the meaning of a text does not reside in the text, but is produced by the reader in relation not only to the text in question, but also the complex network of texts invoked in the reading process.\n\nWhile the theoretical concept of intertextuality is associated with [[post-modernism]], the device itself is not new. [[New Testament]] passages quote from the [[Old Testament]] and Old Testament books such as [[Deuteronomy]] or the [[Nevi'im|prophet]]s refer to the events described in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] (for discussions on using 'intertextuality' to describe the use of the Old Testament in the New Testament, see Porter 1997; Oropeza 2013; Oropeza & Moyise, 2016). Whereas a redaction critic would use such intertextuality to argue for a particular order and process of the authorship of the books in question, [[literary criticism]] takes a synchronic view that deals with the texts in their final form, as an interconnected body of [[literature]]. This interconnected body extends to later poems and paintings that refer to Biblical narratives, just as other texts build networks around Greek and Roman [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] history and mythology. Bullfinch's 1855 work ''[[The Age Of Fable]]'' served as an introduction to such an intertextual network;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} according to its author, it was intended \"...for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets...\".\n\nSometimes intertextuality is taken as [[plagiarism]] as in the case of Spanish writer [[Luc\u00eda Etxebarria]] whose poem collection ''Estaci\u00f3n de infierno'' (2001) was found to contain metaphors and verses from [[Antonio Colinas]].\nEtxebarria claimed that she admired him and applied intertextuality.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Post-structuralism ===\nMore recent [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] theory, such as that formulated in Daniela Caselli's ''[[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s [[Dante]]s: Intertextuality in the Fiction and Criticism'' (MUP 2005), re-examines \"intertextuality\" as a production within texts, rather than as a series of relationships between different texts. Some postmodern theorists <ref>Gerard Genette, ''Palimpsests: literature in the second degree'', Channa Newman and Claude Doubinsky (trans.), University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln NE and London.</ref> like to talk about the relationship between \"intertextuality\" and \"[[hypertext]]uality\" (not to be confused with [[Hypertext (semiotics)|hypertext]], another semiotic term coined by [[G\u00e9rard Genette]]); intertextuality makes each text a \"living hell of hell on earth\" <ref>Kristeva, 66.</ref> and part of a larger mosaic of texts, just as each [[hypertext]] can be a web of links and part of the whole [[World-Wide Web]]. The [[World-Wide Web]] has been theorized as a unique realm of reciprocal intertextuality, in which no particular text can claim centrality, yet the Web text eventually produces an image of a community\u2014the group of people who write and read the text using specific discursive strategies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mitra|first=Ananda|year=1999|title=Characteristics of the WWW Text: Tracing Discursive Strategies|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol5/issue1/mitra.html|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=5|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1999.tb00330.x}}</ref>\n\nOne can also make distinctions between the notions of \"intertext\", \"hypertext\" and \"supertext\".{{Citation needed|reason=supertext is not a term in Wikipedia; what does it mean?|date=August 2014}} Take for example the ''[[Dictionary of the Khazars]]'' by [[Milorad Pavi\u0107 (writer)|Milorad Pavi\u0107]]. As an intertext, it employs quotations from the scriptures of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s. As a hypertext, it consists of links to different articles within itself and also every individual trajectory of reading it. As a supertext, it combines male and female versions of itself, as well as three mini-dictionaries in each of the versions.\n\n== Examples in literature ==\nSome examples of intertextuality in literature include:\n* ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' (1952) by [[John Steinbeck]]: A retelling of the account of Genesis, set in the Salinas Valley of Northern California.\n* ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) by [[James Joyce]]: A retelling of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', set in Dublin.\n* ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936) by [[William Faulkner]]: A retelling of the [[Absalom]] story from [[the Book of Samuel]], set in antebellum Mississippi.\n* ''[[Earthly Powers]]'' (1980) by [[Anthony Burgess]]: A retelling of [[Anatole France]]'s Le Miracle du grand saint Nicolas during the 20th century.\n* ''[[The Dead Fathers Club]]'' (2006) by [[Matt Haig]]: A retelling of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', set in modern England.\n* ''[[A Thousand Acres]]'' (1991) by [[Jane Smiley]]: A retelling of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'', set in rural Iowa.\n* ''[[Perelandra]]'' (1943) by [[C. S. Lewis]]: Another retelling of the account of Genesis, also leaning on Milton's [[Paradise Lost]], but set on the planet Venus.\n* ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966) by [[Jean Rhys]]: A [[textual intervention]] on [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', the story of the \"[[Bertha Mason|mad woman in the attic]]\" told from her perspective.\n* ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (1996) by [[Steven Pressfield]]: A retelling of the Bhagavad Gita, set in 1931 during an epic golf game.\n* ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (1996) by [[Helen Fielding]]: A modern [[chick lit]] romantic comedy replaying and referencing [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.\n* ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' (1935) by [[John Steinbeck]]: A retelling of the Arthurian legends, set in ''[[Monterey, CA]]'' during the interwar period.\n* ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1931) by [[Eugene O'Neill]]: A retelling of Aeschylus' ''[[The Oresteia]]'', set in post-American Civil War New England.\n\n== Types ==\nIntertextuality and intertextual relationships can be separated into three types: obligatory, optional and accidental.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://moodle.cqu.edu.au|title=Romantic and contemporary poetry: readings|last=Fitzsimmons|first=John|date=2013|website=moodle.cqu.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}</ref> These variations depend on two key factors: the intention of the writer, and the significance of the reference.  The distinctions between these types and those differences between categories are not absolute and exclusive but instead, are manipulated in a way that allows them to co-exist within the same text.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Italy, and intertextuality|date=2004|publisher=Manchester University Press|others=Marrapodi, Michele.|isbn=9780719066672|location=Manchester|oclc=56657010}}</ref>\n\n===Obligatory===\nObligatory intertextuality is when the writer deliberately invokes a comparison or association between two (or more) texts. Without this pre-understanding or success to 'grasp the link', the reader's understanding of the text is regarded as inadequate.<ref name=\":1\" /> Obligatory intertextuality relies on the reading or understanding of a prior hypotext, before full comprehension of the hypertext can be achieved.<ref>Jacobmeyer, Hannah. [http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/edoc/ia/eese/artic98/jacobm/88_98.html \"Ever After: A study in intertextuality\"], Carl Hanser Verlag, 1998. Retrieved on 15 March 2018.</ref> \n\nAs an example, Maria Mitchell analyzes the obligatory intertexuality of Tom Stoppard's 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' with Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Marea|date=2007|title=Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: transformations and adaptation.|url=https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/hamlet-and-rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead-transformations-|journal=Sydney Studies in English|volume=33|pages=39\u201355|via=}}</ref> It is in Hamlet where we first meet Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and as the plot of ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead'' unravels, specific scenes from Hamlet are actually performed and viewed from a different perspective. According to Mitchell, this understanding of the hypotext Hamlet, gives deeper meaning to the pretext as many of the implicit themes from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are more recognizable.\n\n===Optional===\nOptional intertextuality has a less vital impact on the significance of the hypertext. It is a possible, but not essential, intertextual relationship that if recognized, the connection will slightly shift the understanding of the text.<ref name=\":1\" /> Optional Intertextuality means it is possible to find a connection to multiple texts of a single phrase, or no connection at all.<ref name=\":0\" /> The intent of the writer when using optional intertextuality, is to pay homage to the 'original' writers, or to reward those who have read the hypotext. However, the reading of this hypotext is not necessary to the understanding of the hypertext.\n\nThe use of optional intertextuality may be something as simple as parallel characters or plotlines. According to Emily Keller, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series shares many similarities with J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Keller says that they both apply the use of an aging wizard mentor (Professor Dumbledore and Gandalf) and a key friendship group is formed to assist the protagonist (an innocent young boy) on their arduous quest to defeat a powerful wizard and to destroy a powerful being.<ref>Keller, Emily. [http://www.jmu.edu/evision/Volume10/Keller.html \"Crafting a Masterpiece: The Genre Mosaic of Harry Potter\"] e-Vision, 2013.</ref>\n\n===Accidental===\nAccidental intertextuality is when readers often connect a text with another text, cultural practice or a personal experience, without there being any tangible anchorpoint within the original text.<ref name=\":1\" /> The writer has no intention of making an intertextual reference and it is completely upon the reader's own prior knowledge that these connections are made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Perspectives on the formation of the Book of the Twelve : methodological foundations, redactional processes, historical insights|others=Albertz, Rainer, 1943-, Nogalski, James., W\u00f6hrle, Jakob.|isbn=9783110283761|location=Berlin|oclc=961557000|last1 = Albertz|first1 = Rainer|last2 = Nogalski|first2 = James D.|last3 = W\u00f6hrle|first3 = Jakob|date = 2012-07-04}}</ref> Often when reading a book or viewing a film a memory will be triggered in the viewers' mind. For example, when reading Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick', a reader may use his or her prior experiences to make a connection between the size of the whale and the size of the ship.\n\n==Competing terms==\nSome critics have complained that the ubiquity of the term \"intertextuality\" in postmodern criticism has crowded out related terms and important nuances. Irwin (227) laments that intertextuality has eclipsed [[allusion]] as an object of literary study while lacking the latter term's clear definition.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Linda Hutcheon]] argues that excessive interest in intertextuality rejects the role of the author, because intertextuality can be found \"in the eye of the beholder\" and does not entail a communicator's intentions. By contrast, in ''A Theory of Parody'' Hutcheon notes [[parody]] always features an author who actively encodes a text as an imitation with critical difference.<ref>Hutcheon, Linda. A Theory of Parody: The Teachings of Twentieth-Century Art Forms. New York: Methuen, 1985.</ref> However, there have also been attempts at more closely defining different types of intertextuality. The Australian media scholar [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] has made a distinction between what he labels 'vertical' and 'horizontal' intertextuality. Horizontal intertextuality denotes references that are on the 'same level' i.e. when books make references to other books, whereas vertical intertextuality is found when, say, a book makes a reference to film or song or vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011|reason=Which Fiske does this come from?}} Similarly, Linguist [[Norman Fairclough]] distinguishes between 'manifest intertextuality' and 'constitutive intertextuality'.<ref>Fairclough, Norman (1992). Discourse and Social Change. Cambridge: Polity Press, 117.</ref> The former signifies intertextual elements such as presupposition, negation, parody, irony, etc. The latter signifies the interrelationship of discursive features in a text, such as structure, form, or genre. Constitutive Intertextuality is also referred to [[interdiscourse|interdiscursivity]],<ref>Agger, Gunhild Intertextuality Revisited: Dialogues and Negotiations in Media Studies. Canadian Journal of Aesthetics, 4, 1999.</ref> though, generally  [[interdiscourse|interdiscursivity]] refers to relations between larger formations of texts.\n\n=== Related concepts ===\nLinguist Norman Fairclough states that \"intertextuality is a matter of [[recontextualization]]\".<ref>Fairclough, Norman. ''Analysing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research.'' New York: Routledge, 2003, p. 51.</ref> According to Per Linell, recontextualization can be defined as the \"dynamic transfer-and-transformation of something from one discourse/text-in-context ... to another\".<ref>Linell, Per. \"Discourse across boundaries: On recontextualizations and the blending of voices in professional discourse,\" ''Text'', 18, 1998, p. 154.</ref> Recontextualization can be relatively explicit\u2014for example, when one text directly quotes another\u2014or relatively implicit\u2014as when the \"same\" generic meaning is rearticulated across different texts.<ref name=\"Oddo2014\">Oddo, John. ''Intertextuality and the 24-Hour News Cycle: A Day in the Rhetorical Life of Colin Powell's U.N. Address.'' East Lansing, MI: Michigan State University Press, 2014.</ref>{{rp|132\u2013133}}\n\nA number of scholars have observed that recontextualization can have important ideological and political consequences. For instance, Adam Hodges has studied how White House officials recontextualized and altered a military general's comments for political purposes, highlighting favorable aspects of the general's utterances while downplaying the damaging aspects.<ref>Hodges, Adam. \"The Politics of Recontextualization: Discursive Competition over Claims of Iranian Involvement in Iraq, \" ''Discourse & Society'', 19(4), 2008, 483-505.</ref> Rhetorical scholar Jeanne Fahnestock has found that when popular magazines recontextualize scientific research they enhance the uniqueness of the scientific findings and confer greater certainty on the reported facts.<ref>Fahnestock, Jeanne. \"Accommodating Science: The Rhetorical life of Scientific Facts,\" ''Written Communication'', 3(3), 1986, 275-296.</ref> Similarly, John Oddo stated that American reporters covering Colin Powell's 2003 U.N. speech transformed Powell's discourse as they recontextualized it, bestowing Powell's allegations with greater certainty and warrantability and even adding new evidence to support Powell's claims.<ref name=\"Oddo2014\" />\n\nOddo has also argued that recontextualization has a future-oriented counterpoint, which he dubs \"precontextualization\".<ref>Oddo, John. \"Precontextualization and the Rhetoric of Futurity:  Foretelling Colin Powell's U.N. Address on NBC News,\" ''Discourse & Communication'', 7(1), 2013, 25-53.</ref> According to Oddo, precontextualization is a form of anticipatory intertextuality wherein \"a text introduces and predicts elements of a symbolic event that is yet to unfold\".<ref name=\"Oddo2014\" />{{rp|78}} For example, Oddo contends, American journalists anticipated and previewed Colin Powell's U.N. address, drawing his future discourse into the normative present.\n\n===Allusion===\nWhile intertextuality is a complex and multileveled literary term, it is often confused with the more casual term 'allusion'. Allusion is a passing or casual reference; an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/plagiarism|title=the definition of plagiarism|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> This means it is most closely linked to both obligatory and accidental intertextuality, as the 'allusion' made relies on the listener or viewer knowing about the original source. It is also seen as accidental, however, as they are normally phrases that are so frequently or casually used, that the true significance of the words is not fully appreciated. Allusion is most often used in conversation, dialogue or metaphor. For example, \"I was surprised his nose was not growing like Pinocchio's.\" This makes a reference to ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', written by [[Carlo Collodi]] when the little wooden puppet lies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/allusion|title=Allusion dictionary definition {{!}} allusion defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> If this was obligatory intertextuality in a text, multiple references to this (or other novels of the same theme) would be used throughout the hypertext.\n\n==Plagiarism==\n[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943), Parsifal Act 3, Picture composition.jpg|thumb|Intertextuality in art: \"Nur eine Waffe taugt\" (Richard Wagner, Parsifal, act III), by [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], ca. 1930]]\n\"Intertextuality is an area of considerable ethical complexity\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Share|first=Perry|date=January 2005|title=Managing intertextuality\u2013meaning, plagiarism and power|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228770980|journal=ResearchGate|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> As intertextuality, by definition, involves the (sometimes) purposeful use of other's work without proper citation, it is often mistaken for plagiarism. Plagiarism is the act of \"using or closely imitating the language and thoughts of another author without authorization-\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Whilst this does seem to include intertextuality, the intention and purpose of using of another's work, is what allows intertextuality to be excluded from this definition. When using intertextuality, it is usually a small excerpt of a hypotext that assists in the understanding of the new hypertext's original themes, characters or contexts.<ref name=\":0\" /> They use a part of another text and change its meaning by placing it in a different context.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jabri|first=Muayyad|date=December 2003|title=Change as shifting identities: a dialogic perspective|url=http://www.msu.ac.zw/elearning/material/temp/1372165169dialogism%20-%20identities.pdf|journal=Journal of Organizational Change Management|volume=17|pages=|via=}}</ref> This means that they are using other's ideas to create or enhance their own new ideas, not simply plagiarising them. Intertextuality is based on the 'creation of new ideas', whilst plagiarism is often found in projects based on research to confirm your ideas.\n\n== Non-literary uses ==\nIn addition, the concept of intertextuality has been used analytically outside the sphere of literature and art. For example, Christensen (2016) <ref>Christensen, L.R. (2016). On Intertext in Chemotherapy: an Ethnography of Text in Medical Practice. Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): The Journal of Collaborative Computing and Work Practices. Volume 25, Issue 1, pp 1-38</ref> introduces the concept of intertextuality to the analysis of work practice at a hospital. The study shows that the ensemble of documents used and produced at a hospital department can be said to form a corpus of written texts. On the basis of the corpus, or subsections thereof, the actors in cooperative work create intertext between relevant (complementary) texts in a particular situation, for a particular purpose. The intertext of a particular situation can be constituted by several kinds of intertextuality, including the complementary type, the intratextual type and the mediated type. In this manner the concept of intertext has had an impact beyond literature and art studies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[D\u00e9tournement]]\n* [[Honkadori]]\n* [[Interdiscursivity]]\n* [[Julia Kristeva]]\n* [[Literary theory]]\n* [[Meta]]\n* [[Post-structuralism]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n* ''[[The Shape of Time|The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things]]''\n* [[Transmedia storytelling]]\n* [[Transtextuality]]\n* [[Type scene]]\n* [[Umberto Eco]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Additional citations===\n*Comhrink, A.
