She is the only Animal Mechanical who cannot walk on two legs. The horn on her head can be made to blink like a [[beacon]], allowing other creatures to follow her while she is flying. When flying, her legs are bent backwards and her [[hooves]] become [[rocket boosters]], propelling her through the air. Her wings are folded inside her back, except when in use where they provide direction and speed control. Unicorn can also throw lightning, and create a whirlwind with her horn. She is voiced by Leah Ostry; and/or [[\u00c9veline G\u00e9linas]] in French Canadian.<ref name=\"origin-source\" />\n\n===Komodo===\nKomodo is a red Mechana-[[Komodo dragon]] who walks on two legs and has big, squared-off blue [[spectacles]]. His enhancement is the ability to change his tail into a selection of tools, such as a [[hammer]] or a [[screwdriver]]. Often, when utilizing this ability, Unicorn refers to him as being \"handy dandy tool time.\" This does, however, involve him working backwards to the line of the problem, forcing him to bend almost in half in order to see what he is doing. He is shown to be very intelligent, often figuring out the small details of the [[problem]] in hand. He tends to act like a martial arts expert. In a few episodes, he reveals that he has a sensitive stomach and legs. He often has to warn Sasquatch about \"traps\". He is voiced by [[Shannon Lynch]]; and/or Fran\u00e7ois Caffiaux in French Canadian.<ref name=\"origin-source\" />\n\n===Sasquatch===\nSasquatch is a blue Mechana-[[Sasquatch]] who has the enhanced ability to stretch. Each of his limbs extend to an incredible length. When stretched his individual limbs are long, however his joints do not alter and bend as normal. In the episode, \"Baboon Balloon Island\", it was revealed that he is allergic to air pears and in \"Balloon Baboon Island\" and \"Mechana Ski Ball Island\", he has anxiety and a fear of heights. He has referred to himself many times as ''The Mighty Sasquatch''. Whenever Mouse is scared, he always comes to hold her hand (as seen in Jigsaw Shark Puzzle and Chugboat Island), but whenever he's scared or impatient (as seen in Dino Mountain Island and Snail Pace Island), Mouse always comes to hold his hand. Sasquatch often disobeys Komodo's warnings. He is voiced by Ian MacDougall; and/or Denis Roy in French Canadian.<ref name=\"origin-source\" />\n\n===Mouse===\n<!-- PLEASE NOTE that an official citation MUST be provided proving that Mouse is the youngest character, otherwise it will be reverted. -->\nMouse is a yellow Mechana-[[mouse]] who is the youngest in the group and runs about on two wheels instead of her back feet. Her ability is Mechana-Fast, which is increased by lying flat, with her front paws on the ground, which also have wheels on them, and flattening her ears to the side of her head and extending [[exhaust pipes]] which help to propel her forwards. Her ears act like satellite dishes to catch sounds. She sometimes laughs and giggles before Sasquatch transforms and can fit to tight places her friends can't. Whenever Sasquatch is afraid or impatient, she always come to hold his hand. But when she is scared, Sasquatch is always there to hold her hand. She also has the ability to understand creatures. She is voiced by Abigail Gordon; and/or [[Catherine Brunet]] in French Canadian.<ref name=\"origin-source\" />\n\n===Island Owl===\nIsland Owl is the team's commander that only appears at the start of each episode, giving the team's their mission. Her head resembles a television set, which starts each briefing showing her face, then changes to show a representation of the island to which the animal mechanicals are to be sent. She does accompany the Animal Mechanicals, after they have left to go on their mission as she is never heard from or seen again; however she is mentioned by Komodo whenever someone breaks a rule.

He was bought up by his mother Winifred, a violinist, with help from his Godmother Mary Gotch, also a musician. He became a chorister at [[New College Oxford]], attended [[Worksop College]] (studying piano and cello) and then at the Birmingham and Midland School of Music (now the [[Royal Birmingham Conservatoire]]) between 1944 and 1946 for clarinet and composition.<ref name=jan>Composer & Conductor Christopher Whelen' posted by ''Janice in Caunes''</ref> After two years with the [[RAF]] for his National Service Whelen secured conducting lessons with the Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]].<ref name=grove>[https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-5000002933?rskey=IuTaiD Palmer, Christopher. 'Whelen, Christopher' in Grove Music Online]</ref> becoming assistant conductor at the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra]] under Schwarz.\n\nAlready interested in [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] culture (particularly [[Yeats]]), the music of [[Arnold Bax]] became a central influence for Whelen after hearing a performance of [[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]].<ref>Foreman, Lewis. ''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref> Through Bax Whelen also met the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], who became a supporter. He was awarded the [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]] medal for conducting in 1955.<ref name=jan/>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen met his life long partner Dennis Andrews in 1948 in Bournemouth They lived for many years in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire for several years before his death in 1993.<ref name=jan/> The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was [[The Beggar's Opera|''The Beggar's Opera'']], for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref>. The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield. Jeremy Rundall in ''The Sunday Times'' said it \"has an Ancient Mariner-ish ring, and should be heard again\".<ref>''Sunday Times'', 12 December 1965, p 40</ref> \n\nThe specifically commissioned television opera ''Some Place of Darkness'' used an original libretto by the experienced television writer [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. The BBC insisted on realism, and the result was \" a sombre domestic drama set in the present, it exemplified all that television promoted\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6fwSLslWOjsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22Some+place+of+darkness%22+%22television+opera%22&source=bl&ots=b_k28mFrbb&sig=ACfU3U2uiIHxXAQHFjddkSSblEjGXMLm6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji-7CJovfoAhUNQRUIHeqrACcQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20place%20of%20darkness%22%20%22television%20opera%22&f=false Barnes, Jennifer.

The piece, he said \"was the result of a BBC edict - crisp and clear - 'contemporary plot and modern dress'. The words smacked like a damp cloth on the operatic table.\"<ref>Whelen, Christopher. 'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself.

''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen lived in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire for several years before his death in 1993. The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was [[The Beggar's Opera|''The Beggar's Opera'']], for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref>.
