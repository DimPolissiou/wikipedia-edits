events==\n===\"Miss Survivor\" and \"Mr. Survivor\"===\nFrom 2012 to 2015, Cesternino hosted annual \"Miss Survivor\" competitions, in which podcast listeners could vote for female ''Survivor'' players to compete as finalists in a personality and [[Beauty pageant|beauty contest]]. The first competition, in 2012, allowed listeners to vote in any five women from ''Survivor''<nowiki/>'s first 23 seasons as a finalist. The finalists would then participate in an interview with Cesternino and campaign for votes to win. This inaugural competition was won by [[Parvati Shallow]], of ''[[Survivor: Cook Islands|Cook Islands]], [[Survivor: Micronesia|Micronesia]],'' and ''[[Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains|Heroes vs. Villains]].''\n\nIn 2014, Cesternino created a \"Mr. Survivor\" competition, which followed the same rules and procedures as the \"Miss Survivor\", but was open to men. The two competitions were won by Malcolm Freberg (''[[Survivor: Philippines|Philippines]]'') in 2014 and Spencer Bledsoe (''[[Survivor: Cagayan|Cagayan]]'') in 2015.\n\nPrior to the 2016 competitions, Cesternino decided to suspend both \"Mr. Survivor\" and \"Miss Survivor\" competitions, but allowed a chance of revival in future years.<ref name=\"Miss Survivor Suspension\">{{cite web|url=http://robhasawebsite.com/rob-has-an-announcement-why-im-suspending-miss-mr-survivor-for-2016/|title=Rob Has an Announcement: Why I\u2019m Suspending Miss & Mr. Survivor for 2016|date=January 11, 2016|website=Rob Has a Website|last1=Cesternino|first1=Rob|author-link1=Rob Cesternino|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''Reality Gamemasters''===\nOn February 20, 2013, Cesternino launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund a new project, ''Reality Gamemasters,'' in which six reality TV contestants would compete in a game of [[Risk_(game)|''Risk'']], which would be filmed and would air on [[YouTube]].

In the [[Palace of Westminster]] the [[House of Commons]] represents 65 million people in [[United Kingdom constituencies|650 UK constituencies]], and appoints the Prime Minister at will. The [[House of Lords]] remains unelected but can be overruled.<ref>[[Parliament Act 1911]] and [[Parliament Act 1949]]</ref>]]\n{{PoliticsUK}}\nThe '''constitution of the United Kingdom''' is the system of rules that shapes the political governance of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. The UK constitution is not contained in a single code, but principles have emerged over the centuries from statute, case law, political conventions and social consensus. In this sense, it can be said that the United Kingdom does not have a constitution or a [[basic law]]. In England in 1215, [[Magna Carta 1215|Magna Carta]] required the King to call \"common counsel\" or [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], hold courts in a fixed place, guarantee fair trials, guarantee free movement of people, free the church from the state, and enshrined the rights of \"common\" people to use the land.<ref>[[Magna Carta 1215]] clauses 1 ('... the English church shall be free...'), 12 and 14 (no tax 'unless by common counsel of our kingdom...'), 17 ('Common pleas shall... be held in some fixed place'), 39-40 ('To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice'), 41 ('merchants shall have safe and secure [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|exit from England, and entry to England]]') and 47-48 (land taken by the King 'shall forthwith be [[Charter of the Forest|disafforested]]').</ref> After the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, Parliament won supremacy over the monarch, as well as the church and the courts, and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] recorded its fundamental unit of right in \"Person\" and that the \"election of members of Parliament ought to be free\". The [[Act of Union 1707]] unified England, Wales and Scotland, while Ireland was joined in 1801, but the [[Republic of Ireland]] formally separated between [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|1916]] and [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|1921]]. By the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]], almost every adult man and woman was finally entitled to vote for Parliament. The UK was a founding member of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).<ref>The ILO was formed as part of the (now defunct) [[League of Nations]] in the [[Versailles Treaty 1919]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_International_Labour_Office Part XIII]. The [[UN]] was formed in 1945. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] was formally established by the [[London Declaration]] of 1949. The [[Council of Europe]] was created in 1950. The [[European Union]] was formed by the [[Maastricht Treaty 1992]], succeeding the European Community which the UK joined by the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]. The WTO was created in 1994.</ref> The principles of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], the [[rule of law]], [[democracy]], and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] guide the UK's modern political system to advance the [[human development (humanity)|social and economic development]] of its people.\n\nThe central institutions of modern constitutional government are Parliament, the judiciary, the executive, the [[civil service]] and public bodies which implement policies, and regional and local governments. Parliament is composed of the [[House of Commons]], elected by a democratic vote, and the [[House of Lords]] which is mostly appointed on the recommendation of cross-political party groups. To make a new [[Act of Parliament]], the highest form of law, both Houses must read, amend, or approve proposed legislation three times. The judiciary is headed by a twelve-member [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]], and underneath are the [[Court of Appeal for England and Wales]], the [[Court of Session]] for Scotland, the [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland]], and a system of High Courts, Crown Courts, or Tribunals depending on the subject in the case. Courts interpret statutes, progress the [[common law]] and principles of [[equity (law)|equity]], and can control the discretion of the executive. UK courts are usually thought to have no power to declare an [[Act of Parliament]] unconstitutional. The executive is headed by the Prime Minister, who usually commands a majority in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister appoints a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] of people who lead each department, and form [[Her Majesty's Government]]. The Queen herself is a ceremonial figurehead, who gives [[royal assent]] to new laws. By constitutional convention, the monarch does not usurp the democratic process and has not refused royal assent since the [[Scottish Militia Bill]] in 1708. Beyond the Parliament and cabinet, a civil service and a large number of public bodies, from the [[Department of Education]] to the [[National Health Service]], deliver public services that implement the law and fulfil political, economic and social rights.\n\nIn practice, most constitutional litigation occurs through [[administrative law]] disputes, concerning the operation of public bodies, and [[human rights]]. The courts have an inherent power of [[judicial review]], to ensure that every institution under law acts according to law. Except for Parliament itself, courts may declare acts of any institution or public figure void, to ensure that discretion is only used reasonably or proportionately. Since it joined the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1950, and particularly after the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], courts are required to review whether legislation is compatible with international human rights norms. These protect everyone's rights against government or [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights|corporate power]], including [[liberty]] against arbitrary arrest or detention, the right to privacy against unlawful surveillance, the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association including joining [[trade unions]] and taking strike action, and the freedom of assembly and protest. Every public body and private bodies that affect people's rights and freedoms are accountable under the law.\n\n==Principles==\n[[File:Claude Monet 015.jpg|thumb|300px|'''\"London, Houses of Parliament. The Sun Shining through the Fog\", painted by [[Claude Monet]] in 1904.''' In French, ''parler'' means \"to talk\", and the old French developed into the English word \"Parliament\". Though not [[Uncodified constitution|codified]], the UK's constitution is written in hundreds of Acts of Parliament, court cases, and in documented conventions. Its essential principles, though continually evolving, are [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], the [[rule of law]], [[democracy]] and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].<ref>See AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) chs 1-6</ref>]]\n\nThe UK constitution has not been [[Codification (law)|codified]] in one document, like the [[Constitution of South Africa]] or the [[Grundgesetz]] in [[Germany]]. However, general constitutional principles run through the law,<ref>AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) chs 1-6</ref> and central statutes have been recognised as holding \"constitutional\" value.<ref>''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' [2014] UKSC 3, [207] per Lord Neuberger and Lord Mance, \"The United Kingdom has no written constitution, but we have a number of constitutional instruments. They include [[Magna Carta]], the [[Petition of Right 1628]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and (in Scotland) the [[Claim of Rights Act 1689]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Act of Union 1707]]. The [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] may now be added to this list.\" Also see Laws LJ in ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]''.</ref> The main [[sources of law]], which \"constitute\" the body politic of the UK, are Acts of Parliament, cases decided by courts, and conventions on how the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, Parliament and the Monarch conduct themselves.<ref>On conventions, see ''[[Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd]]'' [1975] 3 All ER 484</ref> Through legislation, case law and conventions, at least four main principles are usually recognised. First, [[parliamentary sovereignty]] is a foundational principle. Through the [[English Reformation]], the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Glorious Revolution of 1688]] and the [[Act of the Union 1707]], Parliament became the dominant source of law, above the judiciary, executive, monarchy, and church. Parliamentary sovereignty means Parliament can make or unmake any law within its practical power to do so, a fact that is usually justified by Parliament upholding other principles, namely the [[rule of law]], democracy, and internationalism. Second, the rule of law has run through the constitution since the [[Magna Carta 1215]] and the [[Petition of Right 1628]]. This means the government may only conduct itself according to legal authority, including respect for human rights.<ref>See [[T Bingham]], ''The Rule of Law'' (2011) and ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html EWHC KB J98]</ref> Third, at least since [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928|1928]], democracy has become a fundamental constitutional principle. Originally only wealthy, property-owning men held rights to vote for the [[House of Commons]], while the king or queen, and/or a hereditary [[House of Lords]], dominated politics. But from 1832 adult citizens slowly won the right to [[universal suffrage]].<ref>[[Great Reform Act 1832]] (common property qualification rules for all boroughs and counties), [[Representation of the People Act 1867]] (extended the franchise to around 1/3 of men), [[Representation of the People Act 1884]] (extended the male franchise), [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] (enabled all men to vote over 21, and women over 30 with property), and [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]] (enabled equal suffrage of men at women age 21). The [[Representation of the People Act 1948]] further abolished multiple votes for graduates of London, Cambridge and Oxford, and other [[University constituencies]], and the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]] lowered the voting age to 18. Restrictions on prisoner voting were inserted by the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]]. British citizens abroad can vote under the [[Representation of the People Act 1985]], but millions of UK residents, who pay taxes but do not have citizenship, cannot vote.</ref> Fourth, the UK constitution is international: Parliament has consistently augmented its sovereignty and the practical power of UK citizens through membership of international bodies, including the [[International Labour Organization]],<ref>See the [[Appropriation Act 1923]] Sch 4</ref> the [[United Nations]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the [[European Union]], the [[World Trade Organization]], and the [[International Criminal Court]]. [[EU law|EU]] membership was challenged by the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], and as the government then lost its majority at the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], it was unclear what the outcome would be. However, after the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], in which the Conservatives won their biggest majority since 1987, it became clear that the UK would leave the EU by the end of January 2020.<ref name=\"theg_Brex\">{{Cite web |title=Brexit: Boris Johnson to act swiftly in bringing deal back to MPs |last=Perraudin |first=Frances |work=the Guardian |date= |access-date=20 December 2019 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/general-election-boris-johnson-act-swiftly-brexit-deal-back-to-mps |quote=January }}</ref>\n\n===Parliamentary sovereignty===\n{{main|Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|International law|European Union law}}\n{{Clist sovereignty}}\nParliamentary sovereignty is often seen as a central element in the UK constitution, although its extent is contested.<ref>See generally, [[AW Bradley]], \u2018The Sovereignty of Parliament \u2013 Form or Substance?\u2019 in J Jowell, ''The Changing Constitution'' (7th edn 2011) ch 2</ref> It means that an Act of Parliament is the highest form of law, but also that \"Parliament cannot bind itself.\"<ref>cf AW Bradley and KD Ewing, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2015) 65, it \u2018is not possible to predict the outcome of changes made by Parliament to the \u2018manner and form\u2019 of the legislative process since, depending on the nature and reasons for such changes, the courts might still be influenced by a deep-seated belief in the proposition that Parliament cannot bind itself.\u2019</ref> Historically, Parliament became sovereign through a series of power struggles between the monarch, the church, the courts, and ordinary people. The [[Magna Carta 1215]], which came from the conflict leading to the [[First Barons' War]], granted the right of Parliament to exist for \"common counsel\" before any tax,<ref>[[Magna Carta 1215]] cl 12, \u2018No scutage [tax on knight's land or fee] nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by common counsel of our kingdom...\u2019</ref> against the supposedly \"[[divine right of kings]]\" to rule. [[Common land]] was also guaranteed to people to farm, graze, hunt or fish, though aristocrats continued to dominate politics. In the [[Act of Supremacy 1534]], [[King Henry VIII]] asserted his divine right over the [[Catholic Church]] in Rome, declaring himself the supreme leader of the [[Church of England]]. Then in the ''[[Earl of Oxford's case]]'' in 1615,<ref>''[[Earl of Oxford\u2019s case]]'' (1615) 21 ER 485, Lord Ellesmere LC, \u2018... when a Judgment is obtained by Oppression, Wrong and a hard Conscience, the Chancellor will frustrate and set it aside, not for any error or Defect in the Judgment, but for the hard Conscience of the Party.\u2019</ref> the [[Lord Chancellor]] (both the King's representative and head of the [[judiciary]]) asserted the supremacy of the [[Court of Chancery]] over the common law courts, effectively nullifying [[Sir Edward Coke]]'s assertion that judges could declare statutes void if they went \"against common right and reason\".<ref>''[[Dr Bonham\u2019s case]]'' (1610) 8 Co Rep 114a</ref> Finally, after the [[Glorious Revolution of 1688]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] placed Parliament's power over the monarch (and therefore over the church and courts). Parliament became the \"[[sovereign]]\", and supreme. Power struggles within Parliament continued between the aristocracy and [[common people]]. Outside Parliament, people from the [[Chartists]], to the [[UK labour law|trade unions]] fought for the vote in the [[House of Commons]], and finally in the [[Parliament Act 1911]] and [[Parliament Act 1949]] for the Commons to prevail in any conflict over the unelected [[House of Lords]]: after 1949, the Lords could only delay legislation by one year,<ref>[[Parliament Act 1949]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/103/section/1 s 1].</ref> and not delay any budgetary measure over a month.<ref>[[Parliament Act 1911]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/13/section/1 s 1].</ref> In ''[[R (Jackson) v Attorney General]]'', a group of pro-hunting protestors challenged the [[Hunting Act 2004]]'s ban on fox hunting, arguing it was not a valid Act because it was passed avoiding the House of Lords under the Parliament Acts. The 1949 Act itself was passed using the 1911 Act's power to override the Lords in two years and limited the Lords' power of delay to one year. The claimants argued that this meant the 1949 Act should not be considered a valid law, because the 1911 Act was limited in scope and could not be used to amend its own limitation of the Lords' power. The House of Lords rejected this argument, holding both the [[Parliament Act 1949]] and the [[Hunting Act 2004]] to be completely valid. However, in ''[[obiter dicta]]'' Lord Hope did argue that Parliamentary sovereignty \"is no longer, if it ever was, absolute\", and that the \"rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based\", and cannot be used to defend unconstitutional Acts (as determined by the courts).<ref>[2005] UKHL 56, [120] 'Parliamentary sovereignty is an empty principle if legislation is passed which is so absurd or so unacceptable that the populace at large refuses to recognise it as law'.</ref> There remains no settled meaning of \"Parliamentary sovereignty\", except that it crystallises around the principle of representative democracy, and that its legal force depends on its political legitimacy.<ref>Contrast ''[[R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department]]'' [1999] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/33.html UKHL 33], [2000] 2 AC 115, 131, [[Lord Hoffmann]], \u2018Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. ... The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts, therefore, presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.\u2019</ref>\n\n[[File:Methodist Central Hall - Great Hall with pipe organ.jpg|thumb|left|The UK has committed to [[international law]] as a \"sovereign\" member, to augment its power through cooperation, in the [[United Nations]] since 1945.

It is, of course, omnipotent in the sense that it can make whatever laws it pleases, inasmuch as a law means any rule which has been made by the legislature. But from the scientific point of view, the power of the legislature is of course strictly limited. It is limited, so to speak, both from within and from without; from within, because the legislature is the product of a certain social condition, and determined by whatever determines the society; and from without, because the power of imposing laws is dependent upon the instinct of subordination, which is itself limited. If a legislature decided that all [[Eye color#Blue|blue-eyed]] babies should be murdered, the preservation of blue-eyed babies would be illegal; but legislators must go mad before they could pass such a law, and subjects be idiotic before they could submit to it.\"</ref> First, since 1945 international cooperation meant Parliament augmented its power by working with other sovereign nations, rather than trying to dominate them. The [[British Empire]], which once colonised a quarter of the world's population and a third of its land, was weakened by [[World War I]], and disintegrated after [[World War II]]. While Parliament had nearly uncontested military power before, and so was thought by writers of the Imperial period to be able to \"make or unmake any law whatever\",<ref>[[AV Dicey]], ''The Law of the Constitution'' (1885) 39-40, Parliament has \u2018under the English constitution, the right to make or unmake any law whatever; and further... no person or body is recognised by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.\u2019</ref> the UK chose to join in the [[League of Nations]] in 1919, and after its failure, the [[United Nations]] 1945 to rebuild a system of [[international law]]. The [[Versailles Treaty 1919]] recalled that \"peace can only be established if it is based upon social justice\".<ref>[[Treaty of Versailles 1919]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_International_Labour_Office Part XIII], statute of the [[International Labour Organization]]</ref> The [[UN Charter]], \"based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members\", said that \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\", the UN would \"reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights\", and members should \"live together in peace with one another as good neighbours\". The [[Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1945]], [[United Nations Act 1946]] and [[International Organisations Act 1968]] wrote the UK's funding and membership of the United Nations, the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], and other bodies, into law.<ref>See the [[International Organisations Act 1968]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/20/contents ss 1-8]</ref> For example, the UK bound itself to implement by order UN [[Security Council]] resolutions, up to the actual use of force, in return for representation in the General Assembly and Security Council.<ref>[[United Nations Act 1946]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/45/section/1 s 1]</ref> Although the UK has not always clearly abided by [[international law]],<ref>See the [[Legality of the Iraq War]] page.</ref> it has accepted formal duty that its sovereignty would not be used unlawfully. Second, in 1950 the UK helped to write and join the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. While that convention reflected norms and cases decided under UK statutes and the [[common law]] on [[civil liberties]],<ref>For instance, preceding art. 8 of that convention, see ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' [1765] EWHC KB J98.

In the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], Parliament decided that the UK judiciary should be required to apply human rights norms directly in determining UK cases, to ensure a more speedy, human rights-based resolution to case law, and effectively influence human rights reasoning more.\n\n[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement europ\u00e9en Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|Until 31 January 2020, the UK was a [[European Union]] member, which commits to \"[[human dignity]], [[freedom]], [[democracy]], [[Social equality|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for [[human rights]]\".<ref>[[Treaty on European Union]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_2 art 2]</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] had called for a [[United States of Europe]],\n<ref name=\"19 September 1946\">e.g. 'Speech at the University of Zurich' ([https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1946-1963-elder-statesman/united-states-of-europe 19 September 1946]).</ref>\n<ref name=\"9 October 1948\">e.g. 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' ([https://www.biblio.com/book/winston-churchills-9-october-1948-speech/d/472181237 9 October 1948]).

The idea of a Union had long been envisaged by European leaders, including [[Winston Churchill]], who in 1946 had called for a \"[[United States of Europe]]\".<ref name=\"19 September 1946\"/><ref name=\"9 October 1948\"/> [[EU law]] has always been held to prevail in any conflict between member state laws for the limited fields in which it operates,<ref>''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]]'' (1963) Case 26/62, [94] member states \"have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\".</ref> but member states and citizens gain control over the scope of EU law, and so extend their sovereignty in international affairs, through joint representation in the [[European Parliament]], Council of Ministers, and the [[European Commission|Commission]]. This means that, as the UK is a member of the club, it voluntarily agrees to play by the club's rules. This principle was tested in ''[[R (Factortame Ltd) v SS for Transport]]'', where a fishing business claimed that it should not be required to have 75% of British shareholders, as the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]] said.<ref>[1990] UKHL 7</ref> Under EU law, the principle of [[freedom of establishment]] states that nationals of any member state can freely incorporate and run a business across the EU without unjustified interference. The [[House of Lords]] held that, because the EU law conflicted with the sections of the 1988 Act, those sections would not be enforced, and disapplied, because Parliament had not clearly expressed an intention to renounce the 1972 Act. According to [[Lord Bridge]] \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the [1972 Act] was entirely voluntary\".<ref>[1990] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/7.html UKHL 7]</ref> It is, therefore, the courts' duty, until Parliament expresses a clear will to leave the EU on certain terms, to apply EU law. On the other hand, in ''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Limited) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' the Supreme Court held that certain fundamental principles of UK constitutional law would not be interpreted by the courts as having been given up by membership of the EU, or probably any international organisation.<ref>[2014] UKSC 3</ref> Here a group protesting against the [[High Speed 2]] rail line from London to Manchester and Leeds claimed that the government had not properly followed an Environmental Impact Assessment Directive by whipping a vote in Parliament to approve the plan. They argued that the Directive required open and free consultation, which was not fulfilled if a [[party whip]] compelled party members to vote. The Supreme Court unanimously held the Directive did not require that no party whip occurred, but if a conflict had existed a Directive would not be able to compromise the fundamental constitutional principle from the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] that Parliament is free to organise its affairs.\n\nFourth, [[devolution in the United Kingdom]] has meant Parliament gave power to legislate on specific topics to nations and regions: the [[Scotland Act 1998]] created the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] created the [[Welsh Assembly]], the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] created a [[Northern Ireland Executive]] following the historic [[Good Friday Agreement]], to bring peace. In addition, the [[Local Government Act 1972]] and the [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]] give more limited powers to local and London governments. Practically, but also constitutionally, it has become increasingly accepted that decisions should not be taken for the UK which would override, and run counter to the will of regional governments. However, in ''[[Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU]]'', a group of people who sought to remain in the [[European Union]] brought the government on whether the Prime Minister could trigger Article 50 to notify the [[European Commission]] of the UK's intention to leave, without an [[Act of Parliament]].<ref>[2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/5.html UKSC 5]</ref> This followed the [[Brexit poll of 2016]] where 51.9% of those voting voted to leave.<ref>See [[Opinion polling for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum#Post\u2013referendum polling]]</ref> The claimants argued that, because \"[[Brexit]]\" would obliterate rights that Parliament had conferred through Acts (such as the right of free movement of UK citizens in the EU, the right to [[fair competition]] through merger control, and the right to vote for EU institutions) only Parliament could consent to notifying the intention to negotiate to leave under Article 50. They also argued that the [[Sewel Convention]] for devolved assemblies, where the assembly passes a motion that the Westminster Parliament can legislate on a devolved matter before it does so, meant the UK could not negotiate to leave without the Scottish or Northern Ireland legislatures' consent. The [[UK Supreme Court]] held that Parliament must pass an Act, and could not begin the process of leaving purely through [[Royal Prerogative]]. However, the Sewel convention could not be enforced by courts, rather than observed.<ref>[2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/5.html UKSC 5], 146. 'Judges, therefore, are neither the parents nor the guardians of political conventions; they are merely observers. As such, they can recognise the operation of a political convention in the context of deciding a legal question (as in the Crossman diaries case - ''[[Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd]]'' [1976] 1 QB 752), but they cannot give legal rulings on its operation or scope, because those matters are determined within the political world. As Professor Colin Munro has stated, \"the validity of conventions cannot be the subject of proceedings in a court of law\" - (1975) 91 LQR 218, 228.</ref> This led Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] to procure the [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017]], giving her power to notify the intention to leave the EU.<ref>cf ''[[MacCormick v Lord Advocate]]'' 1953 SC 396, Lord Cooper, \"The principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law.\" However this view was disapproved in ''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU]]'' [2017] [https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/5.html UKSC 5], [43] \"Parliamentary sovereignty is a fundamental principle of the UK constitution\" and at [50] \"it is a fundamental principle of the UK constitution that, unless primary legislation permits it, the Royal prerogative does not enable ministers to change statute law or common law...

The most widely accepted meanings speak of several factors: [[Lord Bingham of Cornhill]], formerly the highest judge in England and Wales, suggested the rule of law ought to mean that [[law]] is clear and predictable, not subject to broad or unreasonable discretion, [[Equality before the law|applies equally]] to all people, with speedy and fair procedures for enforcement, protects fundamental [[human rights]], and works according to [[international law]].<ref name=\"661 Cambridge Law Journal 67\">[[T Bingham]], \u2018The Rule of Law\u2019 (2007) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4500873 66(1) Cambridge Law Journal 67] and see also [[T Bingham]], ''Rule of Law'' (2008) 8, \u2018all persons and authorities within the state, whether [[public]] or [[Privately held company|private]] should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made, taking effect (generally) in the future and publicly administered in the courts.\u2019 [[Lord Bingham]], \u2018The Rule of Law and the Sovereignty of Parliament\u2019 (31 October 2007) [[King's College, London]] also remarked, \u2018democracy lies at the heart of the concept of the rule of law\u2019.</ref> Other definitions seek to exclude human rights and international law as relevant, but largely stem from visions of pre-democratic scholars such as [[Albert Venn Dicey]].<ref>[[AV Dicey]], ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' (3rd edn 1889) [https://archive.org/stream/introductiontos04dicegoog#page/n206/mode/2up Part II, ch IV, 189], first \"absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power\", second \"equality before the law, or the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law courts\" and third, \"principles of private law have with us been by the action of the courts and Parliament so extended as to determine the position of the Crown and of its servants\".

In 1765, in ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' a writer, [[John Entick]], claimed that the King's Chief Messenger, Nathan Carrington, had no legal authority to break into and ransack his home, and remove his papers. Carrington claimed he had authority from the Secretary of State, [[Lord Halifax]] who issued a search \"warrant\", but there was no statute that gave Lord Halifax the authority to issue search warrants. [[Lord Camden CJ]] held that the \"great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property\", and that without any authority \"every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass.\"<ref>[1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html EWHC KB J98]</ref> Carrington acted unlawfully and had to pay damages.

In ''[[R (Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office]]'' a group campaigning against the [[Arms industry|arms trade]], [[Corner House Research]], claimed the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] acted unlawfully by dropping an investigation into the UK-Saudi [[Al-Yamamah arms deal]].

In ''[[R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor]]'' the Supreme Court held the government's imposition of \u00a31200 in fees to bring an [[Employment Tribunal]] claim undermined the [[rule of law]], and was void. The [[Lord Chancellor]] had statutory authority to create fees for court services, but in the case of Employment Tribunals, his Order led to a 70% drop in claims against employers for breach of [[UK labour law|labour rights]], such as unfair dismissal, unlawful wage deductions or discrimination. [[Lord Reed]] said the \"constitutional right of access to the courts is inherent in the rule of law\". Without access to courts, \"laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.\"<ref>[2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/51.html UKSC 51], [66]-[68]</ref> In principle every person is subject to the law, including government ministers, or corporate executives, who may be held in [[contempt of court]] for violating an order.<ref>e.g. ''[[M v Home Office]]'' [1993] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/5.html UKHL 5], holding the Home Secretary, [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]], in contempt of court for failing to return a [[Zaire]] teacher to the UK on refugee status, despite a High Court judge ordering it be done.</ref> In other systems the idea of a [[separation of powers]] is seen as an essential part of maintaining the rule of law. In theory, originally advocated by [[Baron de Montesquieu]], there should be a strict separation of the executive, legislature and judiciary.<ref>Montesquieu, ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748) Book XI, ch 6, \u2018When legislative power is united with executive power in a single person or in a single body of the magistracy, there is no liberty.\u2019</ref> While other systems, notably the [[United States]], attempted to put this into practice (e.g. requiring the executive does not come from the legislature) it is clear that modern political parties may undermine such a separation by capturing all three branches of government, and democracy has been maintained since the 20th century despite the fact that \"there is no formal separation of powers in the United Kingdom.\"<ref>AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2014) 94. cf [[W Bagehot]], ''The English Constitution'' 65, the \u2018efficient secret\u2019 of the UK constitution was \u2018the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the legislative and executive powers\u2019.</ref> The [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] did, however, end the practice of the [[Lord Chancellor]] sitting as the head of the judiciary, while also being a Member of Parliament, and sitting in the cabinet.

In 1703, in the landmark case of ''[[Ashby v White]]'', [[Lord Holt CJ]] stated that the right of everyone \"to give [their] vote at the election of a person to represent [them] in Parliament, there to concur to the making of laws, which are to bind [their] liberty and property, is a most transcendent thing, and of an high nature\".<ref>(1703) 2 Ld Raym 938, dissent approved by the House of Lords.</ref> This has meant that the courts actively ensure that votes cast are counted, and that democratic elections are conducted according to law.

The place of the social welfare state that is necessary to support democratic life is also manifested through courts' interpretation. For instance, in ''[[Gorringe v Calderdale MBC]]'', Lord Steyn, giving the leading judgement, said it was \"necessary\" to view the law of negligence in the context of \"the contours of our social welfare state\".<ref>''[[Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council]]'' [2004] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/15.html UKHL 15], [2].

The [[Exchequer of Pleas|Court of Exchequer]] held the Crown could impose the duty as he pleased to regulate trade. The Court could not go behind the King's statement that the duty was indeed imposed for the purpose of regulating trade. Then, the ''[[Case of Ship Money]]'' or ''[[R v Hampden]]'' (1637) 3 St Tr 825 held that the King could raise money from trade without Parliament. This was reversed by the [[Shipmoney Act 1640]], and after the civil war and glorious revolution, once again by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] art 4.</ref> Similarly in the 18th century, [[Lord Holt CJ]] viewed international law as a general tool for interpretation of the common law,<ref>''[[Lethulier's Case]]'' (1692) 2 Salk 443, \"we take notice of the laws of merchants that are general, not of those that are particular.\"</ref> while [[Lord Mansfield]] in particular did more than any other to affirm that the international ''lex mercatoria'' \"is not the law of a particular country but the law of all nations\",<ref>''[[Luke v Lyde]]'' (1759) 97 Eng Rep 614, 618; (1759) 2 Burr 882, 887</ref> and \"the law of merchants and the law of the land is the same\".<ref>''[[Pillans v Van Mierop]]'' (1765) 3 Burr 1663</ref> In 1774, in ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'', one of the most important cases in legal history, [[Lord Mansfield]] held that [[slavery]] was lawful \"in no country\" and therefore in common law.<ref>''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' (1772) 98 ER 499, \"The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of now being introduced by Courts of Justice upon mere reasoning or inferences from any principles, natural or political; it must take its rise from positive law; the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other source: immemorial usage preserves the memory of positive law long after all traces of the occasion; reason, authority, and time of its introduction are lost...\"</ref> In modern case law it has been consistently accepted that it \"is a principle of legal policy that [UK] law should conform to public [[international law]].\"<ref>''[[Saad v SS for the Home Department]]'' [2001] EWCA Civ 2008, [15] Lord Phillips MR, quoting Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed) p 630 that: \"It is a principle of legal policy that the municipal law should conform to public international law.

It has been further debated whether the UK should adopt a theory of that sees international law as part of UK without any further act (a \"[[Monism and dualism in international law|monist]]\" theory), or whether it should still be required for international law principles to be translated into domestic law (a \"dualist\" theory).<ref>See further ''[[R (SG) v SS for Work and Pensions]]'' [2015] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/16.html UKSC 16], on the benefits cap, [[Lord Kerr]], dissenting, at [247]-[257] argued the dualist theory of international law should be abandoned, and international law should be directly effective in UK law.</ref> The current position in [[European Union law]] is that while international law binds the EU, it cannot undermine fundamental principles of constitutional law or human rights.<ref>''[[Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission]]'' (2008) C-402/05</ref>\n\n[[File:EU Flag at the Stop Trump Rally (32205545383).jpg|thumb|left|The 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum challenged UK membership of the [[European Union]] on a 72.21% turnout, 51.89% voted to leave, and 48.11% to remain.

From the [[Versailles Treaty 1919]], the UK was a founding member of the [[International Labour Organization]], which sets universal standards for people's rights at work. After the failure of the [[League of Nations]] and following World War Two, the UK became a founding member of the [[United Nations]], recognised by Parliament through the [[United Nations Act 1946]], enabling any resolution of the Security Council except the use of force to be implemented by an Order in Council. Under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948]], the continued colonial occupation, and suppression of democracy and human rights in the British Empire lost any remaining legitimacy under international law, and combined with independence movements this led to its rapid dissolution. Two fundamental treaties, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] in 1966 saw the UK ratify most rights from the Universal Declaration. Following the [[Ponsonby Rule]] from 1924, the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] section 20 stipulates that a treaty is ratified once it is laid before Parliament for 21 days and no adverse resolution is passed against it.<ref>For principles of treaty interpretation, see the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969]]</ref> Regionally, the UK participated in drafting the [[European Convention on Human Rights 1950]] which sought to guarantee basic standards of democracy and human rights to preserve peace in post-war Europe. At the same time, following long-held visions for European integration with the UK \"at the centre\",<ref>e.g. [[Winston Churchill]], 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' (9 October 1948). See J Danzig 'Winston Churchill: A founder of the European Union' (10 November 2013) EU ROPE</ref> democratic European countries sought to integrate their economies both to make war impossible, and to advance social progress. In 1972, the UK joined the [[European Community]] (renamed the [[European Union]] in 1992) and committed to implement [[EU law]] in which it participated, in the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]. In 1995, the UK also became a founding member of the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref>cf [[World Trade Organization (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1995]]</ref> To ensure that the European Convention was directly applied by the courts, the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] was passed. It also passed the [[International Criminal Court Act 2001]] to enable prosecution of war criminals, and subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the court. In 2016, however, the UK voted in a referendum on whether to leave the [[European Union]], resulting on a 72.21% turnout in a margin of 48.11% favouring \"remain\", 51.89% favouring \"leave\".<ref>On the post-referendum crisis, see ''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]'' [2017] UKSC 5 and [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017]] s 1, giving power to the PM to notify intention to negotiate to leave the EU.</ref> However, large majorities in both Scotland and Northern favoured remaining in the EU, and it was revealed that significant misconduct took place in the campaigns.<ref>See House of  Commons, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, ''Disinformation and \u2018fake news\u2019: Interim Report'' (29 July 2018) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/363/36302.htm HC 363] and [[Electoral Commission]], ''Report of an investigation in respect of Vote Leave Limited, Mr Darren Grimes, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain'' (17 July 2018).

The executive is bound to the rule of law, interpreted by the [[judiciary]], but the judiciary may not declare an Act of Parliament to be unconstitutional.]]\nWhile principles may the basis of the UK constitution, the institutions of the state perform its functions in practice. First, [[UK Parliament|Parliament]] is the sovereign entity. Its two chambers legislate. In the [[House of Commons]] each [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] is elected by a [[first past the post|simple majority]] in a democratic vote, although outcomes do not always accurately match people's preferences overall. Historically, most elections occurred each four years,<ref>The [[Parliament Act 1911]] set elections to take place at a maximum of each five years, but elections usually occurred in a fourth year. Before this the maximum was seven years, but in practice governments called votes sooner.</ref> but this was fixed at five years in 2011.<ref>[[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] s 1(3). By contrast, [[Australia]] has elections each 3 years, and the US has presidential elections each 4 years.</ref> Election spending is tightly controlled, foreign interference is prohibited, and donations and lobbying are limited in whatever form. The [[House of Lords]] reviews and votes upon legislative proposals by the Commons. It can delay legislation by one year, and cannot delay at all if the proposed Act concerns money.<ref>[[Parliament Act 1911]] and [[Parliament Act 1949]].</ref> Most Lords are appointed by the Prime Minister, through the Queen,<ref>[[Life Peerages Act 1958]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/21/section/1 s 1]</ref> on the advice of a Commission which, by convention, offers some balance between political parties. Ninety-two hereditary peers remain.<ref>[[House of Lords Act 1999]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/34/section/2 ss 1-2], or 90 plus the \"[[Lord Great Chamberlain]]\" and the \"[[Earl Marshal]]\".</ref> To become law, each [[Act of Parliament]] must be read by both houses three times, and given [[royal assent]] by the monarch. The Sovereign does not veto legislation, by convention, since [[Scottish Militia Bill|1708]]. Second, the judiciary interprets the law. It can not strike down an Act of Parliament, but the judiciary ensures that any law which may violate fundamental rights has to be clearly expressed, to force politicians to openly confront what they are doing and \"accept the political cost\".<ref>''[[R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department]]'' [1999] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/33.html UKHL 33], [2000] 2 AC 115, 131, [[Lord Hoffmann]]</ref> Under the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], the judiciary is appointed by the [[Judicial Appointments Commission]] with cross-party and judicial recommendations, to protect judicial independence. Third, the executive branch of government is led by the [[Prime Minister]] who must be able to command a majority in the House of Commons. The Cabinet of Ministers is appointed by the Prime Minister to lead the main departments of state, such as the [[Treasury]], the [[Foreign Office]], the [[Department of Health]] and the [[Department of Education]]. Officially the \"[[head of state]]\" is the monarch, but all [[prerogative power]] is exercised by the Prime Minister, subject to [[judicial review]]. Fourth, as the UK matured as a modern democracy, an extensive system of civil servants, and [[public service]] institutions developed to deliver UK residents economic, social and legal rights. All public bodies, and private bodies that perform public functions, are bound by the [[rule of law]].\n\n===Parliament===\n{{Clist parliament}}\n{{main|Parliament of the United Kingdom}}\nIn the UK constitution, [[Parliament]] sits at the apex of power. It emerged through a series of revolutions as the dominant body, over the [[Acts of Supremacy|church]], [[Earl of Oxford's case|courts]], and the [[Glorious Revolution|monarch]],<ref>Following [[Magna Carta 1215]], see the [[Acts of Supremacy 1534]], the ''[[Earl of Oxford's case]]'' (1615) 21 ER 485, and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]</ref> and within Parliament the [[House of Commons]] emerged as the dominant chamber, over the [[House of Lords]] that traditionally represented the [[aristocracy]].<ref>This was represented by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], following the [[People's Budget]] of 1909.</ref> The central justification for [[Parliamentary sovereignty]] is usually thought to be its democratic nature, although it was only upon the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]] that Parliament could be said to have finally become \"democratic\" in any modern sense (as property qualifications to vote were abolished for everyone over 21), and not until after [[WW2]] that decolonisation, university constituencies and lowering of the voting age took place. Parliament's main functions are to legislate, to allocate money for public spending,<ref>[[Bill of Rights 1689]] art 4, levying money for the Crown without Parliament's consent is illegal. Each year a Supply and Appropriation (Anticipation and Adjustments) Bill, typically passed in March, provides money on account to fund activities from the start of the new financial year. A Supply and Appropriation (Main Estimates) Bill, typicalled passed in July, authorises issue of money from the [[Consolidated Fund]] for the balance of the grant of estimates for the financial year, with a detailed schedule of total net resources, capital and cash authorised for each department.</ref> and to scrutinise the government.<ref>See [[JS Mill]], ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]'' (1861) [https://archive.org/details/considerations00mill/page/96 ch 5].

For instance, the Modernisation Committee of the House of Commons in 2002 recommended publishing draft bills before they became law, and was later found to have been highly successful.<ref>HC Modernisation Committee (2001-2) HC 1168, recommended publishing draft bills, and (2005-6) HC 1097, 'one of the most successful Parliamentary innovations of the last ten years' and 'should become more widespread'.</ref> There are 650 [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs) in the [[House of Commons]], currently elected in five year terms unless two-thirds vote for an early election,<ref>[[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] s 1(3)</ref> and 790 peers in the [[House of Lords]]. For a proposed Bill to become an Act, and law, it must be read three times in each chamber, and given [[royal assent]] by the monarch.\n\n[[File:House of Commons 2010.jpg|left|thumb|The [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is the most important body in the UK constitution. Its [[Members of Parliament]] are democratically elected by constituencies across the UK, and the parties who have a majority in the Commons form the UK government.]]\nToday the [[House of Commons]] is the primary organ of representative government. The [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] section 1 gives the right to vote for MP in the [[House of Commons]] to all [[Commonwealth]] citizens, and citizens of the [[Republic of Ireland]], who are over age 18, and registered. Sections 3 and 4 exclude people who are convicted of an offence and in a penal institution, or detained under mental health laws.<ref>[[Mental Health Act 1983]] or [[Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964]]</ref> These restrictions fall below European standards, which require that people who are convicted of very minor crimes (such as petty theft or drug offences) have the right to vote.<ref>See ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)]]'' [2005] ECHR 681 (blanket disqualification of convicted prisoners from voting breached ECHR Prot 1, art 3. After this the UK failed to change its laws. ''[[Green v United Kingdom]]'' [2010] ECHR 868 reaffirmed the position. HL Paper 103, HC 924 (2013-14) recommended prisoners serving under 12 months should be entitled to vote. Parliament still did not act. ''[[McHugh v UK]]'' [2015] ECHR 155, reaffirmed breach but awarded no compensation or costs.However, ''[[Moohan v Lord Advocate]]'' [2014] UKSC 67 and ''Moohan v UK'' (13 June 2017) App No 22962/15, denial of prisoner voting in the Scottish independent referendum was not a breach of art 3.</ref> Since 2013, everyone has to register individually to vote (for instance, at [http://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote www.gov.uk/register-to-vote]), instead of households being able to register collectively, but an annual household canvass is conducted to increase the number of registered people.<ref>[[Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013]] ss 1-5</ref> As far back as 1703,''[[Ashby v White]]'' recognised the right to \"vote at the election of a person to represent him or [her] in Parliament, there to concur to the making of laws, which are to bind his liberty and property\" as \"a most transcendent thing, and of an high nature\".<ref>(1703) 2 Ld Raym 938</ref> This originally meant that any interference in that right would lead to damages. If the denial of voting would have changed the result, or if a vote was \"conducted so badly that it was not substantially in accordance with the law\" the vote would have to be run again.<ref>''[[Morgan v Simpson]]'' [1975] QB 151, per Lord Denning MR</ref> So, in ''[[Morgan v Simpson]]'' the Court of Appeal declared that an election for a [[Greater London Council]] seat was not valid after it was found that 44 unstamped ballot papers were not counted.

By contrast, in [[Australia]] voters may select preferences for candidates, although this system was rejected in a [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum]] staged by the Cameron-Clegg coalition. In the [[European Parliament]], voters choose a party from multi-member regional constituencies: this tends to give smaller parties much greater representation. In the [[Scottish Parliament]], [[Welsh Assembly]] and [[London Assembly]], voters have the choice of both constituencies and a party list, which tends to reflect overall preferences best.

Since the abolition of most [[hereditary peers]], there has been ongoing debate about whether or how to elect the House of Lords.]]\nAlong with a hereditary monarch, the [[House of Lords]] remains an historical curiosity in the UK constitution. Traditionally it represented the landed aristocracy, and political allies of the monarch or the government, and has only gradually and incompletely been reformed. Today, the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] has abolished all but 92 hereditary peers, leaving most peers to be \"life peers\" appointed by the government under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]], law lords appointed under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]], and [[Lords Spiritual]] who are senior clergy of the [[Church of England]].<ref>[[House of Lords Act 1999]] ss 1-2</ref> Since 2005, senior judges can only sit and vote in the House of Lords after retirement.<ref>[[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] s 24</ref> The government carries out appointment of most peers, but since 2000 has taken advice from a seven-person House of Lords Appointments Commission with representatives from the Labour, Conservatives and Liberal-Democrat parties.<ref>See the [https://lordsappointments.independent.gov.uk/the-commission-2 Lords Appointments webpage].</ref> A peerage can always be disclaimed,<ref>Now confirmed in the [[House of Lords Reform Act 2014]]</ref> and ex-peers may then run for Parliament.<ref>[[Peerages Act 1963]] and ''[[Re Parliamentary Election for Bristol South East]]'' [1964] 2 QB 257, Viscount Stansgate or [[Tony Benn]] challenged the law disqualifying peers standing for Parliament.</ref> Since 2015, a peer may be suspended or expelled by the House.<ref>[[House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015]]</ref> In practice the [[Parliament Act 1949]] greatly reduced the House of Lords' power, as can only delay and cannot block legislation by one year, and cannot delay money bills at all.<ref>[[Parliament Act 1911]] ss 1-3 and [[Parliament Act 1949]]</ref> Nevertheless, several [[Reform of the House of Lords|options for reform]] are debated. A [[House of Lords Reform Bill 2012]] proposed to have 360 directly elected members, 90 appointed members, 12 bishops and an uncertain number of ministerial members. The elected Lords would have been elected by proportional representation for 15 year terms, through 10 regional constituencies on a [[single transferable vote]] system. However, the government withdrew support after backlash from Conservative backbenches. It has often been argued that if the Lords were elected by geographic constituencies and a party controlled both sides \"there would be little prospect of effective scrutiny or revision of government business.\" A second option, like in Swedish [[Riksdag]], could simply be to abolish the House of Lords: this was in fact done during the [[English Civil War]] in 1649, but restored along with the monarchy in [[Convention Parliament (1660)|1660]].<ref>An Act abolishing the House of Lords 1649, reading \"The Commons of England assembled in Parliament, finding by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England to be continued, have thought fit to ordain and enact, and be it ordained and enacted by this present Parliament, and by the authority of the same, that from henceforth the House of Lords in Parliament shall be and is hereby wholly abolished and taken away; and that the Lords shall not from henceforth meet or sit in the said House called the Lords' House, or in any other house or place whatsoever...\" See also [[Tony Benn|T Benn]], 'We should abolish the House of Lords, not reform it' (12 July 2012) [https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/we-should-abolish-house-lords-not-reform-it New Statesman]</ref> A third proposed option is to elect peers by work and professional groups, so that health care workers elect peers with special health knowledge, people in education elect a fixed number of education experts, legal professionals elect legal representatives, and so on.<ref>cf GDH Cole, ''Self-Government in Industry'' (5th edn 1920) ch V, 134-135.

The highest court of appeal, renamed from the [[House of Lords]] officially from 2005, is the [[UK Supreme Court]]; with the Lord Chancellor's role changed dramatically on 3 April 2006, as a result of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Due to the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005, the make up of the Judiciary is clearly demonstrated for the first time inside the Constitution. This form of enshrined law presents a new branch of government. An independent Supreme Court has been established, separate from the House of Lords and with its own independent appointments system, staff, budget and building. Further aspects of this explores how independent Judicial has become; Appointments Commission, responsible for selecting candidates to recommend for judicial appointment to the Secretary of State for Justice were established. The Judicial Appointments Commission ensures that merit remains the sole criterion for appointment and the appointments system is modern, open and transparent. Lastly,in terms of scrutiny, A Judicial Appointment and Conduct Ombudsman, responsible for investigating and making recommendations concerning complaints about the judicial appointments process, and the handling of judicial conduct complaints within the scope of the Constitutional Reform Act, this provides checks and balances to the Supreme Court. <ref>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/contents</ref>\nThe Judiciary hears appeals from the whole UK in civil law matters, and for criminal law in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland. It cannot hear criminal appeals from Scotland, as that was precluded by the 1707 Treaty of Union, and it is outside the formal competence of the UK Parliament to alter that position. The Supreme Court does however consider \u201cdevolution issues\u201d where these may affect Scottish criminal law.   Since the 1966 [[Practice Statement]], the judiciary has acknowledged that while a system of precedent, that binds lower courts, is necessary to provide \"at least some degree of certainty\", the courts should update their jurisprudence and \"depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.\"<ref>Practice Statement [1966] 3 All ER 77</ref> Litigation usually begins in a [[County Court (England and Wales)|County Court]] or the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] for civil law issues,<ref>This has three divisions: the Administrative, Family and Queen's Bench divisions.</ref> or a [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] or the [[Crown Court]] for [[English criminal law|criminal law]] issues. There are also [[employment tribunals]] for [[UK labour law|labour law]] disputes,<ref>[[Employment Tribunals Act 1996]], appealing to the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]].</ref> and the [[First-tier Tribunal]] for public or regulatory disputes, ranging from immigration, to social security, to tax.<ref>[[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]], appealing to the appropriate [[Upper Tribunal]] division.</ref> After the High Court, Crown Court, or appeal tribunals, cases generally may appeal to the [[Court of Appeal]] in England and Wales. In Scotland, the [[Court of Session]] has an Outer (first instance) and Inner (appeal) House. Appeals then go to the UK Supreme Court, although at any time a court may make a \"[[preliminary reference]]\" to the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] to clarify the meaning of [[EU law]]. Since the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], courts have been expressly required to interpret UK law to be compatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. This follows a longer tradition of courts interpreting the law to be compatible with [[international law]] obligations.<ref>e.g. ''[[Hounga v Allen]]'' [2014] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/47.html UKSC 47]</ref> It is generally accepted that the UK courts do not merely apply but also create new law through their interpretative function: this is obvious in the [[common law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]], where there is no codified statutory basis for large parts of the law, such as [[English contract law|contracts]], [[English tort law|torts]] or [[English trusts law|trusts]]. This also means an element of retroactivity,<ref>\"The power to interpret is the power to destroy.\" O Kahn-Freund, 'The Impact of Constitutions on Labour Law\" (1976) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4505935  35 Cambridge Law Journal 240], 244, paraphrasing [[Marshall CJ]] in ''[[McCulloch v Maryland]]'' (1819) 17 US (4 Wheat) 316</ref> since an application of developing rules may differ from at least one party's understanding of the law in any conflict.<ref>See ''[[Re Spectrum Plus Ltd]]'' [2005] UKHL 41.</ref> Although formally the UK judiciary may not declare an Act of Parliament \"unconstitutional\",<ref>See ''[[Pickin v British Railways Board]]'' [1974] AC 765</ref> in practice the judiciary's power to interpret the law so as to be compatible with human rights can render a statute inoperative, much like in other countries.<ref>''[[R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department]]'' [1999] UKHL 33, per [[Lord Hoffmann]], \"In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.\"</ref> The courts do so sparingly because they recognise the importance of the democratic process.

Since the [[Act of Settlement 1700]], no judge has been removed, as to do so the Queen must act on address by both Houses of Parliament.<ref>See now the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] s 33 and [[Senior Courts Act 1981]] s 11(3)</ref> It is very likely that a judge would never be dismissed, not merely because of formal rules but a \"shared constitutional understanding\" of the importance of the integrity of the legal system.<ref>AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2014) 329, \u2018whatever the theoretical position, there are a number of reasons which help to ensure that these latter powers are unlikely ever to be used, with the security of judicial tenure relying not so much on legal rules as on a shared constitutional understanding which these rules reflect.\u2019</ref> This is reflected, for example, in the ''[[sub judice]]'' rule that matters awaiting decision in court should not be prejudged in a Parliamentary debate.<ref>Codified in 1963, updated in 1972 and 2001, HC Deb (15 December 2001) col 1012.</ref> The [[Lord Chancellor]] (once head of the judiciary but now simply a government minister) also has a statutory duty to uphold the independence of the judiciary,<ref>[[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] s 3</ref> for instance, against attacks upon their integrity by media, corporations, or the government itself. Members of the judiciary can be appointed from among any member of the legal profession who has over 10 years of experience having rights of audience before a court: this usually includes barristers, but can also mean solicitors or academics.<ref>[[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]]</ref> Appointments should be made \"solely on merit\" but regard may be had to the need for diversity when two candidates have equal qualifications.<ref>This was not always true: [[H Laski]] (1932) 168-9, between 1832 and 1906, \u2018Out of 139 judges appointed, 80 were members of the House of Commons at the time of their nomination; 11 others had been candidates for Parliament\u2019, and that of the 80, \u201863 were appointed by their own party while in office\u2019.</ref> For appointments to the Supreme Court, a five-member Judicial Appointments Committee is formed including one Supreme Court judge, three members from the [[Judicial Appointments Commission]], and one lay person.<ref>[[CRA 2005]] s 27A and SI 2013/2193.

I'm different from most of my colleagues in a number of respects (and they're probably at least as conscious of this as I am). I think we could do with more of that sort of diversity.\"</ref> Backing up the judiciary is a considerable body of administrative law. The [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] enables a court to hold anyone in contempt, and commit the person to imprisonment, for violating a court order, or behaviour that could compromise a fair judicial process. In practice this is enforced by the executive. The [[Lord Chancellor]] heads the [[Ministry of Justice]], which performs various functions including administering the [[Legal Aid Agency]] for people who cannot afford access to the courts. In ''[[R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor]]'' the government suffered scathing criticism for creating high fees that cut the number of applicants to employment tribunals by 70 per cent.<ref>[2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/51.html UKSC 51]</ref> The Attorney General of England and Wales, and in Scottish matters, the Advocate General for Scotland,  and the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]] represent the Crown in litigation.

The UK remains a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The formal [[head of state]] is [[Majesty|Her Majesty]] [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II]], a [[hereditary]] monarch since 1952. In reality, no Queen or King has attempted to usurp the will of Parliament [[Scottish Militia Bill|since 1708]],<ref>[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] withheld [[royal assent]] for the [[Scottish Militia Bill]].</ref> and all constitutional duties and power are accepted by binding convention to have shifted to the [[Prime Minister]], Parliament or the courts.<ref>See R Blackburn, \u2018Monarchy and the personal prerogatives\u2019 [2004] Public Law 546, explaining that the \"personal prerogative\" of the monarch is a set of powers that must be exercised according to law, and must follow the advice of the Prime Minister, or in accordance with Parliament and the courts.</ref> Over the 17th century, the [[Petition of Right 1628]] was asserted by Parliament to prevent any taxation by the monarch without Parliament's consent, and the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]] denied the monarch any power to arrest people for failing to pay taxes. The monarch's continued assertion of the [[divine right to rule]] led to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] being executed in the [[English Civil War]], and finally the settlement of power in the [[Bill of Rights of 1689]]. Following the [[Act of Union 1707]] and an early financial crisis as [[South Sea Company]] shares crashed, [[Robert Walpole]] emerged as a dominant political figure. Leading the House of Commons from 1721 to 1742, Walpole is generally acknowledged to be the first [[Prime Minister of the UK|Prime Minister]] (''[[Primus inter pares]]''). The PM's modern functions include leading the dominant political party, setting policy priorities, creating Ministries and appointing ministers, judges, peers, and civil servants. The PM also has considerable control through the convention of [[collective responsibility]] (that ministers must publicly support the government even when they privately disagree, or resign), and control over the government's communications to the public. By contrast in law, as is necessary in a democratic society,<ref>n.b. the Monarch continued to withhold royal assent for laws in British colonies leading, for example, to the [[American Revolution]] and [[US Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.</ref> the monarch is a figurehead with no political power,<ref>cf [[W Bagehot]], ''The English Constitution'' ([https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_English_Constitution_(1894) 1867]) 111, suggesting the monarch has a right to be consulted, to encourage and to warn.</ref> but a series of ceremonial duties, and considerable funding.

However, on the other hand, it has been argued that the UK should [[Abolition of monarchy|abolish the monarchy]], on the ground that hereditary inheritance of political office has no place in a modern democracy.

This includes a growing number of [[Henry VIII]] clauses, which enable a Secretary of State to alter provisions of primary legislation.

By 1789, these ideas evolved and inspired both the [[US Bill of Rights]], and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] after the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s.

The only public body whose decisions cannot be reviewed is Parliament, when it passes an Act. Otherwise, a claimant can argue that a public body's decision was unlawful in five main types of case:<ref>Different books and cases categorise the grounds to review administrative discretion differently, as do different fields of law such as [[directors' duties]] in [[UK company law]], [[unfair dismissal]] in [[UK labour law]] or implied terms in [[English contract law]]. Lord Diplock in the ''[[GCHQ case]]'' said the grounds were \"illegality\", \"irrationality\" and \"procedural impropriety\". A Le Sueur, M Sunkin and J Murkens, ''Public Law Text, Cases, and Materials'' (3rd edn 2016) ch 16 follows this. It is often, however, unclear how a procedural requirement of the law can be separated from substance, and it was thought that \"irrationality\" is too restrictive. AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2014) ch 24 now suggests substantive grounds, legitimate expectations and procedural grounds.

That is the essence and the rest is mainly machinery.' M Elliott and R Thomas, ''Public Law'' (3rd edn 2017) ch 12 generally follows this.

To date, the Parliament of the UK has no limit on its power other than the possibility of extra-parliamentary action (by the people) and of other sovereign states (pursuant to treaties made by Parliament and otherwise). It has been commented by Dicey that formally, the UK Parliament was limited by the terms of the international treaties that created it in the first place. His comment that it would be imprudent for the UK Parliament to try and abolish Scots Law for example, has been criticised judicially as \u201ccynical\u201d but was written in the high Victorian era when Parliament was grappling with the concept of Irish Home Rule, strongly opposed by many politicians at the time. \n\nProponents of a codified constitution argue it would strengthen the legal protection of democracy and freedom.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=Lewis F.|title=British Democracy: Its Restoration & Extension|publisher=ISR|year=2006|chapter=Five: \"The Legal Protection Of Democracy & Freedom: The Case for a New Written Constitution & Bill Of Rights\"|isbn=978-0-906321-31-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xwN-MIMtE6sC&dq=isbn=090632131X}}</ref> As a strong advocate of the \"unwritten constitution\", Dicey highlighted that English rights were embedded in the general English [[common law]] of personal liberty, and \"the institutions and manners of the nation\".<ref>A V Dicey (1897) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SBNxu6y9t8EC&pg=PA193 Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution]</ref> Opponents of a codified constitution argue that the country is not based on a founding document that tells its citizens who they are and what they can do. There is also a belief that any unwarranted encroachment on the spirit of constitutional authority would be stiffly resisted by the British people, a perception expounded by the 19th century American judge [[Joseph P. Bradley|Justice Bradley]] in the course of delivering his opinion in a case heard in Louisiana in 1873: \"England has no written constitution, it is true; but it has an unwritten one, resting in the acknowledged, and frequently declared, privileges of Parliament and the people, to violate which in any material respect would produce a revolution in an hour.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Joseph P.

The courts can advise Parliament of [[primary legislation]] that conflicts with the Act by means of \"[[Declarations of Incompatibility]]\" \u2013 however Parliament is not bound to amend the law nor can the judiciary void any statute \u2013 and it can refuse to enforce, or \"strike down\", any incompatible [[secondary legislation]]. Any actions of government authorities that violate Convention rights are illegal except if mandated by an Act of Parliament.\n\nChanges also include the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] which alters the structure of the House of Lords to separate its judicial and legislative functions. For example, the legislative, judicial and executive functions of the [[Lord Chancellor]] are now shared between the Lord Chancellor (executive), [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] (judicial) and the newly created post of [[Lord Speaker]] (legislative). The role of [[Law Lord]] (a member of the judiciary in the House of Lords) was abolished by transferring them to the new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in October 2009.\n\n[[Gordon Brown]] launched a \"[[Governance of Britain]]\" process when he took over as PM in 2007. This was an ongoing process of constitutional reform with the [[Ministry of Justice (UK)|Ministry of Justice]] as lead ministry. The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 is a piece of constitutional legislation. It enshrines in statute the impartiality and integrity of the UK Civil Service and the principle of open and fair recruitment. It enshrines in law the [[Ponsonby Rule]] which requires that treaties are laid before Parliament before they can be ratified.\n\nThe Coalition Government formed in May 2010 proposed a series of further constitutional reforms in their coalition agreement. Consequently, the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]] and the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] were passed. The Acts were intended to reduce the number of MPs in the House of Commons from 650 to 600, change the way the UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies, introduce [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|a referendum on changing the system used to elect MPs]] and take the power to dissolve Parliament away from the monarch. The Coalition also promised to introduce law on the reform of the House of Lords. In the referendum, the Alternative Vote system was rejected by 67% to 33%, and therefore all reforms regarding the voting system were dropped.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13297573 | work=BBC News | title=Vote 2011: UK rejects alternative vote | date=7 May 2011}}</ref> Conservatives forced the government to drop House of Lords reforms, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] said they would refuse to support changes to the boundaries of constituencies, as they believed such changes favoured the Conservatives.\n\n==See also==\n*[[UK human rights law]]\n*[[UK administrative law]]\n*[[UK labour law]]\n*[[English land law]]\n*[[Constitutional government]]\n*[[Constitution Committee|House of Lords Constitution Committee]]\n*[[Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee]]\n*[[Parliament in the Making]]\n*[[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)]]\n*[[Power Inquiry]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n;Articles\n*A Blick, '[http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/magna-carta-and-contemporary-constitutional-change Magna Carta and contemporary constitutional change]' (2015) History and Policy \n*[[V Bogdanor]], T Khaitan and S Vogenauer, 'Should Britain have a written constitution?'

The [[House of Lords]] remains unelected but can be overruled.<ref>[[Parliament Act 1911]] and [[Parliament Act 1949]]</ref>]]\n{{PoliticsUK}}\nThe '''constitution of the United Kingdom''' is the system of rules that shapes the political governance of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. The UK constitution is not contained in a single code, but principles have emerged over the centuries from statute, case law, political conventions and social consensus. In this sense, it can be said that the United Kingdom does not have a constitution or a [[basic law]]. In England in 1215, [[Magna Carta 1215|Magna Carta]] required the King to call \"common counsel\" or [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], hold courts in a fixed place, guarantee fair trials, guarantee free movement of people, free the church from the state, and enshrined the rights of \"common\" people to use the land.<ref>[[Magna Carta 1215]] clauses 1 ('... the English church shall be free...'), 12 and 14 (no tax 'unless by common counsel of our kingdom...'), 17 ('Common pleas shall... be held in some fixed place'), 39-40 ('To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice'), 41 ('merchants shall have safe and secure [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|exit from England, and entry to England]]') and 47-48 (land taken by the King 'shall forthwith be [[Charter of the Forest|disafforested]]').</ref> After the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Glorious Revolution 1688]], Parliament won supremacy over the monarch, as well as the church and the courts, and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] recorded its fundamental unit of right in \"Person\" and that the \"election of members of Parliament ought to be free\". The [[Act of Union 1707]] unified England, Wales and Scotland, while Ireland was joined in 1801, but the [[Republic of Ireland]] formally separated between [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|1916]] and [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|1921]]. By the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]], almost every adult man and woman was finally entitled to vote for Parliament. The UK was a founding member of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).<ref>The ILO was formed as part of the (now defunct) [[League of Nations]] in the [[Versailles Treaty 1919]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_International_Labour_Office Part XIII]. The [[UN]] was formed in 1945. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] was formally established by the [[London Declaration]] of 1949. The [[Council of Europe]] was created in 1950. The [[European Union]] was formed by the [[Maastricht Treaty 1992]], succeeding the European Community which the UK joined by the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]. The WTO was created in 1994.</ref> The principles of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], the [[rule of law]], [[democracy]], and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] guide the UK's modern political system to advance the [[human development (humanity)|social and economic development]] of its people.\n\nThe central institutions of modern constitutional government are Parliament, the judiciary, the executive, the [[civil service]] and public bodies which implement policies, and regional and local governments. Parliament is composed of the [[House of Commons]], elected by a democratic vote, and the [[House of Lords]] which is mostly appointed on the recommendation of cross-political party groups. To make a new [[Act of Parliament]], the highest form of law, both Houses must read, amend, or approve proposed legislation three times. The judiciary is headed by a twelve-member [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]], and underneath are the [[Court of Appeal for England and Wales]], the [[Court of Session]] for Scotland, the [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland]], and a system of High Courts, Crown Courts, or Tribunals depending on the subject in the case. Courts interpret statutes, progress the [[common law]] and principles of [[equity (law)|equity]], and can control the discretion of the executive. UK courts are usually thought to have no power to declare an [[Act of Parliament]] unconstitutional. The executive is headed by the Prime Minister, who usually commands a majority in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister appoints a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] of people who lead each department, and form [[Her Majesty's Government]]. The Queen herself is a ceremonial figurehead, who gives [[royal assent]] to new laws. By constitutional convention, the monarch does not usurp the democratic process and has not refused royal assent since the [[Scottish Militia Bill]] in 1708. Beyond the Parliament and cabinet, a civil service and a large number of public bodies, from the [[Department of Education]] to the [[National Health Service]], deliver public services that implement the law and fulfil political, economic and social rights.\n\nIn practice, most constitutional litigation occurs through [[administrative law]] disputes, concerning the operation of public bodies, and [[human rights]]. The courts have an inherent power of [[judicial review]], to ensure that every institution under law acts according to law. Except for Parliament itself, courts may declare acts of any institution or public figure void, to ensure that discretion is only used reasonably or proportionately. Since it joined the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1950, and particularly after the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], courts are required to review whether legislation is compatible with international human rights norms. These protect everyone's rights against government or [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights|corporate power]], including [[liberty]] against arbitrary arrest or detention, the right to privacy against unlawful surveillance, the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association including joining [[trade unions]] and taking strike action, and the freedom of assembly and protest. Every public body and private bodies that affect people's rights and freedoms are accountable under the law.\n\n==Principles==\n[[File:Claude Monet 015.jpg|thumb|300px|'''\"London, Houses of Parliament. The Sun Shining through the Fog\", painted by [[Claude Monet]] in 1904.''' In French, ''parler'' means \"to talk\", and the old French developed into the English word \"Parliament\". Though not [[Uncodified constitution|codified]], the UK's constitution is written in hundreds of Acts of Parliament, court cases, and in documented conventions. Its essential principles, though continually evolving, are [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], the [[rule of law]], [[democracy]] and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].<ref>See AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) chs 1-6</ref>]]\n\nThe UK constitution has not been [[Codification (law)|codified]] in one document, like the [[Constitution of South Africa]] or the [[Grundgesetz]] in [[Germany]]. However, general constitutional principles run through the law,<ref>AW Bradley, KD Ewing and CJS Knight, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2018) chs 1-6</ref> and central statutes have been recognised as holding \"constitutional\" value.<ref>''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' [2014] UKSC 3, [207] per Lord Neuberger and Lord Mance, \"The United Kingdom has no written constitution, but we have a number of constitutional instruments. They include [[Magna Carta]], the [[Petition of Right 1628]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and (in Scotland) the [[Claim of Rights Act 1689]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Act of Union 1707]]. The [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] may now be added to this list.\" Also see Laws LJ in ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]''.</ref> The main [[sources of law]], which \"constitute\" the body politic of the UK, are Acts of Parliament, cases decided by courts, and conventions on how the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, Parliament and the Monarch conduct themselves.<ref>On conventions, see ''[[Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd]]'' [1975] 3 All ER 484</ref> Through legislation, case law and conventions, at least four main principles are usually recognised. First, [[parliamentary sovereignty]] is a foundational principle. Through the [[English Reformation]], the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Glorious Revolution of 1688]] and the [[Act of the Union 1707]], Parliament became the dominant source of law, above the judiciary, executive, monarchy, and church. Parliamentary sovereignty means Parliament can make or unmake any law within its practical power to do so, a fact that is usually justified by Parliament upholding other principles, namely the [[rule of law]], democracy, and internationalism. Second, the rule of law has run through the constitution since the [[Magna Carta 1215]] and the [[Petition of Right 1628]]. This means the government may only conduct itself according to legal authority, including respect for human rights.<ref>See [[T Bingham]], ''The Rule of Law'' (2011) and ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html EWHC KB J98]</ref> Third, at least since [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928|1928]], democracy has become a fundamental constitutional principle. Originally only wealthy, property-owning men held rights to vote for the [[House of Commons]], while the king or queen, and/or a hereditary [[House of Lords]], dominated politics. But from 1832 adult citizens slowly won the right to [[universal suffrage]].<ref>[[Great Reform Act 1832]] (common property qualification rules for all boroughs and counties), [[Representation of the People Act 1867]] (extended the franchise to around 1/3 of men), [[Representation of the People Act 1884]] (extended the male franchise), [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] (enabled all men to vote over 21, and women over 30 with property), and [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]] (enabled equal suffrage of men at women age 21). The [[Representation of the People Act 1948]] further abolished multiple votes for graduates of London, Cambridge and Oxford, and other [[University constituencies]], and the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]] lowered the voting age to 18. Restrictions on prisoner voting were inserted by the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]].

The [[Magna Carta 1215]], which came from the conflict leading to the [[First Barons' War]], granted the right of Parliament to exist for \"common counsel\" before any tax,<ref>[[Magna Carta 1215]] cl 12, \u2018No scutage [tax on knight's land or fee] nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by common counsel of our kingdom...\u2019</ref> against the supposedly \"[[divine right of kings]]\" to rule. [[Common land]] was also guaranteed to people to farm, graze, hunt or fish, though aristocrats continued to dominate politics. In the [[Act of Supremacy 1534]], [[King Henry VIII]] asserted his divine right over the [[Catholic Church]] in Rome, declaring himself the supreme leader of the [[Church of England]]. Then in the ''[[Earl of Oxford's case]]'' in 1615,<ref>''[[Earl of Oxford\u2019s case]]'' (1615) 21 ER 485, Lord Ellesmere LC, \u2018... when a Judgment is obtained by Oppression, Wrong and a hard Conscience, the Chancellor will frustrate and set it aside, not for any error or Defect in the Judgment, but for the hard Conscience of the Party.\u2019</ref> the [[Lord Chancellor]] (both the King's representative and head of the [[judiciary]]) asserted the supremacy of the [[Court of Chancery]] over the common law courts, effectively nullifying [[Sir Edward Coke]]'s assertion that judges could declare statutes void if they went \"against common right and reason\".<ref>''[[Dr Bonham\u2019s case]]'' (1610) 8 Co Rep 114a</ref> Finally, after the [[Glorious Revolution of 1688]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] placed Parliament's power over the monarch (and therefore over the church and courts). Parliament became the \"[[sovereign]]\", and supreme. Power struggles within Parliament continued between the aristocracy and [[common people]]. Outside Parliament, people from the [[Chartists]], to the [[UK labour law|trade unions]] fought for the vote in the [[House of Commons]], and finally in the [[Parliament Act 1911]] and [[Parliament Act 1949]] for the Commons to prevail in any conflict over the unelected [[House of Lords]]: after 1949, the Lords could only delay legislation by one year,<ref>[[Parliament Act 1949]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/103/section/1 s 1].</ref> and not delay any budgetary measure over a month.<ref>[[Parliament Act 1911]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/13/section/1 s 1].</ref> In ''[[R (Jackson) v Attorney General]]'', a group of pro-hunting protestors challenged the [[Hunting Act 2004]]'s ban on fox hunting, arguing it was not a valid Act because it was passed avoiding the House of Lords under the Parliament Acts. The 1949 Act itself was passed using the 1911 Act's power to override the Lords in two years and limited the Lords' power of delay to one year. The claimants argued that this meant the 1949 Act should not be considered a valid law, because the 1911 Act was limited in scope and could not be used to amend its own limitation of the Lords' power. The House of Lords rejected this argument, holding both the [[Parliament Act 1949]] and the [[Hunting Act 2004]] to be completely valid. However, in ''[[obiter dicta]]'' Lord Hope did argue that Parliamentary sovereignty \"is no longer, if it ever was, absolute\", and that the \"rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based\", and cannot be used to defend unconstitutional Acts (as determined by the courts).<ref>[2005] UKHL 56, [120] 'Parliamentary sovereignty is an empty principle if legislation is passed which is so absurd or so unacceptable that the populace at large refuses to recognise it as law'.</ref> There remains no settled meaning of \"Parliamentary sovereignty\", except that it crystallises around the principle of representative democracy, and that its legal force depends on its political legitimacy.<ref>Contrast ''[[R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department]]'' [1999] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/33.html UKHL 33], [2000] 2 AC 115, 131, [[Lord Hoffmann]], \u2018Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. ... The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts, therefore, presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.\u2019</ref>\n\n[[File:Methodist Central Hall - Great Hall with pipe organ.jpg|thumb|left|The UK has committed to [[international law]] as a \"sovereign\" member, to augment its power through cooperation, in the [[United Nations]] since 1945.

It is, of course, omnipotent in the sense that it can make whatever laws it pleases, inasmuch as a law means any rule which has been made by the legislature. But from the scientific point of view, the power of the legislature is of course strictly limited. It is limited, so to speak, both from within and from without; from within, because the legislature is the product of a certain social condition, and determined by whatever determines the society; and from without, because the power of imposing laws is dependent upon the instinct of subordination, which is itself limited. If a legislature decided that all [[Eye color#Blue|blue-eyed]] babies should be murdered, the preservation of blue-eyed babies would be illegal; but legislators must go mad before they could pass such a law, and subjects be idiotic before they could submit to it.\"</ref> First, since 1945 international cooperation meant Parliament augmented its power by working with other sovereign nations, rather than trying to dominate them. The [[British Empire]], which once colonised a quarter of the world's population and a third of its land, was weakened by [[World War I]], and disintegrated after [[World War II]]. While Parliament had nearly uncontested military power before, and so was thought by writers of the Imperial period to be able to \"make or unmake any law whatever\",<ref>[[AV Dicey]], ''The Law of the Constitution'' (1885) 39-40, Parliament has \u2018under the English constitution, the right to make or unmake any law whatever; and further... no person or body is recognised by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.\u2019</ref> the UK chose to join in the [[League of Nations]] in 1919, and after its failure, the [[United Nations]] 1945 to rebuild a system of [[international law]]. The [[Versailles Treaty 1919]] recalled that \"peace can only be established if it is based upon social justice\".<ref>[[Treaty of Versailles 1919]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_International_Labour_Office Part XIII], statute of the [[International Labour Organization]]</ref> The [[UN Charter]], \"based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members\", said that \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\", the UN would \"reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights\", and members should \"live together in peace with one another as good neighbours\". The [[Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1945]], [[United Nations Act 1946]] and [[International Organisations Act 1968]] wrote the UK's funding and membership of the United Nations, the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], and other bodies, into law.<ref>See the [[International Organisations Act 1968]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/20/contents ss 1-8]</ref> For example, the UK bound itself to implement by order UN [[Security Council]] resolutions, up to the actual use of force, in return for representation in the General Assembly and Security Council.<ref>[[United Nations Act 1946]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/45/section/1 s 1]</ref> Although the UK has not always clearly abided by [[international law]],<ref>See the [[Legality of the Iraq War]] page.</ref> it has accepted formal duty that its sovereignty would not be used unlawfully. Second, in 1950 the UK helped to write and join the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. While that convention reflected norms and cases decided under UK statutes and the [[common law]] on [[civil liberties]],<ref>For instance, preceding art. 8 of that convention, see ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' [1765] EWHC KB J98. On [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/European_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Rights_and_Fundamental_Freedoms#Article_11_%E2%80%93_Freedom_of_assembly_and_association%C2%B9 art 11], see ''[[Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch]]'' [1941] UKHL 2</ref> the UK accepted that people could appeal to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]], if domestic remedies were insufficient. In the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], Parliament decided that the UK judiciary should be required to apply human rights norms directly in determining UK cases, to ensure a more speedy, human rights-based resolution to case law, and effectively influence human rights reasoning more.\n\n[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement europ\u00e9en Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|Until 31 January 2020, the UK was a [[European Union]] member, which commits to \"[[human dignity]], [[freedom]], [[democracy]], [[Social equality|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for [[human rights]]\".<ref>[[Treaty on European Union]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_2 art 2]</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] had called for a [[United States of Europe]],\n<ref name=\"19 September 1946\">e.g. 'Speech at the University of Zurich' ([https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1946-1963-elder-statesman/united-states-of-europe 19 September 1946]).</ref>\n<ref name=\"9 October 1948\">e.g. 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' ([https://www.biblio.com/book/winston-churchills-9-october-1948-speech/d/472181237 9 October 1948]).

The idea of a Union had long been envisaged by European leaders, including [[Winston Churchill]], who in 1946 had called for a \"[[United States of Europe]]\".<ref name=\"19 September 1946\"/><ref name=\"9 October 1948\"/> [[EU law]] has always been held to prevail in any conflict between member state laws for the limited fields in which it operates,<ref>''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]]'' (1963) Case 26/62, [94] member states \"have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\".</ref> but member states and citizens gain control over the scope of EU law, and so extend their sovereignty in international affairs, through joint representation in the [[European Parliament]], Council of Ministers, and the [[European Commission|Commission]]. This means that, as the UK is a member of the club, it voluntarily agrees to play by the club's rules. This principle was tested in ''[[R (Factortame Ltd) v SS for Transport]]'', where a fishing business claimed that it should not be required to have 75% of British shareholders, as the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]] said.<ref>[1990] UKHL 7</ref> Under EU law, the principle of [[freedom of establishment]] states that nationals of any member state can freely incorporate and run a business across the EU without unjustified interference. The [[House of Lords]] held that, because the EU law conflicted with the sections of the 1988 Act, those sections would not be enforced, and disapplied, because Parliament had not clearly expressed an intention to renounce the 1972 Act. According to [[Lord Bridge]] \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the [1972 Act] was entirely voluntary\".<ref>[1990] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/7.html UKHL 7]</ref> It is, therefore, the courts' duty, until Parliament expresses a clear will to leave the EU on certain terms, to apply EU law. On the other hand, in ''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Limited) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' the Supreme Court held that certain fundamental principles of UK constitutional law would not be interpreted by the courts as having been given up by membership of the EU, or probably any international organisation.<ref>[2014] UKSC 3</ref> Here a group protesting against the [[High Speed 2]] rail line from London to Manchester and Leeds claimed that the government had not properly followed an Environmental Impact Assessment Directive by whipping a vote in Parliament to approve the plan. They argued that the Directive required open and free consultation, which was not fulfilled if a [[party whip]] compelled party members to vote. The Supreme Court unanimously held the Directive did not require that no party whip occurred, but if a conflict had existed a Directive would not be able to compromise the fundamental constitutional principle from the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] that Parliament is free to organise its affairs.\n\nFourth, [[devolution in the United Kingdom]] has meant Parliament gave power to legislate on specific topics to nations and regions: the [[Scotland Act 1998]] created the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] created the [[Welsh Assembly]], the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] created a [[Northern Ireland Executive]] following the historic [[Good Friday Agreement]], to bring peace. In addition, the [[Local Government Act 1972]] and the [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]] give more limited powers to local and London governments. Practically, but also constitutionally, it has become increasingly accepted that decisions should not be taken for the UK which would override, and run counter to the will of regional governments. However, in ''[[Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU]]'', a group of people who sought to remain in the [[European Union]] brought the government on whether the Prime Minister could trigger Article 50 to notify the [[European Commission]] of the UK's intention to leave, without an [[Act of Parliament]].<ref>[2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/5.html UKSC 5]</ref> This followed the [[Brexit poll of 2016]] where 51.9% of those voting voted to leave.<ref>See [[Opinion polling for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum#Post\u2013referendum polling]]</ref> The claimants argued that, because \"[[Brexit]]\" would obliterate rights that Parliament had conferred through Acts (such as the right of free movement of UK citizens in the EU, the right to [[fair competition]] through merger control, and the right to vote for EU institutions) only Parliament could consent to notifying the intention to negotiate to leave under Article 50. They also argued that the [[Sewel Convention]] for devolved assemblies, where the assembly passes a motion that the Westminster Parliament can legislate on a devolved matter before it does so, meant the UK could not negotiate to leave without the Scottish or Northern Ireland legislatures' consent. The [[UK Supreme Court]] held that Parliament must pass an Act, and could not begin the process of leaving purely through [[Royal Prerogative]]. However, the Sewel convention could not be enforced by courts, rather than observed.<ref>[2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/5.html UKSC 5], 146. 'Judges, therefore, are neither the parents nor the guardians of political conventions; they are merely observers. As such, they can recognise the operation of a political convention in the context of deciding a legal question (as in the Crossman diaries case - ''[[Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd]]'' [1976] 1 QB 752), but they cannot give legal rulings on its operation or scope, because those matters are determined within the political world.

In 1703, in the landmark case of ''[[Ashby v White]]'', [[Lord Holt CJ]] stated that the right of everyone \"to give [their] vote at the election of a person to represent [them] in Parliament, there to concur to the making of laws, which are to bind [their] liberty and property, is a most transcendent thing, and of an high nature\".<ref>(1703) 2 Ld Raym 938, dissent approved by the House of Lords.</ref> This has meant that the courts actively ensure that votes cast are counted, and that democratic elections are conducted according to law. In ''[[Morgan v Simpson]]'' the [[Court of Appeal]] held that if a vote \"was conducted so badly that it was not substantially in accordance with the law as\" then it would be declared void, and so would even minor irregularities that would affect the result.<ref>[1975] QB 151</ref> A considerable body of regulation, for instance in the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] or the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]], restrict spending or any foreign interference because, according to [[Baroness Hale]] \"each person has equal value\" and \"we do not want our government or its policies to be decided by the highest spenders.\"<ref>''[[Animal Defenders International v United Kingdom]]'' [2008] UKHL 15, [48] and see also [2013] ECHR 362</ref> More broadly, the concept of a \"democratic society\" and what is \"necessary\" for its functioning underpins the entire scheme of interpretation for the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] as applied in UK law, particularly after the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], because each right can usually only be restricted if \"in accordance with law\" and as \"necessary in a democratic society\". The place of the social welfare state that is necessary to support democratic life is also manifested through courts' interpretation. For instance, in ''[[Gorringe v Calderdale MBC]]'', Lord Steyn, giving the leading judgement, said it was \"necessary\" to view the law of negligence in the context of \"the contours of our social welfare state\".<ref>''[[Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council]]'' [2004] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/15.html UKHL 15], [2].

The [[Exchequer of Pleas|Court of Exchequer]] held the Crown could impose the duty as he pleased to regulate trade. The Court could not go behind the King's statement that the duty was indeed imposed for the purpose of regulating trade. Then, the ''[[Case of Ship Money]]'' or ''[[R v Hampden]]'' (1637) 3 St Tr 825 held that the King could raise money from trade without Parliament. This was reversed by the [[Shipmoney Act 1640]], and after the civil war and glorious revolution, once again by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] art 4.</ref> Similarly in the 18th century, [[Lord Holt CJ]] viewed international law as a general tool for interpretation of the common law,<ref>''[[Lethulier's Case]]'' (1692) 2 Salk 443, \"we take notice of the laws of merchants that are general, not of those that are particular.\"</ref> while [[Lord Mansfield]] in particular did more than any other to affirm that the international ''lex mercatoria'' \"is not the law of a particular country but the law of all nations\",<ref>''[[Luke v Lyde]]'' (1759) 97 Eng Rep 614, 618; (1759) 2 Burr 882, 887</ref> and \"the law of merchants and the law of the land is the same\".<ref>''[[Pillans v Van Mierop]]'' (1765) 3 Burr 1663</ref> In 1774, in ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'', one of the most important cases in legal history, [[Lord Mansfield]] held that [[slavery]] was lawful \"in no country\" and therefore in common law.<ref>''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' (1772) 98 ER 499, \"The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of now being introduced by Courts of Justice upon mere reasoning or inferences from any principles, natural or political; it must take its rise from positive law; the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other source: immemorial usage preserves the memory of positive law long after all traces of the occasion; reason, authority, and time of its introduction are lost...\"</ref> In modern case law it has been consistently accepted that it \"is a principle of legal policy that [UK] law should conform to public [[international law]].\"<ref>''[[Saad v SS for the Home Department]]'' [2001] EWCA Civ 2008, [15] Lord Phillips MR, quoting Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed) p 630 that: \"It is a principle of legal policy that the municipal law should conform to public international law. The court, when considering, in relation to the facts of the instant case, which of the opposing constructions of the enactment would give effect to the legislative intention, should presume that the legislator intended to observe this principle.\"</ref> The [[House of Lords]] stressed that \"there is a strong presumption in favour of interpreting English law (whether common law or statute) in a way which does not place the United Kingdom in breach of an international obligation.\"<ref>''[[R v Lyons]]'' [2002] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/44.html UKHL 44], [27] [[Lord Hoffmann]]</ref> For example, in ''[[Hounga v Allen]]'' the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held that a young lady who had been illegally trafficked to the UK had a right to bring a race discrimination claim against her employers, even though she had herself been in violation of the [[Immigration Act 1971]].<ref>[2014] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/47.html UKSC 47]</ref> In doing so, the court unanimously drew upon international treaties signed by the UK, known as the [[Palermo Protocols]], as well as the European Convention on Human Rights, in interpreting the scope of the common law doctrine of [[Illegality in English law|illegality]], and held it was no bar for the claimant to assert her legal rights. It has been further debated whether the UK should adopt a theory of that sees international law as part of UK without any further act (a \"[[Monism and dualism in international law|monist]]\" theory), or whether it should still be required for international law principles to be translated into domestic law (a \"dualist\" theory).<ref>See further ''[[R (SG) v SS for Work and Pensions]]'' [2015] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/16.html UKSC 16], on the benefits cap, [[Lord Kerr]], dissenting, at [247]-[257] argued the dualist theory of international law should be abandoned, and international law should be directly effective in UK law.</ref> The current position in [[European Union law]] is that while international law binds the EU, it cannot undermine fundamental principles of constitutional law or human rights.<ref>''[[Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission]]'' (2008) C-402/05</ref>\n\n[[File:EU Flag at the Stop Trump Rally (32205545383).jpg|thumb|left|The 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum challenged UK membership of the [[European Union]] on a 72.21% turnout, 51.89% voted to leave, and 48.11% to remain.

From the [[Versailles Treaty 1919]], the UK was a founding member of the [[International Labour Organization]], which sets universal standards for people's rights at work. After the failure of the [[League of Nations]] and following World War Two, the UK became a founding member of the [[United Nations]], recognised by Parliament through the [[United Nations Act 1946]], enabling any resolution of the Security Council except the use of force to be implemented by an Order in Council. Under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948]], the continued colonial occupation, and suppression of democracy and human rights in the British Empire lost any remaining legitimacy under international law, and combined with independence movements this led to its rapid dissolution. Two fundamental treaties, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] in 1966 saw the UK ratify most rights from the Universal Declaration. Following the [[Ponsonby Rule]] from 1924, the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] section 20 stipulates that a treaty is ratified once it is laid before Parliament for 21 days and no adverse resolution is passed against it.<ref>For principles of treaty interpretation, see the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969]]</ref> Regionally, the UK participated in drafting the [[European Convention on Human Rights 1950]] which sought to guarantee basic standards of democracy and human rights to preserve peace in post-war Europe. At the same time, following long-held visions for European integration with the UK \"at the centre\",<ref>e.g. [[Winston Churchill]], 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' (9 October 1948). See J Danzig 'Winston Churchill: A founder of the European Union' (10 November 2013) EU ROPE</ref> democratic European countries sought to integrate their economies both to make war impossible, and to advance social progress. In 1972, the UK joined the [[European Community]] (renamed the [[European Union]] in 1992) and committed to implement [[EU law]] in which it participated, in the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]. In 1995, the UK also became a founding member of the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref>cf [[World Trade Organization (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1995]]</ref> To ensure that the European Convention was directly applied by the courts, the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] was passed. It also passed the [[International Criminal Court Act 2001]] to enable prosecution of war criminals, and subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the court. In 2016, however, the UK voted in a referendum on whether to leave the [[European Union]], resulting on a 72.21% turnout in a margin of 48.11% favouring \"remain\", 51.89% favouring \"leave\".<ref>On the post-referendum crisis, see ''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]'' [2017] UKSC 5 and [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017]] s 1, giving power to the PM to notify intention to negotiate to leave the EU.</ref> However, large majorities in both Scotland and Northern favoured remaining in the EU, and it was revealed that significant misconduct took place in the campaigns.<ref>See House of  Commons, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, ''Disinformation and \u2018fake news\u2019: Interim Report'' (29 July 2018) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/363/36302.htm HC 363] and [[Electoral Commission]], ''Report of an investigation in respect of Vote Leave Limited, Mr Darren Grimes, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain'' (17 July 2018).

Historically, most elections occurred each four years,<ref>The [[Parliament Act 1911]] set elections to take place at a maximum of each five years, but elections usually occurred in a fourth year. Before this the maximum was seven years, but in practice governments called votes sooner.</ref> but this was fixed at five years in 2011.<ref>[[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] s 1(3). By contrast, [[Australia]] has elections each 3 years, and the US has presidential elections each 4 years.</ref> Election spending is tightly controlled, foreign interference is prohibited, and donations and lobbying are limited in whatever form.

Parliament's main functions are to legislate, to allocate money for public spending,<ref>[[Bill of Rights 1689]] art 4, levying money for the Crown without Parliament's consent is illegal. Each year a Supply and Appropriation (Anticipation and Adjustments) Bill, typically passed in March, provides money on account to fund activities from the start of the new financial year. A Supply and Appropriation (Main Estimates) Bill, typicalled passed in July, authorises issue of money from the [[Consolidated Fund]] for the balance of the grant of estimates for the financial year, with a detailed schedule of total net resources, capital and cash authorised for each department.</ref> and to scrutinise the government.<ref>See [[JS Mill]], ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]'' (1861) [https://archive.org/details/considerations00mill/page/96 ch 5].

Since the abolition of most [[hereditary peers]], there has been ongoing debate about whether or how to elect the House of Lords.]]\nAlong with a hereditary monarch, the [[House of Lords]] remains an historical curiosity in the UK constitution. Traditionally it represented the landed aristocracy, and political allies of the monarch or the government, and has only gradually and incompletely been reformed. Today, the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] has abolished all but 92 hereditary peers, leaving most peers to be \"life peers\" appointed by the government under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]], law lords appointed under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]], and [[Lords Spiritual]] who are senior clergy of the [[Church of England]].<ref>[[House of Lords Act 1999]] ss 1-2</ref> Since 2005, senior judges can only sit and vote in the House of Lords after retirement.<ref>[[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] s 24</ref> The government carries out appointment of most peers, but since 2000 has taken advice from a seven-person House of Lords Appointments Commission with representatives from the Labour, Conservatives and Liberal-Democrat parties.<ref>See the [https://lordsappointments.independent.gov.uk/the-commission-2 Lords Appointments webpage].</ref> A peerage can always be disclaimed,<ref>Now confirmed in the [[House of Lords Reform Act 2014]]</ref> and ex-peers may then run for Parliament.<ref>[[Peerages Act 1963]] and ''[[Re Parliamentary Election for Bristol South East]]'' [1964] 2 QB 257, Viscount Stansgate or [[Tony Benn]] challenged the law disqualifying peers standing for Parliament.</ref> Since 2015, a peer may be suspended or expelled by the House.<ref>[[House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015]]</ref> In practice the [[Parliament Act 1949]] greatly reduced the House of Lords' power, as can only delay and cannot block legislation by one year, and cannot delay money bills at all.<ref>[[Parliament Act 1911]] ss 1-3 and [[Parliament Act 1949]]</ref> Nevertheless, several [[Reform of the House of Lords|options for reform]] are debated. A [[House of Lords Reform Bill 2012]] proposed to have 360 directly elected members, 90 appointed members, 12 bishops and an uncertain number of ministerial members. The elected Lords would have been elected by proportional representation for 15 year terms, through 10 regional constituencies on a [[single transferable vote]] system. However, the government withdrew support after backlash from Conservative backbenches. It has often been argued that if the Lords were elected by geographic constituencies and a party controlled both sides \"there would be little prospect of effective scrutiny or revision of government business.\" A second option, like in Swedish [[Riksdag]], could simply be to abolish the House of Lords: this was in fact done during the [[English Civil War]] in 1649, but restored along with the monarchy in [[Convention Parliament (1660)|1660]].<ref>An Act abolishing the House of Lords 1649, reading \"The Commons of England assembled in Parliament, finding by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England to be continued, have thought fit to ordain and enact, and be it ordained and enacted by this present Parliament, and by the authority of the same, that from henceforth the House of Lords in Parliament shall be and is hereby wholly abolished and taken away; and that the Lords shall not from henceforth meet or sit in the said House called the Lords' House, or in any other house or place whatsoever...\" See also [[Tony Benn|T Benn]], 'We should abolish the House of Lords, not reform it' (12 July 2012) [https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/we-should-abolish-house-lords-not-reform-it New Statesman]</ref> A third proposed option is to elect peers by work and professional groups, so that health care workers elect peers with special health knowledge, people in education elect a fixed number of education experts, legal professionals elect legal representatives, and so on.<ref>cf GDH Cole, ''Self-Government in Industry'' (5th edn 1920) ch V, 134-135.

The highest court of appeal, renamed from the [[House of Lords]] officially from 2005, is the [[UK Supreme Court]]; with the Lord Chancellor's role changed dramatically on 3 April 2006, as a result of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Due to the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005, the make up of the Judiciary is clearly demonstrated for the first time inside the Constitution. This form of enshrined law presents a new branch of government. An independent Supreme Court has been established, separate from the House of Lords and with its own independent appointments system, staff, budget and building. Further aspects of this explores how independent Judicial has become; Appointments Commission, responsible for selecting candidates to recommend for judicial appointment to the Secretary of State for Justice were established. The Judicial Appointments Commission ensures that merit remains the sole criterion for appointment and the appointments system is modern, open and transparent. Lastly,in terms of scrutiny, A Judicial Appointment and Conduct Ombudsman, responsible for investigating and making recommendations concerning complaints about the judicial appointments process, and the handling of judicial conduct complaints within the scope of the Constitutional Reform Act, this provides checks and balances to the Supreme Court. <ref>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/contents</ref>\nThe Judiciary hears appeals from the whole UK in civil law matters, and for criminal law in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland. It cannot hear criminal appeals from Scotland, as that was precluded by the 1707 Treaty of Union, and it is outside the formal competence of the UK Parliament to alter that position. The Supreme Court does however consider \u201cdevolution issues\u201d where these may affect Scottish criminal law.   Since the 1966 [[Practice Statement]], the judiciary has acknowledged that while a system of precedent, that binds lower courts, is necessary to provide \"at least some degree of certainty\", the courts should update their jurisprudence and \"depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.\"<ref>Practice Statement [1966] 3 All ER 77</ref> Litigation usually begins in a [[County Court (England and Wales)|County Court]] or the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] for civil law issues,<ref>This has three divisions: the Administrative, Family and Queen's Bench divisions.</ref> or a [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] or the [[Crown Court]] for [[English criminal law|criminal law]] issues. There are also [[employment tribunals]] for [[UK labour law|labour law]] disputes,<ref>[[Employment Tribunals Act 1996]], appealing to the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]].</ref> and the [[First-tier Tribunal]] for public or regulatory disputes, ranging from immigration, to social security, to tax.<ref>[[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]], appealing to the appropriate [[Upper Tribunal]] division.</ref> After the High Court, Crown Court, or appeal tribunals, cases generally may appeal to the [[Court of Appeal]] in England and Wales. In Scotland, the [[Court of Session]] has an Outer (first instance) and Inner (appeal) House. Appeals then go to the UK Supreme Court, although at any time a court may make a \"[[preliminary reference]]\" to the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] to clarify the meaning of [[EU law]]. Since the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], courts have been expressly required to interpret UK law to be compatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. This follows a longer tradition of courts interpreting the law to be compatible with [[international law]] obligations.<ref>e.g. ''[[Hounga v Allen]]'' [2014] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/47.html UKSC 47]</ref> It is generally accepted that the UK courts do not merely apply but also create new law through their interpretative function: this is obvious in the [[common law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]], where there is no codified statutory basis for large parts of the law, such as [[English contract law|contracts]], [[English tort law|torts]] or [[English trusts law|trusts]]. This also means an element of retroactivity,<ref>\"The power to interpret is the power to destroy.\" O Kahn-Freund, 'The Impact of Constitutions on Labour Law\" (1976) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4505935  35 Cambridge Law Journal 240], 244, paraphrasing [[Marshall CJ]] in ''[[McCulloch v Maryland]]'' (1819) 17 US (4 Wheat) 316</ref> since an application of developing rules may differ from at least one party's understanding of the law in any conflict.<ref>See ''[[Re Spectrum Plus Ltd]]'' [2005] UKHL 41.</ref> Although formally the UK judiciary may not declare an Act of Parliament \"unconstitutional\",<ref>See ''[[Pickin v British Railways Board]]'' [1974] AC 765</ref> in practice the judiciary's power to interpret the law so as to be compatible with human rights can render a statute inoperative, much like in other countries.<ref>''[[R (Simms) v SS for the Home Department]]'' [1999] UKHL 33, per [[Lord Hoffmann]], \"In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.\"</ref> The courts do so sparingly because they recognise the importance of the democratic process.

Members of the judiciary can be appointed from among any member of the legal profession who has over 10 years of experience having rights of audience before a court: this usually includes barristers, but can also mean solicitors or academics.<ref>[[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]]</ref> Appointments should be made \"solely on merit\" but regard may be had to the need for diversity when two candidates have equal qualifications.<ref>This was not always true: [[H Laski]] (1932) 168-9, between 1832 and 1906, \u2018Out of 139 judges appointed, 80 were members of the House of Commons at the time of their nomination; 11 others had been candidates for Parliament\u2019, and that of the 80, \u201863 were appointed by their own party while in office\u2019.</ref> For appointments to the Supreme Court, a five-member Judicial Appointments Committee is formed including one Supreme Court judge, three members from the [[Judicial Appointments Commission]], and one lay person.<ref>[[CRA 2005]] s 27A and SI 2013/2193.

I'm different from most of my colleagues in a number of respects (and they're probably at least as conscious of this as I am). I think we could do with more of that sort of diversity.\"</ref> Backing up the judiciary is a considerable body of administrative law. The [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] enables a court to hold anyone in contempt, and commit the person to imprisonment, for violating a court order, or behaviour that could compromise a fair judicial process. In practice this is enforced by the executive. The [[Lord Chancellor]] heads the [[Ministry of Justice]], which performs various functions including administering the [[Legal Aid Agency]] for people who cannot afford access to the courts.

The UK remains a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The formal [[head of state]] is [[Majesty|Her Majesty]] [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II]], a [[hereditary]] monarch since 1952. In reality, no Queen or King has attempted to usurp the will of Parliament [[Scottish Militia Bill|since 1708]],<ref>[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] withheld [[royal assent]] for the [[Scottish Militia Bill]].</ref> and all constitutional duties and power are accepted by binding convention to have shifted to the [[Prime Minister]], Parliament or the courts.<ref>See R Blackburn, \u2018Monarchy and the personal prerogatives\u2019 [2004] Public Law 546, explaining that the \"personal prerogative\" of the monarch is a set of powers that must be exercised according to law, and must follow the advice of the Prime Minister, or in accordance with Parliament and the courts.</ref> Over the 17th century, the [[Petition of Right 1628]] was asserted by Parliament to prevent any taxation by the monarch without Parliament's consent, and the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]] denied the monarch any power to arrest people for failing to pay taxes. The monarch's continued assertion of the [[divine right to rule]] led to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] being executed in the [[English Civil War]], and finally the settlement of power in the [[Bill of Rights of 1689]]. Following the [[Act of Union 1707]] and an early financial crisis as [[South Sea Company]] shares crashed, [[Robert Walpole]] emerged as a dominant political figure. Leading the House of Commons from 1721 to 1742, Walpole is generally acknowledged to be the first [[Prime Minister of the UK|Prime Minister]] (''[[Primus inter pares]]'').

These are powers of day-to-day management, but tightly constrained to ensure that executive power cannot usurp Parliament or the courts. In the ''[[Case of Prohibitions]]'' in 1607,<ref>''[[Case of Prohibitions]]'' [1607] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1607/J23.html EWHC J23 (KB)], per [[Coke CJ]], \"true it was, that God had endowed His Majesty with excellent science, and great endowments of nature; but His Majesty was not learned in the laws of his realm of England, and causes which concern the life, or inheritance, or goods, or fortunes of his subjects\".</ref> it was held that the royal prerogative could not be used to determine court cases, and in the ''[[Case of Proclamations]]'' in 1610 it was held new prerogative powers could not be created by the executive.<ref name=\"EWHC KB J22\">''[[Case of Proclamations]]'' [1610] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1610/J22.html EWHC KB J22]</ref> It is also clear that no exercise of the prerogative can compromise any right contained in an Act of Parliament.

This includes a growing number of [[Henry VIII]] clauses, which enable a Secretary of State to alter provisions of primary legislation. For this reason it has often been argued that executive authority should be reduced, written into statute, and never used to deprive people of rights without Parliament. All uses of the prerogative, however, are subject to judicial review: in the ''[[GCHQ case]]'' the House of Lords held that no person could be deprived of legitimate expectations by use of the royal prerogative.<ref>''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service]]'' [1985] AC 374</ref>\n\n[[File:Big Ben from Trafalgar Square.JPG|thumb|left|[[Whitehall]] hosts the major offices of the UK government, led by [[cabinet of the UK|cabinet]] ministers.

But in other parts of England, local government is split between two tiers of authority: 32 larger County Councils, and within those 192 District Councils, each sharing different functions.

[[Lord Mansfield]], after declaring he should \"[[let justice be done whatever be the consequence]]\", held that slavery was \"so odious\" that nobody could take \"a slave by force to be sold\" for any \"reason whatever\".</ref> this set off a wave of outrage in southern, enslavement colonies of America. Together with northern colonies grievances over taxation without representation, this led to the [[American Revolution]] and [[US declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] in 1776.<ref>AW Blumrosen, 'The Profound Influence in America of Lord Mansfield's Decision in Somerset v Stuart' (2007) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/twlr13&div=28&id=&page= 13 Texas Wesleyan Law Review 645]</ref> The British military failed to hold control.

Poverty had also accelerated through the [[Speenhamland system]] of [[poor laws]] by subsidising employers and landowners with parish rates. The [[Corn Laws]] from 1815 further impoverished people by fixing prices to maintain landowner profits.<ref>[[T Malthus]], ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'' (1798) supported this, arguing that working class \"vice\" and overpopulation was the cause of poverty.</ref> While the [[Great Reform Act 1832]] extended the vote slightly, only those with property had any representation in Parliament. Although the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] abolished the slave trade within the British Empire, it only compensated slave owners and made ex-slaves in colonies pay off debts for their freedom for decades after. With the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], further punishment for poverty was inflicted as people were put into work houses if found to be unemployed. In ''[[R v Lovelass]]'' a group of agricultural workers who formed a trade union were prosecuted and sentenced to be transported to Australia under the [[Unlawful Oaths Act 1797]],<ref>(1834) 172 ER 1380</ref> triggering mass protests. A movement called [[Chartism]] grew demanding the right to vote for everyone in free and fair elections. As the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|great famine]] hit Ireland and millions migrated to the [[United States]], Chartists staged a mass march from [[Kennington Common]] to Parliament in 1848 as [[1848 revolutions|revolutions]] broke out across Europe, and the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' was drafted by German revolutionary [[Karl Marx]] and Manchester factory owner [[Friedrich Engels]]. While the [[Crimean War]] distracted from social reform and [[Viscount Palmerston]] opposed anything,<ref>Letter to [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] (October 1862) 'Power in the Hands of the Masses throws the Scum of the Community to the Surface. ... Truth and Justice are soon banished from the Land.'</ref> the [[American civil war]] of 1860 to 1865 ended slavery in the US, and the UK gradually enabled greater political freedom. In the [[Second Reform Act 1867]] more middle class property owners were enfranchised, the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] provided free primary school, and the [[Trade Union Act 1871]] enabled free association without criminal penalty.<ref>See also the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]] and ''[[Allen v Flood]]'' [1898] AC 1</ref> The [[Representation of the People Act 1884]] reduced the property qualification further, so that around one third of men could vote. Still, outside the UK liberty and the right to vote were violently repressed across the vast [[British Empire]], in Africa, India, Asia and the Caribbean.<ref>See [[S Tharoor]], ''[[Inglorious Empire]]'' (2018)</ref>\n\nFrom the start of the 20th century, the UK underwent vast social and constitutional change, beginning with an attempt by the [[House of Lords]] to suppress trade union freedom.<ref>''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1901/1.html UKHL 1]</ref> In response, the labour movement organised to support representatives in Parliament, and in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]] won 29 seats and supported the [[Liberal Party]]'s programme of reform. This included a legal guarantee of the right of unions to collectively bargain and strike for fair wages,<ref>[[Trade Disputes Act 1906]]</ref> an old age pension,<ref>[[Old Age Pensions Act 1908]]</ref> a system of minimum wages,<ref>[[Trade Boards Act 1909]]</ref> a [[People's Budget]] with higher taxes on the wealthy to fund spending. After a [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|further election]] brought by the [[House of Lords]] blocking reform, Parliament pass a [[National Insurance]] system for welfare,<ref>[[National Insurance Act 1911]]</ref> and the [[Parliament Act 1911]] prevented the House of Lords blocking legislation for more than two years, and removed the right to delay any money bills.<ref>[[Parliament Act 1949]] reduced the power to delay to one year.</ref> Despite this, the Liberal government, against the opposition of Labour, armed for and entered [[World War One]]. At the end of the War, with millions dead, Parliament passed the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] which enabled every adult male the vote, although it was only after the mass protest of the [[Suffragettes]] that the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]] enabled all women to vote, and that the UK became democratic. The War also triggered uprising in Ireland, and an [[Irish War of Independence]] leading to the partition of the island between the [[Republic of Ireland]] in the south and [[Northern Ireland]] in the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. The [[Versailles Treaty]] at the end of the War demanded German reparations, beggaring the country through the 1920s and upon the [[Great Depression]] leading to a fascist collapse under [[Hitler]].<ref>Predicted by [[JM Keynes]], ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'' (1919)</ref> The failed international law system, after [[World War Two]] was replaced with the [[United Nations]] where the UK held a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]]. However the [[British Empire]] began to crumble as [[India]], [[Israel]] and nations across Africa fought for democracy, human rights, and  independence. To prevent any recurrence of the [[Holocaust]] and [[war]], the [[Council of Europe]] was established to draft the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1950. Further it was seen that the only way to prevent conflict was through economic integration. The [[European Economic Community]], which became the [[European Union]] in 1992, was supported by [[Winston Churchill]] with the UK to be \"at the centre\",<ref name=\"9 October 1948\"/> although it did not enter until the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]. Under [[Margaret Thatcher]], significant cuts were made to public services, labour rights, and the powers of local government, including abolishing the [[Greater London Council]]. However some powers were restored with extensive devolution of power in the [[Scotland Act 1998]], [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]], [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]]. After many years of [[armed conflict]] in Northern Ireland, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998 brought peace. The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] empowered courts to apply [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]] rights without the need for claimants to take cases to the [[European Court of Human Rights|Strasbourg court]]. The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] reduced but did not fully eliminate hereditary peers.

To date, the Parliament of the UK has no limit on its power other than the possibility of extra-parliamentary action (by the people) and of other sovereign states (pursuant to treaties made by Parliament and otherwise). It has been commented by Dicey that formally, the UK Parliament was limited by the terms of the international treaties that created it in the first place. His comment that it would be imprudent for the UK Parliament to try and abolish Scots Law for example, has been criticised judicially as \u201ccynical\u201d but was written in the high Victorian era when Parliament was grappling with the concept of Irish Home Rule, strongly opposed by many politicians at the time. \n\nProponents of a codified constitution argue it would strengthen the legal protection of democracy and freedom.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=Lewis F.|title=British Democracy: Its Restoration & Extension|publisher=ISR|year=2006|chapter=Five: \"The Legal Protection Of Democracy & Freedom: The Case for a New Written Constitution & Bill Of Rights\"|isbn=978-0-906321-31-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xwN-MIMtE6sC&dq=isbn=090632131X}}</ref> As a strong advocate of the \"unwritten constitution\", Dicey highlighted that English rights were embedded in the general English [[common law]] of personal liberty, and \"the institutions and manners of the nation\".<ref>A V Dicey (1897) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SBNxu6y9t8EC&pg=PA193 Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution]</ref> Opponents of a codified constitution argue that the country is not based on a founding document that tells its citizens who they are and what they can do. There is also a belief that any unwarranted encroachment on the spirit of constitutional authority would be stiffly resisted by the British people, a perception expounded by the 19th century American judge [[Joseph P. Bradley|Justice Bradley]] in the course of delivering his opinion in a case heard in Louisiana in 1873: \"England has no written constitution, it is true; but it has an unwritten one, resting in the acknowledged, and frequently declared, privileges of Parliament and the people, to violate which in any material respect would produce a revolution in an hour.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Joseph P.

The courts can advise Parliament of [[primary legislation]] that conflicts with the Act by means of \"[[Declarations of Incompatibility]]\" \u2013 however Parliament is not bound to amend the law nor can the judiciary void any statute \u2013 and it can refuse to enforce, or \"strike down\", any incompatible [[secondary legislation]]. Any actions of government authorities that violate Convention rights are illegal except if mandated by an Act of Parliament.\n\nChanges also include the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] which alters the structure of the House of Lords to separate its judicial and legislative functions. For example, the legislative, judicial and executive functions of the [[Lord Chancellor]] are now shared between the Lord Chancellor (executive), [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] (judicial) and the newly created post of [[Lord Speaker]] (legislative). The role of [[Law Lord]] (a member of the judiciary in the House of Lords) was abolished by transferring them to the new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in October 2009.\n\n[[Gordon Brown]] launched a \"[[Governance of Britain]]\" process when he took over as PM in 2007. This was an ongoing process of constitutional reform with the [[Ministry of Justice (UK)|Ministry of Justice]] as lead ministry. The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 is a piece of constitutional legislation. It enshrines in statute the impartiality and integrity of the UK Civil Service and the principle of open and fair recruitment. It enshrines in law the [[Ponsonby Rule]] which requires that treaties are laid before Parliament before they can be ratified.\n\nThe Coalition Government formed in May 2010 proposed a series of further constitutional reforms in their coalition agreement. Consequently, the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]] and the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] were passed. The Acts were intended to reduce the number of MPs in the House of Commons from 650 to 600, change the way the UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies, introduce [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|a referendum on changing the system used to elect MPs]] and take the power to dissolve Parliament away from the monarch. The Coalition also promised to introduce law on the reform of the House of Lords. In the referendum, the Alternative Vote system was rejected by 67% to 33%, and therefore all reforms regarding the voting system were dropped.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13297573 | work=BBC News | title=Vote 2011: UK rejects alternative vote | date=7 May 2011}}</ref> Conservatives forced the government to drop House of Lords reforms, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] said they would refuse to support changes to the boundaries of constituencies, as they believed such changes favoured the Conservatives.\n\n==See also==\n*[[UK human rights law]]\n*[[UK administrative law]]\n*[[UK labour law]]\n*[[English land law]]\n*[[Constitutional government]]\n*[[Constitution Committee|House of Lords Constitution Committee]]\n*[[Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee]]\n*[[Parliament in the Making]]\n*[[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)]]\n*[[Power Inquiry]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n;Articles\n*A Blick, '[http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/magna-carta-and-contemporary-constitutional-change Magna Carta and contemporary constitutional change]' (2015) History and Policy \n*[[V Bogdanor]], T Khaitan and S Vogenauer, 'Should Britain have a written constitution?'

The series centers on the monster hunter [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and his efforts to avenge his mother's murder. Its gameplay consists of combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of attacks, avoiding damage and exhibiting stylized combat; this combat, along with time and the number of items collected and used, are considered in grading the player's performance. Across the series, new characters with unique skills are available.\n\nThe series alludes to [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Hideki Kamiya created ''Devil May Cry'' after a failed attempt to develop a ''[[Resident Evil]]''; Kamiya wanted to create a game with more action features, something which Capcom felt the series did not need. The games were directed by [[Hideaki Itsuno]] and writer [[Bingo Morihashi]]. Capcom announced a new game, ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'' (developed by [[Ninja Theory]] and Capcom), during the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]]. A high-definition remastering of the three [[PlayStation 2]] titles was released for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012, and in 2018 for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Personal computer|PC]]. The latest game is ''[[Devil May Cry 5]]'', which was released on March 8, 2019.\n\nThe series has been successful; the main entries have sold several million copies and received Capcom's Platinum Title award. The success of the video-game series has led to  [[comic book]]s, [[novelization]]s, an animated series, guides, collectibles, publications, and a variety of [[action figure]]s. Critical response to the gameplay [[Combo (video games)|combos]] has been positive, although the games' narrative was considered simple until the third installment.\n\n==<span id=\"Overview\"></span>Game overview==\n{{Video game timeline\n| 2001 = ''Devil May Cry''\n| 2003 = ''Devil May Cry 2''\n| 2005 = ''Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening''\n| 2008 = Devil May Cry 4''\n| 2012 = ''Devil May Cry HD Collection''\n| 2013 = ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]''\n| 2019 = ''Devil May Cry 5''\n}}\n* ''[[Devil May Cry (video game)|Devil May Cry]]'': Its gameplay focuses on fast-paced, highly-stylized combat; a high style ranking requires long attack and evasion strings, while avoiding damage. Although the game also features puzzle-solving and exploration elements retained from its survival-horror origins, they are downplayed in favor of action. In later games, the system was modified; players had to vary their attacks to maintain their style rank. The style rank is graded during combat with letters: from worst to best, D, C, B, A, and S. They are also represented by words beginning with the first letter of the class: \"Dull\" for D, for example. The third game introduced \"SS\" and \"SSS\" ranks, and player performance on each [[Level (video gaming)|level]] is ranked similarly.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite book|title = Devil May Cry Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Capcom]]| year = 2001}}</ref> The Devil Trigger enables a player's character to assume a devilish form with additional powers (based on their current weapon), while the character's strength and speed increase and health is slowly restored.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \n* ''[[Devil May Cry 2]]'' [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] is generally the games' lead character, although most of the games offer other playable characters. The ability to perform combination attacks in mid-air and evasion and weapon-change buttons were introduced. With the latter, a player can cycle through ranged weapons without switching to the inventory screen.\n[[File:Devilmaycrygameplay.jpg|thumb|alt=Screenshot|Dante attacks an enemy with the sword Alastor. The word \"Cool!\" assesses the player's performance in combat.]]\n* ''[[Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening]]'' added a selection of gameplay styles, allowing the player to focus on favorite techniques or weapons: swords (swordmaster), guns (gunslinger), evasion (trickster) or defense (royal guard). Each of the four styles gains experience points, which unlock more techniques and abilities without costing red orbs (the series' currency). A second weapon-change button was added, allowing the player to cycle through a character's melee weaponry (Devil Arms).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles |title=List of styles in Devil May Cry 3 |publisher=devilmaycry.org |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917091001/http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles/ |archivedate=September 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The game was re-released as ''Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition'' with new skills for Dante and the ability to play as Vergil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/23/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening-special-edition-review|title=Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition Review|author=Dunhan, Jeremy|date=November 22, 2006|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310023352/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/23/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening-special-edition-review|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> \n* ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' had a major innovation: Nero's (the main character) Devil Bringer arm, which gives players the ability to pull distant enemies in to be attacked or destroyed.

Sparda stops Mundus from conquering the human world by sealing a number of hellgates, sealing Temen-Ni-Gru (the last portal) with a ritual requiring his blood and the aid of a powerful priestess. Sparda meets Eva, who gives birth to his twin sons Dante and Vergil.\n\nThe plot begins with ''Devil May Cry 3'', a year after Dante has a falling-out with Vergil.<ref>''Arkham:'' Is your name Dante? Son of Sparda? ''Dante:'' Where did you hear that? ''Arkham:'' From your brother. He sent this invitation to you. Please accept it. ''Dante:'' Invitation huh?

Where does the time go? No doubt you've got some fun planned for me. Right Vergil? (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005</ref> Dante is defeated in Temen-Ni-Gru by Vergil, who takes his locket and leaves with Arkham. Dante's dormant devil power revives him, and he resumes pursuing his brother. Vergil wants to use the pendants their mother gave them in a ritual to create a portal to the Demon World. The battle is joined by [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Lady|Lady]], who wants to avenge her mother's death by Arkham; Arkham manipulated the three into completing the ritual, which would allow him to acquire Sparda's sword: the Force Edge.<ref>''Jester:'' It was quite a ride, you know! If any of you had died before getting here, our little plan would have gone to waste! Therefore, my job was to get you to battle each other in order to weaken you. But at the same time, I needed to guide you here and make sure you were kept alive. I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot!

We surrender in joy to the lowest of the foul and rank; we submerge through darkness, rancid filth. Hour by hour, we move downward, ever closer to Hell, in a slow, steady gait.

The portal begins to close, and Vergil approaches it. Dante pleads with his brother not to go, but Vergil leaps into the Demon World before the portal closes. Vergil is tested and encounters Mundus, his mother's killer. When Lady returns to the human world, she coins the phrase \"devil may cry\"; Dante uses it for the shop.<ref>''Lady:'' Are you crying? ''Dante:'' It's only the rain. ''Lady:'' The rain already stopped. ''Dante:'' Devils never cry. ''Lady:'' I see. Maybe somewhere out there even a devil may cry when he loses a loved one.

(''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante and Trish escape as the island collapses, and work together in the Devil Never Cry shop.\n\nIn the ''Devil May Cry: The Animated Series'' anime, Trish is a demon hunter; Dante is the bodyguard of Patty, a young heiress who becomes obsessed with him. Patty's mother is descended from a sorcerer who sealed the power of Abigail, an ancient devil lord. Patty is targeted by Sid, a demon seeking Abigail's power. Lady and Trish fight demons summoned by Sid, and Dante kills him. \n\nDante is invited by [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Lucia|Lucia]] in ''Devil May Cry 2'' to meet her mother, [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Matier|Matier]].

Kamiya]]. The series centers on the monster hunter [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and his efforts to avenge his mother's murder. Its gameplay consists of combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of attacks, avoiding damage and exhibiting stylized combat; this combat, along with time and the number of items collected and used, are considered in grading the player's performance. Across the series, new characters with unique skills are available.\n\nThe series alludes to [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Hideki Kamiya created ''Devil May Cry'' after a failed attempt to develop a ''[[Resident Evil]]''; Kamiya wanted to create a game with more action features, something which Capcom felt the series did not need. The games were directed by [[Hideaki Itsuno]] and writer [[Bingo Morihashi]]. Capcom announced a new game, ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'' (developed by [[Ninja Theory]] and Capcom), during the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]]. A high-definition remastering of the three [[PlayStation 2]] titles was released for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012, and in 2018 for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Personal computer|PC]]. The latest game is ''[[Devil May Cry 5]]'', which was released on March 8, 2019.\n\nThe series has been successful; the main entries have sold several million copies and received Capcom's Platinum Title award. The success of the video-game series has led to  [[comic book]]s, [[novelization]]s, an animated series, guides, collectibles, publications, and a variety of [[action figure]]s. Critical response to the gameplay [[Combo (video games)|combos]] has been positive, although the games' narrative was considered simple until the third installment.\n\n==<span id=\"Overview\"></span>Game overview==\n{{Video game timeline\n| 2001 = ''Devil May Cry''\n| 2003 = ''Devil May Cry 2''\n| 2005 = ''Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening''\n| 2008 = Devil May Cry 4''\n| 2012 = ''Devil May Cry HD Collection''\n| 2013 = ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]''\n| 2019 = ''Devil May Cry 5''\n}}\n* ''[[Devil May Cry (video game)|Devil May Cry]]'': Its gameplay focuses on fast-paced, highly-stylized combat; a high style ranking requires long attack and evasion strings, while avoiding damage. Although the game also features puzzle-solving and exploration elements retained from its survival-horror origins, they are downplayed in favor of action. In later games, the system was modified; players had to vary their attacks to maintain their style rank. The style rank is graded during combat with letters: from worst to best, D, C, B, A, and S. They are also represented by words beginning with the first letter of the class: \"Dull\" for D, for example. The third game introduced \"SS\" and \"SSS\" ranks, and player performance on each [[Level (video gaming)|level]] is ranked similarly.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite book|title = Devil May Cry Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Capcom]]| year = 2001}}</ref> The Devil Trigger enables a player's character to assume a devilish form with additional powers (based on their current weapon), while the character's strength and speed increase and health is slowly restored.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \n* ''[[Devil May Cry 2]]'' [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] is generally the games' lead character, although most of the games offer other playable characters. The ability to perform combination attacks in mid-air and evasion and weapon-change buttons were introduced. With the latter, a player can cycle through ranged weapons without switching to the inventory screen.\n[[File:Devilmaycrygameplay.jpg|thumb|alt=Screenshot|Dante attacks an enemy with the sword Alastor. The word \"Cool!\" assesses the player's performance in combat.]]\n* ''[[Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening]]'' added a selection of gameplay styles, allowing the player to focus on favorite techniques or weapons: swords (swordmaster), guns (gunslinger), evasion (trickster) or defense (royal guard). Each of the four styles gains experience points, which unlock more techniques and abilities without costing red orbs (the series' currency). A second weapon-change button was added, allowing the player to cycle through a character's melee weaponry (Devil Arms).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles |title=List of styles in Devil May Cry 3 |publisher=devilmaycry.org |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917091001/http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles/ |archivedate=September 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The game was re-released as ''Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition'' with new skills for Dante and the ability to play as Vergil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/23/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening-special-edition-review|title=Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition Review|author=Dunhan, Jeremy|date=November 22, 2006|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310023352/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/23/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening-special-edition-review|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> \n* ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' had a major innovation: Nero's (the main character) Devil Bringer arm, which gives players the ability to pull distant enemies in to be attacked or destroyed.

Sparda stops Mundus from conquering the human world by sealing a number of hellgates, sealing Temen-Ni-Gru (the last portal) with a ritual requiring his blood and the aid of a powerful priestess. Sparda meets Eva, who gives birth to his twin sons Dante and Vergil.\n\nThe plot begins with ''Devil May Cry 3'', a year after Dante has a falling-out with Vergil.<ref>''Arkham:'' Is your name Dante?

(''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005</ref> Dante is defeated in Temen-Ni-Gru by Vergil, who takes his locket and leaves with Arkham. Dante's dormant devil power revives him, and he resumes pursuing his brother. Vergil wants to use the pendants their mother gave them in a ritual to create a portal to the Demon World. The battle is joined by [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Lady|Lady]], who wants to avenge her mother's death by Arkham; Arkham manipulated the three into completing the ritual, which would allow him to acquire Sparda's sword: the Force Edge.<ref>''Jester:'' It was quite a ride, you know! If any of you had died before getting here, our little plan would have gone to waste! Therefore, my job was to get you to battle each other in order to weaken you.

The portal begins to close, and Vergil approaches it. Dante pleads with his brother not to go, but Vergil leaps into the Demon World before the portal closes.

''West [[Amager]]'') is a [[rapid transit station]] of the [[Copenhagen Metro]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The terminus of the [[M1 (Copenhagen)|M1]] line, it is located in zone 3 in the southwestern section of the island of [[Amager]].\n\n==Location==\nVestamager is the southernmost station of the Copenhagen Metro, located in the southern part of [[Amager]]. Specifically, the station lies on a viaduct paralleling \u00d8restads Boulevard at its intersection with Asger Jorns All\u00e9.

It saw action at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], before moving the the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. It returned to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to fight in the German [[Spring Offensive]] and the victorious Allied [[Hundred Days Offensive]].\n\n==Recruitment==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien. Alfred Leete (1882\u20131933) Britons (Kitchener) wants you (Briten Kitchener braucht Euch). 1914 (Nachdruck), 74 x 50 cm. (Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.<ref>Army Council Instructions No 32 (6 August) and No 37 (7 August).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Grist53>Grist, p. 53.</ref> A flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into 'Service' battalions of the county regiments. However, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce considered that the city's response was inadequate and formed a Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee under the leadership of the former Lord Mayor, Sir [[Herbert Ashman]], to encourage enlistment. The city's Colston Hall was opened as a recruiting centre on 14 August, and 2274 men enlisted by 2 September. Eighty men calling themselves the Weston Comrades Company also joined from [[Weston-super-Mare]]. It was clear that many of these men wanted to serve together in a special Bristol battalion, similar to other '[[Pals battalion]]s' being formed around the country. The [[War Office]] (WO) gave the committee authority to form the '''Bristol Battalion''', [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], on 30 August. Later in the year it became part of Kitchener's Fifth New Army (K5) and was officially numbered as the '''12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol)''', but the subtitle was usually rendered as 'Bristol's Own'. The recruiting committee encouraged 'mercantile and professional' men to apply, both through reasons of social exclusiveness and with a view to Kitchener's directive that workers in vital industries could not be spared. The first commanding officer (CO) was William Burges, who had retired from command of the 3rd Militia Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment some years before. Several of the other officers appointed had experience in the Regular or Auxiliary forces, and a number of junior officers had been members of their school or university [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>Marks, pp. 8\u201320, 32\u20133, 39.</ref><ref name = Grist54>Grist, pp. 54\u20135.</ref><ref name = Daniell227>Daniell, p. 227.</ref><ref>Army Council Instructions, October 1914, Appendix VIII; December 1914, Appendix III.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 102.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 72.</ref><ref name = TrailGlos>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/gloucestershire-regiment/ Glosters at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = GlosCO>[http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/gloucs.html Glosters at Infantry Battalion COs.]</ref>\n\n==Training==\nThe rush of recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of K5 were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Initially the Bristol men lived at home and drilled by squads at Colston Hall in their civilian clothes, distinguished only by a lapel badge bearing the words 'New Bristol Battalion Gloucestershire Regt'. They then began battalion drills at the Artillery Grounds in [[Whiteladies Road]], the headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|I South Midland (Gloucestershire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery]] of the [[Territorial Force]]. But in late September the recruiting committee persuaded the WO to buy up the site of the abandoned Bristol International Exhibition in Greville Smyth Park, the buildings of which were converted into barracks by the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Army Service Corps]]. The 'Weston Comrades' joined the rest of the battalion here in November and were posted to D Company. Some of the battalion's best men were already being posted away, for officer training for example, and on 30 November the WO authorised the recruiting committee to raise a fifth, reserve company (E Company); F Company was raised as a further reserve in April 1915. Old rifles had been issued to the battalion for drill purposes, with just a few modern [[Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]] .303 SMLE rifles for musketry training. Uniforms were finally received in December 1914. In March 1915 the battalion began field training by companies at [[Chipping Sodbury]].<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 22\u201331, 40\u201351, 69, 71.</ref><ref>[http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Gloucestershire/TownBristol.htm Bristol at Drill Hall Project.]</ref>\n\nThe locally-raised units to form K5 were assigned to brigades on 10 December 1914: the Bristol Battalion was brigaded with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd [[Birmingham Pals]] (later 14th, 15th and 16th (Service) Battalions, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]). The brigade was\ninitially numbered 116th Brigade in 39th Division, but in April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1\u2013K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 39th Division thus became [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] and 116th Brigade became [[95th Brigade (United Kingdom)|95th Brigade]].<ref name = TrailGlos/><ref>Army Council Instruction No 101 (10 December 1914).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I2</ref><ref name = Becke32>Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21\u201328.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn May 1915 the brigade was to have gathered in [[Shropshire]], but the ground selected at [[Prees Heath Army Camp|Prees Heath]] proved unsuitable for brigade training and on 23 June the 12th Gloucesters left Bristol to join 95th Brigade at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire]]. The two reserve or depot companies joined those of the Birmingham Pals at [[Sutton Coldfield]] to continue training. Brigade training started in earnest at Wensley, and 12th Gloucesters was finally adopted by the WO on 23 June 1915. Previously, most of the shooting had been on miniature ranges with .22 ammunition; now the men began weekly musketry courses (12th Gloucesters at [[Whitburn, Tyne and Wear|Whitburn]]) although many of the rifles were worn and defective. In August 32nd Division gathered on [[Salisbury Plain]] to begin final battle training, with 12th Gloucesters in camp at [[Codford]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 79\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe battalion's strength at this time was about 1550, or more than 50 per cent over establishment; during August a large number of skilled men were transferred to other arms, others went to officer cadet training units, and older or unfit men were sent to the 15th (Reserve) Battalion at Sutton Coldfield into which the depot companies had been absorbed. Now that the battalion was almost ready to go overseas, the 59-year-old Lt-Col Burges was ordered to remain in the UK. He was succeeded in command by Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], a former Regular Army officer who was now [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Finsbury Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury Central]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, pp. 89\u201390, 95.</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOn 11 November 1915 32nd Division was ordered to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 12th Gloucesters landed at [[Boulogne]] on 21 November. By 28 November the division had concentrated round [[Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher]], north of the [[Somme (river)|River Somme]]. For its initiation into trench warfare with experienced units of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], 12th Gloucesters moved into a section of trenches thick with mud at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] on 6 December. A Company was with 1st Bn [[East Surrey Regiment]] for instruction, and B Company with 2nd Bn [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. 95th Brigade was exchanged with a brigade from 5th Division on 26 December as part of a policy to even-up experience levels between formations. The Pals battalions were scattered among 5th Division's brigades; although 12th Gloucesters remained with 95th Brigade, it was now brigaded with three Regular Army battalions that had been fighting since the beginning of the war.<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Grist, pp. 97\u20138.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 95\u2013106.</ref><ref name = Becke5>Becke, Part 1, pp, 65\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg|thumb|right|The high street of Guillemont, captured on 3 September.]]\n===Somme===\n5th Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in mid-February 1916, and 12th Gloucesters took over dry, well-made trenches with deep dug-outs, and lived in cellars in Arras when out of the line.<ref>Grist, p. 100.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 111\u20135.</ref> Steel helmets began to be issued to British troops early in 1916, but there were great shortages: Lt-Col Archer-Shee used his position as an MP and own observations in the trenches to ask embarrassing questions of the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]].<ref name = Daniell227/>\n\nThe battalion's first real taste of offensive warfare came during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The offensive had begun on 1 July, and 5th Division took over part of the line in the Delville Wood sector near [[Longueval]] between 18 and 20 July, where 95th Brigade was to deal with German strongpoints in the orchards. When the commander of 95th Brigade, [[Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)#Historical_rank_of_brigadier_general|Brigadier-General]] C.R. Ballard, was wounded on 20 July, Lt-Col Archer-Shee took temporary command until Brig-Gen Lord Esme Gordon-Lennox arrived to take over.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Marks, pp. 118\u20139.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 106\u20137, 141.</ref> From 23 to 26 July the battalion was in the front line and was heavily shelled, with [[High explosive shell|high explosive]], [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]], suffering many casualties. It went back into Longueval on 28 July, when the line was advanced to 'Duke Street' without opposition, but shelling was heavier than ever. At 15.30 next day 95th Brigade attacked to complete the capture of Longueval in support of the main attack (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). 12th Gloucesters put in two companies on the left of the brigade after a half-hour bombardment, and they successfully advanced the line some {{convert|500|yd|m}} beyond Duke Street. The battalion held these positions until relieved next day.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 140\u20131.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 119\u201327.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, p. 160.</ref>\n[[File:Glosters_at_Guillemont.png|thumb|right|12th Bn Gloucesters' attack at Guillemont, 3 September 1916.]]\nThe phase of the offensive that began on 22 July culminated in the [[Battle of Guillemont]]. The village of [[Guillemont]] had withstood repeated British attacks, but 5th Division made a new attempt on 3 September. The bombardment began at 08.30 and the attack began at 12.00, with the men advancing behind a [[Creeping barrage]] (a recent innovation) moving at {{convert|50|yd|m}} a minute; the men were instructed to keep within {{convert|25|yd|m}} of the bursting shells. However, a flanking position at Falfemont Farm, which should have been captured in the morning, was still in enemy hands and threatened 95th Brigade's advance. The two leading companies of 12th Gloucesters took their first objective, a sunken lane, and found the [[Dugout_(shelter)#World_War_I|dugouts]] beyond to be unoccupied. But then they came under [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from a machine gun off to the right in the Falfemont direction, which caused numerous casualties before A Company eliminated it. At 12.50 the battalion moved on to its second objective, the German line between Wedge Wood and the south of Guillemont village, which was taken without too much trouble. It then moved on at 14.50 to the third objective, a sunken lane running north from Wedge Wood towards [[Ginchy]]. Amidst the devastation of the battlefield C Company mistook Leuze Wood for Wedge Wood, got too far ahead and were caught by their own artillery fire. Although no enemy could be seen at Leuze Wood, the battalion was ordered to halt and consolidate its position rather than push into an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]].<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151>Grist, pp. 151\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 132\u201340.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 252\u20134; Sketch 32.</ref>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Gloucesters moving up in support near Ginchy, 25 September 1916.]]\nThe 12th Gloucesters was now only 300 strong and took no active part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] (18\u201322 September) though the battalion was later awarded it as a [[Battle honour]]. Although the battalion had been told that it would not have to go back into the line, it received a draft of 116 reinforcements and was given a role in 95th Brigade's next attack, the [[Battle of Morval|Morval]] on 25 September. The battalion was in support while 1st Bn [[Devonshire Regiment]] and 1st Bn East Surreys suffered heavy casualties taking the first and second objectives. 12th Gloucesters and 2nd [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] then moved through the village of Morval itself and dug in on the far side. The battalion's casualties were 12 killed and 61 wounded. The next night the battalion was relieved and went into camp in Happy Valley.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151/><re>Marks, pp. 146\u20138.</ref>\n<ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 373\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lt-Col Archer-Shee, of the 950 members of 12th Gloucesters who entered the Battle of the Somme, 736 became casualties.<ref>Marks, p. 149.</ref> After the end of the Somme offensive the battalion continued to do duty in the appalling trenches in the area, alternating with tents in devastated [[Mametz, Somme|Mamez Wood]]. 5th Division moved to the [[B\u00e9thune]] sector in October and spent the next six months in this quieter area. On 22 October Lt-Col Archer-Shee returned to the UK for treatment to an old wound and was succeeded on 20 November by Lt-Col Robert Rawson, a Regular officer of the Gloucesters who had commanded 6th [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] for two years. Rawson also acted as 95th Brigade's commander during the winter. Archer-Shee returned to the battalion in January 1917, but resigned his command on 10 February 1917 to devote himself to his parliamentary duties. Rawson returned from Brigade HQ on 18 March and took over full command.<ref>Grist, pp. 182\u20137.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 150\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n12th Gloucesters was in reserve to the [[Canadian Corps]] for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on 9 April. Then on the night of 4/5 May, as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] continued, 95th Brigade relieved a Canadian Brigade that had captured [[Fresnoy-en-Gohelle|Fresnoy]]. Because of casualties, 12th Gloucesters was reduced to three companies, so it had two companies of 1st [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) under its command in order to hold the wood north of the town. During 7 May the British trenches were heavily bombarded, then that night two successive attacks came in. 12th Gloucesters repulsed the first at 03.45 (which may have been an unplanned clash as the German storm troops moved into position) but the battalion was overwhelmed by the second attack at 05.45, which completely broke through the British lines and recaptured Fresnoy. Rawson sent up D Company DCLI and his own C Company to try to restore the situation, followed later by D Company 12th Gloucesters, but all they could do was hold a sunken lane behind the lost positions until relieved at 10.00. The battalion lost 389 casualties, including 94 dead; A and B Companies had completely disappeared, killed or captured, and there were no officers left in the frontline companies.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 520\u20131.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 188\u201393.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 157\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Ypres===\n[[File:Hill-62-Museum-Tranches-Ypres-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved trenches at [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62]]: when 12th Gloucesters were stationed here it was 'an unimaginably foul and miserable place'. There were no trees left and the battalion was sheltering in shell craters and dugouts.<ref>Grist, p. 213.</ref>]]\nThe battered battalions were slowly built up to strength and trained hard, but 12th Gloucesters did not see major action again until the latter stages of the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres Offensive]]. 5th Division moved into [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps']] area on the night of 2/3 October during the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]], then attacked on 4 October (the [[Battle of Broodseinde]]). Launched at 06.00, 95th Brigade advanced {{convert|500|yd|m}} with the help of a tank to deal with German [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. 12th Gloucesters had been in reserve to the attacking battalion, 1st [[East Surrey Regiment]], and moved three companies up into the Surreys' forming-up trenches 40 minutes after Zero hour, where they suffered badly from the German counter-barrage. Later in the morning C Company was sent up to help 1st [[Devonshire Regiment]]. The following day the battalion held the captured line, under continuing artillery fire. In preparation for the next attack (the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] on 9 October), 12th Gloucesters was in [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62|Sanctuary Wood]], where it was under observation and artillery fire from the enemy and movement was restricted to duckboard tracks. On 8 October the battalion was split, with two companies providing carrying parties and the other two in the support line behind 1st Bn [[Cheshire Regiment]]. When the attack was delivered, the companies in Sanctuary Wood provided carrying and burial parties, while the two in the support line were pinned by artillery and could not be relieved until 10/11 October. Despite not actually attacking itself, 12th Gloucesters lost 359 casualties (150 from gas), of whom 88 died, in the period 1\u201312 October.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 314, 334.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 210\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 167\u201370.</ref>\n\nWhile 5th Division continued to attack (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), 12th Gloucesters remained out of the line after Poelcapelle, resting, absorbing a few reinforcements, and training. It spent two short spells holding the line, suffering only light casualties, and then the whole division was pulled out. At the end of October Lt-Col Rawson left the battalion for a six-month tour of duty in the UK and the second-in-command, Maj H.A. Colt, was promoted to succeed him.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 214.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 170\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nFollowing the Austro-German breakthrough at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the BEF was required to release divisions to reinforce the [[Italian Army]]. On 23 November, 5th Division was warned that it would be moved to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Entrainment began at [[Hesdin]] on 27 November, but after A and C Companies were got away, B and D were held back under orders to move at a moment's notice to the [[Cambrai]] sector, where the German counter-attack following the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] threatened to break through. The fighting died down after 3 December, and the two companies were released. 5th Division completed its concentration to the east of the [[Brenta (river)|River Brenta]], not far from [[Padua]], by 20 December. When 5th Division took over part of the line along the [[Piave (river)|River Piave]] on 27 January 1918 12th Gloucesters relieved an Italian unit, and was ordered to wear Italian helmets to conceal the fact that British troops had taken over. The battalion carried out several fighting patrols against the opposing Hungarian units until 5th Division was relieved on 18 March.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 352, 391.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 222\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 174\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Spring Offensive===\nThe Germans began their [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front on 21 March and achieved rapid successes. On 24 March 5th Division was warned that it would return to France. Entrainment began on 1 April, 12th Gloucesters started on 2 April, and the division completed its concentration between [[Doullens]] and [[Fr\u00e9vent]] on 9 April.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 224, 267.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 181.</ref>\n[[File:British_Lewis_gun_team_Battle_of_Hazebrouck_1918_IWM_Q_10902.jpg|thumb|right|A British Lewis gun team at the Battle of Hazebrouck]]\nThe second phase of the Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette, or the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)|Battle of the Lys]]) had opened on 7 April and 5th Division took up positions from the Lys Canal to the [[Nieppe|Forest of Nieppe]], where it came under immediate attack (the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)#Battle_of_Hazebrouck_(12\u201315_April)|Battle of Hazebrouck]]). On 13 April 12th Gloucesters held off one German attack for the loss of 76 casualties, including 18 killed. By 15 April the battalion was well dug in and held off another attack. The battalion was out of the line from 16 to 21 April, and then carried out an attack of its own on 22 April. Close behind a creeping barrage it captured Le Vert Bois Farm (later renamed 'Gloucester Farm') without serious opposition, but it took all day to take Le Vert Bois itself. The battalion captured three German machine guns and 39 prisoners. The Germans abandoned Operation Georgette a few days later. <ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 267.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 182\u20135.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June the British launched a limited operation to improve their positions along the edge of the Nieppe Forest. 12th Gloucesters was tasked with capturing Le Cornet Perdu, moving up in darkness to attack at 06.00. It took all its objectives by 09.30, and pushed patrols up to the PLate Becq river, though a handful of German machine guns had caused 164 casualties, of whom 45 died.<ref name = Becke5/> <ref>Grist, p. 270.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 186\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Hundred Days Offensive===\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] launched their own [[Hundred Days Offensive]] on 8 August 1918, when 5th Division was in reserve. It then came into action at the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Third Battle of Albert]] on 21 August. This was a three-phase attack, with 5th Division passing through [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division ]] for the second phase. 95th Brigade led, with 12th Gloucesters as its reserve. Once the second objective had been taken, 12th Gloucesters took over and despite having lost the barrage advanced over a mile of open country with some of 1st East Surreys and just reached the Arras\u2013[[Albert, Somme|Albert]] railway before meeting stronger opposition. Mist now hampered the artillery and tanks and the battalion was unable to push beyond the railway to the final objective. It had lost an officer and 11 other ranks killed, and nearly100 wounded. Next day the battalion consolidated, then drove off a German counter-attack at 17.30, capturing 180 prisoners and five machine guns in the process. On 23 August, reinforced by two companies of 1st DCLI, the battalion launched an attack at 11.00 behind a creeping barrage to capture the railway line itself. The Germans had numerous machine gun nests along it and caused numerous casualties before they were overrun. Having lost the barrage, the battalion was unable to advance beyond the ridge to [[Irles]], and requested reinforcements. Before they arrived, the neighbouring brigade attacked, so Lt-Col Colt led a charge by the remainder of 12th Gloucesters and the DCLI companies to capture the village, though losses were heavy: 30 men were killed and nine officers and 170 men wounded, including Lt-Col Colt (who was awarded the DSO). The previous CO, Lt-Col Rawson, returned to command the battalion.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, pp. 191, 229\u201330.</ref><ref name = Grist275>Grist, p. 275.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 189\u201393.</ref> \n\nThe weakened battalion was withdrawn into reserve while the rest of 95th Brigade attacked on 30 August (the [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Battle of the Scarpe]]) and then took over holding part of the front line. 95th Brigade was relieved on 4 September after the conclusion of the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]]. Part of 5th Division went into action at the [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] on 18 September, and  12th Gloucesters later received the battle honour despite not being engaged.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist275/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, p. 363, 493.</ref><ref name = Grist279>Grist, p, 279.</ref>\n\nAll the Allied armies began a rolling offensive all the way along the Western Front on 26 September. The BEF's [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] stormed across the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]] on 27 September, and next morning 5th Division launched a follow-up attack. Because the designated assault brigade ([[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]]) had suffered heavy casualties, 95th Brigade was substituted for it at short notice and only just got to the jumping-off position in time for Zero hour at 02.40. It ran into considerable opposition and 12th Gloucesters found both its flanks were open; 1st DCLI came up on the left later, but the right remained  exposed and isolated German machine gun posts had to be dealt with using [[Rifle grenade|rifle grenades]]. It was not until 08.00 that the first village was taken. The brigade then had to resort to trench warfare methods to work its way up to the second objective on the slopes of Welsh Ridge by evening. 95th Brigade was also hung up when it attacked again next day, finding the pace of the creeping barrage too fast over broken ground. By the time it was relieved on 30 September 12th Gloucesters' casualties amounted to 52, 24 of them fatal, though it had taken about 120 prisoners.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist279/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, pp. 48, 118.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nWhile 5th Division had been in Italy, the BEF's manpower shortage led to infantry brigades being reduced from four to three battalions. 5th Division's brigades had retained the four-battalion establishment, but by late 1918 the shortage of manpower was critical, and the division had to fall in line. As the only New Army battalion in 95th Brigade, 12th Gloucesters was ordered to disband and the remaining men were drafted to other units. 12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, (Bristol's Own) commenced disbandment on 19 October 1918 while the [[Battle of the Selle]] was raging. Most of D Company was posted to 14th Warwicks, which became the divisional pioneer battalion. Others went to 1st Devons and 1st DCLI. The war ended less than a month later when the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, p. 338.</ref><ref name = Marks194>Marks, p. 194.</ref>\n\nDuring its service the battalion had suffered losses of 32 officers and 754 other ranks killed. Of the original 990 men who landed in France in November 1915, 205 had died with the battalion, and over 100 more after being posted to other units.<ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = Marks194/><ref name = DaniellApp>Daniell, Appendix I.</ref>\n\n==15th (Reserve) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment==\n15th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Sutton Coldfield on 31 August 1915 from the depot companies of the 12th (Bristol's Own) and 14th (West of England) Battalions of the Gloucesters. The 14th (Service) Battalion was a '[[Bantam (military)|Bantam]]' battalion that had been raised by the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee on 22 April 1915. It moved to [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Camp]] and joined [[22nd Reserve Brigade]]. The CO from 10 August 1915 to 31 August 1916 was Lt-Col Stephen Willcock. On 1 September 1916 it became 93rd Training Reserve Battalion in 22nd Reserve Bde and on 4 July 1917 it was redesignated 262nd (Infantry) Battalion of the Training Reserve. When the Training Reserve was reorganised in late 1917, the battalion became 51st (Graduated) Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Grist, p. 56.</ref><ref>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/royal-warwickshire-regiment/ Warwicks at Long, Long Trail.]</ref>\n\n==Commanding officers==\nThe following commanded the battalion during its service:<ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, p 152 & Appendix I.</ref>\n* Lt-Col William Burges from 1 September 1914 to 12 August 1915\n* Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]] from 12 August 1915 to 22 October 1916\n* Maj W.A.R.

It saw action at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], before moving the the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. It returned to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to fight in the German [[Spring Offensive]] and the victorious Allied [[Hundred Days Offensive]].\n\n==Recruitment==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien. Alfred Leete (1882\u20131933) Britons (Kitchener) wants you (Briten Kitchener braucht Euch). 1914 (Nachdruck), 74 x 50 cm. (Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.<ref>Army Council Instructions No 32 (6 August) and No 37 (7 August).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Grist53>Grist, p. 53.</ref> A flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into 'Service' battalions of the county regiments. However, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce considered that the city's response was inadequate and formed a Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee under the leadership of the former Lord Mayor, Sir [[Herbert Ashman]], to encourage enlistment. The city's Colston Hall was opened as a recruiting centre on 14 August, and 2274 men enlisted by 2 September. Eighty men calling themselves the Weston Comrades Company also joined from [[Weston-super-Mare]]. It was clear that many of these men wanted to serve together in a special Bristol battalion, similar to other '[[Pals battalion]]s' being formed around the country. The [[War Office]] (WO) gave the committee authority to form the '''Bristol Battalion''', [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], on 30 August. Later in the year it became part of Kitchener's Fifth New Army (K5) and was officially numbered as the '''12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol)''', but the subtitle was usually rendered as 'Bristol's Own'. The recruiting committee encouraged 'mercantile and professional' men to apply, both through reasons of social exclusiveness and with a view to Kitchener's directive that workers in vital industries could not be spared. The first commanding officer (CO) was William Burges, who had retired from command of the 3rd Militia Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment some years before. Several of the other officers appointed had experience in the Regular or Auxiliary forces, and a number of junior officers had been members of their school or university [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>Marks, pp. 8\u201320, 32\u20133, 39.</ref><ref name = Grist54>Grist, pp. 54\u20135.</ref><ref name = Daniell227>Daniell, p. 227.</ref><ref>Army Council Instructions, October 1914, Appendix VIII; December 1914, Appendix III.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 102.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 72.</ref><ref name = TrailGlos>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/gloucestershire-regiment/ Glosters at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = GlosCO>[http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/gloucs.html Glosters at Infantry Battalion COs.]</ref>\n\n==Training==\nThe rush of recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of K5 were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Initially the Bristol men lived at home and drilled by squads at Colston Hall in their civilian clothes, distinguished only by a lapel badge bearing the words 'New Bristol Battalion Gloucestershire Regt'. They then began battalion drills at the Artillery Grounds in [[Whiteladies Road]], the headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|I South Midland (Gloucestershire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery]] of the [[Territorial Force]]. But in late September the recruiting committee persuaded the WO to buy up the site of the abandoned Bristol International Exhibition in Greville Smyth Park, the buildings of which were converted into barracks by the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Army Service Corps]]. The 'Weston Comrades' joined the rest of the battalion here in November and were posted to D Company. Some of the battalion's best men were already being posted away, for officer training for example, and on 30 November the WO authorised the recruiting committee to raise a fifth, reserve company (E Company); F Company was raised as a further reserve in April 1915. Old rifles had been issued to the battalion for drill purposes, with just a few modern [[Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]] .303 SMLE rifles for musketry training. Uniforms were finally received in December 1914. In March 1915 the battalion began field training by companies at [[Chipping Sodbury]].<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 22\u201331, 40\u201351, 69, 71.</ref><ref>[http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Gloucestershire/TownBristol.htm Bristol at Drill Hall Project.]</ref>\n\nThe locally-raised units to form K5 were assigned to brigades on 10 December 1914: the Bristol Battalion was brigaded with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd [[Birmingham Pals]] (later 14th, 15th and 16th (Service) Battalions, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]). The brigade was\ninitially numbered 116th Brigade in 39th Division, but in April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1\u2013K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 39th Division thus became [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] and 116th Brigade became [[95th Brigade (United Kingdom)|95th Brigade]].<ref name = TrailGlos/><ref>Army Council Instruction No 101 (10 December 1914).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I2</ref><ref name = Becke32>Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21\u201328.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn May 1915 the brigade was to have gathered in [[Shropshire]], but the ground selected at [[Prees Heath Army Camp|Prees Heath]] proved unsuitable for brigade training and on 23 June the 12th Gloucesters left Bristol to join 95th Brigade at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire]]. The two reserve or depot companies joined those of the Birmingham Pals at [[Sutton Coldfield]] to continue training. Brigade training started in earnest at Wensley, and 12th Gloucesters was finally adopted by the WO on 23 June 1915. Previously, most of the shooting had been on miniature ranges with .22 ammunition; now the men began weekly musketry courses (12th Gloucesters at [[Whitburn, Tyne and Wear|Whitburn]]) although many of the rifles were worn and defective. In August 32nd Division gathered on [[Salisbury Plain]] to begin final battle training, with 12th Gloucesters in camp at [[Codford]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 79\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe battalion's strength at this time was about 1550, or more than 50 per cent over establishment; during August a large number of skilled men were transferred to other arms, others went to officer cadet training units, and older or unfit men were sent to the 15th (Reserve) Battalion at Sutton Coldfield into which the depot companies had been absorbed. Now that the battalion was almost ready to go overseas, the 59-year-old Lt-Col Burges was ordered to remain in the UK. He was succeeded in command by Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], a former Regular Army officer who was now [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Finsbury Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury Central]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, pp. 89\u201390, 95.</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOn 11 November 1915 32nd Division was ordered to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 12th Gloucesters landed at [[Boulogne]] on 21 November. By 28 November the division had concentrated round [[Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher]], north of the [[Somme (river)|River Somme]]. For its initiation into trench warfare with experienced units of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], 12th Gloucesters moved into a section of trenches thick with mud at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] on 6 December. A Company was with 1st Bn [[East Surrey Regiment]] for instruction, and B Company with 2nd Bn [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. 95th Brigade was exchanged with a brigade from 5th Division on 26 December as part of a policy to even-up experience levels between formations. The Pals battalions were scattered among 5th Division's brigades; although 12th Gloucesters remained with 95th Brigade, it was now brigaded with three Regular Army battalions that had been fighting since the beginning of the war.<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Grist, pp. 97\u20138.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 95\u2013106.</ref><ref name = Becke5>Becke, Part 1, pp, 65\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg|thumb|right|The high street of Guillemont, captured on 3 September.]]\n===Somme===\n5th Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in mid-February 1916, and 12th Gloucesters took over dry, well-made trenches with deep dug-outs, and lived in cellars in Arras when out of the line.<ref>Grist, p. 100.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 111\u20135.</ref> Steel helmets began to be issued to British troops early in 1916, but there were great shortages: Lt-Col Archer-Shee used his position as an MP and own observations in the trenches to ask embarrassing questions of the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]].<ref name = Daniell227/>\n\nThe battalion's first real taste of offensive warfare came during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The offensive had begun on 1 July, and 5th Division took over part of the line in the Delville Wood sector near [[Longueval]] between 18 and 20 July, where 95th Brigade was to deal with German strongpoints in the orchards. When the commander of 95th Brigade, [[Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)#Historical_rank_of_brigadier_general|Brigadier-General]] C.R. Ballard, was wounded on 20 July, Lt-Col Archer-Shee took temporary command until Brig-Gen Lord Esme Gordon-Lennox arrived to take over.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Marks, pp. 118\u20139.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 106\u20137, 141.</ref> From 23 to 26 July the battalion was in the front line and was heavily shelled, with [[High explosive shell|high explosive]], [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]], suffering many casualties. It went back into Longueval on 28 July, when the line was advanced to 'Duke Street' without opposition, but shelling was heavier than ever. At 15.30 next day 95th Brigade attacked to complete the capture of Longueval in support of the main attack (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). 12th Gloucesters put in two companies on the left of the brigade after a half-hour bombardment, and they successfully advanced the line some {{convert|500|yd|m}} beyond Duke Street. The battalion held these positions until relieved next day.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 140\u20131.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 119\u201327.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, p. 160.</ref>\n[[File:Glosters_at_Guillemont.png|thumb|right|12th Bn Gloucesters' attack at Guillemont, 3 September 1916.]]\nThe phase of the offensive that began on 22 July culminated in the [[Battle of Guillemont]]. The village of [[Guillemont]] had withstood repeated British attacks, but 5th Division made a new attempt on 3 September. The bombardment began at 08.30 and the attack began at 12.00, with the men advancing behind a [[Creeping barrage]] (a recent innovation) moving at {{convert|50|yd|m}} a minute; the men were instructed to keep within {{convert|25|yd|m}} of the bursting shells. However, a flanking position at Falfemont Farm, which should have been captured in the morning, was still in enemy hands and threatened 95th Brigade's advance. The two leading companies of 12th Gloucesters took their first objective, a sunken lane, and found the [[Dugout_(shelter)#World_War_I|dugouts]] beyond to be unoccupied. But then they came under [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from a machine gun off to the right in the Falfemont direction, which caused numerous casualties before A Company eliminated it. At 12.50 the battalion moved on to its second objective, the German line between Wedge Wood and the south of Guillemont village, which was taken without too much trouble. It then moved on at 14.50 to the third objective, a sunken lane running north from Wedge Wood towards [[Ginchy]]. Amidst the devastation of the battlefield C Company mistook Leuze Wood for Wedge Wood, got too far ahead and were caught by their own artillery fire. Although no enemy could be seen at Leuze Wood, the battalion was ordered to halt and consolidate its position rather than push into an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]].<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151>Grist, pp. 151\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 132\u201340.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 252\u20134; Sketch 32.</ref>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Gloucesters moving up in support near Ginchy, 25 September 1916.]]\nThe 12th Gloucesters was now only 300 strong and took no active part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] (18\u201322 September) though the battalion was later awarded it as a [[Battle honour]]. Although the battalion had been told that it would not have to go back into the line, it received a draft of 116 reinforcements and was given a role in 95th Brigade's next attack, the [[Battle of Morval|Morval]] on 25 September. The battalion was in support while 1st Bn [[Devonshire Regiment]] and 1st Bn East Surreys suffered heavy casualties taking the first and second objectives. 12th Gloucesters and 2nd [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] then moved through the village of Morval itself and dug in on the far side. The battalion's casualties were 12 killed and 61 wounded. The next night the battalion was relieved and went into camp in Happy Valley.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151/><re>Marks, pp. 146\u20138.</ref>\n<ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 373\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lt-Col Archer-Shee, of the 950 members of 12th Gloucesters who entered the Battle of the Somme, 736 became casualties.<ref>Marks, p. 149.</ref> After the end of the Somme offensive the battalion continued to do duty in the appalling trenches in the area, alternating with tents in devastated [[Mametz, Somme|Mamez Wood]]. 5th Division moved to the [[B\u00e9thune]] sector in October and spent the next six months in this quieter area. On 22 October Lt-Col Archer-Shee returned to the UK for treatment to an old wound and was succeeded on 20 November by Lt-Col Robert Rawson, a Regular officer of the Gloucesters who had commanded 6th [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] for two years. Rawson also acted as 95th Brigade's commander during the winter. Archer-Shee returned to the battalion in January 1917, but resigned his command on 10 February 1917 to devote himself to his parliamentary duties. Rawson returned from Brigade HQ on 18 March and took over full command.<ref>Grist, pp. 182\u20137.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 150\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n12th Gloucesters was in reserve to the [[Canadian Corps]] for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on 9 April. Then on the night of 4/5 May, as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] continued, 95th Brigade relieved a Canadian Brigade that had captured [[Fresnoy-en-Gohelle|Fresnoy]]. Because of casualties, 12th Gloucesters was reduced to three companies, so it had two companies of 1st [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) under its command in order to hold the wood north of the town. During 7 May the British trenches were heavily bombarded, then that night two successive attacks came in. 12th Gloucesters repulsed the first at 03.45 (which may have been an unplanned clash as the German storm troops moved into position) but the battalion was overwhelmed by the second attack at 05.45, which completely broke through the British lines and recaptured Fresnoy. Rawson sent up D Company DCLI and his own C Company to try to restore the situation, followed later by D Company 12th Gloucesters, but all they could do was hold a sunken lane behind the lost positions until relieved at 10.00. The battalion lost 389 casualties, including 94 dead; A and B Companies had completely disappeared, killed or captured, and there were no officers left in the frontline companies.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 520\u20131.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 188\u201393.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 157\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Ypres===\n[[File:Hill-62-Museum-Tranches-Ypres-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved trenches at [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62]]: when 12th Gloucesters were stationed here it was 'an unimaginably foul and miserable place'.

Launched at 06.00, 95th Brigade advanced {{convert|500|yd|m}} with the help of a tank to deal with German [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. 12th Gloucesters had been in reserve to the attacking battalion, 1st [[East Surrey Regiment]], and moved three companies up into the Surreys' forming-up trenches 40 minutes after Zero hour, where they suffered badly from the German counter-barrage. Later in the morning C Company was sent up to help 1st [[Devonshire Regiment]]. The following day the battalion held the captured line, under continuing artillery fire. In preparation for the next attack (the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] on 9 October), 12th Gloucesters was in [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62|Sanctuary Wood]], where it was under observation and artillery fire from the enemy and movement was restricted to duckboard tracks. On 8 October the battalion was split, with two companies providing carrying parties and the other two in the support line behind 1st Bn [[Cheshire Regiment]]. When the attack was delivered, the companies in Sanctuary Wood provided carrying and burial parties, while the two in the support line were pinned by artillery and could not be relieved until 10/11 October. Despite not actually attacking itself, 12th Gloucesters lost 359 casualties (150 from gas), of whom 88 died, in the period 1\u201312 October.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 314, 334.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 210\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 167\u201370.</ref>\n\nWhile 5th Division continued to attack (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), 12th Gloucesters remained out of the line after Poelcapelle, resting, absorbing a few reinforcements, and training. It spent two short spells holding the line, suffering only light casualties, and then the whole division was pulled out. At the end of October Lt-Col Rawson left the battalion for a six-month tour of duty in the UK and the second-in-command, Maj H.A. Colt, was promoted to succeed him.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 214.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 170\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nFollowing the Austro-German breakthrough at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the BEF was required to release divisions to reinforce the [[Italian Army]]. On 23 November, 5th Division was warned that it would be moved to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Entrainment began at [[Hesdin]] on 27 November, but after A and C Companies were got away, B and D were held back under orders to move at a moment's notice to the [[Cambrai]] sector, where the German counter-attack following the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] threatened to break through. The fighting died down after 3 December, and the two companies were released. 5th Division completed its concentration to the east of the [[Brenta (river)|River Brenta]], not far from [[Padua]], by 20 December. When 5th Division took over part of the line along the [[Piave (river)|River Piave]] on 27 January 1918 12th Gloucesters relieved an Italian unit, and was ordered to wear Italian helmets to conceal the fact that British troops had taken over. The battalion carried out several fighting patrols against the opposing Hungarian units until 5th Division was relieved on 18 March.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 352, 391.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 222\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 174\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Spring Offensive===\nThe Germans began their [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front on 21 March and achieved rapid successes. On 24 March 5th Division was warned that it would return to France. Entrainment began on 1 April, 12th Gloucesters started on 2 April, and the division completed its concentration between [[Doullens]] and [[Fr\u00e9vent]] on 9 April.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 224, 267.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 181.</ref>\n[[File:British_Lewis_gun_team_Battle_of_Hazebrouck_1918_IWM_Q_10902.jpg|thumb|right|A British Lewis gun team at the Battle of Hazebrouck]]\nThe second phase of the Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette, or the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)|Battle of the Lys]]) had opened on 7 April and 5th Division took up positions from the Lys Canal to the [[Nieppe|Forest of Nieppe]], where it came under immediate attack (the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)#Battle_of_Hazebrouck_(12\u201315_April)|Battle of Hazebrouck]]). On 13 April 12th Gloucesters held off one German attack for the loss of 76 casualties, including 18 killed. By 15 April the battalion was well dug in and held off another attack. The battalion was out of the line from 16 to 21 April, and then carried out an attack of its own on 22 April. Close behind a creeping barrage it captured Le Vert Bois Farm (later renamed 'Gloucester Farm') without serious opposition, but it took all day to take Le Vert Bois itself. The battalion captured three German machine guns and 39 prisoners. The Germans abandoned Operation Georgette a few days later. <ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 267.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 182\u20135.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June the British launched a limited operation to improve their positions along the edge of the Nieppe Forest. 12th Gloucesters was tasked with capturing Le Cornet Perdu, moving up in darkness to attack at 06.00. It took all its objectives by 09.30, and pushed patrols up to the PLate Becq river, though a handful of German machine guns had caused 164 casualties, of whom 45 died.<ref name = Becke5/> <ref>Grist, p. 270.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 186\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Hundred Days Offensive===\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] launched their own [[Hundred Days Offensive]] on 8 August 1918, when 5th Division was in reserve. It then came into action at the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Third Battle of Albert]] on 21 August. This was a three-phase attack, with 5th Division passing through [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division ]] for the second phase. 95th Brigade led, with 12th Gloucesters as its reserve. Once the second objective had been taken, 12th Gloucesters took over and despite having lost the barrage advanced over a mile of open country with some of 1st East Surreys and just reached the Arras\u2013[[Albert, Somme|Albert]] railway before meeting stronger opposition. Mist now hampered the artillery and tanks and the battalion was unable to push beyond the railway to the final objective. It had lost an officer and 11 other ranks killed, and nearly100 wounded. Next day the battalion consolidated, then drove off a German counter-attack at 17.30, capturing 180 prisoners and five machine guns in the process. On 23 August, reinforced by two companies of 1st DCLI, the battalion launched an attack at 11.00 behind a creeping barrage to capture the railway line itself. The Germans had numerous machine gun nests along it and caused numerous casualties before they were overrun. Having lost the barrage, the battalion was unable to advance beyond the ridge to [[Irles]], and requested reinforcements. Before they arrived, the neighbouring brigade attacked, so Lt-Col Colt led a charge by the remainder of 12th Gloucesters and the DCLI companies to capture the village, though losses were heavy: 30 men were killed and nine officers and 170 men wounded, including Lt-Col Colt (who was awarded the DSO). The previous CO, Lt-Col Rawson, returned to command the battalion.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, pp. 191, 229\u201330.</ref><ref name = Grist275>Grist, p. 275.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 189\u201393.</ref> \n\nThe weakened battalion was withdrawn into reserve while the rest of 95th Brigade attacked on 30 August (the [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Battle of the Scarpe]]) and then took over holding part of the front line. 95th Brigade was relieved on 4 September after the conclusion of the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]]. Part of 5th Division went into action at the [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] on 18 September, and  12th Gloucesters later received the battle honour despite not being engaged.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist275/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, p. 363, 493.</ref><ref name = Grist279>Grist, p, 279.</ref>\n\nAll the Allied armies began a rolling offensive all the way along the Western Front on 26 September. The BEF's [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] stormed across the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]] on 27 September, and next morning 5th Division launched a follow-up attack. Because the designated assault brigade ([[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]]) had suffered heavy casualties, 95th Brigade was substituted for it at short notice and only just got to the jumping-off position in time for Zero hour at 02.40. It ran into considerable opposition and 12th Gloucesters found both its flanks were open; 1st DCLI came up on the left later, but the right remained  exposed and isolated German machine gun posts had to be dealt with using [[Rifle grenade|rifle grenades]]. It was not until 08.00 that the first village was taken. The brigade then had to resort to trench warfare methods to work its way up to the second objective on the slopes of Welsh Ridge by evening. 95th Brigade was also hung up when it attacked again next day, finding the pace of the creeping barrage too fast over broken ground. By the time it was relieved on 30 September 12th Gloucesters' casualties amounted to 52, 24 of them fatal, though it had taken about 120 prisoners.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist279/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, pp. 48, 118.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nWhile 5th Division had been in Italy, the BEF's manpower shortage led to infantry brigades being reduced from four to three battalions. 5th Division's brigades had retained the four-battalion establishment, but by late 1918 the shortage of manpower was critical, and the division had to fall in line. As the only New Army battalion in 95th Brigade, 12th Gloucesters was ordered to disband and the remaining men were drafted to other units. 12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, (Bristol's Own) commenced disbandment on 19 October 1918 while the [[Battle of the Selle]] was raging. Most of D Company was posted to 14th Warwicks, which became the divisional pioneer battalion. Others went to 1st Devons and 1st DCLI. The war ended less than a month later when the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, p. 338.</ref><ref name = Marks194>Marks, p. 194.</ref>\n\nDuring its service the battalion had suffered losses of 32 officers and 754 other ranks killed. Of the original 990 men who landed in France in November 1915, 205 had died with the battalion, and over 100 more after being posted to other units.<ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = Marks194/><ref name = DaniellApp>Daniell, Appendix I.</ref>\n\n==15th (Reserve) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment==\n15th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Sutton Coldfield on 31 August 1915 from the depot companies of the 12th (Bristol's Own) and 14th (West of England) Battalions of the Gloucesters. The 14th (Service) Battalion was a '[[Bantam (military)|Bantam]]' battalion that had been raised by the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee on 22 April 1915. It moved to [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Camp]] and joined [[22nd Reserve Brigade]]. The CO from 10 August 1915 to 31 August 1916 was Lt-Col Stephen Willcock. On 1 September 1916 it became 93rd Training Reserve Battalion in 22nd Reserve Bde and on 4 July 1917 it was redesignated 262nd (Infantry) Battalion of the Training Reserve. When the Training Reserve was reorganised in late 1917, the battalion became 51st (Graduated) Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Grist, p. 56.</ref><ref>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/royal-warwickshire-regiment/ Warwicks at Long, Long Trail.]</ref>\n\n==Commanding officers==\nThe following commanded the battalion during its service:<ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, p 152 & Appendix I.</ref>\n* Lt-Col William Burges from 1 September 1914 to 12 August 1915\n* Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]] from 12 August 1915 to 22 October 1916\n* Maj W.A.R.

Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as \"hot air\". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.<ref>See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, ''The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, political scientist Peter&nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.<ref>Smith, Peter J. 1987. \"The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation\". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a \"liberal order\" in northern North America.<ref>Mckay, I. 2000. \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617\u2013645.</ref> Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.<ref>Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Constant. ''Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2008. \"Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation\". ''The Canadian Historical Review''. 89, no. 1: 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, political scientist [[Janet Ajzenstat]] connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.<ref>Ajzenstat, Janet.

Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=83}}\n\nNo minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and John A.

At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another. [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}}\n\nGeorge Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be \"amazingly civilized\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\nReaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. \"From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet.\"<ref>Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Quebec Conference===\n{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}\nAfter returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A.

Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=98}} For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}} For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}}\n\nOn the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible. With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the other three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=100}} It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}} It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government\u2014federal or provincial\u2014that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined. Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted this was to be the central government, and in this, he was supported by, among others, Tupper.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=105}}\n\nAt the end of the Conference, it adopted the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.\n\nPrince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference. It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 it felt had been offered at Charlottetown to assist in [[Land Purchase Act (1875)|buying out the holdings of absentee landlords]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=107}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\n\"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation\" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S.

Therefore, a [[Great Coalition]] of parties formed in order to reform the political system.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=44}}\n\n===Influences leading to Confederation===\nSeveral factors influenced Confederation, both caused from internal sources and pressures from external sources.{{sfn|Martin|1995|pp=23-57}}<ref name=\"Martin1990\">{{cite book |first=Ged |last=Martin |title=The Causes of Canadian confederation |pages=[https://archive.org/details/causesofcanadian0000unse/page/12 12\u201324] |year=1990 |publisher=Acadiensis Press |isbn=978-0-919107-25-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/causesofcanadian0000unse/page/12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Smith |title=British Businessmen and Canadian Confederation Constitution-Making in an Era of Anglo-Globalization |location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=2008}}</ref>\n;Internal causes that influenced Confederation:\n* political deadlock resulting from the current political structure\n* demographic pressure (population expansion)\n* economic nationalism and the promise of economic development\n* an inter-colony railroad which would improve trade, military movement, and transportation in general <ref>The Intercolonial Railway, ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=4</ref>\n\n;External pressures that influenced Confederation:\n* cancellation of the [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] (a free trade policy whereby products were allowed into the United States without taxes or tariffs starting in 1854, which was then considered to be beneficial for Canada), in 1865 by the United States, partly as a revenge against Great Britain for unofficial support of the South in the American Civil War\n* the U.S. doctrine of \"[[manifest destiny]]\", the possible threat of invasion from the U.S.\u2014Canadians had fended off American invasions during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812\u2014increased by the [[Alaska Purchase]] of March 30, 1867, which was supported on the floor of the U.S. Senate (by Charles Sumner, among others) precisely in terms of taking over the remainder of North America from the British\n* the [[American Civil War]], which horrified Canadians and drove many away from any thought of republicanism, along with British actions during the war, and American reactions to Canada<ref>The American Dimension, ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=3</ref>\n* the [[Fenian raids]]\n* the [[Little Englander]] philosophy, whereby Britain no longer wanted to maintain troops in its colonies.\n* political pressure from British financiers who had invested money in the loss-making [[Grand Trunk Railway]]\n* The [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]\n\n===Ideological origins and philosophical dimensions===\n[[File:Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Confederation 1867.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Canadian Confederation, 1867.]]\nThere is extensive scholarly debate on the role of political ideas in Canadian Confederation. Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as \"hot air\". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.<ref>See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, ''The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, political scientist Peter&nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.<ref>Smith, Peter J. 1987. \"The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation\". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a \"liberal order\" in northern North America.<ref>Mckay, I. 2000. \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617\u2013645.</ref> Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.<ref>Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Constant. ''Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2008. \"Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation\". ''The Canadian Historical Review''. 89, no. 1: 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, political scientist [[Janet Ajzenstat]] connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.<ref>Ajzenstat, Janet.

Macdonald]] surprised the Atlantic premiers by asking if the Province of Canada could be included in the negotiations. The request was channelled through the Governor-General, Monck, to London and accepted by the Colonial Office.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008}} After several years of legislative paralysis in the Province of Canada caused by the need to maintain a double legislative majority (a majority of both the Canada East and Canada West delegates in the Province of Canada's legislature), Macdonald had led his [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] into the [[Great Coalition]] with [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]]'s [[Parti bleu]] and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]'s [[Clear Grits]].{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}} Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown felt union with the other British colonies might be a way to solve the political problems of the Province of Canada.{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}}\n\nThe [[Charlottetown Conference]] began on September 1, 1864. Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=83}}\n\nNo minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald presented arguments in favour of a union of the three colonies;{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=304}} [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]] presented the Province of Canada's proposals on the financial arrangements of such a union;{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=304}} and George Brown presented a proposal for what form a united government might take.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=87}} The Canadian delegation's proposal for the governmental system involved:\n# preservation of ties with Great Britain;\n# residual jurisdiction left to a central authority;\n# a bicameral system including a Lower House with representation by population (rep by pop) and an Upper House with representation based on regional, rather than provincial, equality;\n# responsible government at the federal and provincial levels;\n# the appointment of a [[Governor General of Canada|Canadian governor general]] by the [[British Crown]].\n\nOther proposals attractive to the politicians from the Maritime colonies were:\n# assumption of provincial debt by the central government;{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=85}}\n# revenues from the central government apportioned to the provinces on the basis of population;{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=85}}\n# the building of an intercolonial railway to link Montreal and Halifax, giving Canada access to an ice-free winter port and the Maritimes easy access to Canada and [[Rupert's Land]].{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=307}}\n\nBy September 7, 1864, the delegates from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island gave a positive answer to the Canadian delegation, expressing the view the federation of all of the provinces was considered desirable if the terms of union could be made satisfactory{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}} and the question of Maritime Union was waived.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=87}}\n\nAfter the Conference adjourned on September 9, there were further meetings between delegates held at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], and [[Fredericton]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=88}}{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}} These meetings evinced enough interest that the delegates decided to hold a second Conference.\n[[File:ThomasDArcyMcGee.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868]]\n\n====Delegates' reactions====\nOne of the most important purposes of the Charlottetown Conference was the introduction of Canadians to the leaders from the Maritime Provinces and vice versa. At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another. [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}}\n\nGeorge Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be \"amazingly civilized\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\nReaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. \"From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet.\"<ref>Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Quebec Conference===\n{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}\nAfter returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A. Macdonald asked [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Viscount Monck]], the [[Governor-General of the Province of Canada]] to invite delegates from the three Maritime provinces and Newfoundland to a conference with United Canada delegates. Monck obliged and the Conference went ahead at [[Quebec City]] in October 1864.\n\n[[File:QuebecConvention1864.jpg|thumb|left|Delegates at the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], October 1864]]\n\nThe Conference began on October 10, 1864, on the site of present-day Montmorency Park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |title=Quebec 2008 (400th Anniversary website), Government of Canada |publisher=Quebec400.gc.ca |date=November 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011800/http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |archivedate=May 6, 2012}}</ref> The Conference elected [[\u00c9tienne-Paschal Tach\u00e9]] as its chairman, but it was dominated by Macdonald. Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=98}} For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}} For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}}\n\nOn the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible. With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the other three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=100}} It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}} It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government\u2014federal or provincial\u2014that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined. Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted this was to be the central government, and in this, he was supported by, among others, Tupper.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=105}}\n\nAt the end of the Conference, it adopted the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.\n\nPrince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference. It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 it felt had been offered at Charlottetown to assist in [[Land Purchase Act (1875)|buying out the holdings of absentee landlords]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=107}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\n\"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation\" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S. E. Dawson and reprinted in a Quebec City newspaper during the Conference.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nAgain, reaction to the Quebec Conference varied depending on the political views of the critic.\n\n==== Constitutional scheme discussed in London====\nGeorge Brown was the first to carry the constitutional proposals to the British Government in London in December 1864, where it gave \"a most gracious answer to our constitutional scheme.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mackenzie |first=Alexander |title=The Life and Speeches of Hon.

The union proved more controversial in the Maritime provinces, however, and it was not until 1866 that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed union resolutions, while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland continued to opt against joining.\n\nIn December 1866, sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia travelled to London, where the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|4th Earl of Carnarvon]] presented each to [[Queen Victoria]] in private [[audience (meeting)|audience]],<ref name=\"Lady Carnarvon\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/a-constitutional-walk-for-canada-day/ |title=A Constitutional Walk for Canada Day |date=2017-06-30 |work=Lady Carnarvon |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref> as well as holding court for their wives and daughters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bousfield|1991|p=16}}</ref> At meetings held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, the delegates reviewed and approved the 72 resolutions; although Charles Tupper had promised anti-union forces in Nova Scotia he would push for amendments, he was unsuccessful in getting any passed. Now known as the ''London Resolutions'', the conference's decisions were forwarded to the [[Colonial Office]].\n\nAfter breaking for Christmas, the delegates reconvened in January 1867 and began drafting the ''[[British North America Act (1867)|British North America Act]].'' The 4th Earl of Carnarvon continued to have a central role in drafting the act at [[Highclere Castle]] alongside the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A.

July 1 is now celebrated as a [[public holiday]], [[Canada Day]], the country's official [[National Day]].\n\nThe form of the country's government was influenced by the American republic to the south. Noting the flaws perceived in the American system, the Fathers of Confederation opted to retain a monarchical form of government. [[John A.
