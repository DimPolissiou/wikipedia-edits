Cohen used the term \"moral panic\" to characterize the reactions of the media, the public, and agents of social control to youth disturbances.<ref name=cohen/> This work, involving the [[Mods and rockers|Mods and Rockers]], demonstrated how agents of social control amplified deviance. According to Cohen, these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself, hence the term \"folk devils\".<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Donna |last1=Killingbeck |year=2001 |title=The role of television news in the construction of school violence as a 'moral panic' |journal=Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=186\u2013202 |url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is3/killingbeck.html }}</ref>\n\nIn a more recent edition of ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics,'' Cohen suggested that the term \"panic\" in itself connotes irrationality and a lack of control. Cohen maintained that \"panic\" is a suitable term when used as an extended metaphor.<ref name=cohen/>\n\n==Mass media==\nThe concept of \"moral panic\" has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media.<ref name=cohen/> Cohen stated that the mass media is the primary source of the public's knowledge about deviance and social problems.

According to Goode and Ben-Yehuda, moral panic consists of the following characteristics:<ref name=Goode/>\n* Concern \u2013 There must be the belief that the behavior of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society.\n* Hostility \u2013 Hostility toward the group in question increases, and they become \"folk devils\". A clear division forms between [[In-group and out-group|\"them\" and \"us\"]].\n* Consensus \u2013 Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the \"moral entrepreneurs\" are vocal and the \"folk devils\" appear weak and disorganized.\n* Disproportionality \u2013 The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.\n* Volatility \u2013 Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.<ref name = Jones/>\n\nWriting about the [[Blue Whale Challenge]] and the [[Momo Challenge]] as examples of moral panics, Benjamin Radford listed themes he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena:\n*Hidden dangers of modern technology.\n*Evil stranger manipulating the innocent.\n*A \u201chidden world\u201d of anonymous evil people.<ref name=BR>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|title=The 'Momo Challenge' and the 'Blue Whale Game': Online Suicide Game Conspiracies|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|date=27 February 2019|website=Skeptical Inquirer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228170347/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|archive-date=28 February 2019|url-status=live|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!-- Note: Please do not make NEW ADDITIONS to this section unless you have a reference that cites the incident or phenomenon as an EXAMPLE OF A MORAL PANIC. -->\n=== 1840s-1860s: Nativist movement and the Know-Nothing Party ===\n{{Main|Nativism (politics)|The Know-Nothing Party}}\nThis example reflects the fear of immigrants which emerged in the United States  during the 1840s and 1850s. A short-lived national [[Know Nothing|The Know-Nothing Party]] embodied the Moral Panic Theory, focusing upon Catholic immigrants and labelling them as members of an \"out-group\".

The widespread concern regarding the perceive social threat is exhibited by the showing of the Know Nothing Party in the [[Presidential election of 1856|Presidential Election of 1856]], where they won 21.5% of the total vote share. It is important to note the quick decline in political success for the Know Nothing Party as a result of a decline in concern for the perceived social threat, an indicative feature of the movements situated in Moral Panic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Downs|first=A.|date=1972|title=Up with Ecology and Down with Ecology: The 'Issue Attention' Cycle|url=|journal=The Public Interest|volume=28|issue=38\u201350}}</ref>\n\n===20th\u201321st century: public health===\nThe fear of disease (or fear of threats to [[public health]]) and spread of panic dates back many centuries and continues into the 21st century with diseases such as [[AIDS]]. Cohen's idea of the \"folk devil\"<ref name=cohen/> and epidemics may be synonymous in their role in spreading mass panic and fear. Prior to the 20th century, an intense concentration on hygiene emerged with a medical belief referred to as [[miasma theory]], which stated that disease was the direct result of the polluting emanations of filth: sewer gas, garbage fumes, and stenches that polluted air and water, which results in an epidemic. The [[Great Stink]] of 1858 was blamed on miasma, along with reoccurring [[cholera]] epidemics during the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=Stephen|date=22 December 2001|title=Death and miasma in Victorian London: an obstinate belief|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=323|issue=7327|pages=1469\u20131471|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1121911|pmid=11751359|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1469}}</ref> Although the water was safe to drink in most parts of London, such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== 1919\u20131920, late 1940s, and 1950s: Communism ===\n{{Main|First Red Scare|Second Red Scare}}\nDuring the year 1919, the year 1920, the late 1940s, and the 1950s, the United States had a moral panic over communism and feared being attacked by the [[Soviet Union]]. In the late 1940s and the 1950s, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] led a witch hunt against communists called [[McCarthyism]], where people were accused of being communists.\n\n=== 1920s\u2013present: \"The Devil's music\" ===\n''This section of this page is in need of updating.''\n\nOver the years, there has been concern of various types of new music, often called \"the devil's music\", causing spiritual or otherwise moral corruption to younger generations. While the types of music mainly labeled \"the devil's music\" has changed, along with the nature of the accusations, this basic factor of the moral panic has remained constant. It could thus be argued that this is really a series of smaller moral panics that fall under a larger umbrella. While most notable in the United States, other countries such as [[Romania]]<ref>http://fto.ro/altarul-reintregirii/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2016_3_18.-Nechita-307-323.pdf</ref> have seen exposure to or promotion of the idea as well.\n\n[[Blues]] was one of the first music genres to receive this label, mainly due to a perception that it incited violence and other poor behavior.<ref>SFGate</ref> In the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s.\n\n[[Jazz]] was another early receiver of the label. At the time, traditionalists considered jazz to contribute to the breakdown of morality.<ref>Paula S. Fass, ''The Damned and the Beautiful: American Youth in the 1920s'' (1977), p. 22.</ref> Despite the veiled attacks on Blues and Jazz as \"negro music\" often going hand-in-hand with other attacks on the genres, urban middle-class African Americans perceived jazz as \"devil's music\", and agreed with the beliefs that Jazz's improvised rhythms and sounds were promoting promiscuity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dinerstein|first=Joel|title=Music, Memory, and Cultural Identity in the Jazz Age|journal=American Quarterly|volume=55|issue=2|year=2003|pages=303\u2013313|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0012}}</ref> At this stage, the idea of a link between music and [[Theistic Satanism|Satanism as a religion]] was not a major component in the accusations of blues, jazz, or other genres of music. ([[LaVeyan Satanism]] and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 60's, and \"devil's music\" moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction.)\n\nOne of the most cited types of evidence today is [[Backmasking]], which was used to popularize the idea of music being directly associated in particular with satanism as a religion, rather than generalized moral depravity. The idea of backmasking began to enter the public discussion with the [[Paul is Dead]] rumor, which popularized the idea that messages recorded backwards in music contained messages by or about the artist, the focus of the topic would change in the 1970s: then, religious leaders in the United States began to claim that backmasking in music of the time, particularly [[Rock music]], glorified and promoted Satanism through ways that could be accepted subconsciously, a rumor boosted by the film [[The Exorcist]], where satanic backmasking was a plot point. This eventually lead to the proposal in 1983 of bills in California and Arkansas. Some have speculated that this and other moral panics, particularly in the 70's and early 80's, contributed to the popularity of the [[satanic ritual abuse]] moral panic.<ref>https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13413864/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-explained</ref>\n\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, the term has been closely associated with [[heavy metal music]] through falsifiable concepts like backmasking, as well as overt content of some major acts in the genre. However, there are a number of people who still subscribe to other definitions of \"devil music\" as described above.\n\n=== 1950s: Switchblades ===\n\n{{Main|Switchblade}}\n\nIn the United States, a 1950 article titled \"The Toy That Kills\" in the ''Women's Home Companion'',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pollack, Jack H., ''The Toy That Kills'', 77 Women's Home Companion Magazine 38, November 1950</ref> about automatic knives, or \"switchblades\", sparked significant controversy. It was further fuelled by highly popular films of the late 1950s, including ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', ''[[Crime in the Streets]]'', ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'', and the 1957 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical, ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''.

The illness was still negatively viewed by many as either being caused by or passed on through the gay community. Once it became clear that this wasn't the case, the moral panic created by the media changed to blaming the overall negligence of ethical standards of the younger generation (both male and female), resulting in another moral panic. Authors behind ''AIDS: Rights, Risk, and Reason'' argued that \"British TV and press coverage is locked into an agenda which blocks out any approach to the subject which does not conform in advance to the values and language of a profoundly homophobic culture\u2014a culture that does not regard gay men as fully or properly human.

In his analysis of [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 electoral victory, Joosse reimagined moral panic in [[Max Weber|Weberian]] terms, showing how charismatic moral entrepreneurs can at once deride folk devils in the traditional sense while avoiding the conservative moral recapitulation that classic moral panic theory predicts.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjc/azx047 |title=Expanding Moral Panic Theory to Include the Agency of Charismatic Entrepreneurs |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=993\u20131012 |last1=Joosse |first1=Paul |year=2017}}</ref> Another criticism is that of disproportionality: there is no way to measure what a proportionate reaction should be to a specific action.<ref name=cohen/>{{rp|xxvi\u2013xxxi}}\n\nWriting in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the UK after a series of murders by juveniles, chiefly that of two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] by two ten-year-old boys but also including that of 70-year-old [[Murder of Edna Phillips|Edna Phillips]] by two 17-year-old girls, the sociologist [[Colin Hay (political scientist)|Colin Hay]] pointed out that the folk devil was ambiguous in such cases; the child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Colin |last=Hay |authorlink=Colin Hay (political scientist) |title=Mobilization Through Interpellation: James Bulger, Juvenile Crime and the Construction of a Moral Panic |journal=Social & Legal Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=197\u2013223 |year=1995 |doi=10.1177/096466399500400203 }} Cited in {{cite book |first=Alan |last=Hunt |contribution=Fractious Rivals?

The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and consequently allow themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.<ref name=\"Jewkes1\"/>\n\nAnother British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic' is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=S. |year=2012 |title=Theorizing Crime and Deviance: A New Perspective |location=London |publisher=Sage |pages=132\u2013139 |isbn=9781848606722 |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/theorizing-crime-and-deviance/book233792#description}}</ref>\n\nEchoing another point Hall makes, the sociologists Thompson and Williams argue that the concept of 'moral panic' is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class 'mob'. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=W. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=The Myth of Moral Panics: Sex, Snuff, and Satan |series=Routledge Advances in Criminology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415812665 }} {{page needed|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen's original framework.

A clear division forms between [[In-group and out-group|\"them\" and \"us\"]].\n* Consensus \u2013 Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the \"moral entrepreneurs\" are vocal and the \"folk devils\" appear weak and disorganized.\n* Disproportionality \u2013 The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.\n* Volatility \u2013 Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.<ref name = Jones/>\n\nWriting about the [[Blue Whale Challenge]] and the [[Momo Challenge]] as examples of moral panics, Benjamin Radford listed themes he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena:\n*Hidden dangers of modern technology.\n*Evil stranger manipulating the innocent.\n*A \u201chidden world\u201d of anonymous evil people.<ref name=BR>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|title=The 'Momo Challenge' and the 'Blue Whale Game': Online Suicide Game Conspiracies|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|date=27 February 2019|website=Skeptical Inquirer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228170347/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|archive-date=28 February 2019|url-status=live|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!-- Note: Please do not make NEW ADDITIONS to this section unless you have a reference that cites the incident or phenomenon as an EXAMPLE OF A MORAL PANIC. -->\n=== 1840s-1860s: Nativist movement and the Know-Nothing Party ===\n{{Main|Nativism (politics)|The Know-Nothing Party}}\nThis example reflects the fear of immigrants which emerged in the United States  during the 1840s and 1850s.

Fass, ''The Damned and the Beautiful: American Youth in the 1920s'' (1977), p. 22.</ref> Despite the veiled attacks on Blues and Jazz as \"negro music\" often going hand-in-hand with other attacks on the genres, urban middle-class African Americans perceived jazz as \"devil's music\", and agreed with the beliefs that Jazz's improvised rhythms and sounds were promoting promiscuity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dinerstein|first=Joel|title=Music, Memory, and Cultural Identity in the Jazz Age|journal=American Quarterly|volume=55|issue=2|year=2003|pages=303\u2013313|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0012}}</ref> At this stage, the idea of a link between music and [[Theistic Satanism|Satanism as a religion]] was not a major component in the accusations of blues, jazz, or other genres of music. ([[LaVeyan Satanism]] and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 60's, and \"devil's music\" moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction.)\n\nOne of the most cited types of evidence today is [[Backmasking]], which was used to popularize the idea of music being directly associated in particular with satanism as a religion, rather than generalized moral depravity. The idea of backmasking began to enter the public discussion with the [[Paul is Dead]] rumor, which popularized the idea that messages recorded backwards in music contained messages by or about the artist, the focus of the topic would change in the 1970s: then, religious leaders in the United States began to claim that backmasking in music of the time, particularly [[Rock music]], glorified and promoted Satanism through ways that could be accepted subconsciously, a rumor boosted by the film [[The Exorcist]], where satanic backmasking was a plot point. This eventually lead to the proposal in 1983 of bills in California and Arkansas. Some have speculated that this and other moral panics, particularly in the 70's and early 80's, contributed to the popularity of the [[satanic ritual abuse]] moral panic.<ref>https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13413864/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-explained</ref>\n\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, the term has been closely associated with [[heavy metal music]] through falsifiable concepts like backmasking, as well as content of some major acts in the genre. However, there are a number of people who still subscribe to previous definitions of \"devil music\".\n\n=== 1950s: Switchblades ===\n\n{{Main|Switchblade}}\n\nIn the United States, a 1950 article titled \"The Toy That Kills\" in the ''Women's Home Companion'',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pollack, Jack H., ''The Toy That Kills'', 77 Women's Home Companion Magazine 38, November 1950</ref> about automatic knives, or \"switchblades\", sparked significant controversy.

In his analysis of [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 electoral victory, Joosse reimagined moral panic in [[Max Weber|Weberian]] terms, showing how charismatic moral entrepreneurs can at once deride folk devils in the traditional sense while avoiding the conservative moral recapitulation that classic moral panic theory predicts.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjc/azx047 |title=Expanding Moral Panic Theory to Include the Agency of Charismatic Entrepreneurs |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=993\u20131012 |last1=Joosse |first1=Paul |year=2017}}</ref> Another criticism is that of disproportionality: there is no way to measure what a proportionate reaction should be to a specific action.<ref name=cohen/>{{rp|xxvi\u2013xxxi}}\n\nWriting in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the UK after a series of murders by juveniles, chiefly that of two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] by two ten-year-old boys but also including that of 70-year-old [[Murder of Edna Phillips|Edna Phillips]] by two 17-year-old girls, the sociologist [[Colin Hay (political scientist)|Colin Hay]] pointed out that the folk devil was ambiguous in such cases; the child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Colin |last=Hay |authorlink=Colin Hay (political scientist) |title=Mobilization Through Interpellation: James Bulger, Juvenile Crime and the Construction of a Moral Panic |journal=Social & Legal Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=197\u2013223 |year=1995 |doi=10.1177/096466399500400203 }} Cited in {{cite book |first=Alan |last=Hunt |contribution=Fractious Rivals?

The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and consequently allow themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.<ref name=\"Jewkes1\"/>\n\nAnother British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic' is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=S. |year=2012 |title=Theorizing Crime and Deviance: A New Perspective |location=London |publisher=Sage |pages=132\u2013139 |isbn=9781848606722 |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/theorizing-crime-and-deviance/book233792#description}}</ref>\n\nEchoing another point Hall makes, the sociologists Thompson and Williams argue that the concept of 'moral panic' is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class 'mob'. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=W. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=The Myth of Moral Panics: Sex, Snuff, and Satan |series=Routledge Advances in Criminology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415812665 }} {{page needed|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen's original framework.

This federal initiative allows for the organized entry into Canada of low- to mid-level skilled farm workers for up to eight months a year to fill labour shortages on Canadian farms during peak periods of planting, cultivating and harvesting of specified farm commodities. The program is run jointly with the governments of Mexico and the participating Caribbean states, which recruit the workers and appoint representatives in Canada to assist in the program's operations.<ref>Lois Ross, [http://www.nsi-ins.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2006-Migrant-Workers-in-Canada-A-review-of-the-Canadian-Seasonal-Agricultural-Workers-Program.pdf ''Migrant Workers in Canada: a review of the Canadian seasonal agricultural workers program''], ([[The North-South Institute]], 2006)</ref>\n\nNon-agricultural companies in Canada have begun to recruit under the temporary foreign worker program since [[Service Canada]]'s 2002 expansion of an immigration program for migrant workers.\n\nAs of 2002, the federal government introduced the Low Skill Pilot Project.  This project allows companies to apply to bring in temporary foreign workers to fill low skill jobs. The classification of \"low skill\" means that workers require no more than high school or two years of job-specific training to qualify.\n\nIn 2006, the federal Conservatives expanded the list of occupations that qualified for the Low Skill Pilot Project and increased the speed of processing applications.{{citation needed| date=November 2016 }}\n\n====Latin America====\nImmigrants often take any available job, and often they find employment in the fields.

After losing their cultural identity immigrants try to find a way to feed their families, and end up being exploited. Triplett also says that since 1989, \"their average real hourly wages (in 1998 dollars) had dropped from $6.89 to $6.18\", and that immigrants suffer physical as well as economic exploitation in the work place.<ref>Triplett, William. \"Migrant Farmworkers.\" CQ Researcher 8 October 2004: 829\u201352.

In 2008 the majority of migrant workers (1,085,658: 52.6%) originally came from Indonesia. This was followed by Bangladesh (316,401), Philippines (26,713), Thailand (21,065) and Pakistan (21,278). The total number of migrant workers from other countries was 591,481. Their arrival, if not controlled, will decrease the local population's employment opportunities. However, the arrival of migrant workers increased the country's output and reduced the wage rates in the local labor market. Despite the benefits achieved by both the sending and receiving countries, many problems arise in the receiving country, Malaysia.

For both the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]] and [[Accession of Romania to the European Union|2007]] enlargements, existing [[Member State of the European Union|states]] were given the rights to impose various transitional arrangements to limit access to their labour markets. After the Second World War, Germany did not have enough workers so  laborers from other European states were invited to work in Germany. This invitation ended in 1973 and these workers were known as [[Gastarbeiter]].\n\n1 March has become a symbolic day for transnational migrants' strike. This day unites all migrants to give them a common voice to speak up against racism, discrimination and exclusion on all levels of social life. The transnational protests on 1 March were originally initiated in the US in 2006 and have encouraged migrants in other countries to organise and take action on that day. In Austria the first transnational migrants' strike (''{{lang|de|Transnationaler Migrant innenstreik}}'') took place in March 2011, in the form of common actions, e.g. a manifestation, but also in form of numerous decentralised actions.\n\n====Finland====\nAccording to the Finnish trade union organizations SAK ([[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]]) and PAM [[Finnish Service Union United PAM]] foreign workers were increasingly abused in the [[Construction worker|construction]] and [[Portal:Transport|transportation]] sectors in Finland in 2012, in some cases reporting hourly wages as low as two euros. [[Bulgarians]], [[List of Kosovars|Kosovars]] and [[Estonians]] were the most likely victimised in the building trade.<ref>[http://yle.fi/uutiset/unions_foreign_workers_often_underpaid_overworked/6479057 Unions: Foreign workers often underpaid, overworked] [[yle]] 4 February 2013</ref>\n\n====Germany====\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n{{Main|Gastarbeiter}}\nIn Nazi Germany, from 1940\u201342, [[Organization Todt]] began its reliance on guest workers, [[Internment|military internees]], [[Zivilarbeiter]] (civilian workers), [[Ostarbeiter]] (Eastern workers) and [[Hilfswillige]] (\"volunteer\") POW workers.\n\nThe great migration phase of labor migrants in the 20th century began in Germany during the 1950s, as the sovereign Germany since 1955 due to repeated pressure from NATO partners yielded to the request for closure of the so-called 'Anwerbe' Agreement ([[German language|German]]: Anwerbeabkommen).\nThe initial plan was a rotation principle: a temporary stay (usually two to three years), followed by a return to their homeland. The rotation principle proved inefficient for the industry, because the experienced workers were constantly replaced by inexperienced ones. The companies asked for legislation to extend the residence permits.\nMany of these foreign workers were followed by their families in the following period and stayed forever. Until the 1970s, more than four million migrant workers and their families came to Germany like this, mainly from the Mediterranean countries of Italy, Spain, the former Yugoslavia, [[Greece]] and Turkey.\nSince about 1990, came for the disintegration of the Soviet bloc and the enlargement of the European Union and guest workers from Eastern Europe to Western Europe\nSometimes, a host country sets up a program in order to invite guest workers, as did the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] from 1955 until 1973, when over one million guest workers (German: [[Gastarbeiter]]) arrived, mostly from [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Turkey]].\n\n====Armenia====\nThe main destination for Armenian seasonal workers is Russia. Until the end of the 1990s, there was an act of a third huge wave of Armenian emigrants, which accounted for about one million people. The main destination was the Russian Federation (620,000) \u2024 When Armenia became Independent (1991), the number of people who leave the country permanently slowed down, whereas, the number of seasonal labor migrants mainly to Russia increased.<ref>[https://www.univie.ac.at/alumni.ksa/wp-content/uploads/ASSA-SN-2017-01_Migration-and-its-impact-on-Armenia.pdf]</ref> According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Territorial Development and Administration, 95% of seasonal migrants and 75% of long-term migrants work in Russia as of the end of the year 2018, and the reason is supposed to be the membership with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The First Deputy Minister of Territorial Administration and Development of Armenia, Vache Terteryan, once said:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://emerging-europe.com/news/russia-remains-preferred-destination-for-armenian-migrants/ | title=Russia remains preferred destination for Armenian migrants| date=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n{{Quote|\u201cWe must ensure that our labor force feels comfortable both at home and in EAEU countries,\u201d said Mr. Terteryan, speaking at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Migration Policy under the UNECE (UN Economic Commission for Europe). \u201cThey must also feel comfortable in third countries.

The introduction of employer-driven labor immigration, motivated by the need to address labor shortages, resulted in large inflows of migrants also in low-skilled occupations in labor surplus sectors, for example the restaurant and cleaning sectors.<ref>Olle Fr\u00f6din & Anders Kjellberg (2018) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/40268826/Labor_Migration_from_Third_Countries_to_Swedish_Low_wage_Jobs_Fr_din_Kjellberg.pdf  Labor Migration from Third Countries to Swedish Low-wage Jobs], ''Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies'', vol. 8 no 1 (March 2018), pp. 65-85</ref>\n\n====Switzerland====\nThe underestimation of the required [[Social integration|integration]] services by the state and the society of the host countries, but also by the migrants themselves. Switzerland's transformation into a country of immigration was not until after the accelerated industrialization in the second half of the 19th century. Switzerland was no longer a purely rural Alpine area but became a European vanguard in various industries at that time, first of [[textile]], later also the mechanical and chemical industries. Since the middle of the 19th century especially German academics, self-employed and craftsmen, but also Italians, who found a job in science, industry, construction and infrastructure construction migrated to Switzerland.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=D'amato|first1=Gianni|title=Schweizerisches Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Entwicklungspolitik|issue=27\u20132|pages=177\u2013195|url=http://sjep.revues.org/340|journal=Schweizerisches Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Entwicklungspolitik|accessdate=4 April 2015|date=December 2008}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] migrant workers are denied [[National Health Service]] treatment unless they can afford to pay.

This demand was met by foreign workers, primarily those from the Arab states, with a later shift to those from Asian countries.<ref name=Kapiszewski>{{cite journal|last=Kapiszewski|first=Andrzej|title=Arab versus Asian migrant workers in the GCC countries|journal=Ited Nations Expert Group Meeting on International Migration and Development in the Arab Region|year=2006}}</ref>  A rise in the standards of living for citizens of Middle Eastern countries also created a demand for domestic workers in the home.\n\nSince the 1970s, foreign workers have become a large percentage of the population in most nations in the Persian Gulf region. Growing competition with nationals in the job sector, along with complaints regarding treatment of foreign workers, have led to rising tensions between the national and foreign populations in these nations.\n\n[[Remittance]]s are becoming a prominent source of external funding for countries that contribute foreign workers to the countries of the GCC. On average, the top recipients globally are India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh.  In 2001, $72.3 billion was returned as remittances to the countries of origin of foreign workers, equivalent to 1.3% of the world GDP.  The source of income remains beneficial as remittances are often more stable that private capital flows. Despite fluctuations in the economy of GCC countries, the amount of dollars in remittances is usually stable.<ref name=Ratha>{{cite journal|last=Ratha|first=Dilip|title=Workers' remittances: an important and stable source of external development finance|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nThe spending of remittances is seen in two ways. Principally, remittances are sent to the families of guest workers. Though often put towards consumption, remittances are also directed to investment. Investment is seen to lead to the strengthening of infrastructure and facilitating international travel.<ref name=Ratha />\n\nWith this jump in earnings, one benefit that has been seen is the nutritional improvement in households of migrant workers. Other benefits are the lessening of underemployment and unemployment.<ref name=Shah>{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Nasra M.|title=Pakistani Workers in the Middle East: Volume, Trends and Consequences|journal=International Migration Review|year=1983|volume=17|issue=3|pages=410\u2013424|jstor=2545795|doi=10.2307/2545795}}</ref>\n\nIn detailed studies of Pakistani migrants to the Middle East in the early 1980s, the average foreign worker was of age 25\u201340 years. 70 percent were married, while only 4 percent were accompanied by families. Two thirds hailed from rural areas, and 83 percent were production workers. At the time, 40 percent of Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings came from its migrant workers.<ref name=Shah />\n\nDomestic work is the single most important category of employment among women migrants to the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], as well as to Lebanon and Jordan.  The increase of Arab women in the labour force, and changing conceptions of women's responsibilities, have resulted in a shift in household responsibilities to hired domestic workers. Domestic workers perform an array of work in the home: cleaning, cooking, child care, and elder care. Common traits of the work include an average 100-hour work week and virtually non-existent overtime pay.  Remuneration differs greatly according to nationality, oftentimes depending on language skills and education level. This is seen with Filipina domestic workers receiving a higher remuneration than Sri Lankan and Ethiopian nationals.<ref name=Manseau>{{cite journal|last=Manseau|first=Gwennan|title=Contractual solutions for migrant labourers: The case of domestic workers in the Middle East|journal=Human Rights Law Commentary|year=2007|pages=25\u201347}}</ref>\n\nSaudi Arabia is the largest source of remittance payments in the world.  Remittance payments from Saudi Arabia, similar to other GCC countries, rose during the oil boom years of the 1970s and early 1980s, but declined in the mid-1980s.  As oil prices fell, budget deficits mounted, and most governments of GCC countries put limits on hiring foreign workers. Weaknesses in the financial sector and in government administration impose substantial transaction costs on migrant workers who send them. Costs, although difficult to estimate, consist of salaries and the increased spending required to expand educational and health services, housing, roads, communications, and other infrastructure to accommodate the basic needs of the newcomers. The foreign labor force is a substantial drain of the GCC states' hard currency earnings, with remittances to migrants' home countries in the early 2000s amounting to $27 billion per year, including $16 billion from Saudi Arabia alone. It has been shown that the percentage of the GDP that foreign labor generates is roughly equal to what the state has to spend on them.<ref name=Ratha />\n\nThe main concerns of developed countries regarding immigration centers are: (1) the local job seekers' fear of competition from migrant workers, (2) the fiscal burden that may result on native taxpayers for providing health and social services to migrants, (3) fears of erosion of cultural identity and problems of assimilation of immigrants, and (4) national security.<ref name=Ratha />\n\nIn immigrant-producing countries, individuals with less than a high school education continue to be a fiscal burden into the next generation. Skilled workers, however, pay more in taxes than what they receive in social spending from the state.  Emigration of highly skilled workers has been linked to skill shortages, reductions in output, and tax shortfalls in many developing countries. These burdens are even more apparent in countries where educated workers emigrated in large numbers after receiving a highly subsidized technical education.<ref name=Ratha /> \"Brain Drain refers to the emigration (out-migration) of knowledgeable, well-educated and skilled professionals from their home country to another country, [usually because of] better job opportunities in the new country.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Brain-Drain-48420204.html|title=Brain Drain|author=KevinJ6|work=StudyMode}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, 10 million workers from Southeast Asia, South Asia, or Africa live and work in the countries of the Persian Gulf region.<ref name=Manseau /> Xenophobia in receiving nations is often rampant, as menial work is often allocated only to foreign workers. Expatriate labor is treated with prejudice in host countries despite government attempts to eradicate malpractice and [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]]. Emigrants are offered substandard wages and living conditions and are compelled to work overtime without extra payment.  With regards to injuries and death, workers or their dependents are not paid due compensation. Citizenship is rarely offered and labor can oftentimes be acquired below the legal minimum wage. Foreign workers often lack access to local labor markets. Oftentimes these workers are legally attached to a sponsor/employer until completion of their employment contract, after which a worker must either renew a permit or leave the country.<ref name=Abella />\n\nRacism is prevalent towards migrant workers. With an increasing number of unskilled workers from Asia and Africa, the market for foreign workers became increasingly racialized, and dangerous or \"dirty\" jobs became associated with Asian and African workers noted by the term \"Abed\", meaning dark skin.<ref name=Shah />\n\nForeign workers migrate to the Middle East as contract workers by means of the ''kafala'', or \"sponsorship\" system.<ref name=Ruhs>{{cite journal|last=Ruhs|first=Martin|title=Temporary Foreign Worker Programmes: Policies, adverse consequences, and the need to make them work|year=2002}}</ref>  Migrant work is typically for a period of two years.<ref name=Kapiszewski />  Recruitment agencies in sending countries are the main contributors of labor to GCC countries. Through these agencies, sponsors must pay a fee to the recruiter and pay for the worker's round-trip airfare, visas, permits, and wages. Recruiters charge high fees to prospective employees to obtain employment visas, averaging between $2,000 and $2,500 in such countries as Bangladesh and India. Contract disputes are also common. In Saudi Arabia, foreign workers must have employment contracts written in Arabic and have them signed by both the sponsor and themselves in order to be issued a work permit. With other GCC countries, such as Kuwait, contracts may be written or oral.<ref name=Ruhs />\n\nDependence on the sponsor (''kafeel'') naturally creates room for violations of the rights of foreign workers.<ref name=Ruhs />  Debt causes workers to work for a certain period of time without a salary to cover these fees. This bondage encourages the practice of international labour migration as women in situations of poverty are able to find jobs overseas and pay off their debts through work.<ref name=Manseau />  It is common for the employer or the sponsor to retain the employee's passport and other identity papers as a form of insurance for the amount an employer has paid for the worker's work permit and airfare. Kafeels sell visas to the foreign worker with the unwritten understanding that the foreigner can work for an employer other than the sponsor.<ref name=Ruhs />\n\nWhen a two-year work period is over, or with a job loss, workers must find another employer willing to sponsor them, or return to their nation of origin within a short time. Failing to do this entails imprisonment for violation of immigration laws. Protections are nearly non-existent for migrant workers.<ref name=Manseau />\n\nThe population in the current GCC states has grown more than eight times during 50 years.  Foreign workers have become the primary, dominant labor force in most sectors of the economy and the government bureaucracy. With rising unemployment, GCC governments embarked on the formulation of labor market strategies to improve this situation, to create sufficient employment opportunities for nationals, and to limit the dependence on expatriate labor.  Restrictions have been imposed: the sponsorship system, the rotational system of expatriate labor to limit the duration of foreigners' stay, curbs on naturalization and the rights of those who have been naturalized, etc. This has also led to efforts to improve the education and training of nationals. Localization remains low among the private sector, however. This is due to the traditionally low income the sector offers. Also included are long working hours, a competitive work environment, and a need to recognize an expatriate supervisor, often difficult to accept.<ref name=Kapiszewski />\n\nIn 2005, low-paid Asian workers staged protests, some of them violent, in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar for not receiving salaries on time. In March 2006, hundreds of mostly south Asian construction workers stopped work and went on a rampage in Dubai, UAE, to protest their harsh working conditions, low or delayed pay, and general lack of rights.  Sexual harassment of Filipina housemaids by local employers, especially in Saudi Arabia, has become a serious matter.  In recent years, this has resulted in a ban on migration of females under 21. Such nations as Indonesia have noted the maltreatment of women in the GCC states, with the government calling for an end to the sending of housemaids altogether.<ref name=Abella />  In GCC countries, a chief concern with foreign domestic workers is childcare without the desired emphasis on Islamic and Arabic values.<ref name=Manseau />\n\nPossible developments in the future include a slowdown in the growth of foreign labor. One contributor to this is a dramatic change in demographic trends. The growing birth rate of nationals in the GCC states will lead to a more competitive workforce in the future.<ref name=Kapiszewski />  This could also lead to a rise in the numbers of national women in the workforce.\n\n====United Arab Emirates====\n{{main|Migrant workers in the United Arab Emirates}}\nThe treatment of migrant workers in the [[UAE]] has been likened to \"modern-day slavery\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/world/modern-day-slave-labor-conditions-abu-dhabis-migrant-workers-shame-west|title=Modern Day Slave Labor: Conditions for Abu Dhabi's Migrant Workers Shame the West|date=23 December 2013}}</ref> Migrant workers are excluded from the UAE's collective labour rights, hence migrants are vulnerable to forced labour.

In some places, like China, for instance, rapid economic growth has led to an imbalance in the modernization of rural and urban environments, leading women to migrate from rural areas into the city to be a part of the push for modernization.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other reasons include familial pressure, on a daughter, for instance, who is seen as a reliable source of income for the family only through [[remittance]]s. Young girls and women are singled out in families to be migrant workers because they don't have a viable alternative role to fulfil in the local village.<ref name=\":2\">''The Mosuo Sisters.''

Migration can also substitute for divorce in societies that don't allow or do not condone divorce.<ref name=\"Morokvasic\"/>\n\n===Impact on roles within the family===\nIn terms of migrant labour, many women move from a more oppressive home country to a less oppressive environment where they have actual access to waged work. As such, leaving the home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom challenges traditional [[gender roles]]. This can be seen to strengthen women's position in the family by improving their relative bargaining position. They have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets. However, this can lead to hostility between wives and husbands who feel inadequate or ashamed at their inability to fulfil their traditional role as [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]]. The hostility and resentment from the husband can also be a source of [[domestic violence]].<ref>[[#Menj\u00edvar|Menj\u00edvar (1999)]]</ref> Studies have also been done which point to changes in family structures as a result of migrant labour. These changes include increased divorce rates and decrease in household stability. Additionally, female migrant labour has been indicated as a source for more egalitarian relationships within the family, decline of extended family patterns, and more nuclear families.<ref name=\"Morokvasic\"/> There is also a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.<ref name=\"Parle\">[[#Parle|de Parle (2007)]]</ref>\n\nResearchers identified three groups of women to represent the dimensions of gender roles in Singapore. The first group is made up of expatriate wives who are often reduced to dependent spouse status by immigration laws. The second group are housewives who left work in order to take care of the children at home. Although they are from the Singaporean middle class, they are stuck at almost the same level and share status with the third group, foreign domestic workers. Because of global economic restructuring and global city formation, the mobility of female labours is increasing. However, they are controlled through strict enforcement and they are statistically invisible in migration data. The female foreign domestic workers are always gender-stereotyped as maids and generalized as low wages workers in society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yeoh|first=Brenda S.A.|title=Global Cities, Transnational Flows and Gender Dimensions, The View From Singapore|year=2000|publisher=Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG|location=Department of Geography, University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\n=== Women Migrant Workers: The Informal Sector ===\nThe spread of global [[neoliberalism]] has contributed to physically displaced people, which translates to displaced workers, worldwide. Due to the national and transnational economic push and pull of migration, growing numbers of women migrant workers find themselves employed in the underground and informal sector. To be clear, these women tended not to be previously employed in the formal sector, if at all. Frequently, the cheap and flexible labor is sought in more developed areas. Also, these women migrant workers are often considered an asset to employers who think of these individuals as docile, compliant, and disposable.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Disposable Women and Other Myths of Global Capitalism|last=Wright|first=Melissa|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|location=London and New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWork found in the informal economy is defined as being outside the legal regulation of the state. This underground sector includes nontraditional types of employment: intimate care,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Globalizing Care Economies and Migrant Workers: Explorations in Global Care Chains|last=Yeates|first=Nicola|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=|location=Basingstoke|pages=}}</ref> [[street vending]], [[community gardening]], food selling, sewing and tailoring, [[laundry]] service, water selling, car cleaning, home cleaning, and various kinds of [[artisan]] production.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development, and Globalization: Economics As if all People Mattered.|last=Bene\u00eda|first=Lourdes|last2=Berik|first2=G\u00fcnseli|last3=Floro|first3=Maira S.|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>  These positions are frequently precarious and lack the social contracts often found between employee and employer in the formal sector. This unofficial economy is often found in locations that are between home and work and combine personal and private spaces. Because migrant women workers often occupy the lowest economic positions, this leaves them especially vulnerable to exploitation and dangerous working conditions. Incidentally, [[Guy Standing (economist)|Guy Standing]] has termed this kind of vulnerable worker, the [[Precariat]].\n\nWomen are frequently at the bottom of the economic hierarchy due to various factors, mainly a lack of opportunity to support themselves and their families and in addition, a lack of adequate education. Despite the [[United Nations Girls' Education Initiative|United Nations' Girls Education Initiative]], there remains high rates of [[Literacy|illiteracy]] among women in the Global South. Commonly, the informal sector is the only place where geographically displaced workers are able to insert themselves into the economy. Thus, women migrant workers perform a high percentage of work found in this sector.\n\nDue in part to complex migration issues which include the restructuring of gendered and familiar relations, women migrant workers frequently care for children without a local family network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Maylei|date=2010|title=Lideres Campesinas: Nepantla Strategies and Grassroots Organizing at the Intersection of Gender and Globalization|url=|journal=Aztlan: A Journal of Chicano Studies|volume=35|pages=13\u201347|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Intimate Migrations: Gender, Family, and Illegality Among Transnational Mexicans|last=Boehm|first=Deborah A.|publisher=New York University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> The informal sector allows for public and private space to be merged and accommodate their care-taking responsibilities. New immigrants are often concerned with leaving children unattended and the informal sector allows for care-taking alongside of economic activities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Immigrant Women Workers in the Neoliberal Age|last=Flores-Gonzales|first=Nilda|display-authors=etal|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=133-163|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIt is important to note, through case studies, it has been determined that men and women migrate for similar reasons. Mainly, they leave places in search of better opportunities, most often financial. In addition to the financial push, women also migrate to escape oppressive environments and/or abusive spouses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Servants of Globalization: Migration and Domestic Work|last=Parre\u00f1as|first=Rachel|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=61\u201379}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Good Gingrich|first=Luann|date=2010|title=The Symbolic Economy of Trans-Border Governance: A Case Study of Subjective Exclusion and Migrant Women from Mexico.|url=|journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly|volume=29|pages=161\u2013184|doi=10.1093/rsq/hdq008}}</ref>\n\n===Children of female migrant workers===\n[[File:8c35333.jpg|thumb|Group of Florida migrants near [[Shawboro, North Carolina]] on their way to [[Cranbury, New Jersey]], to pick potatoes]]\nMigrant labour of women also raises special concerns about children. Female migrant workers may not have enough possibilities to care for their own children whilst being abroad. Their children may learn to regard their relatives at home as their parents and may rarely see their mothers. Frequently, children of migrant workers become migrant workers themselves. There is concern that this may have negative psychological effects on the children who are left behind. Although this has not been proven to be entirely true or false, studies have been done which show that many children of migrant workers manage reasonably well. One theory states that remittances to some degree make up for the lack of care by providing more resources for food and clothing. Additionally, some migrant mothers take great care in attempting to maintain familial relationships while abroad.<ref name=\"Parle\"/>\n\n==Migrant education==\n''See [[Migrant education]].''\n[[File:A school for the children of white migrant farm workers is maintained at the Osceola Farm Labor Supply Center... - NARA - 512800.tif|upright=1.8|thumb|A school for the children of white migrant farm workers, circa 1945]]\nChildren of [[migrant workers]] struggle to achieve the same level of educational success as their peers. Relocation, whether it is a singular or regular occurrence, causes discontinuity in education, which causes migrant students to progress slowly through school and drop out at high rates. Additionally, relocation has negative social consequences on students: isolation from peers due to cultural differences and [[language barrier]]s. Migrant children are also at a disadvantage because the majority live in [[extreme poverty]] and must work with their parents to support their families.<ref name=Kindler>{{cite journal |last=Kindler |first=Anneka L.|year=1995 |title=Education of Migrant Children in the United States|journal=[[Directions in Language and Education]] |volume=1 |issue=8 }}</ref> These barriers to equal educational attainment for children of migrant workers are present in countries all over the world. Although the inequality in education remains pronounced, government policies, [[non-governmental organizations]], [[non-profits]], and [[social movements]] are working to reverse its effects.\n\n==Migrant labour force in economies==\nThe migrant workforce has historically played a vital role nationally and across local communities in recent times. [[Economic globalization]] has created more migrant workers than ever before. While developed countries have increased their demand for labour, especially unskilled labour, workers from developing countries are used. As a result, millions of workers and their families travel to other countries to find work. This influx of migrant workers contributes to growth of [[slum]]s and urban poverty, according to Mike Davis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Mike|title=Planet of Slums|year=2006|publisher=Verso|location=London}}</ref> Some of these workers, usually from rural areas, cannot afford housing in cities and thus live in slums.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Todaro|first=Michael P.|title=A Model of Labor Migration and Urban Unemployment in Less Developed Countries|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1969|volume=59|issue=1}}</ref> Some of these unskilled workers living in slums suffer from unemployment and make a living in the [[informal sector]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Indrani|author2=Arup Mitra|title=Rural Migrants and Labour Segmentation: Micro-Level Evidence from Delhi Slums|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2002|volume=37|issue=2}}</ref> According to International Labor Organization, as of 2013 there were approximately 175 million migrants around the world.<ref>{{cite web|last=Labour Organization (ILO)|first=International|title=Migrant Workers|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/migrant-workers/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Standards|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Exploitation and enslavement of migrant workers==\n{{see also|Human trafficking}}\n\nRecruitment of international workers through employment agencies is a common phenomenon in developed countries, such as the United States or the [[UAE]]. Especially members of underprivileged communities are attracted by the opportunities of living and working in the US. Some of these agencies make fraudulent promises. But even worse than false promises, some migrants are abused and mistreated by the agencies and their middlemen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Twohey, Megan. \"Wanted: Foreign Workers \u2014 and the Labor Brokers Accused of Illegally Profiting from Them.\" Reuters.

He had to report to the government about these women and that they were in fact working in the country so that he could continue to receive funds, while they too continued working. And that is what he did. \"Documents he submitted to the government didn't indicate that he and his partner, Philip Langerman, were taking a large portion of the visa-holders' wages.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nEventually, this scheme that Kalu and his partner Phillip Langerman created began to become known to the public.

These women usually leave their families, including young children, behind in order to help maintain the family by sending [[remittance]]s. After arriving in the U.S., many are put to work and live in places that are neither clean nor safe. Companies and traffickers promise legitimate jobs in America because they make money doing so.\n\nAn article \"Girl Next Door\", by Peter Landsman, examines this system, which is said to be brutal and inhumane oppression of migrant workers. \"On a tip, the Plainfield police raided the house in February 2002, expecting to find illegal aliens working an underground brothel. What the police found were four girls between the ages of 14 and 17. They were all Mexican nationals without documentation. But they weren't prostitutes; they were sex slaves. The distinction is important: these girls weren't working for profit or a paycheck. They were captives to the traffickers and keepers who controlled their every move.\"<ref name=\"Landesman, Peter 2004\">Landesman, Peter. 2004. The Girls Next Door. New York Times Magazine</ref> These girls, a large percentage are underaged, are forcefully lured from their homeland in Mexico and other parts of Latin America.

Many other houses or neighborhoods in the U.S that seem to be upscale and upper class are infested with these types of illegal actions.\n\n=== Migrant workers in Europe ===\nIn the agricultural sector (strawberry industry, ...) in some countries in Europe ([[Human_rights_in_Spain#Migrant_agricultural_workers_in_Southern_Spain|Spain]], Italy), sexual harassment, rape and even sexual exploitation occurs.<ref>[https://correctiv.org/en/top-stories-en/2018/04/30/rape-in-the-fields/ Rape in the fields]</ref>\n\n==Migrant workers' rights==\nThe \"People's Movement for Human Rights Education (PDHRE)\" have composed a list of fourteen rights for migrant workers.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The People's Movement for Human Rights Education (PDHRE)|title=Human Rights and Migrant Workers|url=http://www.pdhre.org/rights/migrants.html|first=Shulamith |last=Koenig|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Phillipines migrant workers' rights===\n\"The Philippine government has long lauded the fact that, every day, some 4,500 Filipinos are sent abroad to work. The remittances they send back keeps the Philippine economy afloat.The government doesn't seem to provide any protection when these overseas Filipino workers run into distress. This labour export policy is still one of their pillars of development \u2013 pushing people to other countries instead of addressing poverty or lack of jobs at home.\"<ref name=\"ipsnews.net\"/> Instead of sending workers out just because the process helps the economy at their countries of origin, the country needs to examine ways in which they can work with the people to obtain jobs or at least create more jobs. When their skilled workers come to the United States and are often exploited, sexually, physically and mentally it not only affects the worker, but also the country upon their return-or if they are able to return at all due to the conditions they face. These are risky jobs and journeys taken by migrants to ensure themselves better lives and also their families. The governments need to do more. \"The exploitative immigration system of the U.S. works hand-in-hand with the corrupt labour export policy of the Philippines to maintain a steadily increasing flow of cheap, temporary migrant labour.\"<ref name=\"ipsnews.net\"/>\n\n==Effects on migrant workers' health==\nMonica Rosales (a professor from Colorado State University) describes work-related injuries in her journal article titled \"Life in the field: Migrant farm workers\u2019 perceptions of work related injuries\".

Migrant workers usually do not have the intention to stay permanently in the country or region in which they work.\n\nMigrant workers who work outside their home country are also called [[foreign worker]]s. They may also be called [[expatriate]]s or guest workers, especially when they have been sent for or invited to work in the host country before leaving the home country.\n\nThe [[International Labour Organization]] estimated in 2014 there were 232 million international migrants worldwide who were outside their home country for at least 12 months and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}</ref> Some countries have millions of migrant workers.

It is estimated that around 5 million foreign workers live in Northwestern Europe, half a million in Japan, and around 5 million in Saudi Arabia. A comparable number of dependents are accompanying international workers.<ref>http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=westfall</ref>\n\n===Americas===\n\n====Canada====\n\nForeign nationals are accepted into Canada on a temporary basis if they have a [[student visa]], are [[seeking asylum]], or under special permits. The largest category however is called the [[Temporary foreign worker program in Canada|Temporary Foreign Worker Program]] (TFWP), under which workers are brought to Canada by their employers for specific jobs.<ref name=Canada1>Sharma, Nandita.

Amongst those of working age, there was a 118% increase from 1996.  By 2008, the intake of non-permanent immigrants (399,523, the majority of whom are TFWs), had overtaken the intake of permanent immigrants (247,243).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2010002/article/11166-eng.htm |title=Foreign nationals working temporarily in Canada |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> In order to hire foreign workers, Canadian employers must acquire a Labour Market Impact Assessment administered by Employment and Social Development Canada.\n\nSince the 1960s, farmers in Ontario and other provinces have been meeting some of their seasonal labour needs by hiring temporary workers from Caribbean countries and, since 1974, from Mexico under the Canadian [[Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program]] (CSAWP). This federal initiative allows for the organized entry into Canada of low- to mid-level skilled farm workers for up to eight months a year to fill labour shortages on Canadian farms during peak periods of planting, cultivating and harvesting of specified farm commodities. The program is run jointly with the governments of Mexico and the participating Caribbean states, which recruit the workers and appoint representatives in Canada to assist in the program's operations.<ref>Lois Ross, [http://www.nsi-ins.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2006-Migrant-Workers-in-Canada-A-review-of-the-Canadian-Seasonal-Agricultural-Workers-Program.pdf ''Migrant Workers in Canada: a review of the Canadian seasonal agricultural workers program''], ([[The North-South Institute]], 2006)</ref>\n\nNon-agricultural companies in Canada have begun to recruit under the temporary foreign worker program since [[Service Canada]]'s 2002 expansion of an immigration program for migrant workers.\n\nAs of 2002, the federal government introduced the Low Skill Pilot Project.  This project allows companies to apply to bring in temporary foreign workers to fill low skill jobs. The classification of \"low skill\" means that workers require no more than high school or two years of job-specific training to qualify.\n\nIn 2006, the federal Conservatives expanded the list of occupations that qualified for the Low Skill Pilot Project and increased the speed of processing applications.{{citation needed| date=November 2016 }}\n\n====Latin America====\nImmigrants often take any available job, and often they find employment in the fields. The work often consists of hard manual labour, often with unfair pay. The article \"Migrant Farmworkers: Is government doing enough to protect them?\u201d, by William Triplett, states that the median annual income was $7,500, and 61% had income below the poverty level. After losing their cultural identity immigrants try to find a way to feed their families, and end up being exploited. Triplett also says that since 1989, \"their average real hourly wages (in 1998 dollars) had dropped from $6.89 to $6.18\", and that immigrants suffer physical as well as economic exploitation in the work place.<ref>Triplett, William. \"Migrant Farmworkers.\" CQ Researcher 8 October 2004: 829\u201352.

In 2008 the majority of migrant workers (1,085,658: 52.6%) originally came from Indonesia. This was followed by Bangladesh (316,401), Philippines (26,713), Thailand (21,065) and Pakistan (21,278). The total number of migrant workers from other countries was 591,481. Their arrival, if not controlled, will decrease the local population's employment opportunities. However, the arrival of migrant workers increased the country's output and reduced the wage rates in the local labor market. Despite the benefits achieved by both the sending and receiving countries, many problems arise in the receiving country, Malaysia. The number of migrant workers currently in Malaysia is very difficult to determine, although the numbers working legally, with a passport and a work permit, are known.\n\n====Philippines====\nIn 2013, the [[Commission on Filipinos Overseas]] (CFO) estimated that approximately 10.2&nbsp;million Filipinos worked or resided abroad.<ref name=\"CFO2013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.gov.ph/images/stories/pdf/StockEstimate2013.pdf|title=Stock Estimate of Filipinos Overseas As of December 2013|publisher=Philippine Overseas Employment Administration|accessdate=2015-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207092932/http://www.cfo.gov.ph/images/stories/pdf/StockEstimate2013.pdf|archive-date=7 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the [[Census in the Philippines|census]] year of 2010, about 9.3 percent of Filipinos worked or resided abroad.{{refn|Calculation:<br />\n:Domestic population (2010): ~92.34 million<ref>{{cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/2010-census-population-and-housing-reveals-philippine-population-9234-million|title=The 2010 Census of Population and Housing Reveals the Philippine Population at 92.34 Million|date=4 April 2012|publisher=Philippine Statistics Authority}}</ref>\n:Overseas Filipinos (2010): ~9.45&nbsp;million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.gov.ph/pdf/statistics/Stock%202010.pdf|title=Stock Estimate of Filipinos Overseas As of December 2010|publisher=Philippine Overseas Employment Administration|accessdate=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717112638/http://www.cfo.gov.ph/pdf/statistics/Stock%202010.pdf|archive-date=17 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Some sources have indicated that there are on the order of 3 million additional Filipinos working illegally abroad.<ref name=PRB2003>{{cite web |url=http://www.prb.org/Articles/2003/RapidPopulationGrowthCrowdedCitiesPresentChallengesinthePhilippines.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053330/http://www.prb.org/Articles/2003/RapidPopulationGrowthCrowdedCitiesPresentChallengesinthePhilippines.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-16 |title=Rapid Population Growth, Crowded Cities Present Challenges in the Philippines |author=Yvette Collymore |publisher=Population Reference Bureau |quote=An estimated 10 percent of the country's population, or nearly 8,000,000 people, are overseas Filipino workers distributed in 182 countries, according to POPCOM.

It provided work for foreigners as trainees in small and medium-sized businesses. However, these workers were considered trainees and not official employees, so they could not receive protection under Korean labour laws. On 14 February 1995 Guidelines for the Protection and Management of Foreign Industrial Trainees provided legal and social welfare for migrant workers. The Act on the Employment of Foreign Workers which states that \"a foreign worker shall not be given discriminatory treatment on the ground that he/she is a foreigner\", was put into force on 16 August 2003. Later that year the numbers of migrant workers multiplied dramatically.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nEven though there has been a drastic rise of migrant workers in Korea and policies are in place for their protection, the lack of cheap labour in Korea has forced the Korean community to condone the maltreatment of illegal migrant workers, and other unsavoury practices.

For both the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]] and [[Accession of Romania to the European Union|2007]] enlargements, existing [[Member State of the European Union|states]] were given the rights to impose various transitional arrangements to limit access to their labour markets. After the Second World War, Germany did not have enough workers so  laborers from other European states were invited to work in Germany. This invitation ended in 1973 and these workers were known as [[Gastarbeiter]].\n\n1 March has become a symbolic day for transnational migrants' strike. This day unites all migrants to give them a common voice to speak up against racism, discrimination and exclusion on all levels of social life. The transnational protests on 1 March were originally initiated in the US in 2006 and have encouraged migrants in other countries to organise and take action on that day. In Austria the first transnational migrants' strike (''{{lang|de|Transnationaler Migrant innenstreik}}'') took place in March 2011, in the form of common actions, e.g. a manifestation, but also in form of numerous decentralised actions.\n\n====Finland====\nAccording to the Finnish trade union organizations SAK ([[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]]) and PAM [[Finnish Service Union United PAM]] foreign workers were increasingly abused in the [[Construction worker|construction]] and [[Portal:Transport|transportation]] sectors in Finland in 2012, in some cases reporting hourly wages as low as two euros.

The rotation principle proved inefficient for the industry, because the experienced workers were constantly replaced by inexperienced ones. The companies asked for legislation to extend the residence permits.\nMany of these foreign workers were followed by their families in the following period and stayed forever. Until the 1970s, more than four million migrant workers and their families came to Germany like this, mainly from the Mediterranean countries of Italy, Spain, the former Yugoslavia, [[Greece]] and Turkey.\nSince about 1990, came for the disintegration of the Soviet bloc and the enlargement of the European Union and guest workers from Eastern Europe to Western Europe\nSometimes, a host country sets up a program in order to invite guest workers, as did the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] from 1955 until 1973, when over one million guest workers (German: [[Gastarbeiter]]) arrived, mostly from [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Turkey]].\n\n====Armenia====\nThe main destination for Armenian seasonal workers is Russia. Until the end of the 1990s, there was an act of a third huge wave of Armenian emigrants, which accounted for about one million people. The main destination was the Russian Federation (620,000) \u2024 When Armenia became Independent (1991), the number of people who leave the country permanently slowed down, whereas, the number of seasonal labor migrants mainly to Russia increased.<ref>[https://www.univie.ac.at/alumni.ksa/wp-content/uploads/ASSA-SN-2017-01_Migration-and-its-impact-on-Armenia.pdf]</ref> According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Territorial Development and Administration, 95% of seasonal migrants and 75% of long-term migrants work in Russia as of the end of the year 2018, and the reason is supposed to be the membership with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The First Deputy Minister of Territorial Administration and Development of Armenia, Vache Terteryan, once said:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://emerging-europe.com/news/russia-remains-preferred-destination-for-armenian-migrants/ | title=Russia remains preferred destination for Armenian migrants| date=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n{{Quote|\u201cWe must ensure that our labor force feels comfortable both at home and in EAEU countries,\u201d said Mr. Terteryan, speaking at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Migration Policy under the UNECE (UN Economic Commission for Europe). \u201cThey must also feel comfortable in third countries.

Switzerland's transformation into a country of immigration was not until after the accelerated industrialization in the second half of the 19th century. Switzerland was no longer a purely rural Alpine area but became a European vanguard in various industries at that time, first of [[textile]], later also the mechanical and chemical industries. Since the middle of the 19th century especially German academics, self-employed and craftsmen, but also Italians, who found a job in science, industry, construction and infrastructure construction migrated to Switzerland.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=D'amato|first1=Gianni|title=Schweizerisches Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Entwicklungspolitik|issue=27\u20132|pages=177\u2013195|url=http://sjep.revues.org/340|journal=Schweizerisches Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Entwicklungspolitik|accessdate=4 April 2015|date=December 2008}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] migrant workers are denied [[National Health Service]] treatment unless they can afford to pay.

Growing competition with nationals in the job sector, along with complaints regarding treatment of foreign workers, have led to rising tensions between the national and foreign populations in these nations.\n\n[[Remittance]]s are becoming a prominent source of external funding for countries that contribute foreign workers to the countries of the GCC. On average, the top recipients globally are India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh.  In 2001, $72.3 billion was returned as remittances to the countries of origin of foreign workers, equivalent to 1.3% of the world GDP.  The source of income remains beneficial as remittances are often more stable that private capital flows. Despite fluctuations in the economy of GCC countries, the amount of dollars in remittances is usually stable.<ref name=Ratha>{{cite journal|last=Ratha|first=Dilip|title=Workers' remittances: an important and stable source of external development finance|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nThe spending of remittances is seen in two ways. Principally, remittances are sent to the families of guest workers. Though often put towards consumption, remittances are also directed to investment. Investment is seen to lead to the strengthening of infrastructure and facilitating international travel.<ref name=Ratha />\n\nWith this jump in earnings, one benefit that has been seen is the nutritional improvement in households of migrant workers. Other benefits are the lessening of underemployment and unemployment.<ref name=Shah>{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Nasra M.|title=Pakistani Workers in the Middle East: Volume, Trends and Consequences|journal=International Migration Review|year=1983|volume=17|issue=3|pages=410\u2013424|jstor=2545795|doi=10.2307/2545795}}</ref>\n\nIn detailed studies of Pakistani migrants to the Middle East in the early 1980s, the average foreign worker was of age 25\u201340 years. 70 percent were married, while only 4 percent were accompanied by families. Two thirds hailed from rural areas, and 83 percent were production workers. At the time, 40 percent of Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings came from its migrant workers.<ref name=Shah />\n\nDomestic work is the single most important category of employment among women migrants to the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], as well as to Lebanon and Jordan.  The increase of Arab women in the labour force, and changing conceptions of women's responsibilities, have resulted in a shift in household responsibilities to hired domestic workers. Domestic workers perform an array of work in the home: cleaning, cooking, child care, and elder care. Common traits of the work include an average 100-hour work week and virtually non-existent overtime pay.  Remuneration differs greatly according to nationality, oftentimes depending on language skills and education level. This is seen with Filipina domestic workers receiving a higher remuneration than Sri Lankan and Ethiopian nationals.<ref name=Manseau>{{cite journal|last=Manseau|first=Gwennan|title=Contractual solutions for migrant labourers: The case of domestic workers in the Middle East|journal=Human Rights Law Commentary|year=2007|pages=25\u201347}}</ref>\n\nSaudi Arabia is the largest source of remittance payments in the world.  Remittance payments from Saudi Arabia, similar to other GCC countries, rose during the oil boom years of the 1970s and early 1980s, but declined in the mid-1980s.  As oil prices fell, budget deficits mounted, and most governments of GCC countries put limits on hiring foreign workers. Weaknesses in the financial sector and in government administration impose substantial transaction costs on migrant workers who send them. Costs, although difficult to estimate, consist of salaries and the increased spending required to expand educational and health services, housing, roads, communications, and other infrastructure to accommodate the basic needs of the newcomers. The foreign labor force is a substantial drain of the GCC states' hard currency earnings, with remittances to migrants' home countries in the early 2000s amounting to $27 billion per year, including $16 billion from Saudi Arabia alone. It has been shown that the percentage of the GDP that foreign labor generates is roughly equal to what the state has to spend on them.<ref name=Ratha />\n\nThe main concerns of developed countries regarding immigration centers are: (1) the local job seekers' fear of competition from migrant workers, (2) the fiscal burden that may result on native taxpayers for providing health and social services to migrants, (3) fears of erosion of cultural identity and problems of assimilation of immigrants, and (4) national security.<ref name=Ratha />\n\nIn immigrant-producing countries, individuals with less than a high school education continue to be a fiscal burden into the next generation. Skilled workers, however, pay more in taxes than what they receive in social spending from the state.  Emigration of highly skilled workers has been linked to skill shortages, reductions in output, and tax shortfalls in many developing countries. These burdens are even more apparent in countries where educated workers emigrated in large numbers after receiving a highly subsidized technical education.<ref name=Ratha /> \"Brain Drain refers to the emigration (out-migration) of knowledgeable, well-educated and skilled professionals from their home country to another country, [usually because of] better job opportunities in the new country.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Brain-Drain-48420204.html|title=Brain Drain|author=KevinJ6|work=StudyMode}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, 10 million workers from Southeast Asia, South Asia, or Africa live and work in the countries of the Persian Gulf region.<ref name=Manseau /> Xenophobia in receiving nations is often rampant, as menial work is often allocated only to foreign workers. Expatriate labor is treated with prejudice in host countries despite government attempts to eradicate malpractice and [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]]. Emigrants are offered substandard wages and living conditions and are compelled to work overtime without extra payment.  With regards to injuries and death, workers or their dependents are not paid due compensation. Citizenship is rarely offered and labor can oftentimes be acquired below the legal minimum wage. Foreign workers often lack access to local labor markets. Oftentimes these workers are legally attached to a sponsor/employer until completion of their employment contract, after which a worker must either renew a permit or leave the country.<ref name=Abella />\n\nRacism is prevalent towards migrant workers. With an increasing number of unskilled workers from Asia and Africa, the market for foreign workers became increasingly racialized, and dangerous or \"dirty\" jobs became associated with Asian and African workers noted by the term \"Abed\", meaning dark skin.<ref name=Shah />\n\nForeign workers migrate to the Middle East as contract workers by means of the ''kafala'', or \"sponsorship\" system.<ref name=Ruhs>{{cite journal|last=Ruhs|first=Martin|title=Temporary Foreign Worker Programmes: Policies, adverse consequences, and the need to make them work|year=2002}}</ref>  Migrant work is typically for a period of two years.<ref name=Kapiszewski />  Recruitment agencies in sending countries are the main contributors of labor to GCC countries. Through these agencies, sponsors must pay a fee to the recruiter and pay for the worker's round-trip airfare, visas, permits, and wages. Recruiters charge high fees to prospective employees to obtain employment visas, averaging between $2,000 and $2,500 in such countries as Bangladesh and India. Contract disputes are also common. In Saudi Arabia, foreign workers must have employment contracts written in Arabic and have them signed by both the sponsor and themselves in order to be issued a work permit. With other GCC countries, such as Kuwait, contracts may be written or oral.<ref name=Ruhs />\n\nDependence on the sponsor (''kafeel'') naturally creates room for violations of the rights of foreign workers.<ref name=Ruhs />  Debt causes workers to work for a certain period of time without a salary to cover these fees. This bondage encourages the practice of international labour migration as women in situations of poverty are able to find jobs overseas and pay off their debts through work.<ref name=Manseau />  It is common for the employer or the sponsor to retain the employee's passport and other identity papers as a form of insurance for the amount an employer has paid for the worker's work permit and airfare. Kafeels sell visas to the foreign worker with the unwritten understanding that the foreigner can work for an employer other than the sponsor.<ref name=Ruhs />\n\nWhen a two-year work period is over, or with a job loss, workers must find another employer willing to sponsor them, or return to their nation of origin within a short time. Failing to do this entails imprisonment for violation of immigration laws. Protections are nearly non-existent for migrant workers.<ref name=Manseau />\n\nThe population in the current GCC states has grown more than eight times during 50 years.  Foreign workers have become the primary, dominant labor force in most sectors of the economy and the government bureaucracy. With rising unemployment, GCC governments embarked on the formulation of labor market strategies to improve this situation, to create sufficient employment opportunities for nationals, and to limit the dependence on expatriate labor.  Restrictions have been imposed: the sponsorship system, the rotational system of expatriate labor to limit the duration of foreigners' stay, curbs on naturalization and the rights of those who have been naturalized, etc. This has also led to efforts to improve the education and training of nationals. Localization remains low among the private sector, however. This is due to the traditionally low income the sector offers. Also included are long working hours, a competitive work environment, and a need to recognize an expatriate supervisor, often difficult to accept.<ref name=Kapiszewski />\n\nIn 2005, low-paid Asian workers staged protests, some of them violent, in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar for not receiving salaries on time. In March 2006, hundreds of mostly south Asian construction workers stopped work and went on a rampage in Dubai, UAE, to protest their harsh working conditions, low or delayed pay, and general lack of rights.  Sexual harassment of Filipina housemaids by local employers, especially in Saudi Arabia, has become a serious matter.  In recent years, this has resulted in a ban on migration of females under 21. Such nations as Indonesia have noted the maltreatment of women in the GCC states, with the government calling for an end to the sending of housemaids altogether.<ref name=Abella />  In GCC countries, a chief concern with foreign domestic workers is childcare without the desired emphasis on Islamic and Arabic values.<ref name=Manseau />\n\nPossible developments in the future include a slowdown in the growth of foreign labor. One contributor to this is a dramatic change in demographic trends.

In some places, like China, for instance, rapid economic growth has led to an imbalance in the modernization of rural and urban environments, leading women to migrate from rural areas into the city to be a part of the push for modernization.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other reasons include familial pressure, on a daughter, for instance, who is seen as a reliable source of income for the family only through [[remittance]]s. Young girls and women are singled out in families to be migrant workers because they don't have a viable alternative role to fulfil in the local village.<ref name=\":2\">''The Mosuo Sisters.''

Migration can also substitute for divorce in societies that don't allow or do not condone divorce.<ref name=\"Morokvasic\"/>\n\n===Impact on roles within the family===\nIn terms of migrant labour, many women move from a more oppressive home country to a less oppressive environment where they have actual access to waged work. As such, leaving the home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom challenges traditional [[gender roles]]. This can be seen to strengthen women's position in the family by improving their relative bargaining position. They have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets. However, this can lead to hostility between wives and husbands who feel inadequate or ashamed at their inability to fulfil their traditional role as [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]]. The hostility and resentment from the husband can also be a source of [[domestic violence]].<ref>[[#Menj\u00edvar|Menj\u00edvar (1999)]]</ref> Studies have also been done which point to changes in family structures as a result of migrant labour. These changes include increased divorce rates and decrease in household stability. Additionally, female migrant labour has been indicated as a source for more egalitarian relationships within the family, decline of extended family patterns, and more nuclear families.<ref name=\"Morokvasic\"/> There is also a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.<ref name=\"Parle\">[[#Parle|de Parle (2007)]]</ref>\n\nResearchers identified three groups of women to represent the dimensions of gender roles in Singapore. The first group is made up of expatriate wives who are often reduced to dependent spouse status by immigration laws. The second group are housewives who left work in order to take care of the children at home. Although they are from the Singaporean middle class, they are stuck at almost the same level and share status with the third group, foreign domestic workers. Because of global economic restructuring and global city formation, the mobility of female labours is increasing. However, they are controlled through strict enforcement and they are statistically invisible in migration data. The female foreign domestic workers are always gender-stereotyped as maids and generalized as low wages workers in society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yeoh|first=Brenda S.A.|title=Global Cities, Transnational Flows and Gender Dimensions, The View From Singapore|year=2000|publisher=Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG|location=Department of Geography, University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\n=== Women Migrant Workers: The Informal Sector ===\nThe spread of global [[neoliberalism]] has contributed to physically displaced people, which translates to displaced workers, worldwide. Due to the national and transnational economic push and pull of migration, growing numbers of women migrant workers find themselves employed in the underground and informal sector. To be clear, these women tended not to be previously employed in the formal sector, if at all. Frequently, the cheap and flexible labor is sought in more developed areas. Also, these women migrant workers are often considered an asset to employers who think of these individuals as docile, compliant, and disposable.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Disposable Women and Other Myths of Global Capitalism|last=Wright|first=Melissa|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|location=London and New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWork found in the informal economy is defined as being outside the legal regulation of the state. This underground sector includes nontraditional types of employment: intimate care,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Globalizing Care Economies and Migrant Workers: Explorations in Global Care Chains|last=Yeates|first=Nicola|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=|location=Basingstoke|pages=}}</ref> [[street vending]], [[community gardening]], food selling, sewing and tailoring, [[laundry]] service, water selling, car cleaning, home cleaning, and various kinds of [[artisan]] production.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development, and Globalization: Economics As if all People Mattered.|last=Bene\u00eda|first=Lourdes|last2=Berik|first2=G\u00fcnseli|last3=Floro|first3=Maira S.|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>  These positions are frequently precarious and lack the social contracts often found between employee and employer in the formal sector. This unofficial economy is often found in locations that are between home and work and combine personal and private spaces. Because migrant women workers often occupy the lowest economic positions, this leaves them especially vulnerable to exploitation and dangerous working conditions. Incidentally, [[Guy Standing (economist)|Guy Standing]] has termed this kind of vulnerable worker, the [[Precariat]].\n\nWomen are frequently at the bottom of the economic hierarchy due to various factors, mainly a lack of opportunity to support themselves and their families and in addition, a lack of adequate education. Despite the [[United Nations Girls' Education Initiative|United Nations' Girls Education Initiative]], there remains high rates of [[Literacy|illiteracy]] among women in the Global South. Commonly, the informal sector is the only place where geographically displaced workers are able to insert themselves into the economy. Thus, women migrant workers perform a high percentage of work found in this sector.\n\nDue in part to complex migration issues which include the restructuring of gendered and familiar relations, women migrant workers frequently care for children without a local family network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Maylei|date=2010|title=Lideres Campesinas: Nepantla Strategies and Grassroots Organizing at the Intersection of Gender and Globalization|url=|journal=Aztlan: A Journal of Chicano Studies|volume=35|pages=13\u201347|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Intimate Migrations: Gender, Family, and Illegality Among Transnational Mexicans|last=Boehm|first=Deborah A.|publisher=New York University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> The informal sector allows for public and private space to be merged and accommodate their care-taking responsibilities.

Mainly, they leave places in search of better opportunities, most often financial. In addition to the financial push, women also migrate to escape oppressive environments and/or abusive spouses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Servants of Globalization: Migration and Domestic Work|last=Parre\u00f1as|first=Rachel|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=61\u201379}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Good Gingrich|first=Luann|date=2010|title=The Symbolic Economy of Trans-Border Governance: A Case Study of Subjective Exclusion and Migrant Women from Mexico.|url=|journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly|volume=29|pages=161\u2013184|doi=10.1093/rsq/hdq008}}</ref>\n\n===Children of female migrant workers===\n[[File:8c35333.jpg|thumb|Group of Florida migrants near [[Shawboro, North Carolina]] on their way to [[Cranbury, New Jersey]], to pick potatoes]]\nMigrant labour of women also raises special concerns about children. Female migrant workers may not have enough possibilities to care for their own children whilst being abroad. Their children may learn to regard their relatives at home as their parents and may rarely see their mothers. Frequently, children of migrant workers become migrant workers themselves. There is concern that this may have negative psychological effects on the children who are left behind. Although this has not been proven to be entirely true or false, studies have been done which show that many children of migrant workers manage reasonably well. One theory states that remittances to some degree make up for the lack of care by providing more resources for food and clothing. Additionally, some migrant mothers take great care in attempting to maintain familial relationships while abroad.<ref name=\"Parle\"/>\n\n==Migrant education==\n''See [[Migrant education]].''\n[[File:A school for the children of white migrant farm workers is maintained at the Osceola Farm Labor Supply Center... - NARA - 512800.tif|upright=1.8|thumb|A school for the children of white migrant farm workers, circa 1945]]\nChildren of [[migrant workers]] struggle to achieve the same level of educational success as their peers. Relocation, whether it is a singular or regular occurrence, causes discontinuity in education, which causes migrant students to progress slowly through school and drop out at high rates. Additionally, relocation has negative social consequences on students: isolation from peers due to cultural differences and [[language barrier]]s. Migrant children are also at a disadvantage because the majority live in [[extreme poverty]] and must work with their parents to support their families.<ref name=Kindler>{{cite journal |last=Kindler |first=Anneka L.|year=1995 |title=Education of Migrant Children in the United States|journal=[[Directions in Language and Education]] |volume=1 |issue=8 }}</ref> These barriers to equal educational attainment for children of migrant workers are present in countries all over the world.

[[Economic globalization]] has created more migrant workers than ever before. While developed countries have increased their demand for labour, especially unskilled labour, workers from developing countries are used. As a result, millions of workers and their families travel to other countries to find work. This influx of migrant workers contributes to growth of [[slum]]s and urban poverty, according to Mike Davis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Mike|title=Planet of Slums|year=2006|publisher=Verso|location=London}}</ref> Some of these workers, usually from rural areas, cannot afford housing in cities and thus live in slums.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Todaro|first=Michael P.|title=A Model of Labor Migration and Urban Unemployment in Less Developed Countries|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1969|volume=59|issue=1}}</ref> Some of these unskilled workers living in slums suffer from unemployment and make a living in the [[informal sector]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Indrani|author2=Arup Mitra|title=Rural Migrants and Labour Segmentation: Micro-Level Evidence from Delhi Slums|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2002|volume=37|issue=2}}</ref> According to International Labor Organization, as of 2013 there were approximately 175 million migrants around the world.<ref>{{cite web|last=Labour Organization (ILO)|first=International|title=Migrant Workers|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/migrant-workers/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Standards|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Exploitation and enslavement of migrant workers==\n{{see also|Human trafficking}}\n\nRecruitment of international workers through employment agencies is a common phenomenon in developed countries, such as the United States or the [[UAE]].

The remittances they send back keeps the Philippine economy afloat.The government doesn't seem to provide any protection when these overseas Filipino workers run into distress. This labour export policy is still one of their pillars of development \u2013 pushing people to other countries instead of addressing poverty or lack of jobs at home.\"<ref name=\"ipsnews.net\"/> Instead of sending workers out just because the process helps the economy at their countries of origin, the country needs to examine ways in which they can work with the people to obtain jobs or at least create more jobs. When their skilled workers come to the United States and are often exploited, sexually, physically and mentally it not only affects the worker, but also the country upon their return-or if they are able to return at all due to the conditions they face. These are risky jobs and journeys taken by migrants to ensure themselves better lives and also their families. The governments need to do more. \"The exploitative immigration system of the U.S. works hand-in-hand with the corrupt labour export policy of the Philippines to maintain a steadily increasing flow of cheap, temporary migrant labour.\"<ref name=\"ipsnews.net\"/>\n\n==Effects on migrant workers' health==\nMonica Rosales (a professor from Colorado State University) describes work-related injuries in her journal article titled \"Life in the field: Migrant farm workers\u2019 perceptions of work related injuries\".

Rosales discussed how these working conditions affect the lives of immigrants.

For some countries, internal migrants outnumber those who migrate internationally. For example, 120 million people were estimated to migrate internally in China compared to 458,000 people who migrated internationally for work.<ref name=\"prb\">[[#Deshingkar|Deshingkar & Grimm (2005)]]</ref> Situations of surplus labour in rural areas because of scarcity of arable land is a common \"push factor\" in the move of individuals to urban-based industries and service jobs. Environmental factors including drought, [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], and river-bank erosion also contribute to internal migration.<ref name=\"prb\"/>\n\nThere are four spatial patterns of internal migration:<ref name=\"prb\"/>\n# Rural-rural migration: in many poor countries like Senegal, rural-rural migration occurs when labourers from poorer regions travel to agriculturally-rich and irrigated areas which have more work.\n# Rural-urban migration: seen in the urbanizing economies of Asia, migration of poor agricultural workers move to larger cities and manufacturing centers.\n# Urban-rural migration: migration that occurs when individuals retire back to their villages. Often, migrants who return bring back skill sets that benefit their home areas tremendously.\n# Urban-urban migration: as the predominant form of internal migration, this movement takes place from the centre of towns to the outer areas of the town.\n\n[[Circular migration]], the temporary and repetitive movement of a migrant worker between home and host areas, can occur both internally and transnationally.\n\n== Migrant workers as theorists ==\n{{Confusing|section|Template talk=Talk:Migrant_worker#Migrant_workers_as_theorists|reason=it uses too much academic jargon|date=March 2019}}\nIn 2015, scholar Gabriela Raquel R\u00edos published \"Cultivating Land-Based Literacies and Rhetorics,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=R\u00ecos|first=Gabriela|date=2015-03-16|title=Cultivating Land-Based Literacies and Rhetorics|journal=Literacy in Composition Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=60\u201370\u201370|doi=10.21623/1.3.1.5|issn=2326-5620|doi-access=free}}</ref>\" in which she theorizes the phrase \"land-based literacies and rhetorics.\" Her definition is as follows: <blockquote>These literacies (acts of interpretation and communication) and rhetorics (organizational and community-building practices) ultimately build a theory that 1) recognizes the ways in which land can produce relations and 2) recognizes the value of embodied ways of knowing (60).</blockquote>R\u00edos argues that migrant workers' rhetorical practices incorporate their relationship to land and labor in addition to language.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Body shopping|Body Shops]]\n* [[Bracero program]] (historical American guest-worker program)\n* [[Dekasegi]]\n* [[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n* [[Farmworker]]\n* [[Feminization of migration]]\n* [[Foreign worker]]\n** [[Foreign Worker Visa]]\n* [[Gastarbeiter]] (historical German guest-worker program)\n** [[Turks in Germany]]\n* [[Global mobility]]\n* [[Guest worker program]] (a proposed foreign-worker program in the U.S.)\n* ''[[Harvest of Shame]]'', 1960 television documentary presented by [[Edward R.

It is the seat of the [[List of bishops of Lund|Bishop of Lund]] and the main church of the [[Diocese of Lund]]. It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the archiepiscopal see of all the Nordic countries, dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the mightiest representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the [[Nordic countries]]\". Its main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"The giant Finn and his wife\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658 the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes done during the 19th century went very far; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and pieces of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over the church.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see covering all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The crypt, the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Crypt of Lund Cathedral.png|thumb|right|Plan of the crypt]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a bishopric and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have promted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates on the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars in the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin the be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, e.g. in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe in Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was by and large similar to the one see today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, repairs were continuously made during the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of Zettervall]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the situation in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while also making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately got his will through, for the most part.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862 Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades in effect rebuild the cathedral largely in line with the proposal from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

Five decorated [[archivolt]]s supported by small columns with variously decorated [[capital (architecture)|capitals]], frame a [[tympanon]] depicting the [[Lamb of God]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=70\u201371}} The northern portal is slightly later and more richly decorated. The original western portal is not preserved, but a [[baldachin]] now immured in the east wall of the north transept may have been part of it; Its columns have [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]] and support a richly decorated archivolt on which traces of original paint survives. Opposite, in the south wall, is a smaller baldachin where the columns themselves are sculpted angels (one with [[feather tights]]) standing on lions. Similar sculptures exist in e.g. [[Como]] and Modena in northern Italy.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=74\u201375}} In addition, the capitals of the columns in the church are all of high artisanal quality, and can be broadly divided into two groups displaying either [[Classical architecture|Classical]] or [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] influences.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=75}} Apart from its rich Romanesque decoration, Lund Cathedral also contains several late medieval sculptures made by Adam van D\u00fcren, as mentioned above. Several of these are of animals and contain inscriptions in [[Low German]]. A relief in the south transept displaying the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] flanked by Saint Lawrence and Saint Canute is similar to the portal relief van D\u00fcren made a couple of years earlier at [[Glimmingehus]].{{sfn|Svanberg|1996|p=196\u2013197}}\n\n===Altarpiece===\nThe medieval main [[altarpiece]] was donated to the cathedral in 1398 by [[Ide Pedersdatter Falk]].<ref name=kor>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/hogkoret/|title= Gyllene mosaik och korstolar fr\u00e5n 1300-talet|trans-title= Golden mosaics and choir stalls from the 14th century|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref> The altarpiece is stylistically similar to a group of altarpieces from northern Germany.

Their style is [[Gothic art|High Gothic]] and they are stylistically linked with contemporary art from the Rhine Valley. They are among the largest wooden Gothic sculptures to survive in the Nordic countries, and have been described as being of internationally high quality.

It is the seat of the [[List of bishops of Lund|Bishop of Lund]] and the main church of the [[Diocese of Lund]]. It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the archiepiscopal see of all the Nordic countries, dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the mightiest representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the [[Nordic countries]]\". Its main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"The giant Finn and his wife\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658 the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes done during the 19th century went very far; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and pieces of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over the church.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see covering all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The crypt, the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Crypt of Lund Cathedral.png|thumb|right|Plan of the crypt]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a bishopric and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have promted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates on the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars in the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin the be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, e.g. in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe in Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was by and large similar to the one see today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, repairs were continuously made during the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of Zettervall]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the situation in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while also making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately got his will through, for the most part.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862 Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades in effect rebuild the cathedral largely in line with the proposal from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

Five decorated [[archivolt]]s supported by small columns with variously decorated [[capital (architecture)|capitals]], frame a [[tympanon]] depicting the [[Lamb of God]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=70\u201371}} The northern portal is slightly later and more richly decorated. The original western portal is not preserved, but a [[baldachin]] now immured in the east wall of the north transept may have been part of it; Its columns have [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]] and support a richly decorated archivolt on which traces of original paint survives. Opposite, in the south wall, is a smaller baldachin where the columns themselves are sculpted angels (one with [[feather tights]]) standing on lions. Similar sculptures exist in e.g. [[Como]] and Modena in northern Italy.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=74\u201375}} In addition, the capitals of the columns in the church are all of high artisanal quality, and can be broadly divided into two groups displaying either [[Classical architecture|Classical]] or [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] influences.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=75}} Apart from its rich Romanesque decoration, Lund Cathedral also contains several late medieval sculptures made by Adam van D\u00fcren, as mentioned above. Several of these are of animals and contain inscriptions in [[Low German]]. A relief in the south transept displaying the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] flanked by Saint Lawrence and Saint Canute is similar to the portal relief van D\u00fcren made a couple of years earlier at [[Glimmingehus]].{{sfn|Svanberg|1996|p=196\u2013197}}\n\n===Altarpiece===\nThe medieval main [[altarpiece]] was donated to the cathedral in 1398 by [[Ide Pedersdatter Falk]].<ref name=kor>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/hogkoret/|title= Gyllene mosaik och korstolar fr\u00e5n 1300-talet|trans-title= Golden mosaics and choir stalls from the 14th century|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref> The altarpiece is stylistically similar to a group of altarpieces from northern Germany.

Their style is [[Gothic art|High Gothic]] and they are stylistically linked with contemporary art from the Rhine Valley. They are among the largest wooden Gothic sculptures to survive in the Nordic countries, and have been described as being of internationally high quality.

headquartered in [[Lyon]], [[France]]. The network began broadcasting on 1 January 1993 and aimed to cover world news from a [[Pan-European identity|pan-European]] perspective.\n\nIt is jointly owned by several European and [[North Africa]]n state broadcasting organizations, and since 2015 majority-owned (53%) by Media Globe Networks led by Egyptian billionaire [[Naguib Sawiris]] who is chairman of the supervisory board.

The channel's first broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from Lyon. An additional broadcast studio was set up in London in 1996. It was founded by a group of ten public broadcasters:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Richard|title=From Satellite to Single Market: New Communication Technology and European Public Service Television|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|location=London|pages=130|isbn=9780415179706}}</ref>\n\n*[[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation|CyBC]], Cyprus\n*[[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]], France\n*[[RAI]], Italy\n*[[RTBF]], Belgium\n*[[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]], Portugal\n*[[RTVE]], Spain (former shareholder)\n*[[TMC (TV channel)|TMC]], Monaco (former shareholder)\n*[[Yle]], Finland\n*[[ERTU]], Egypt\n\nIn 1997, the British news broadcaster [[ITN]] purchased a 49 percent share of Euronews for \u00a35.1&nbsp;million from [[Alcatel-Lucent]].<ref>{{cite news|title=ITN Acquires 49% Euronews Stake|date=1 December 1997|url=https://www.telecompaper.com/news/itn-acquires-49-euronews-stake--124079|work=Telecom Paper|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> ITN supplies the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders, which are represented by the '''SOCEMIE''' ({{lang-fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9ditrice de la cha\u00eene europ\u00e9enne multilingue d'information Euronews}}) [[consortium]].

The service was designed for viewers for whom \"watching news is not an option\" by providing a direct simulcast to the TV channel, with \"No Comment\" segment being replaced by music. The music of the bulletin openings is also transmitted on Euronews Radio. Weather reports are read by a female announcer.\n\n===Africanews===\n{{main|Africanews}}\n\nOn 20 April 2016, the French subsidiary of Euronews launched an African version of their news service called Africanews in French and English.\n\n===Partnership with NBC===\nIn November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with [[NBCUniversal]], the parent company of [[NBC News]], for a \"strategic partnership\". NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC News, Euronews in Talks for Strategic Partnership|date=11 November 2016|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/global/nbc-news-euronews-talks-strategic-partnership-1201915855/|work=Variety Media|accessdate=11 November 2016}}</ref> After successful negotiations with the [[European Commission]], who feared that the partnership would result in an ''Americanization'' of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finally purchased a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for $30&nbsp;million. NBC News president [[Deborah Turness]] was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, who had led it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both report directly to NBC News chairman [[Andrew Lack (executive)|Andrew Lack]]. The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Palmeri|first1=Christopher|title=NBC Acquires Stake in Euronews, Taps U.S. News Chief to Lead It|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-14/nbc-acquires-stake-in-euronews-taps-u-s-news-chief-to-lead-it|accessdate=17 February 2017|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=14 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Sawiris and NBC News have the largest stakes in Euronews, editorial control by SOCEMIE members has been assured, with the broadcasters having seven slots in the editorial board, as opposed to Sawiris' company (which has three slots) and NBC News, which only has one, thereby reducing rumors of an ''Americanization'' of Euronews' values.

The ''glocal'' strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalize the content and presentation of their channel, not only by sharing own-produced content with other languages but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions. The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.panoramaaudiovisual.com/2017/05/10/euronews-reinventa-su-oferta-de-difusion-y-digital/|title=Euronews reinventa su oferta de difusi\u00f3n y digital (in Spanish)|date=10 May 2017|website=Panorama Audiovisual}}</ref>\n\nAlongside the major language split, satellite distribution for the German, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish channels was discontinued, now being only available via fiber-optic IP uplink.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the discontinuation of the German-language channel from satellite distribution generated outcry from many German satellite TV owners, resulting in the restoration of the German-language channel on the [[Astra 1L]] satellite on 25 July 2017, via an unencrypted SD feed sitting alongside the French-language channel. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2017/07/26/euronews-puts-german-channel-back-on-satellite/|title=Euronews puts German channel back on satellite|last=Krieger|first=J\u00f6rn|date=26 July 2017|work=Broadband TV News}}</ref> Additionally, the Arabic and Persian language editions became available only on Euronews' website and apps, with the TV channels being discontinued, and the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright, due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesatellite.com/actu/49612-fin-de-la-version-ukrainienne-euronews.html|title=Fin de la version ukrainienne d'Euronews (in French)|date=23 May 2017|work=T\u00e9l\u00e9 Satellite et Num\u00e9rique}}</ref> Finally, the Euronews channel in English became known as the ''World'' edition, and distribution to premises in the American continent via fiber-optic IP uplink is set to begin later in 2018.<ref name=\":0\" /> These changes caused the elimination of 43 staff positions, mainly from the Ukrainian edition, causing major layoffs and production staff having more flexible roles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/actualite-economique/euronews-43-departs-a-l-issue-du-plan-de-sauvegarde_1911482.html|title=Euronews: 43 d\u00e9parts \u00e0 l'issue du plan de sauvegarde (in French)|date=24 May 2017|work=L'Express-L'Expansion}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Euronews' English-language channel began to gradually revamp its programming schedule, with the roll-out of a new slate of presenter-led programming to complement its already existing shows, a move that was reported earlier in the year, after the success of its presenter-led special reports and weekly programming introduced in recent years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.a516digital.com/2018/01/big-changes-for-euronews-in-2018.html|title=Big changes for Euronews in 2018|date=2 January 2018|work=a516digital}}</ref> Alongside conventional rolling news shows, debate programming, talk shows, and new presenter-led shows will be offered during the weekly schedule, and throughout programs, Euronews reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/05/11/euronews-overhauls-its-broadcasting-strategy-bid-become-the-unrivalled-chronicler|title=Euronews overhauls its broadcasting strategy in bid to become the unrivaled chronicler of Europe|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=11 May 2017|work=The Drum}}</ref>\n\nThe roll-out began on 22 May, when Euronews debuted the first of these new shows, ''Good Morning Europe'', a five-hour morning show which airs every weekday morning from 7 am. It was first anchored by former [[RT (TV network)|RT]] correspondent and [[TVB Pearl]] news presenter Tesa Arcilla, which anchored it on a temporary basis. Some weeks later, former [[France 24]] presenter Belle Donati began presenting the show, alternating with Arcilla; after she moved to [[Brussels]] in September, she became the main anchor of the slot. Two months later, on 17 July, Euronews debuted a six-hour breaking news show, ''Euronews Now'', anchored by Tokunbo Salako, covering the dayside and afternoon slots. On 3 September, the new evening program lineup was launched, starting with a politics-focused show, ''Raw Politics'', hosted by Tesa Arcilla, and featuring former [[Sky News]] reporter Darren McCaffrey from [[Brussels]]. Two weeks later, on 17 September, the full roll-out was completed with the introduction of a 5-hour evening rolling news show, ''Euronews Tonight'', presented by former [[Sky News]] and [[BBC News]] presenter [[Sam Naz]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2018/08/09/inside-euronews-nbc-fresh-rolling-news-channel-striving-help-save-united-europe|title=Inside Euronews NBC: a fresh rolling news channel striving to help save united Europe|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=9 August 2018|work=The Drum|access-date=}}</ref> The traditional pre-produced blocks of video content still remains on late nights and weekends. Most overnights now repeat the previous day's edition (either full or half-length) of ''Euronews Now''.\n\nNew weekly programming is also being produced, including the weekly interview series ''Uncut'', which feature conversations from political leaders and newsmakers worldwide with minimum to no editing. The first episodes feature German-French politician [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] interviewing former [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] about [[Brexit]]. Additionally, a new social media unit was created, with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it. The newly-created team help to produce ''The Cube'', a social media segment during rolling news shows, focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media, with special attention at the major stories of the day. ''No Comment'', a long-standing element of Euronews' programming, remains on the channels' schedule, and it's being gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English-language channel.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAdditionally, a major investment in mobile reporting via [[iPhone]] devices helped Euronews gain a major [[Scoop (news)|scoop]], becoming the only TV news outlet worldwide to broadcast live coverage from the [[Aquarius Dignitus|MV Aquarius]], with Paris correspondent Annelise Borges (formerly with [[France 24]]) on assignment. Borges broadcast lives for 10 days as the new Italian far-right government denied the Aquarius access to Italian ports. The coverage made headlines on many news outlets worldwide and helped Euronews boost its credibility and its audience.<ref name=\":2\" /> The new Euronews also hired new correspondents in London, Berlin, Moscow, Rome, Madrid and Washington D.C., and gained access to NBC News' large network of correspondents worldwide. This included [[Jack Parrock]] in the Euronews Brussels bureau. \n\nAs of September 2018, the other language editions are unaffected, with the pre-produced blocks of video content remaining at all times, although there are plans to introduce presenter-led programming during the morning slots on these other channels.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter the takeover of [[Sky (company)|Sky plc]] by NBCUniversal's parent company [[Comcast]] on 22 September 2018, EuronewsNBC will increase its worldwide reach, as it plans to closely integrate its operations (and those of NBC News) with those of [[Sky News]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/card/what-s-so-great-about-sky-n890601|title=What's so great about Sky?|last=Atkinson|first=Claire|date=11 July 2018|work=NBCNews.com}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe channel is available in 430&nbsp;million households in 166 countries worldwide.

headquartered in [[Lyon]], [[France]]. The network began broadcasting on 1 January 1993 and aimed to cover world news from a [[Pan-European identity|pan-European]] perspective.\n\nIt is jointly owned by several European and [[North Africa]]n state broadcasting organizations, and since 2015 majority-owned (53%) by Media Globe Networks led by Egyptian billionaire [[Naguib Sawiris]] who is chairman of the supervisory board. It is also a provider of [[live streaming world news]] which can be viewed via its website, [[YouTube]], and various [[mobile devices]] and [[digital media players]].\n\n==History and organisation==\n[[File: Euronews HQ \u00a9euronews photo St\u00e9phane Audras 2015.10.15 (169).JPG|thumb|Euronews headquarters in Lyon]]\n\nIn 1992, following the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], during which [[CNN]]'s position as the preeminent source of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news]] programming was cemented, the [[European Broadcasting Union]] decided to establish Euronews to present information from a European perspective. The channel's first broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from Lyon. An additional broadcast studio was set up in London in 1996. It was founded by a group of ten public broadcasters:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Richard|title=From Satellite to Single Market: New Communication Technology and European Public Service Television|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|location=London|pages=130|isbn=9780415179706}}</ref>\n\n*[[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation|CyBC]], Cyprus\n*[[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]], France\n*[[RAI]], Italy\n*[[RTBF]], Belgium\n*[[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]], Portugal\n*[[RTVE]], Spain (former shareholder)\n*[[TMC (TV channel)|TMC]], Monaco (former shareholder)\n*[[Yle]], Finland\n*[[ERTU]], Egypt\n\nIn 1997, the British news broadcaster [[ITN]] purchased a 49 percent share of Euronews for \u00a35.1&nbsp;million from [[Alcatel-Lucent]].<ref>{{cite news|title=ITN Acquires 49% Euronews Stake|date=1 December 1997|url=https://www.telecompaper.com/news/itn-acquires-49-euronews-stake--124079|work=Telecom Paper|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> ITN supplies the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders, which are represented by the '''SOCEMIE''' ({{lang-fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9ditrice de la cha\u00eene europ\u00e9enne multilingue d'information Euronews}}) [[consortium]].

The service was designed for viewers for whom \"watching news is not an option\" by providing a direct simulcast to the TV channel, with \"No Comment\" segment being replaced by music. The music of the bulletin openings is also transmitted on Euronews Radio. Weather reports are read by a female announcer.\n\n===Africanews===\n{{main|Africanews}}\n\nOn 20 April 2016, the French subsidiary of Euronews launched an African version of their news service called Africanews in French and English.\n\n===Partnership with NBC===\nIn November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with [[NBCUniversal]], the parent company of [[NBC News]], for a \"strategic partnership\". NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC News, Euronews in Talks for Strategic Partnership|date=11 November 2016|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/global/nbc-news-euronews-talks-strategic-partnership-1201915855/|work=Variety Media|accessdate=11 November 2016}}</ref> After successful negotiations with the [[European Commission]], who feared that the partnership would result in an ''Americanization'' of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finally purchased a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for $30&nbsp;million. NBC News president [[Deborah Turness]] was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, who had led it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both report directly to NBC News chairman [[Andrew Lack (executive)|Andrew Lack]]. The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Palmeri|first1=Christopher|title=NBC Acquires Stake in Euronews, Taps U.S. News Chief to Lead It|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-14/nbc-acquires-stake-in-euronews-taps-u-s-news-chief-to-lead-it|accessdate=17 February 2017|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=14 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Sawiris and NBC News have the largest stakes in Euronews, editorial control by SOCEMIE members has been assured, with the broadcasters having seven slots in the editorial board, as opposed to Sawiris' company (which has three slots) and NBC News, which only has one, thereby reducing rumors of an ''Americanization'' of Euronews' values.

The ''glocal'' strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalize the content and presentation of their channel, not only by sharing own-produced content with other languages but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions. The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.panoramaaudiovisual.com/2017/05/10/euronews-reinventa-su-oferta-de-difusion-y-digital/|title=Euronews reinventa su oferta de difusi\u00f3n y digital (in Spanish)|date=10 May 2017|website=Panorama Audiovisual}}</ref>\n\nAlongside the major language split, satellite distribution for the German, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish channels was discontinued, now being only available via fiber-optic IP uplink.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the discontinuation of the German-language channel from satellite distribution generated outcry from many German satellite TV owners, resulting in the restoration of the German-language channel on the [[Astra 1L]] satellite on 25 July 2017, via an unencrypted SD feed sitting alongside the French-language channel. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2017/07/26/euronews-puts-german-channel-back-on-satellite/|title=Euronews puts German channel back on satellite|last=Krieger|first=J\u00f6rn|date=26 July 2017|work=Broadband TV News}}</ref> Additionally, the Arabic and Persian language editions became available only on Euronews' website and apps, with the TV channels being discontinued, and the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright, due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesatellite.com/actu/49612-fin-de-la-version-ukrainienne-euronews.html|title=Fin de la version ukrainienne d'Euronews (in French)|date=23 May 2017|work=T\u00e9l\u00e9 Satellite et Num\u00e9rique}}</ref> Finally, the Euronews channel in English became known as the ''World'' edition, and distribution to premises in the American continent via fiber-optic IP uplink is set to begin later in 2018.<ref name=\":0\" /> These changes caused the elimination of 43 staff positions, mainly from the Ukrainian edition, causing major layoffs and production staff having more flexible roles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/actualite-economique/euronews-43-departs-a-l-issue-du-plan-de-sauvegarde_1911482.html|title=Euronews: 43 d\u00e9parts \u00e0 l'issue du plan de sauvegarde (in French)|date=24 May 2017|work=L'Express-L'Expansion}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Euronews' English-language channel began to gradually revamp its programming schedule, with the roll-out of a new slate of presenter-led programming to complement its already existing shows, a move that was reported earlier in the year, after the success of its presenter-led special reports and weekly programming introduced in recent years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.a516digital.com/2018/01/big-changes-for-euronews-in-2018.html|title=Big changes for Euronews in 2018|date=2 January 2018|work=a516digital}}</ref> Alongside conventional rolling news shows, debate programming, talk shows, and new presenter-led shows will be offered during the weekly schedule, and throughout programs, Euronews reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/05/11/euronews-overhauls-its-broadcasting-strategy-bid-become-the-unrivalled-chronicler|title=Euronews overhauls its broadcasting strategy in bid to become the unrivaled chronicler of Europe|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=11 May 2017|work=The Drum}}</ref>\n\nThe roll-out began on 22 May, when Euronews debuted the first of these new shows, ''Good Morning Europe'', a five-hour morning show which airs every weekday morning from 7 am.

Some weeks later, former [[France 24]] presenter Belle Donati began presenting the show, alternating with Arcilla; after she moved to [[Brussels]] in September, she became the main anchor of the slot. Two months later, on 17 July, Euronews debuted a six-hour breaking news show, ''Euronews Now'', anchored by Tokunbo Salako, covering the dayside and afternoon slots. On 3 September, the new evening program lineup was launched, starting with a politics-focused show, ''Raw Politics'', hosted by Tesa Arcilla, and featuring former [[Sky News]] reporter Darren McCaffrey from [[Brussels]]. Two weeks later, on 17 September, the full roll-out was completed with the introduction of a 5-hour evening rolling news show, ''Euronews Tonight'', presented by former [[Sky News]] and [[BBC News]] presenter [[Sam Naz]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2018/08/09/inside-euronews-nbc-fresh-rolling-news-channel-striving-help-save-united-europe|title=Inside Euronews NBC: a fresh rolling news channel striving to help save united Europe|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=9 August 2018|work=The Drum|access-date=}}</ref> The traditional pre-produced blocks of video content still remains on late nights and weekends.

The first episodes feature German-French politician [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] interviewing former [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] about [[Brexit]]. Additionally, a new social media unit was created, with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it. The newly-created team help to produce ''The Cube'', a social media segment during rolling news shows, focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media, with special attention at the major stories of the day. ''No Comment'', a long-standing element of Euronews' programming, remains on the channels' schedule, and it's being gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English-language channel.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAdditionally, a major investment in mobile reporting via [[iPhone]] devices helped Euronews gain a major [[Scoop (news)|scoop]], becoming the only TV news outlet worldwide to broadcast live coverage from the [[Aquarius Dignitus|MV Aquarius]], with Paris correspondent Annelise Borges (formerly with [[France 24]]) on assignment. Borges broadcast lives for 10 days as the new Italian far-right government denied the Aquarius access to Italian ports. The coverage made headlines on many news outlets worldwide and helped Euronews boost its credibility and its audience.<ref name=\":2\" /> The new Euronews also hired new correspondents in London, Berlin, Moscow, Rome, Madrid and Washington D.C., and gained access to NBC News' large network of correspondents worldwide.

Ibid: p.207</ref>\n\nReferences to a \"[[goon squad]]\" coming to town provoked theories that the song actually concerns [[fascism]] (\"the [[British National Front|National Front]] invade the discos\", inferred ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]]).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> However Bowie played down this interpretation in an interview shortly before the release of ''Scary Monsters'', saying that what he was trying to do was \"move on a little from that [[Ray Davies]] concept of fashion, to suggest more of a gritted teeth determination and an unsuredness about why one's doing it\".<ref>Angus MacKinnon (1980). \"The Future Isn't What It Used to Be\". ''[[NME]] (13 September 1980)'': p.37</ref> Biographer David Buckley believed the song \"poked fun at the banality of the dance-floor and the style fascists\" of the [[New Romantic]] movement.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination - David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp.372\u2013374</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n[[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] shot a music video for the single \"Fashion\" in a famous nightclub owned by his friend Robert Boykin called [[Hurrah (nightclub)|Hurrah]]. The opening shot of the clip features David Bowie on the Hurrah stage which was draped in khaki canvas for this shoot. The faceted mirror walls surrounding the dance floor can be seen in the background of various shots, and all the band scenes are shot in this club setting. Other locations around Manhattan are intercut throughout the clip. Amid a series of facial contortions and other gestures, Bowie made use of a move he had employed in the \"Ashes to Ashes\" video: slowly crouching and bringing his arm down to the ground in a slow vertical arc.

It was released as the second single from the album and was accompanied, like its predecessor \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", by a highly regarded music video.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.113-114</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp.75-76</ref>\n\nIt was ranked as the 8th best single of 1980 by the ''NME'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1980.html|title=Rocklist.net...NME End Of Year Lists 1980...|website=www.rocklistmusic.co.uk|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nAccording to co-producer [[Tony Visconti]], \"Fashion\" was the last song completed in the ''Scary Monsters'' sessions, its bassline and some of the melody taking inspiration from Bowie's 1975 hit \"[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> Guest guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] contributed a series of harsh, mechanical riffs to complement the band's [[funk]]/[[reggae]] arrangement.\n\nThe track was noted for its emotionally vacant choir effect, and the recurring [[onomatopoeia]] \"beep beep\" that Bowie had first used in an unreleased 1970 song called \"Rupert the Riley\".<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> Another phrase in the lyrics that Bowie borrowed from his past was \"People from Bad Homes\", the title track of a 1973 album he recorded with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s The Astronettes, which went unreleased until 1995.<ref>David Buckley (1999). Ibid: p.207</ref>\n\nReferences to a \"[[goon squad]]\" coming to town provoked theories that the song actually concerns [[fascism]] (\"the [[British National Front|National Front]] invade the discos\", inferred ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]]).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> However Bowie played down this interpretation in an interview shortly before the release of ''Scary Monsters'', saying that what he was trying to do was \"move on a little from that [[Ray Davies]] concept of fashion, to suggest more of a gritted teeth determination and an unsuredness about why one's doing it\".<ref>Angus MacKinnon (1980). \"The Future Isn't What It Used to Be\". ''[[NME]] (13 September 1980)'': p.37</ref> Biographer David Buckley believed the song \"poked fun at the banality of the dance-floor and the style fascists\" of the [[New Romantic]] movement.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination - David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp.372\u2013374</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n[[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] shot a music video for the single \"Fashion\" in a famous nightclub owned by his friend Robert Boykin called [[Hurrah (nightclub)|Hurrah]]. The opening shot of the clip features David Bowie on the Hurrah stage which was draped in khaki canvas for this shoot. The faceted mirror walls surrounding the dance floor can be seen in the background of various shots, and all the band scenes are shot in this club setting. Other locations around Manhattan are intercut throughout the clip. Amid a series of facial contortions and other gestures, Bowie made use of a move he had employed in the \"Ashes to Ashes\" video: slowly crouching and bringing his arm down to the ground in a slow vertical arc. ''[[Record Mirror]]'' readers voted \"Fashion\" and \"Ashes to Ashes\" the best music videos of 1980.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nThe video features [[Carlos Alomar]], [[G.E. Smith]] ([[Hall & Oates]]), [[Khandi Alexander]], [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]], the guitarist Steve Love who plays drums in the video, John Kay, [[May Pang]] (later married to the song's producer Tony Visconti) and [[Alan Hunter (VJ)|Alan Hunter]], who became one of the first MTV VJs and also the first VJ to appear in a music video.\n\n==Release and aftermath==\n\"Fashion\" was the second single from ''Scary Monsters'' and the first issued after the album's September 1980 release.
