Raburn signed and began playing in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]] at third base, his natural position. He originally was a member of the [[Gulf Coast League Tigers]], but was brought up to play on the [[Oneonta Tigers]] in July 2001. In 2001, Raburn was a part of [[Baseball America]]'s short-season all-star team. At one point, he was the [[New York\u2013Penn League]]'s player of the week and his eight [[triple (baseball)|triples]] were the most in that league during the season. However, Raburn also committed 23 errors, which tied for the league most by third basemen. After the 2001 season was over, Baseball America named Raburn as Detroit's 18th-best prospect.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nRaburn began 2002 unable to play because of a right hip strain. In July, he got back into action with a rehab stint in the Gulf Coast League. On July 17, he joined the [[West Michigan Whitecaps]]. He immediately started an eight-game hitting streak that lasted until July 25. During that stretch, Raburn posted a .355 batting average and drove in eight runs.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/> During the 2002 season, Raburn appeared in 40 games with West Michigan. He batted .220, hit six home runs and totaled 28 runs batted in.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/><ref name=\"BR Minors\">{{cite web|title=Ryan Raburn Minor League Statistics and History|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=raburn001rya|work=Sports-Reference.com|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=January 26, 2013}}</ref> After the season, Baseball America ranked Raburn as the Tigers' 25th-best prospect.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nRaburn started off the 2003 season with West Michigan, but he appeared in only 16 games for the Whitecaps before moving on to the [[Lakeland Tigers]] in late April. In his 95 games with Lakeland, he batted .222, with 12 homers and 56 RBI.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/><ref name=\"BR Minors\"/>\n\nIn 2004, the Tigers, lacking depth in the middle infield, moved Raburn to second base. Raburn was a September call-up during the 2004 season for the Tigers. He made his big league debut on September 12 and struck out in his first at bat. On September 16, Raburn got his first hit, an RBI double on a pitch from [[Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[CC Sabathia]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nRaburn spent the entire 2005 season with Toledo, posting a .253 batting average and hitting 19 home runs in 130 games.<ref name=\"BR Minors\"/> He committed the most errors (21) by any second baseman in the [[International League]]. During the postseason, he batted .348 and drove in 3 runs. He was rated by Baseball America as the 18th-best minor league prospect for the Tigers at season's end.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nFollowing the 2006 season, the Tigers chose to not add Raburn to the [[40-man roster]]. This left him unprotected in the [[Rule 5 draft]], allowing any team to add him for a cost of $50,000, provided he spent the entire season on a major league roster. Raburn was not selected and returned to the Tigers and their Triple-A affiliate [[Toledo Mud Hens]].\n\n====2007 season====\nRaburn returned to the major leagues for the first time since 2004 when Tigers utility infielder [[Neifi P\u00e9rez]] was suspended 25 games after testing positive for [[amphetamine]] usage. Raburn had a two-out RBI single in his first at bat of that season.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET200707060.shtml July 6, 2007 Boston Red Sox at Detroit Tigers Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> On July 25 against the [[Chicago White Sox]], Raburn went 4\u20135 with two home runs, a double and a single and had a total of seven RBIs.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA200707250.shtml July 25, 2007 Detroit Tigers at Chicago White Sox Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref>\n\nRaburn earned the 2007 Tigers Rookie of the Year award from the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association.\n\n[[File:Ryan Raburn on June 22, 2008.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Raburn playing for the [[2008 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers in 2008]]]]\n\n====2008 season====\nFor the first time in his career, Raburn started the season on Detroit's opening day roster. After getting into one game as a pinch runner, Raburn was sent down to Toledo on April 5. He made five appearances with the Mud Hens before rejoining the Tigers on April 13.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nDuring the 2008 season, Raburn made sporadic starts at third base, second base, and all three outfield positions.  Manager [[Jim Leyland]] often employed Raburn as a late-innings defensive replacement in the outfield or as a [[pinch runner]].\n\nRaburn hit his first career [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] on June 28, 2008 against [[Colorado Rockies]] pitcher [[Jeff Francis]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280628106 Tigers blow 3-run lead, overtake Rockies on Cabrera double].

He did not make the Tigers 25-man roster and began the 2009 season playing for the [[Toledo Mud Hens]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/> He was called up to Detroit on April 22, three days after [[Marcus Thames]] was placed on the [[disabled list]].<ref>{{cite book|title=2010 Tigers Information Guide|year=2010|pages=231|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/det/downloads/y2010/2010_DET_Media_Guide.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2009, Raburn made his first career start at first base.  It was the sixth different position he had started at in the major leagues.\n\nOn June 23, 2009, Raburn hit his first career [[walk-off home run]] to lift the Tigers over the Chicago Cubs 5\u20134.  According to Raburn, it was the first walk-off home run he had ever hit, including the minors leagues, college, high school, and [[Little League]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kornacki|first=Steve|title=Ryan Raburn's walkoff homer in ninth finishes what Brandon Inge started in Tigers' win vs. Cubs|url=http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2009/06/ryan_raburns_walk_off_homer_pu.html|publisher=MLive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2012|date=June 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====2010 season====\nRaburn entered the 2010 season as a key bench player expecting to see time at every defensive position except catcher and shortstop.  As of mid-June, he was regularly filling in for injured right fielder [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], but was hitting poorly. During the second half of the season, when he became an everyday starter primarily playing in the outfield, his bat heated up. By the end of 2010, he had played in 113 games, and sported a .280 batting average with 15 home runs and 61 RBIs.\n\n====2011 season====\n[[File:Ryan Raburn on August 14, 2011.jpg|200px|thumb|Raburn with the [[2011 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers in 2011]]]]\nRaburn signed a two-year contract extension after the 2010 season, and was a regular starter in left field at the beginning of the 2011 season. Near the end of May, Raburn took over at second base after [[Scott Sizemore]] was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]]. In addition, another Tiger second baseman, [[Carlos Guill\u00e9n]], was on the disabled list through the entire first half. Raburn's batting average slumped in the first half (.213 at the All-Star break), but he showed flashes of power with eight home runs. [[Andy Dirks]] and new acquisition [[Delmon Young]] played Raburn's left field position for much of the second half while he saw more time at second base. After another strong second half, Raburn finished the 2011 regular season at .256 with 14 home runs and 49 RBIs in 387 at-bats.\n\n====2012 season====\nAlthough his six Spring training homers shared the team lead,<ref>Wagner, John.

On September 16, Raburn got his first hit, an RBI double on a pitch from [[Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[CC Sabathia]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nRaburn spent the entire 2005 season with Toledo, posting a .253 batting average and hitting 19 home runs in 130 games.<ref name=\"BR Minors\"/> He committed the most errors (21) by any second baseman in the [[International League]]. During the postseason, he batted .348 and drove in 3 runs. He was rated by Baseball America as the 18th-best minor league prospect for the Tigers at season's end.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nFollowing the 2006 season, the Tigers chose to not add Raburn to the [[40-man roster]]. This left him unprotected in the [[Rule 5 draft]], allowing any team to add him for a cost of $50,000, provided he spent the entire season on a major league roster. Raburn was not selected and returned to the Tigers and their Triple-A affiliate [[Toledo Mud Hens]].\n\n====2007 season====\nRaburn returned to the major leagues for the first time since 2004 when Tigers utility infielder [[Neifi P\u00e9rez]] was suspended 25 games after testing positive for [[amphetamine]] usage. Raburn had a two-out RBI single in his first at bat of that season.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET200707060.shtml July 6, 2007 Boston Red Sox at Detroit Tigers Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> On July 25 against the [[Chicago White Sox]], Raburn went 4\u20135 with two home runs, a double and a single and had a total of seven RBIs.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA200707250.shtml July 25, 2007 Detroit Tigers at Chicago White Sox Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref>\n\nRaburn earned the 2007 Tigers Rookie of the Year award from the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association.\n\n[[File:Ryan Raburn on June 22, 2008.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Raburn playing for the [[2008 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers in 2008]]]]\n\n====2008 season====\nFor the first time in his career, Raburn started the season on Detroit's opening day roster. After getting into one game as a pinch runner, Raburn was sent down to Toledo on April 5. He made five appearances with the Mud Hens before rejoining the Tigers on April 13.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nDuring the 2008 season, Raburn made sporadic starts at third base, second base, and all three outfield positions.  Manager [[Jim Leyland]] often employed Raburn as a late-innings defensive replacement in the outfield or as a [[pinch runner]].\n\nRaburn hit his first career [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] on June 28, 2008 against [[Colorado Rockies]] pitcher [[Jeff Francis]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280628106 Tigers blow 3-run lead, overtake Rockies on Cabrera double].

He did not make the Tigers 25-man roster and began the 2009 season playing for the [[Toledo Mud Hens]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/> He was called up to Detroit on April 22, three days after [[Marcus Thames]] was placed on the [[disabled list]].<ref>{{cite book|title=2010 Tigers Information Guide|year=2010|pages=231|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/det/downloads/y2010/2010_DET_Media_Guide.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2009, Raburn made his first career start at first base.  It was the sixth different position he had started at in the major leagues.\n\nOn June 23, 2009, Raburn hit his first career [[walk-off home run]] to lift the Tigers over the Chicago Cubs 5\u20134.  According to Raburn, it was the first walk-off home run he had ever hit, including the minors leagues, college, high school, and [[Little League]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kornacki|first=Steve|title=Ryan Raburn's walkoff homer in ninth finishes what Brandon Inge started in Tigers' win vs. Cubs|url=http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2009/06/ryan_raburns_walk_off_homer_pu.html|publisher=MLive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2012|date=June 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====2010 season====\nRaburn entered the 2010 season as a key bench player expecting to see time at every defensive position except catcher and shortstop.  As of mid-June, he was regularly filling in for injured right fielder [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], but was hitting poorly. During the second half of the season, when he became an everyday starter primarily playing in the outfield, his bat heated up. By the end of 2010, he had played in 113 games, and sported a .280 batting average with 15 home runs and 61 RBIs.\n\n====2011 season====\n[[File:Ryan Raburn on August 14, 2011.jpg|200px|thumb|Raburn with the [[2011 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers in 2011]]]]\nRaburn signed a two-year contract extension after the 2010 season, and was a regular starter in left field at the beginning of the 2011 season. Near the end of May, Raburn took over at second base after [[Scott Sizemore]] was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]]. In addition, another Tiger second baseman, [[Carlos Guill\u00e9n]], was on the disabled list through the entire first half. Raburn's batting average slumped in the first half (.213 at the All-Star break), but he showed flashes of power with eight home runs. [[Andy Dirks]] and new acquisition [[Delmon Young]] played Raburn's left field position for much of the second half while he saw more time at second base. After another strong second half, Raburn finished the 2011 regular season at .256 with 14 home runs and 49 RBIs in 387 at-bats.\n\n====2012 season====\nAlthough his six Spring training homers shared the team lead,<ref>Wagner, John.

Lee initially declined to consider such a proposal until the film was completed, and was only persuaded otherwise in a second meeting arranged by [[Roy Thomas]], who wanted to edit the series. Since movie tie-in comics rarely sold well at that time, Lee negotiated a publishing arrangement which gave no royalties to Lucasfilm until sales exceeded 100,000.

[[Manesson Mallet]]: ''Art de la Guerre'', 1696]]\nThe term refers to all freeborn Ottoman Turkish mounted troops other than ''[[ak\u0131nc\u0131]]'' and tribal horsemen in the Ottoman army. The word was used almost synonymously with cavalry. The sipahis formed two distinct types of cavalry: feudal-like, provincial {{lang|ota-Latn|timarl\u0131 sipahi}} ([[timariots]]) which consisted most of the Ottoman army, and salaried, regular {{lang|ota-Latn|kap\u0131kulu sipahi}} (sipahi of the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]), which constituted the cavalry part of the Ottoman household troops.\n\nThe provincial governors, or [[beys]], were rotated every few years, preventing land inheritance.  The provinces, or [[sanjaks]], were not all equal since [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans]] were mostly ruled by Turks, while other areas of the empire were more flexible, adhering, somewhat, to local traditions.\n\nThe entwinement of land, military, politics, economics and religion was a way of life.\nThe [[timar]] system, where the sultan owned all land but individual plots of land, came with residential rights. The Ottoman people had rights to the land but the ''sipahi'', a unique kind of military aristocracy and cavalry portion of the military, also lived on the land with the farmers (90% of the population) and collected tax revenues, usually in-kind, to subsidize the costs of training and equipping the small army, dedicated to serving the sultan. The ''sipahi'' did not inherit anything, preventing power centres from growing and threatening the supreme power structure. The locals on the timar used the land and all it produced.<ref>{{cite book |title=Balance: The Economics of Great Powers From Ancient Rome to Modern America |last=Hubbard |first=Glenn |first2=Tim |last2=Kane |location= |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2013 |pages=148\u2013155 |isbn=978-1-4767-0025-0 }}</ref>\n\n== Timarli Sipahis ==\n{{main|Timariot}}\n[[File:Ralamb Sipahi.jpg|thumb|Miniature depicting an Anatolian Timariot, dating to before 1657.]]\n\n===Status===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe \"Timarli Sipahi\" or \"timariot\" (''t\u0131marl\u0131'') was the holder of a [[fiefdom|fief]] of land ({{lang|ar|\u062a\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0631 |rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|t\u00eem\u00e2r}}) granted directly by the Ottoman sultan or with his official permission by [[beylerbey]]s. He was entitled to all of the income from that land, in return for military service. The peasants on the land were subsequently attached thereto. Timarli Sipahis' status resembled that of the [[knight]]s of [[medieval Europe]]. Unlike medieval knights, they were not legally owners of their fiefs. The right to govern and collect taxes in a timar fief was merely given to a Timarli Sipahi by the Ottoman State. And in return, t\u0131marli sipahis were responsible for security of the people in their timar, enlisting and training ''cebelu'' soldiers for the army.\n\nA ''[[timar]]'' was the smallest unit of land held by a Sipahi, providing a yearly revenue of no more than 20,000 {{lang|ota-Latn|[[ak\u00e7e]]}}, which was between two and four times what a teacher earned.  A {{lang|ota-Latn|[[ziamet]]}} ({{lang|ota|\u0632\u0639\u0627\u0645\u062a|rtl=yes}}) was a larger unit of land, yielding up to 100,000 ak\u00e7e, and was owned by Sipahis of officer rank. A ''has'' ({{lang|ota|\u062e\u0627\u0635|rtl=yes}} ) was the largest unit of land, giving revenues of more than 100,000 ak\u00e7e, and was only held by the highest-ranking members of the military. A ''t\u00eem\u00e2r'' Sipahi was obliged to provide the army with up to five armed retainers ({{lang|ota-Latn|cebelu}}), a ''ziamet'' Sipahi with up to twenty, and a ''has'' Sipahi with far more than twenty. The ''cebelu'' (meaning \"armed, armored\") were expected to be mounted and fully equipped as the ''sipahi'' themselves; they were usually sons, brothers or nephews and their position was probably more similar to [[squire]]s than men-at-arms.\n\nThe sipahi were traditionally recruited among Turkic landowners, and thus, the non-Turkic provinces such as [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Greater Maghreb|Maghreb]] did not have sipahi. Recruitment of non-Turkic sipahi was banned with a 1635 ''[[ferman]]'' (decree). In contrast to the [[Janissaries]], Timarli Sipahis from that time onwards were Turks (Muslims). A rivalry between Jannisaries, who controlled the central bureaucracy of the empire and had a lot of political influence, and sipahis, who controlled the provincial bureaucracy and had the power of the army, prevented them from cooperating against the House of Osman.\n\nAlthough ''timars'' were not originally granted to their holders until perpetuity (the state inheriting the land at the death of the landholder), but by the end of the 17th century the estates were passed on from father to son.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fodor|first=P\u00e1l|title=Changes in the Structure and Strength of the Timariot Army from the Early Sixteenth to the End of the Seventeenth Century|url=https://www.academia.edu/35577776/Changes_in_the_Structure_and_Strength_of_the_Timariot_Army_from_the_Early_Sixteenth_to_the_End_of_the_Seventeenth_Century|journal=Eurasian Studies|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn wartime, Timarli sipahis and their retainers were gathered under their {{lang|ota-Latn|alay}} (regiment) [[bey]]s. Alay-beys were gathered with their troops under [[sanjak]] (province) beys, and [[sanjak-bey]]s gathered under [[beylerbey]]s. If a battle was to be fought in Europe, [[Rumeli]] (Balkan) Sipahis took the honorary right flank under the Rumeli beylerbey, while the Anatolian beylerbey and his Sipahis took the left flank; when a battle was in Asia, positions were switched. This way, the [[Ottoman classical army]]'s flanks wholly consisted of Timariot cavalry, while the center consisted of Janissary infantry and artillery divisions.\n [[File:Ottoman armour 1480-1500.jpg|thumb|Timariot armour dating to 1480\u20131500]]\nThe equipment and tactics differed between the Anatolian and Balkan Timarli Sipahi. The Anatolian Sipahi were equipped and fought as classic horse archers, shooting while galloping, yet they weren't nomadic cavalry and their status was similar to medium cavalry class. Balkan Timarli Sipahis wore chainmail, rode barded horses and carried lances and javelins, and fought as medium cavalry.\n\nTimarli Sipahis of the classical Ottoman period usually comprised the bulk of the army and did the majority of the fighting on the battlefield. While infantry troops at the army's center maintained a static battle line, the cavalry flanks constituted its mobile striking arm. During battle, Timarli Sipahi tactics were used, opening the conflict with skirmishes and localized skirmishes with enemy cavalry. Regiments of Timarli Sipahis made charges against weaker or isolated units and retreated back to the main body of troops whenever confronted with heavy cavalry. During one regiment's retreat, other regiments of sipahis may have charged the chasing enemy's flanks. Such tactics served to draw enemy cavalry away from infantry support, break their cohesion, and isolate and overwhelm them with numerical superiority. Anatolian Sipahis had the ability to harass and provoke opposing troops with arrow shots. More heavily equipped Balkan Sipahis carried javelins for protection against enemy horsemen during their tactical retreats. All cavalry flanks of the Ottoman army fought a fluid, mounted type of warfare around the center of the army, which served as a stable pivot.\n\nThe standard equipment of Rumeli Sipahis of the classical Ottoman period consisted of a round shield, lance, sword, javelins and plated chainmail. Their horses were barded. Standard equipment of Anatolian Sipahis in the same era was a round shield, composite [[Turkish bow]], arrows, [[kilij]] (Turkish sword) and leather or felt armor. Besides these, Sipahis of both provinces were equipped with {{lang|ota-Latn|bozdogan}} and {{lang|ota-Latn|\u015fe\u015fper}} [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and {{lang|ota-Latn|aydogan}}, {{lang|ota-Latn|teber}} and {{lang|ota-Latn|sagir}} axes. Anatolian Sipahis sometimes also carried lances.\n\n== Kapikulu Sipahis ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\nKapikulu Sipahis (Sipahis of the Porte) were household cavalry troops of the Ottoman Palace. They were the cavalry equivalent of the [[Janissary]] household infantry force. There were six divisions of Kapikulu Sipahis: Sipahis, Silahtars, Right Ulufecis, Left Ulufecis, Right Garips and Left Garips. All of them were paid quarterly salaries, while the Sipahis and Silahtars were elite units.\n\n{{lang|ota-Latn|Silahtars}} (\"weapon masters\") were chosen from the best warriors in the Ottoman Empire. Any Ottoman soldier who committed a significant deed on the battlefield could be promoted to the Silahtar division, although normally members of other mounted units, like Timarli Sipahis or one of the other less prestigious of the four divisions of Kapikulu Sipahis, were promoted this way. Infantry soldiers had to enlist as {{lang|ota-Latn|[[serdengecti]]}} (literally means giver of his head) and survive suicide missions to join Silahtar division. If a janissary ever became a silahtar, other members of the division with cavalry backgrounds despised him and former comrade janissaries considered him a traitor, but because the position and wealth of a silahtar was so attractive, janissaries and other soldiers still enlisted for suicide missions.\n\nThe commander of the Silahtar division was the Silahtar [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Agha]]. He was the official weaponsmaster of the palace and a close personal aide of the sultan, helping him to don his armor. He was also a liaison officer who supervised the communication between the sultan and the [[Grand Vizier]].\n\nThe Sipahi division was the most prestigious of the six divisions. Traditionally, sons of Ottoman \u00e9lite (sons of Vezirs, Pashas and Beys) served in this unit. The Sipahis and Silahtars were granted timar fiefs near Istanbul, alongside their salaries. Ulufeci means \"salaried ones\", and the members of two Ulufeci divisions weren't granted timar fiefs. Garip means \"poor ones\" (because their equipment was lighter compared to the other four divisions) and were paid salaries.\n\nThe six divisions of Sipahis represented the Kapikulu cavalry in the same way that the Janissaries represented the Kapikulu infantry. Kapikulu means servant of the Porte. Servants of the Porte (Kapikullari) were legally servants of the Ottoman throne. They weren't literally slaves, though their legal status was different from other Ottoman people. The Sultan had the power to directly command execution of his servants without any court verdict. Theoretically, the Sultan didn't have this kind of power over other people, even simple peasants. If a freeman was promoted to one of Kapikulu Sipahi divisions, he considered automatically switched to {{lang|ota-Latn|kul}} (servant) status.\n\nEquipment of Silahtar, Sipahi and Ulufeci divisions was [[plated mail]], chainmail, round shield, [[kilij|sword]], composite bow, arrows, lance, bozdogan mace and axe. Their equipment was similar to Rumeli (Balkan) provincial Timarli Sipahis, though they wore brilliant fabrics, prominent hats and bore ornamented polearms. The two Garip divisions were more lightly equipped.\n\nIn the classical period Ottoman battle formation, Kapikulu Sipahis were positioned back of the army as rearguards. They acted as reserve cavalry and bodyguards of Ottoman sultan and [[vezir]]s. Their job included to join and reinforce Ottoman army's flanks which otherwise consisted entirely provincial timariot sipahis.\n\nThe Sipahis of the Porte (Kapikulu Sipahis) were founded during the reign of [[Murad I]]. Although the Sipahis of the Porte were originally recruited, like the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], using the [[dev\u015firme]] system,<ref>Shaw 26</ref> by the time of Sultan [[Mehmed II]], they were chosen from the Muslim land-owners within the Empire (mostly of Turkic origin{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}). The Sipahi eventually became the largest of the six divisions of the Ottoman cavalry. Their duties included mounted body-guarding for the sultan and his family, as well as parade-riding with the sultan, having replaced the earlier Silahtar division for this duty.\n\n== Rivalry with the Janissary corps ==\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.Sipahis.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A depiction of Sipahis during the [[Battle of Vienna]]]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nSince Kapikulu Sipahis were a cavalry regiment it was well known within the Ottoman military circles that they considered themselves a superior stock of soldiers than [[Janissaries]], who were sons of Christian peasants from the Balkans (Rumelia), and were officially slaves bounded by various laws of the dev\u015firme.\n\nWhereas the Sipahis (both T\u0131marl\u0131 and Kap\u0131kulu) were almost exclusively chosen amongst ethnic Turkic landowners, they made great strides of efforts to gain respect within the Ottoman Empire and their political reputation depended on the mistakes of the Janissary. That minor quarrels erupted between the two units is made evident with a Turkmen adage, still used today within Turkey, ''\"{{lang|tr|Atl\u0131 er ba\u015fkald\u0131rmaz}}\"'', which, referring to the unruly Janissaries, translates into ''\"Horsemen don't mutiny\"''.\n\nTowards the middle of the 16th century, the Janissaries had started to gain more importance in the army, though the Sipahis remained an important factor in the empire's bureaucracy, economy and politics, and a crucial aspect of disciplined leadership within the army. As late as the 17th century, the Sipahis were, together with their rivals the Janissaries, the ''[[de facto]]'' rulers in the early years of sultan [[Murad IV]]'s reign. In 1826, after an evident Janissary revolt the Sipahis played an important part in the [[The Auspicious Incident|disbandment of the Janissary corps]].

[[Manesson Mallet]]: ''Art de la Guerre'', 1696]]\nThe term refers to all freeborn Ottoman Turkish mounted troops other than ''[[ak\u0131nc\u0131]]'' and tribal horsemen in the Ottoman army. The word was used almost synonymously with cavalry. The sipahis formed two distinct types of cavalry: feudal-like, provincial {{lang|ota-Latn|timarl\u0131 sipahi}} ([[timariots]]) which consisted most of the Ottoman army, and salaried, regular {{lang|ota-Latn|kap\u0131kulu sipahi}} (sipahi of the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]), which constituted the cavalry part of the Ottoman household troops.\n\nThe provincial governors, or [[beys]], were rotated every few years, preventing land inheritance.  The provinces, or [[sanjaks]], were not all equal since [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans]] were mostly ruled by Turks, while other areas of the empire were more flexible, adhering, somewhat, to local traditions.\n\nThe entwinement of land, military, politics, economics and religion was a way of life.\nThe [[timar]] system, where the sultan owned all land but individual plots of land, came with residential rights. The Ottoman people had rights to the land but the ''sipahi'', a unique kind of military aristocracy and cavalry portion of the military, also lived on the land with the farmers (90% of the population) and collected tax revenues, usually in-kind, to subsidize the costs of training and equipping the small army, dedicated to serving the sultan. The ''sipahi'' did not inherit anything, preventing power centres from growing and threatening the supreme power structure. The locals on the timar used the land and all it produced.<ref>{{cite book |title=Balance: The Economics of Great Powers From Ancient Rome to Modern America |last=Hubbard |first=Glenn |first2=Tim |last2=Kane |location= |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2013 |pages=148\u2013155 |isbn=978-1-4767-0025-0 }}</ref>\n\n== Timarli Sipahis ==\n{{main|Timariot}}\n[[File:Ralamb Sipahi.jpg|thumb|Miniature depicting an Anatolian Timariot, dating to before 1657.]]\n\n===Status===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe \"Timarli Sipahi\" or \"timariot\" (''t\u0131marl\u0131'') was the holder of a [[fiefdom|fief]] of land ({{lang|ar|\u062a\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0631 |rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|t\u00eem\u00e2r}}) granted directly by the Ottoman sultan or with his official permission by [[beylerbey]]s. He was entitled to all of the income from that land, in return for military service. The peasants on the land were subsequently attached thereto. Timarli Sipahis' status resembled that of the [[knight]]s of [[medieval Europe]]. Unlike medieval knights, they were not legally owners of their fiefs. The right to govern and collect taxes in a timar fief was merely given to a Timarli Sipahi by the Ottoman State. And in return, t\u0131marli sipahis were responsible for security of the people in their timar, enlisting and training ''cebelu'' soldiers for the army.\n\nA ''[[timar]]'' was the smallest unit of land held by a Sipahi, providing a yearly revenue of no more than 20,000 {{lang|ota-Latn|[[ak\u00e7e]]}}, which was between two and four times what a teacher earned.  A {{lang|ota-Latn|[[ziamet]]}} ({{lang|ota|\u0632\u0639\u0627\u0645\u062a|rtl=yes}}) was a larger unit of land, yielding up to 100,000 ak\u00e7e, and was owned by Sipahis of officer rank. A ''has'' ({{lang|ota|\u062e\u0627\u0635|rtl=yes}} ) was the largest unit of land, giving revenues of more than 100,000 ak\u00e7e, and was only held by the highest-ranking members of the military. A ''t\u00eem\u00e2r'' Sipahi was obliged to provide the army with up to five armed retainers ({{lang|ota-Latn|cebelu}}), a ''ziamet'' Sipahi with up to twenty, and a ''has'' Sipahi with far more than twenty. The ''cebelu'' (meaning \"armed, armored\") were expected to be mounted and fully equipped as the ''sipahi'' themselves; they were usually sons, brothers or nephews and their position was probably more similar to [[squire]]s than men-at-arms.\n\nThe sipahi were traditionally recruited among Turkic landowners, and thus, the non-Turkic provinces such as [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Greater Maghreb|Maghreb]] did not have sipahi. Recruitment of non-Turkic sipahi was banned with a 1635 ''[[ferman]]'' (decree). In contrast to the [[Janissaries]], Timarli Sipahis from that time onwards were Turks (Muslims). A rivalry between Jannisaries, who controlled the central bureaucracy of the empire and had a lot of political influence, and sipahis, who controlled the provincial bureaucracy and had the power of the army, prevented them from cooperating against the House of Osman.\n\nAlthough ''timars'' were not originally granted to their holders until perpetuity (the state inheriting the land at the death of the landholder), but by the end of the 17th century the estates were passed on from father to son.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fodor|first=P\u00e1l|title=Changes in the Structure and Strength of the Timariot Army from the Early Sixteenth to the End of the Seventeenth Century|url=https://www.academia.edu/35577776/Changes_in_the_Structure_and_Strength_of_the_Timariot_Army_from_the_Early_Sixteenth_to_the_End_of_the_Seventeenth_Century|journal=Eurasian Studies|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn wartime, Timarli sipahis and their retainers were gathered under their {{lang|ota-Latn|alay}} (regiment) [[bey]]s. Alay-beys were gathered with their troops under [[sanjak]] (province) beys, and [[sanjak-bey]]s gathered under [[beylerbey]]s. If a battle was to be fought in Europe, [[Rumeli]] (Balkan) Sipahis took the honorary right flank under the Rumeli beylerbey, while the Anatolian beylerbey and his Sipahis took the left flank; when a battle was in Asia, positions were switched. This way, the [[Ottoman classical army]]'s flanks wholly consisted of Timariot cavalry, while the center consisted of Janissary infantry and artillery divisions.\n [[File:Ottoman armour 1480-1500.jpg|thumb|Timariot armour dating to 1480\u20131500]]\nThe equipment and tactics differed between the Anatolian and Balkan Timarli Sipahi. The Anatolian Sipahi were equipped and fought as classic horse archers, shooting while galloping, yet they weren't nomadic cavalry and their status was similar to medium cavalry class. Balkan Timarli Sipahis wore chainmail, rode barded horses and carried lances and javelins, and fought as medium cavalry.\n\nTimarli Sipahis of the classical Ottoman period usually comprised the bulk of the army and did the majority of the fighting on the battlefield. While infantry troops at the army's center maintained a static battle line, the cavalry flanks constituted its mobile striking arm. During battle, Timarli Sipahi tactics were used, opening the conflict with skirmishes and localized skirmishes with enemy cavalry. Regiments of Timarli Sipahis made charges against weaker or isolated units and retreated back to the main body of troops whenever confronted with heavy cavalry. During one regiment's retreat, other regiments of sipahis may have charged the chasing enemy's flanks. Such tactics served to draw enemy cavalry away from infantry support, break their cohesion, and isolate and overwhelm them with numerical superiority. Anatolian Sipahis had the ability to harass and provoke opposing troops with arrow shots. More heavily equipped Balkan Sipahis carried javelins for protection against enemy horsemen during their tactical retreats. All cavalry flanks of the Ottoman army fought a fluid, mounted type of warfare around the center of the army, which served as a stable pivot.\n\nThe standard equipment of Rumeli Sipahis of the classical Ottoman period consisted of a round shield, lance, sword, javelins and plated chainmail. Their horses were barded. Standard equipment of Anatolian Sipahis in the same era was a round shield, composite [[Turkish bow]], arrows, [[kilij]] (Turkish sword) and leather or felt armor. Besides these, Sipahis of both provinces were equipped with {{lang|ota-Latn|bozdogan}} and {{lang|ota-Latn|\u015fe\u015fper}} [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and {{lang|ota-Latn|aydogan}}, {{lang|ota-Latn|teber}} and {{lang|ota-Latn|sagir}} axes. Anatolian Sipahis sometimes also carried lances.\n\n== Kapikulu Sipahis ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\nKapikulu Sipahis (Sipahis of the Porte) were household cavalry troops of the Ottoman Palace. They were the cavalry equivalent of the [[Janissary]] household infantry force. There were six divisions of Kapikulu Sipahis: Sipahis, Silahtars, Right Ulufecis, Left Ulufecis, Right Garips and Left Garips. All of them were paid quarterly salaries, while the Sipahis and Silahtars were elite units.\n\n{{lang|ota-Latn|Silahtars}} (\"weapon masters\") were chosen from the best warriors in the Ottoman Empire. Any Ottoman soldier who committed a significant deed on the battlefield could be promoted to the Silahtar division, although normally members of other mounted units, like Timarli Sipahis or one of the other less prestigious of the four divisions of Kapikulu Sipahis, were promoted this way. Infantry soldiers had to enlist as {{lang|ota-Latn|[[serdengecti]]}} (literally means giver of his head) and survive suicide missions to join Silahtar division. If a janissary ever became a silahtar, other members of the division with cavalry backgrounds despised him and former comrade janissaries considered him a traitor, but because the position and wealth of a silahtar was so attractive, janissaries and other soldiers still enlisted for suicide missions.\n\nThe commander of the Silahtar division was the Silahtar [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Agha]]. He was the official weaponsmaster of the palace and a close personal aide of the sultan, helping him to don his armor. He was also a liaison officer who supervised the communication between the sultan and the [[Grand Vizier]].\n\nThe Sipahi division was the most prestigious of the six divisions. Traditionally, sons of Ottoman \u00e9lite (sons of Vezirs, Pashas and Beys) served in this unit. The Sipahis and Silahtars were granted timar fiefs near Istanbul, alongside their salaries. Ulufeci means \"salaried ones\", and the members of two Ulufeci divisions weren't granted timar fiefs. Garip means \"poor ones\" (because their equipment was lighter compared to the other four divisions) and were paid salaries.\n\nThe six divisions of Sipahis represented the Kapikulu cavalry in the same way that the Janissaries represented the Kapikulu infantry. Kapikulu means servant of the Porte. Servants of the Porte (Kapikullari) were legally servants of the Ottoman throne. They weren't literally slaves, though their legal status was different from other Ottoman people. The Sultan had the power to directly command execution of his servants without any court verdict. Theoretically, the Sultan didn't have this kind of power over other people, even simple peasants. If a freeman was promoted to one of Kapikulu Sipahi divisions, he considered automatically switched to {{lang|ota-Latn|kul}} (servant) status.\n\nEquipment of Silahtar, Sipahi and Ulufeci divisions was [[plated mail]], chainmail, round shield, [[kilij|sword]], composite bow, arrows, lance, bozdogan mace and axe. Their equipment was similar to Rumeli (Balkan) provincial Timarli Sipahis, though they wore brilliant fabrics, prominent hats and bore ornamented polearms. The two Garip divisions were more lightly equipped.\n\nIn the classical period Ottoman battle formation, Kapikulu Sipahis were positioned back of the army as rearguards. They acted as reserve cavalry and bodyguards of Ottoman sultan and [[vezir]]s. Their job included to join and reinforce Ottoman army's flanks which otherwise consisted entirely provincial timariot sipahis.\n\nThe Sipahis of the Porte (Kapikulu Sipahis) were founded during the reign of [[Murad I]]. Although the Sipahis of the Porte were originally recruited, like the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], using the [[dev\u015firme]] system,<ref>Shaw 26</ref> by the time of Sultan [[Mehmed II]], they were chosen from the Muslim land-owners within the Empire (mostly of Turkic origin{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}). The Sipahi eventually became the largest of the six divisions of the Ottoman cavalry. Their duties included mounted body-guarding for the sultan and his family, as well as parade-riding with the sultan, having replaced the earlier Silahtar division for this duty.\n\n== Rivalry with the Janissary corps ==\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.Sipahis.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A depiction of Sipahis during the [[Battle of Vienna]]]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nSince Kapikulu Sipahis were a cavalry regiment it was well known within the Ottoman military circles that they considered themselves a superior stock of soldiers than [[Janissaries]], who were sons of Christian peasants from the Balkans (Rumelia), and were officially slaves bounded by various laws of the dev\u015firme.\n\nWhereas the Sipahis (both T\u0131marl\u0131 and Kap\u0131kulu) were almost exclusively chosen amongst ethnic Turkic landowners, they made great strides of efforts to gain respect within the Ottoman Empire and their political reputation depended on the mistakes of the Janissary. That minor quarrels erupted between the two units is made evident with a Turkmen adage, still used today within Turkey, ''\"{{lang|tr|Atl\u0131 er ba\u015fkald\u0131rmaz}}\"'', which, referring to the unruly Janissaries, translates into ''\"Horsemen don't mutiny\"''.\n\nTowards the middle of the 16th century, the Janissaries had started to gain more importance in the army, though the Sipahis remained an important factor in the empire's bureaucracy, economy and politics, and a crucial aspect of disciplined leadership within the army. As late as the 17th century, the Sipahis were, together with their rivals the Janissaries, the ''[[de facto]]'' rulers in the early years of sultan [[Murad IV]]'s reign. In 1826, after an evident Janissary revolt the Sipahis played an important part in the [[The Auspicious Incident|disbandment of the Janissary corps]]. The Sultan received critical assistance from the loyalist Sipahi cavalry in order to forcefully dismiss the infuriated Janissaries.\n\nTwo years later, however, they shared a similar fate when Sultan [[Mahmud II]] revoked their privileges and dismissed them in favor of a more modern military structure. Unlike the Janissaries before them they retired honorably, peacefully, and without bloodshed into new Ottoman cavalry divisions who followed modern [[military tradition]] doctrines.

[[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorizing small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Lee Van Cleef]]\u2014we have [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and others like that.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3019&Itemid=56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403091323/http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3019&Itemid=56 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 April 2013 |title=Contemporary Western: An interview with Vince Gilligan |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=[[Local iQ]] |work=News |accessdate=31 May 2013 |place=United States }}</ref>\n\nThe precursor to these{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was the radio series ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'' (1950\u20131952), with [[Joel McCrea]], a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featuring many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.\n\n====Electric Western====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zachariah.jpg|right|thumbnail|''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' (1971)]] -->\nThe 1971 film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' starring [[John Rubinstein]], [[Don Johnson]] and [[Pat Quinn (actress)|Pat Quinn]] was billed as the \"first electric Western.\"<ref name=NYT/> The film featured multiple performing [[musical ensemble|rock bands]] in an otherwise [[American frontier|American West]] setting.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}</ref>\n\n''Zachariah'' featured appearances and music supplied by rock groups from the 1970s, including the [[James Gang]]<ref name=NYT/> and [[Country Joe and the Fish]] as \"The Cracker Band.\"<ref name=NYT/> Fiddler [[Doug Kershaw]] had a musical cameo<ref name=NYT/> as does [[Elvin Jones]] as a gunslinging drummer named Job Cain.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nThe [[independent film]] ''Hate Horses'' starring [[Dominique Swain]], [[Ron Thompson (actor)|Ron Thompson]] and [[Paul Dooley]] billed itself as the \"second electric Western.\"<ref>{{cite video|work=[[YouTube]]|date=2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgTXHXiP7lk|title=Hate Horses - Official Trailer}}</ref>\n\n====Epic Western====\nThe epic Western is a subgenre of the Western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale. Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|title=Quick Gun Murugan: Channel V comes up with funny, irreverent and slightly crazy film|last=November 30|first=AMIT AGARWAL|last2=October 15|first2=1999 ISSUE DATE|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15|last3=July 24|first3=1994UPDATED|last4=Ist|first4=2013 12:00|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403110409/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|archive-date=2019-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil. [[Laal Kaptaan]] (2019) is an Indo western starring [[Saif Ali Khan]] which is set during of rise of [[British Empire]] in India.\n\n====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]].

It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html|title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2015-12-13|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.<ref>Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland & Company, 1995)</ref> Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955-1962), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).

(editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''</ref> Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]]. Originally aired on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] network from 2012 to 2014 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] in 2015 until the show's conclusion in 2017. \n\n[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|\"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared.

American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorizing small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Lee Van Cleef]]\u2014we have [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and others like that.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3019&Itemid=56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403091323/http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3019&Itemid=56 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 April 2013 |title=Contemporary Western: An interview with Vince Gilligan |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=[[Local iQ]] |work=News |accessdate=31 May 2013 |place=United States }}</ref>\n\nThe precursor to these{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was the radio series ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'' (1950\u20131952), with [[Joel McCrea]], a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featuring many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.\n\n====Electric Western====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zachariah.jpg|right|thumbnail|''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' (1971)]] -->\nThe 1971 film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' starring [[John Rubinstein]], [[Don Johnson]] and [[Pat Quinn (actress)|Pat Quinn]] was billed as the \"first electric Western.\"<ref name=NYT/> The film featured multiple performing [[musical ensemble|rock bands]] in an otherwise [[American frontier|American West]] setting.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}</ref>\n\n''Zachariah'' featured appearances and music supplied by rock groups from the 1970s, including the [[James Gang]]<ref name=NYT/> and [[Country Joe and the Fish]] as \"The Cracker Band.\"<ref name=NYT/> Fiddler [[Doug Kershaw]] had a musical cameo<ref name=NYT/> as does [[Elvin Jones]] as a gunslinging drummer named Job Cain.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nThe [[independent film]] ''Hate Horses'' starring [[Dominique Swain]], [[Ron Thompson (actor)|Ron Thompson]] and [[Paul Dooley]] billed itself as the \"second electric Western.\"<ref>{{cite video|work=[[YouTube]]|date=2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgTXHXiP7lk|title=Hate Horses - Official Trailer}}</ref>\n\n====Epic Western====\nThe epic Western is a subgenre of the Western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale. Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|title=Quick Gun Murugan: Channel V comes up with funny, irreverent and slightly crazy film|last=November 30|first=AMIT AGARWAL|last2=October 15|first2=1999 ISSUE DATE|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15|last3=July 24|first3=1994UPDATED|last4=Ist|first4=2013 12:00|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403110409/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|archive-date=2019-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil. [[Laal Kaptaan]] (2019) is an Indo western starring [[Saif Ali Khan]] which is set during of rise of [[British Empire]] in India.\n\n====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]].

It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html|title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2015-12-13|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.<ref>Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland & Company, 1995)</ref> Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955-1962), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).

(editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''</ref> Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]]. Originally aired on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] network from 2012 to 2014 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] in 2015 until the show's conclusion in 2017. \n\n[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|\"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared.

I will save her!'\" (1908)]]\n\n==Visual art==\n{{Main|Artists of the American West}}\nA number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the [[American Old West]]. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

Bratenahl is a small community of fewer than 1,200 population inhabiting approximately 700 households, some of which are stately estates, townhouses, and condominiums on the lakefront.  Its famous Lake Shore Boulevard has been featured in many magazines including ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]''.\n\nBratenahl is home to a once controversial luxury high-rise condominium complex named [[Bratenahl Place]]. Though many residents opposed it at the time, in 1967 two large multi-occupancy buildings of [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] architectural design were built on the lakefront. One of the two structures was originally intended to be a 180-unit rental apartment building, while the other, smaller one was a condominium from its inception. In 1976 however, the larger one also became a condominium.\n\n==Geography==\nBratenahl is located at {{coord|41|33|15|N|81|36|16|W|type:city}} (41.554275, \u221281.604574).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|1.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|1.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.58|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 690\n|1920= 1000\n|1930= 1308\n|1940= 1350\n|1950= 1240\n|1960= 1332\n|1970= 1613\n|1980= 1485\n|1990= 1356\n|2000= 1337\n|2010= 1197\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1161\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=Census1870>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1870a-08.pdff|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Ninth Census|date=1880|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=Census1880>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-11.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1910>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch3.pdf|work=1910 U.S. Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1960/population-volume-1/37749282v1p37_ch02.pdf|date=1960|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013|df=}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,197 people, 679 households, and 333 families living in the village.

Bratenahl is a small community of fewer than 1,200 population inhabiting approximately 700 households, some of which are stately estates, townhouses, and condominiums on the lakefront.  Its famous Lake Shore Boulevard has been featured in many magazines including ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]''.\n\nBratenahl is home to a once controversial luxury high-rise condominium complex named [[Bratenahl Place]]. Though many residents opposed it at the time, in 1967 two large multi-occupancy buildings of [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] architectural design were built on the lakefront. One of the two structures was originally intended to be a 180-unit rental apartment building, while the other, smaller one was a condominium from its inception. In 1976 however, the larger one also became a condominium.\n\n==Geography==\nBratenahl is located at {{coord|41|33|15|N|81|36|16|W|type:city}} (41.554275, \u221281.604574).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|1.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|1.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.58|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 690\n|1920= 1000\n|1930= 1308\n|1940= 1350\n|1950= 1240\n|1960= 1332\n|1970= 1613\n|1980= 1485\n|1990= 1356\n|2000= 1337\n|2010= 1197\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1161\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=Census1870>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/18870a_08.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=Census1880>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-11.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1910>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch3.pdf|work=1910 U.S. Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013|df=}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,197 people, 679 households, and 333 families living in the village.

He grew up in rural [[Missouri]], learning to play the drums at age seven and joining his family's gospel band. When Rateliff was 13, his father was killed in a car crash. As a result, he taught himself guitar and began writing his own songs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nathaniel Rateliff|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2011/events/event_MS14018|publisher=SXSW, Inc.|access-date=February 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926034540/http://schedule.sxsw.com/2011/events/event_MS14018|archive-date=September 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> At eighteen, Rateliff moved to [[Denver]] for missionary work. After internal struggles with life in the church, he moved back to Missouri where he worked in a plastics factory in [[Hermann, Missouri]]. A few months later, he returned to Denver and started work, first as a carpenter, then at a trucking depot for 10 years before becoming a gardener.\n\n=== 2002\u20132008: Born in the Flood ===\nIn 2002, Rateliff formed Born in the Flood, quickly garnering a large following in Denver and headlining local festivals like the [[Westword Music Showcase]]. In Feb, 2007, Born in the Flood released their first full-length album \"If This Thing Should Spill\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaffeinebuzz.com/film/item/12385-born-in-the-flood-if-this-thing-should-spill|title=Born In The Flood - If This Thing Should Spill|website=kaffeinebuzz.com}}</ref> Despite increasing success with Born in the Flood, Rateliff turned down an offer from Roadrunner Records, and shifted his focus to a more stripped-down, solo effort, playing somber, singer-songwriter content under his name and \"Nathaniel Rateliff and the Wheel\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2009/11/05/nathaniel-rateliff-of-denver-band-the-wheel-picks-quiet-route-to-success/|title=Nathaniel Rateliff of Denver band The Wheel picks quiet route to success \u2013 The Denver Post|website=denverpost.com}}</ref>\n\n=== 2007\u20132014: Nathaniel Rateliff and the Wheel===\nIn 2007, while still performing with Born in the Flood, Rateliff began recording and performing more personal, somber content both solo and with BitF bandmate and lifetime collaborator Joseph Pope III (bass/guitar/vibes/organ/harmonica).

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight [[Story arc|story arcs]], each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 127 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 2020.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a [[vampire]]. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient [[Humanoid|humanoids]] of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters.

With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to [[Cairo]] to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

The plot of the series is divided into eight [[Story arc|story arcs]], each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 127 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 2020.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a [[vampire]]. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient [[Humanoid|humanoids]] of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.
