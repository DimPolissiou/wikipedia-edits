Drummers were originally established in European armies to act as signallers.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\">{{cite web\n  | title = History of the Corps Of Drums Where did it all start?\n  | publisher = The Corps of Drums Society\n  | url = http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-11\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm\n  | archivedate = 17 May 2008\n  | df = dmy-all\n  }}</ref> This is the major historical distinction between a military band and a corps of drums, 'drummers' would not play their instruments to entertain or delight, but rather as a utilitarian battlefield role. This role was fulfilled by trumpeters or buglers and timpanists in the cavalry and the artillery, who did not form into comparative formed bodies in the way that drummers did; therefore, an orthodox corps of drums will exist in the infantry arm and not in other arms (save for the light infantry).\n\n==History==\n\nMost fife and drum traditions trace back to the Swiss mercenaries of the early Renaissance, and it is known that by the early 16th century, each [[Company (military unit)|company]] of infantry soldiers would have a single drummer and a single fife player.<ref>[http://corpsofdrums.com/about/history/ History]</ref> These two musicians would march at the head of the company, and when not providing uplifting marching tunes, they would be used by the company commander to convey orders, on and off the field of battle. The drummers would be more aptly described as signallers than musicians, as shouted orders were very hard to hear over the din of battle. Later, a bugle would become the preferred means of communication on the battlefield, and the drummers adapted, training on bugles and carrying them in battle, but retaining the drum and the title of drummer.\n[[Image:Battle of bunker hill by percy moran.jpg|thumb|Drummers in the centre foreground, in their original battlefield role, close to the officer and wearing the distinctive drummers uniform described below.]]\nAs time went on, the individual drummers and fife players in each company would be organized at battalion level.  They retained their role in each company in battle, but would form one body of men at the head of a battalion on the march. It was necessary to appoint a Drum Major (the equivalent of a Sergeant Major, for the drummers) to be in charge of the drummers and to organize training in the emerging discipline of military drumming while a fife major was to be appointed to be the principal fifer and to train future fife players. The corps of drums would group together when not on duty with each company, and carry out various roles within the battalion, such as administering military justice and ensuring soldier's billets were secured, thus, the corps of drums became attached to the battalion HQ and was organized at battalion level, as opposed to individual company level.\n\n==Current Role==\n\nEventually, as the use of musical instrument on the battlefield diminished, corps of drums looked to fill specialist roles within the battalion while still retaining their original role for ceremonial purposes.\n\nSeveral different strings of logic have seen corps of drums employed in many varied roles. Because the corps would often be employed in support of the battalion, in areas such as delivering mail or designating billets, they are often given the role of assault pioneers, or supporting-fire (machine gun) platoons.\nThe corps of drums role on the battlefield was originally to signal orders, and therefore some units are organised into signals platoons, operating radios.\nCorps of drums were also deployed to march under the parley flag when officers of opposing met to discuss terms of surrender, etc. Therefore, some corps of drums perform a liaison role.\n\nHistorical duties such as uncasing [[Colours, standards and guidons|the colours]] on parade and various other privileges are continued in most units. Due to the specialist duties and ceremonial aspects of a drummers life, a corps of drums may be the unofficial custodian of regimental customs and traditions.\n\nCorps of drums are drawn from the whole battalion, and are attached to the battalion HQ. Above the [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] as its head, the corps is usually answerable to the battalion's [[adjutant]].\n\n==United Kingdom==\n[[File:Drummer Lee Rigby 1.jpg|thumbnail|upright|The late [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]] was a Drummer in the Royal Fusiliers]]\nThe [[British Army]] maintains a corps of drums in each infantry battalion except for [[Royal Regiment of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Irish]], and Rifle Regiments ([[The Rifles]] and the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]]) which have [[Pipe band|pipes and drums]] and Bugles respectively. Each battalion of a regiment will maintain a corps of drums which may be 'massed' together on certain occasions. All corps-of-drums soldiers are called {{Anchor|drummer}} drummers (shortened to 'Dmr') regardless of the instrument they play, similarly to use of the term \"sapper\" for soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/>\n\nUnlike army musicians who form bands and will usually be limited to auxiliary duties in wartime, drummers in a Corps of Drums are principally fully trained infantry soldiers, with recruitment coming after standard infantry training. A Corps of Drums will deploy with the rest of the battalion, and will often form specialist platoons such as [[assault pioneer]]s, supporting fire or [[force protection]].\n\nHistorically, the drum was used to convey orders during a battle, so the Corps of Drums has always been a fully integrated feature of an infantry battalion. Later on, when the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] was adopted to convey orders, drummers were given bugles in addition, but maintained their drums and flutes, except in rifles regiments where the lighter instrument was more conducive to the skirmishing form of warfare.\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Welsh guards drummers on the mall.jpg|thumbnail|Corps of Drums of the Welsh Guards. Note: side drum, bugle and short-sword slung behind, fleur-de-lys lace on body and sleeves of tunic.]]\nThe main instrument is the [[Snare drum|Side drum]]. These were originally of a rope-tension design with wide wooden hoops, a wooden shell and an animal-skin head. In the British Army, this model has been continuously upgraded, with the inclusion of snares, more modern metal rod-tension and plastic heads. The current British Army 97s-pattern side drum also has nylon hoops.\n\nThe side drum was increasingly decorated throughout the 19th century, until it bore the fully embellished [[regimental colour]]s of the battalion, including its [[battle honour]]s. As such a regiment's drums are often afforded respect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe second instrument was originally the [[Fife (instrument)|fife]], replaced in the modern British Army by the [[Five-key flute|five key flute]]. A wide variety of flutes and pitches is used. The fife and later the flute have been favoured as a warlike instrument due to shrill pitch and thus the ability to be heard above the noise of battle. Many tunes such as [[The British Grenadiers]] are traditionally played by military flutes. Fifes and keyed flutes were typically pitched in B-flat, but the flute family eventually expanded to include a Piccolo in E-flat, a perfect fourth higher, and a flute pitched in F, a perfect fourth lower than the B-flat flute. There was also a \"B-flat Bass\" which was pitched an octave below the B-flat flute. Occasionally the B-flat flute is known as the \"Treble\" in order to avoid confusion with the B-flat bass flute. The development of this family of flutes facilitated the development of flute band part music which in many ways imitates the style of larger military bands.\n\nThe bugle replaced the drum mid-way through the 19th century as the most common means of communication on the battlefield. These duties were carried out by the battalion's corps of drums, whose drummers now each carry a bugle.\n\nAs the musical role of a corps of drums became more ceremonial in the 19th and 20th centuries, more instruments were added to make their output more musically complete. A modern corps of drums may thus have a range of percussion instruments such as a [[bass drum]], [[tenor drum]]s and [[cymbals]] in addition to the snare drum, flute and bugle.\n\n===Uniform===\n[[Image:DWR Colours, Erquinghem Lys, France (RLH) 2005-11-12.JPG|thumb|left|A corps of drums of the [[Duke of Wellington's regiment]] (since amalgamated into the [[Yorkshire Regiment]]), showing crown lace tunics, a leopard skin on the bass drummer, and rod-tension side drums with metal hoops.]]\nDrummers originally wore distinct uniforms so as to stand out on the battlefield. During the 18th century most British Army drummers were distinguished by wearing their regimental uniforms in \"reversed colours\" \u2013 thus an infantry regiment wearing [[Red coat (British Army)|red coat]]s with yellow [[facings]] would clothe its drummers in yellow coats with red facings. This practice tended to make drummers targets in battle and after 1812 was replaced by less conspicuous distinctions.<ref>page 71, \"Military Uniforms of Britain & the Empire\", Major R.M. Barnes, Sphere Books 1972</ref> These usually consisted of [[lace]], used liberally all over the standard uniform, in varying patterns. Many early patterns consisted of a \"Christmas-tree\" pattern in which the chest was covered in horizontal lace decreasing in width downwards, and chevrons of lace down each sleeve. The modern infantry pattern in the British Army is of \"crown-and-inch\" lace sewn over the seams down the sleeves, around the collar, and over the seams on the back of the tunic. The crown-and-inch lace itself is about {{convert|1/2|in}} thick with a repeating crown pattern. The [[Guards Division]]s drummers have the old-style \"Christmas-tree\" pattern, with [[fleurs-de-lis]] instead of crowns.\n\nWhilst corps of drums in the British Army often parade in [[Army Combat Uniform|combat uniforms]] and other forms of dress, they will usually parade in the [[full dress|full dress uniform]] as above, being one of a few formations which regularly wear full dress.\n\nIn some regiments, it has become custom for the percussion rank to wear leopard skins over their uniform. This has the dual purpose of protecting the uniform (cymbals have to be muffled against the chest, and therefore would leave vertical marks on a bare tunic) and protecting the instruments themselves (the bass drum can be scratched by uniform buttons). Modern \"leopard skins\" are made from synthetic fur. Other regiments opt for a simple leather or cloth apron.\n\nDrummers have traditionally been armed with \"drummers' swords\", a [[shortsword]] with a simple brass hilt bearing the [[Royal Cypher]]. The practice of wearing swords has been discontinued by some regiments, though many still do carry the swords, whilst some use an [[SA80]] [[bayonet]] as a modern alternative.\n\n===Honourable Artillery Company===\n[[File:HAC Corps of Drums at Wellington Barracks.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Corps of Drums]] of the Honourable Artillery Company at [[Wellington Barracks]].]]\nThe [[Honourable Artillery Company]] maintains a corps of drums as other British Army infantry regiments have, and as such is the only such sub-unit in an artillery unit in the British Army.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/10738.aspx<HAC Official Website>]</ref> Although the Honourable Artillery Company now fulfils an artillery role, historically it was originally an infantry regiment, with two battalions fighting during the Great War.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#History<HAC|wiki page, history>]]</ref> The last infantry battalion was disbanded in 1973, but the corps of drums remained. As the regiment still maintains the privilege granted to it by King William IV in 1830, that the H.A.C. should dress as the Grenadier Guards, except wearing silver where the Grenadiers wear gold, the corps of drums of the HAC dresses in a very similar fashion to that of the Grenadier Guards.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#Dress<HAC|wiki page, dress>]]</ref> Just as other corps of drums, its personnel carry out a soldiering role as their main function.\n\nSince the HAC is the oldest unit in existence in the British Army, and as drummers were on the establishment of infantry units at the latest during the 16th century, it may be assumed that the corps of drums of the HAC is the oldest in the British Army, though it has not been in continuous existence.\n\nIn addition, the HAC's veteran unit, the [[Company of Pikemen and Musketeers]] maintains an early form of Corps of Drums known as the 'Musik'. In this capacity, more basic fifes and larger rope-tension drums are used and 17th century uniforms are worn in keeping with the rest of the Company.\n\n===Royal Logistic Corps===\n[[Image:rlc2013-0018.jpg|thumb|RLC Drums with Battle honours.]]\nThe [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC) also maintains a corps of drums in the form of several side drummers, drawn from soldiers who serve a short tour as drummers before returning to a field unit. This is not a conventional corps of drums, as it has no flautists, and comes under the command of regimental headquarters of the RLC, rather than forming a separate entity. It frequently plays with the Band of the RLC, but often performs in isolation. It is famed for its \"black light\" display. These drummers stem from the 12 drummers placed on [[the Royal Waggon Train]] (RWT) in 1803. There are reserve soldiers within the Corps of Drums of 157 Regiment RLC, based at Cardiff in Wales.\n\nAt the time of Waterloo, in the period of deployment to the Low Countries, the RWT introduced drums made of brass. These originated on the Indian sub-continent. The size {{convert|14|by|12|in|mm}}. They weighed {{convert|16|lb}}. They were faced in blue and carried the cypher of King George, with the title below. A few drums of the period survive today. The drumsticks were of Canadian maple, following the campaigns in North America during the Napoleonic era. The drums had drag ropes purchased from unit funds. Whilst drummers carried the bugle, the common instrument for the \"Waggoners\" was the [[fanfare trumpet]] on account of their cavalry traditions, and inclusion in the light cavalry. During that period the corps was then being divided between the foot soldiers, which used drums and fifes, and the mounted soldiers, with cavalry fanfare trumpets as signalling instruments. The drum sling was still that of the hook.\n\n===Royal Marines===\n[[File:USMC-10212009-M-3403K-011.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Marines Corps of Drums]]\n[[Royal Marines Band Service|Royal Marines Bands]] are led by 'buglers', who are trained on both the side drum and the bugle as well as the Herald Fanfare Trumpet (natural trumpet); this section of the band is referred to as \"the Corps of Drums\", which since 1903 is now situated at the front of the band. Whilst similar to Army corps of drums, these are members of the Royal Marines Band Service (RMBS), although they retain their own rank structure.  Members of the RMBS are primarily musicians; however, they also carry out secondary roles (e.g. medics, drivers, force protection etc.) when required to, like their Army counterparts.\n\nRM Buglers have a similar history to Army 'drummers' in that they were used to convey orders on a ship on drums and bugles, and would then mass onshore into corps of drums, though they were still expected to work as individual soldiers,<ref>[http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm Fact Sheet - The Drums of the RM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}</ref> also known in slang by the Royal Navy as drummers.\n\nThese drummer-buglers trace themselves back to the raising of the Royal Marines in 1664 as a maritime foot regiment, with six drummers attached to its battalions.\n\n===History of maritime drums===\nDrums were, in 1664, used for the raising of the Duke of York's and Albany's maritime regiment of foot, the ''Admiral's Regiment''. The regiment's 1,200 personnel had per company six snare drummers, the ancestors of the Royal Marines Band's corps of drums. The Holland Regiment soon came after them. They were later to be called ''The Buffs'', the ''Old Buffs'' and ''Howards's Buffs''.\n\nEach time a maritime regiment, or from 1672 onward, a marine regiment, is disbanded and a new one appears in its place, drummers come in, especially the young ones who liked playing drums and wanted to serve playing them. The 1702 formation of the marine and sea-service foot regiments saw the drummers' greatest action at Gibraltar, when they played the drums to support their regiments.\n\nThe [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] saw into action ten British marine regiments and an all-American marine regiment, all units whose drummers and fifers played alongside their units.\n\nEven though part of the [[British Army]] which in the 18th century was led by the War Office, the Board of Ordnance and the Commissariat, marines were naval units. Royal Navy officers were at one point part of the marines. Due to two laws that regulated them and other army and navy units, marine drummers faced a loyalty problem over what drum calls they would have to do, and for what branch and on what occasion they might be required to play drums for orders, commands, etc.\n\nIn 1755, the problem was solved. The Admiralty took over what was then called ''His Majesty's Marine Forces''.  Even though at first Royal Navy officers filled the officer ranks, with lieutenant-colonel being perceived as the highest relevant rank, in 1771 a promotion to colonel occurred for the first time in the H.M.M.F.\n\nAfter their formation, the H.M.M.F's drummers and fifers of the three marine divisions played alongside their fellow soldiers in various landings worldwide on behalf of the Royal Navy. They joined their units in the American War of Independence, and a drummer was at James Cook's service during his sea travels.\n\nAt Adm. John Jervis's insistence, by King George III's order in 1802, the H.M.M.F. was transformed into the ''H.M.M.F.-Royal Marines'', albeit larger than today's establishment. Two years later, bomb vessel crews and gunners became part of the newly created ''Royal Marine Artillery'', in which bugle calls became a regular part of life from then on.\n\nThe Royal Navy in the 19th century was short of manpower in both the H.M.M.F.-R.M. and the R.M.A. For this, Army units joined the H.M.M.F.-R.M. as replacement units, carrying not only their drummers and fifers but also buglers.\n\nIn 1855, during the units' service in the Crimean War, the H.M.M.F.-R.M's foot units became one under the unified title of ''Royal Marines Light Infantry'', later known as the ''Royal Marine Light Infantry''. From then, bugles replaced drums as signallers and order beaters, but the latter would be still useful for drill, being then called ''drummers and buglers'', and from 1867 the R.M.L.I./R.M.A. drummers were called ''buglers'' only, serving individually in ships and the R.N's shore establishments and artillery units and massed into corps of drums for their units on the ground. Fifes fully declined and disappeared in usage. By then, a bugler playing both the drum and his bugle both to sound orders and do drum calls was a common sight in the RMLI and RMA. By the 1890s, even buglers also trained in using herald trumpets or Fanfare trumpets became commonplace in RMLI and RMA bases and facilities.\nA 1902 incident changed the buglers forever. A Coronation Review at [[Aldershot]] was due soon, and the then Sr. Bandmaster of the RMLI, Lt. George Miller, asked his fellow bandmasters to get buglers for his band for the review. The next day at a church parade, he asked 30 RMLI buglers to front the RMLI Massed Bands. They then marched to his own arrangement of Onward Christian Soldiers. Everyone was shocked by this and were amazed that the formation that he used would become a RMLI and RMA military band standard formation setup, and the precision stick drills that he made became a permanent fixture in military events where either or both the RMLI and RMA's presence were needed. Soon later, when the RM began operating the Royal Naval School of Music the next year as a training venue for future bandsmen of the RN, RMLI and RMA, they brought this formation for Royal Navy bands as well, inspiring the formations used by modern military bands of some Commonwealth countries like Australia,  Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n1923 would see the buglers of the R.M.L.I. and R.M.A. now belong to the ''Corps of Royal Marines'', the Royal Marines of today. Seeing action during the Second World War and in the growing crisis of the [[Cold War]] were the R.M.'s brave buglers of the new '''[[Royal Marines Band Service]]''', even through separate from the bands themselves. The R.M.A. and R.M.L.I. buglers' dress uniforms (dark blue trousers and tunic and red collars and trouser wells) became the full dress of the corps bands and buglers, with the addition of a Wolseley [[pith helmet]] as headdress, and yellow shoulder cords and slashed cuffs to indicate their long history, heritage and lineage from 1664.\n\nBy 1950, the R.N.S.o.M. became today's [[Royal Marines Band Service#Royal Marines School of Music|Royal Marines School of Music]], and the Royal Naval bands were dissolved. Beating retreats by both the Royal Marine bands and the R.M. Corps of Drums buglers would begin to occur annually, later triennially and as of today biannually, at [[Horse Guards Parade]], [[Portsmouth]] and other venues, playing for the entire Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. It would be only in 1978 that the R.M.B.S. would have buglers as well in its rosters. By the 1990s, however, only five R.M. corps of drums were left as the Deal Depot closed down in 1996, the Chatham band already dissolved in the 1940s, with three at the R.N. England bases in [[Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth]] and at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] till 2008 (The last is now assigned to {{HMS|Collingwood|establishment|6}}), one in the R.M.S.o.M. (then in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and now in Portsmouth since 1996) and another one in [[Scotland]] at HMS ''Caledonia''. By the 1950s, only the band carried the corps at the lead, as separate corps of drums, which played only bugles alongside the drums, were discontinued altogether (these were adopted in the 1880s when the RM began to transition from fifes to bugles).\n\nToday there are six R.M. Bands (plus the training company, R.M.S.o.M. Junior Musicians and Buglers) located around the UK, in Portsmouth (three in HMS Nelson, which includes the R.M.S.o.M.), Fareham (HMS Collingwood), Plymouth (HMS Raleigh), Lympstone (Commando Training Centre Royal Marines) and Scotland (HMS Caledonia) for a total of seven bands and attached corps of drums.  All members of the R.M.B.S. are trained at the Royal Marines School of Music (HMS Nelson). Buglers' training lasts two years. Basic military skills are taught during four months of initial military training and, if successful, trainee buglers are instructed on the bugle, drum and herald/fanfare trumpets. Musical skills are refined and supported with additional lessons in music theory and aural perception. Parade work forms a large part of the curriculum and considerable time is spent developing personal drill and bearing.\n\nToday's R.M. Corps of Drums contains approximately 60 buglers who carry out duties ranging from repatriation services (''Last Post'' and ''Reveille''), mess beatings (drum displays), beating retreat (marching displays) and concerts on behalf of the Royal Marines and the entire Royal Navy.\n\n===Instruments and leadership===\nLike the British Army, Military snare (side) drums (MSD) are the principal instrument of the corps of drums; however, another core instrument is the bugle. Bass drums are often used during parades and drum displays, while cymbals and single tenor drums are used during parades and ceremonies only. Herald Fanfare trumpets (natural trumpets) are also performed on such occasions where a bugle fanfare would be inappropriate for such. The corps is led by a drum major and a bugle major serves as the principal player for it.\n\n===British civilian and cadet corps of drums===\nIn addition to Army and Navy/Royal Marines Corps of Drums, in the [[United Kingdom]] there are also [[Cadet#United Kingdom|cadet]]- civilian corps who base their music on the military traditions of the country.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/> The [[Army Cadet Force]] corps use the Army-style formations and instrumentation (flutes/bugles, snare, bass and tenor drums, cymbals and [[Glockenspiel]]s), save for those with Scottish and Irish links that have [[Pipe band]]s instead and those affiliated with the light infantry (especially the now only LI regiment [[The Rifles]]) have a corps of drums without the fifes while using only bugles. Those corps of the [[Combined Cadet Force]], [[Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps]] and the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] use the RN/RM naval and ship-style corps (Snare drums/Bugles, Bass and Tenor drums, cymbals and glockenspiels) and are attached to the main band. This formation is also used by the military band of the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]]. Another example of a military style CoD is that of the [[Royal British Legion]], whose bands are modeled on the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Band Service. The Royal Air Force however does not have any such ensembles, and only Corps of Drums under the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]] are active, with their formation being similar to those of the RN and RM.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police restarted a Corps of Drums in 2011, when the central youth engagement unit purchased some drums and sent cadets on a \"band camp\". Greenwich borough subsequently took a caretaker role of the drums and expanded in a drum corp. 2015 saw Kensington and Chelsea and Hillingdon Boroughs expanding and creating more branches of the drum corp. It is the first band in the Metropolitan Police to be composed of members of the Metropolitan Police since 1988. It is also the first band in the name of the Metropolitan Police since 1997, when the civilianised Metropolitan Police Band was disbanded.\n\nCivilian corps of drums are also formatted after their respective services, with corps patterned after those of the Army, Navy and the Royal Marines in instrumentation and marching style becoming commonplace. These are staffed by both veteran and retired military drummers as well as civilian drummers playing the fifes, bugles and percussion. In Northern Ireland, civilian corps are mounted by Loyalist groups, which for the most part use flutes with no bugles at all.\n\n==United States==\nA '''corps of drums''' or '''field music band''' in the United States is a type of [[military band]], which originated in European [[Army|armies]] in the 16th century. The main instruments of a corps of drums are the [[drum]] and the [[flute]] or [[Fife (instrument)|fife]] and [[bugle]]. Unlike 'full' [[Military band|military marching bands]], corps of drums usually exist within an [[infantry]] [[battalion]]. A [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] is the leader of a corps of drums, and in the past a fife major served as the principal fifer or flautist with a bugle major serving the same purpose for the buglers.\n\n[[Valley Forge Military Academy and College]] has a corps of drums that is part of the regimental band. Uniforms and music are modelled on the Royal Marines Corps of Drums. VFMAC does have a similar but separate formation which is part of the Corps of Cadets (VFMAC Field Music) which only uses drums (snares, tenors and basses), cymbals and bugles and from 2011, fifes. Formed in 1956, it also provides the official guard-of-honour for visitors to the Delaware Valley area.\n\nThe [[United States Army]] [[Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps]], raised in 1960 and part of the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]] of the [[United States Army]], formally revived this very part of American military music history and its mission is to relive it for coming generations. This is the only musical unit of the US armed forces in which its drum major, wearing a classic 18th century infantry cap and carrying a [[spontoon]], the honor badge and weapon of 18th century senior non-commissioned officers, salutes using the left hand. Musicians assigned to this unit wear 18th century military uniforms reminiscent of those used in the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the [[Continental Army]] drummers and fifers. Another corps of drums is found as part of the [[West Point Band]] - the West Point Hellcats, which wear regulation uniforms from the 1820s, and since 2016 play using bugles, fifes and traditional rope tension snare and bass drums.  Until the late 19th century the US Army and the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained similar ensembles before switching to bugles.\n\n=== Formation of field music/corps of drums in the US Armed Forces and civilian organizations === \nWhile only the Old Guard FDC is the only field music formation in the US Armed Forces and thus more similar to a European corps of drums, in the past there had been similar formations armed forces-wide. Should such units be reactivated again not just in the Armed Forces but also as civilian, veterans or youth cadet formations, the formation of the ensemble is as follows (the formation is to be expected to be led by a drum major):\n\n* Field snare drums\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Cymbals (optional)\n* Single tenor drums (optional)\n* Glockenspiels (optional)\n* Fifes\n* Piccolos, Flutes\n* Bugles in B and/or G Major\n* Chromatic fanfare Trumpets in B or G Major (optional)\n* Single-valve bugles (Only in the Old Guard FDC)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald Fanfare Bugles (optional)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald fanfare trumpets (optional)\n* Soprano Bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* Flugelhorn Bugles\n* Mellophones\n* Baritone Bugles\n* Marching Baritones\n* Contrabass bugles\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, ''Spielmannszug'', ''Tambourkorps'' and  sometimes ''Trommlerkorps'' are the names given to the German corps of drums, whether it is a military formation or a civilian formation. The instrumentation of these are, commonly fifes and snare drums (just like the [[Bundeswehr]] corps of drums that are attached to the unit military bands), [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s, [[Glockenspiel]]s, Bass drums, cymbals and, on some corps, single and multiple tenor drums, and like their British counterparts, bugles (in several corps). [[Timpani]], [[vibraphone]]s and [[marimba]]s are used in concerts. Sometimes even a [[Turkish crescent]] is used to symbolize the band. Whatever the configuration, a drum major always leads the corps during military and civil parades and other events, and in modern corps even majorettes and pom pom dancers are a part of its roster.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong and are attached to the bands of the Bundeswehr [[Military bands of the Bundeswehr|Military Music Center]] under the Bundeswehr [[Streitkr\u00e4ftebasis]] while civilian corps are dedicated civil bands and youth bands assigned in cities and towns all over Germany.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1990, the [[National People's Army]] maintained corps of drums in the same manner as the Bundeswehr. During the Republic Day parades on 7 October in East Berlin from 1959 to 1989, the national corps included single tenor drums at the front.\n\n==Russia/CIS==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e \u0414\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0412\u041e (5).jpg|thumb|Drummers of the [[Minsk Suvorov Military School]] on the avenue during a parade in 2017.]]\nRussian '''{{transl|ru|Barabanshchiki}}''' or drummers are names that are used to refer to Russian military corps of drums ({{lang|ru|\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432}}, {{transl|ru|rota barabanshchikom}}), a practice that is of Imperial origin in the field drummers that marched at the lead of their units in parades and that is a part of the traditions of almost all former Soviet republics (save for the Baltics and Georgia). Russian drum corps are usually made up of snare drummers with one line of [[flute]] or [[fife]] players in the middle and two [[glockenspiel]]s in the front (with the option for a third one or a [[Turkish crescent]], plus chromatic fanfare trumpeters, buglers and trumpeters). Military corps of drums are usually made separate from the massed military bands of the unit or command that it is a part of, and are led by a drum major who is a commissioned officer of minimum junior officer rank.\n\n[[File:Azerbaijan Armed Forces.jpg|thumb|An Azerbaijani corps of drums]]\n\nHistorically, the corps of drums is a military unit that is formally a part of the junior military high schools of these countries. Uniquely, the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces]] follows the Turkish models by attaching a full bugle formation behind the corps of drums.\n\n===List of Post-Soviet units/institutions with corps of drums===\n*[[Moscow Military Music College]]\n*Kronstadt Sea Cadet Corps \n*Ussuriysk Suvorov Military School\n*Yekaterinburg Suvorov Military School\n*Vladivostok Nakhimov Naval School\n*Baltic Fleet Naval Training Center Sevastopol\n*[[Minsk Suvorov Military School]]\n*[[Ivan Bohun Military High School]]\n*[[Monte Melkonian Military College]]\n*[[Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy]]\n*[[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]]\n*[[Mastibek Tashmukhamedov Military Lyceum of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan]]\n*[[Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense of Turkmenistan]]\n*[[Military Music College of Mongolia]]\n*Georgi Atanasov Military Music School (until 2001<ref>https://m.dnevnik.bg/print/arhiv_pari/2001/08/01/1544686_zakrivat_uchilishte_zaradi_lipsa_na_pari/amp</ref>)\n\n== Sweden ==\nOnly the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]] King's Guard Battalion has a corps of drums organized as a platoon - the [[Svea Corps of Drums]] (''F\u00e4ltpipark\u00e5ren/Livgardets trumk\u00e5r'') which is part of the Life Guards Company. Until 2009 the Royal Swedish Army Drum Corps served as the official active field music unit of both the Army and the entire Armed Forces, and thus only the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard Command]] maintains the practice with dedicated ensembles in several areas of the country.\n\n== Canada ==\nThe sole corps of drums that is active within the [[Canadian Army]] today is the Corps of Drums of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]. Being a musical unit, it replaces the regimental band of the PPCLI, which was dissolved in 1994. Based on the British tradition for these units, it is modeled on the Corps of Drums of the [[Royal Logistics Corps]] of the [[British Army]]. The regimental drum corps is divided into three units which are assigned to different battalions in the PPCLI. These individual drum corps operate as small drum lines that serve during different ceremonies and events. Unlike their British and American counterparts, but more similar to the Corps of Drums of the RLC, the drum corps does not utilize [[flutes]] and bugles. An example of a historical corps of drums can be found through the [[Fort Henry Guard]] and the [[Fort York Guard]], both of which sport corps of drums that include [[fife]]s and are led by a Drum Major and a Drum Sergeant. Although it is not part of the Canadian Forces, it is designed to represent the units of the [[British Army]] in [[Upper Canada]]. During WWII, many regiments maintained small corps of drums that were stationed at all\nmajor bases. While most of them were staffed by active duty troops, others were staffed by volunteer bandsmen, consisting of reservists and professional civilian percussionists.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520erum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], corps of drums have been historically attached to military bands at the front-rank following the precedent the [[Royal Marines Band Service|bands]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Corps of Royal Marines]]. After the 1968 [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]], corps of drums in both the RCN, were dismantled and abolished, although notably making a return in the mid-1980s within the naval reserve. In July 2013, a five-person corps of drums was unveiled for the first time by the [[Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific]] a [[Victoria Day]] Parade.<ref>http://www.lookoutnewspaper.com/corps-of-drums-return-to-band/</ref>\n\n==Netherlands and in Indonesia==\n''Drum bands'' are the Dutch and Indonesian terms for the corps of drums, but in the [[Netherlands]] they are also called as ''drumfanfares'', ''tamboerkorps'', ''trompetterkorps'' and ''klaroenkorps'' (''drum and lyre bands, [[fanfare band]]s and drum and brass bands'') and in [[Indonesia]] as ''marching bands'' and ''drum corps''.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the basic instrumentation is\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Multiple and single tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Flutes, Fifes\n* Bugles, Natural trumpets, [[fanfare trumpet]]s\n* Natural horns (few bands only)\n* Turkish crescent (optional)\n* [[Brass section]]/[[Marching brass]] (in few bands)\n\nMilitary drum bands in the [[armed forces of the Netherlands]] would have only two to four of these basic instruments.\n\nOptional or permanent instruments in these bands are flutes and piccolos, bugles, natural horns, valved bugles and brass instruments (soprano bugles and trumpets, cornets, horns, mellophones, baritones, sousaphones and contrabass bugles).\n\nThese bands are attached to the main marching band, similar to French bands, but also perform as stand alone bands. They are led by a drum major, and can have [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s and [[colour guard]]s, the latter now more separated from the band.\n\nIn the 1990s however these bands became paramilitary-styled and even adopted the traditions of British military bands of the Guards Division and the Royal Marines, but several of these bands chose the American marching band and drum and bugle corps practice. Some of these bands also adopted woodwind instruments turning them into full-time military marching bands, and almost all drum bands use English voice commands and not Dutch commands and only a few use whistle commands and the mace movements.\n\nIn Indonesia, the corps, a military musical heritage from Dutch colonial times, may be treated as military, civil or school marching and show bands, and in some cases as [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]], and are either attached to the main marching band or as stand-alone bands, with instrumentation drawn from the following:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* [[Melodica]]s (in school marching bands)\n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]s (chromatic and/or herald) (optional)\n* [[Bugle]]s (optional)\n* Flutes, piccolos (in the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]])\n* Fifes (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Clarinet]]s (in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Trumpet]]s, [[cornet]]s and soprano bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* [[Flugelhorn]]s and flugel bugles\n* [[Trombone]]s (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[French horn|Horn]]s, [[mellophone]]s and horn bugles\n* Baritone bugles, [[baritone horn]]s and marching baritones\n* [[Wagner tuba]]s (optional)\n* [[Tuba]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[saxhorn]]s (optional)\n* [[Contrabass bugle]]s, [[sousaphone]]s\n''If a civilian front ensemble is present'':\n* [[Marimba]]\n* [[Vibraphone]]\n* Xylophone\n* Suspended cymbals\n* Tubular bells\n* Gong\n* Drum kit\n* Timpani\n\nThey are led by from one to six [[Drum major (military)|drum major]]s and can have a separate director of music (in civil and police bands only), majorettes and [[color guard (flag spinning)|Colour guard]]s (optional). The drum majors in these bands have a unique use of the mace in order to coordinate the timing and precision of the band like US marching band drum majors do. The Indonesian corps also has dancing bass drummers either wearing uniforms or costumes (such is the case in the corps of drums of the various Indonesian uniformed organizations, most especially the armed forces and the national police), a unique feature of these corps and are attached to it and are also a nod to Indonesian cultural traditions, plus dancing contrabass buglers and baritone buglers in some bands. The brass instruments are pitched in C, F or B major unlike US military DBCs, most notably that of the [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]] that use G major brasses and civilian corps in the past, and so too are the glockenspiels being used and the flutes and clarinets.\n\nAnother unique characteristic is that in military and police corps of drums, tenor and bass drummers, baritone buglers (optionally) and contrabass buglers wear combat, duty or everyday uniform (and optionally costumes for the tenor drummers) instead of the full dress uniform while playing, whether in performance, field practice or rehearsals, unlike their British counterparts do. They wear [[beret]]s, [[ball cap]]s or [[side cap]]s as head-dress, unlike the rest of the band, who wear [[peaked cap]]s, especially the drum majors and in civil bands, the director of music, the color guards and the pit section during field performances. Bands of the Armed Forces academies tend to have their single tenor drummers wear their specialty uniform and colored berets of the selected service arm or branch, with those of the Navy wearing free diving gear and the Air Force flightsuits.\n\n=== Ancient style corps of drums in Indonesia ===\n\nThe practice was introduced to the Netherlands East Indies in the early 1800s, and today both the [[Yogyakarta Kraton Guards]] and the Royal Guard of [[Pakualaman]] each sport an ancient form of the corps, alongside a recently reconstituted formation from the Royal Guard of the [[Surakarta Sunanate]]. Alongside them, both the southern regencies of Central Java and Yogyakarta have dedicated civilian corps, each serving the ''bregodo rakyat'' (''people's brigade'') companies that conserve the traditions of the armed services of the former sultanates. These corps, when formed up in parade, are composed of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Fifes, flutes, [[suling]] flutes\n* Bugle/s\n* Trumpet/s (in some civil bands)\n* One to three [[Kendang]]s\n* Single tenor drum/s (in civil bands)\n* Cymbals\n* Bass drum (in civil bands and in Surakarta)\n* Gong/s\n\n==South America==\nInspired by the German (and sometimes French) style corps of drums, South American corps differ in instrumentation, size and leadership.\n\n===Chile===\nSimilar to the German corps, the Chilean corps of drums are both military and civil bands, the ''Bandas de Guerra'' (War Bands) that the Chileans call them formally.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong to the Chilean Armed Forces' three services, the [[Carabineros de Chile]] and the [[Chilean Gendarmerie]] and differ in instrumentation and officers in charge (only in the Chilean Navy).\n\n*[[Chilean Army]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*[[Chilean Navy]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major)\n*[[Chilean Air Force]]: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Carabiners: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Gendarmerie: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n\nThe military style corps also inherit the British corps' tradition of carrying drummers' swords attached to belts in all their dress uniforms.\n\nCivilian corps are usually school based bands with the addition of a percussion section (Snare drums, bass drums and cymbals) and glockenspiels and are either part of a school marching band or as a standalone band in itself. In these separate bands, a fife major leads the band's fifers/flautists while on duty, and also assist the drum major and the bugle major. These positions also exists on corps which are now part of school bands, as well as in a few volunteer community fire departments. These civil corps perform on occasions when requested and participate in competitions.\n\n===Ecuador===\nCorps of drums in Ecuador are both military and civil bands. These corps are very similar to the German corps, but with the addition of bugles and the single tenor drum.\n\nLike the Chilean corps, these bands have differences in configuration and instrumentation in the Ecuadorian armed forces. But the corps snare and tenor (sometimes bass) drummers often play on drums that are painted in the service or unit colours (sometimes in the colours of Guayaquil, which are blue and white for the corps of the [[Ecuadorian Navy]]) and in the case of the Military Academy \"Eloy Alfaro\" and the Air Force Academy \"Cosme Rendella\", have the unit/school insignia attached to the bugles' and fifes' tabards.\n\nThe typical Ecuadorian corps, called as the ''Peloton Comando'' (Commando Platoon) but are also called as the ''Banda de Guerra'' (War Band), just like in Chile in several schools and colleges (many bands now fall under the ''Banda Escolar'' or ''Banda de Paz'' title due to recent state reforms), is led by a drum major (in several cases there would be 1 to 4 drum majors) and is composed of:\n\n*Snare drums\n*Fifes (common only in the Ecuadorian Army and Ecuadorian Air Force and school bands)\n*Bugles and natural trumpets (common in all three services, principal instrument in the Ecuadorian Navy)\n*Single tenor drums\n*Bass drums (optional and common in some corps)\n*Cymbals (optional and in some corps)\n*Glockenspiels\n*Multiple tenor drums (only in school bands)\n\nEcuadorian Civil corps of drums are similar only to the Army and Air Force corps but are based as youth bands stationed in schools across the nation. Notable exceptions include the Corps of Drums of the Ecuadorian National Police. Like military corps, they are led by a drum major in all their activities but there are cases of multiple drum majors leading, from a minimum of two to a maximum of four or five. But in some corps, there are some majorettes and tambourine players. Those that are based on the Navy's corps of drums (especially [[Guayaquil]]-based corps) use the same instrumentation as its corps have.\n\n===Venezuela===\nSimilar to Germany and Colombia's, the Venezuelan corps of drums are both military and civil bands, and like Colombia's, Peru's and Ecuador's contain the same instrumentation of :\n\n*Snare drums\n*Bass drums\n*Cymbals\n*Single tenor drums\n*Glockenspiels\n*Bugles (and optionally trumpets)\n\nThe corps is led by a single drum major. In some corps, especially in civil-based ones, other brass instruments may be added into the bugle section.\n\nMilitary corps have tabards applied on the bass drums, snare drums, glockenspiels and bugles on every occasion that it is performing. One such formation is the Military Academy of Venezuela Corps of Drums. Recently there's an effort to build up full-time military marching bands in the national armed forces with the percussion of the corps combined with brass and woodwind instruments.\n\n===Bolivia===\nCorps of drums in Bolivia, both military and civil, are inspired by German and French band practices and are part of the main band. The instruments used by them are snare drums, tenor drums (single and multiple), bass drums, cymbals and sometime glockenspiels. Turkish crescents are used as standards and are paraded as part of them. In military corps attached to bands there would be one to two drum majors and in some cases standards or vertical banners are used to distinguish the corps when on parade. Civil corps attached to [[marching band]]s would have one to eight drum majors (in some cases ten) and would also have a military-styled colour guard marching with the Turkish crescents and optionally the standards.\n\n===Peru===\nPeruvian corps of drums are both military (''Banda de guerra'') and civil bands (''Banda ritmica''), with differences in instrumentation. In whatever combination, it's a main part of the main school or military marching band led by the Director of Music, with the drum major or majorette or standard bearer leading led by the conductor or as a separate band led by the drum major or standard bearer at the front of the ensemble. These follow the Spanish and French influence.\n\nCorps of drums in the [[Peruvian Armed Forces]] and the [[National Police of Peru]] (formerly the Civil Guard of Peru, Peruvian Investigations Police and Peruvian Republican Guard), plus school or college based bands and corps attached to them or as separate bands are composed of snare and or field drums, single tenor drums, multiple tenor drum (in school corps), bugles and glockenspiels in addition to the regular snare and bass drums and cymbals. [[Tambourine]]s are common within the school-based corps, with female [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s assisting the conductor or the school band drum major or music director. Tabards are applied only on the bugles and glockenspiels, as well as in the snare and tenor drums if applicable.\n\n===Colombia===\nColombian corps of drums ar similar to those of Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela but are different in leadership, being led by a minimum of 3-7 drum majors or majorettes, and are composed instrumentally of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Field/precision snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums (civil corps)\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Bugles and trumpets\n* Natural trumpets (military corps only and in several civil corps)\n* [[Trombones]] (optional, only in select military corps)\n* [[Saxhorns]] (only in select military corps)\n* [[Bagpipes]] (in the corps of drums of the [[Colombian Naval Academy]] and the Basic School of the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]])\n* Tambourines (civil corps)\n* Conga drums (civil Corps)\n* Timbales (civil corps)\n* Cowbells (civil corps)\n* Suspended cymbals (civil corps)\n\nCivil corps would also have a separate conductor, occasionally standard bearers and [[colour guard]]s marching along.\n\nEven through separate from the main marching band, a part of the band itself or as a band of its own, they are both useful as military-based and civil-based marching bands. The drums are either covered with cloth tabards of the unit or band to which the corps belongs, or painted in various colours to suit its needs.  The bugles, trumpets and glockenspiels (and in military units and several civil bands, natural trumpets) are attached with small tabards with the military service, police, school or college insignia, name or emblem shown in them.\n\n== Central America ==\nKnown as ''Bandas de Guerra'' or ''banda tradicional'' in Spanish, the Corps of drums tradition is also active in the following Central American countries:\n\n* [[Guatemala]]\n* [[El Salvador]]\n* [[Honduras]]\n* [[Panama]]\n\nThe Guatemalan corps tradition is mostly active in school-based corps, which mirror drum and bugle corps of the US and Mexico. In Nicaragua, only the Nicaraguan Armed Forces sports a small corps manned by officer cadets. School based bands are known as ''bandas ritmicas'' following the Peruvian pattern and are percussion only.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200141/http://www.coldstreamguards.org.nz/ Coldstream Guards Corps of Drums website]\n*[http://www.royalwelshband.com/drums/drums.shtml Regimental Band of The Royal Welsh Guards Corps of Drums website]\n*[http://www.corpsofdrums.com/ Corps of Drums Society]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080325110007/http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc_band/corps_of_drums.htm Corps of Drums of The Royal Logistic Corps]\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XgwuPK4jEA0 Kirab Drum Corps Akpol]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military band]]\n* [[Marching band]]\n* [[Pipe band]]\n* [[Fife and drum corps]] for the US variant \n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]\n* [[Fanfare band]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corps Of Drums}}\n[[Category:Types of musical groups]]\n[[Category:Marching bands]]\n[[Category:Military bands]]\n[[Category:Combat occupations]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Drum and bugle corps (disambiguation){{!}}Drum and bugle corps}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-24.jpeg|thumb|right|Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Conservatoire at the Victory Parade on Red Square, 2010.

This role was fulfilled by trumpeters or buglers and timpanists in the cavalry and the artillery, who did not form into comparative formed bodies in the way that drummers did; therefore, an orthodox corps of drums will exist in the infantry arm and not in other arms (save for the light infantry).\n\n==History==\n\nMost fife and drum traditions trace back to the Swiss mercenaries of the early Renaissance, and it is known that by the early 16th century, each [[Company (military unit)|company]] of infantry soldiers would have a single drummer and a single fife player.<ref>[http://corpsofdrums.com/about/history/ History]</ref> These two musicians would march at the head of the company, and when not providing uplifting marching tunes, they would be used by the company commander to convey orders, on and off the field of battle. The drummers would be more aptly described as signallers than musicians, as shouted orders were very hard to hear over the din of battle. Later, a bugle would become the preferred means of communication on the battlefield, and the drummers adapted, training on bugles and carrying them in battle, but retaining the drum and the title of drummer.\n[[Image:Battle of bunker hill by percy moran.jpg|thumb|Drummers in the centre foreground, in their original battlefield role, close to the officer and wearing the distinctive drummers uniform described below.]]\nAs time went on, the individual drummers and fife players in each company would be organized at battalion level.  They retained their role in each company in battle, but would form one body of men at the head of a battalion on the march. It was necessary to appoint a Drum Major (the equivalent of a Sergeant Major, for the drummers) to be in charge of the drummers and to organize training in the emerging discipline of military drumming while a fife major was to be appointed to be the principal fifer and to train future fife players. The corps of drums would group together when not on duty with each company, and carry out various roles within the battalion, such as administering military justice and ensuring soldier's billets were secured, thus, the corps of drums became attached to the battalion HQ and was organized at battalion level, as opposed to individual company level.\n\n==Current Role==\n\nEventually, as the use of musical instrument on the battlefield diminished, corps of drums looked to fill specialist roles within the battalion while still retaining their original role for ceremonial purposes.\n\nSeveral different strings of logic have seen corps of drums employed in many varied roles. Because the corps would often be employed in support of the battalion, in areas such as delivering mail or designating billets, they are often given the role of assault pioneers, or supporting-fire (machine gun) platoons.\nThe corps of drums role on the battlefield was originally to signal orders, and therefore some units are organised into signals platoons, operating radios.\nCorps of drums were also deployed to march under the parley flag when officers of opposing met to discuss terms of surrender, etc. Therefore, some corps of drums perform a liaison role.\n\nHistorical duties such as uncasing [[Colours, standards and guidons|the colours]] on parade and various other privileges are continued in most units. Due to the specialist duties and ceremonial aspects of a drummers life, a corps of drums may be the unofficial custodian of regimental customs and traditions.\n\nCorps of drums are drawn from the whole battalion, and are attached to the battalion HQ. Above the [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] as its head, the corps is usually answerable to the battalion's [[adjutant]].\n\n==United Kingdom==\n[[File:Drummer Lee Rigby 1.jpg|thumbnail|upright|The late [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]] was a Drummer in the Royal Fusiliers]]\nThe [[British Army]] maintains a corps of drums in each infantry battalion except for [[Royal Regiment of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Irish]], and Rifle Regiments ([[The Rifles]] and the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]]) which have [[Pipe band|pipes and drums]] and Bugles respectively. Each battalion of a regiment will maintain a corps of drums which may be 'massed' together on certain occasions. All corps-of-drums soldiers are called {{Anchor|drummer}} drummers (shortened to 'Dmr') regardless of the instrument they play, similarly to use of the term \"sapper\" for soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/>\n\nUnlike army musicians who form bands and will usually be limited to auxiliary duties in wartime, drummers in a Corps of Drums are principally fully trained infantry soldiers, with recruitment coming after standard infantry training. A Corps of Drums will deploy with the rest of the battalion, and will often form specialist platoons such as [[assault pioneer]]s, supporting fire or [[force protection]].\n\nHistorically, the drum was used to convey orders during a battle, so the Corps of Drums has always been a fully integrated feature of an infantry battalion. Later on, when the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] was adopted to convey orders, drummers were given bugles in addition, but maintained their drums and flutes, except in rifles regiments where the lighter instrument was more conducive to the skirmishing form of warfare.\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Welsh guards drummers on the mall.jpg|thumbnail|Corps of Drums of the Welsh Guards. Note: side drum, bugle and short-sword slung behind, fleur-de-lys lace on body and sleeves of tunic.]]\nThe main instrument is the [[Snare drum|Side drum]]. These were originally of a rope-tension design with wide wooden hoops, a wooden shell and an animal-skin head. In the British Army, this model has been continuously upgraded, with the inclusion of snares, more modern metal rod-tension and plastic heads. The current British Army 97s-pattern side drum also has nylon hoops.\n\nThe side drum was increasingly decorated throughout the 19th century, until it bore the fully embellished [[regimental colour]]s of the battalion, including its [[battle honour]]s. As such a regiment's drums are often afforded respect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe second instrument was originally the [[Fife (instrument)|fife]], replaced in the modern British Army by the [[Five-key flute|five key flute]]. A wide variety of flutes and pitches is used. The fife and later the flute have been favoured as a warlike instrument due to shrill pitch and thus the ability to be heard above the noise of battle. Many tunes such as [[The British Grenadiers]] are traditionally played by military flutes. Fifes and keyed flutes were typically pitched in B-flat, but the flute family eventually expanded to include a Piccolo in E-flat, a perfect fourth higher, and a flute pitched in F, a perfect fourth lower than the B-flat flute. There was also a \"B-flat Bass\" which was pitched an octave below the B-flat flute. Occasionally the B-flat flute is known as the \"Treble\" in order to avoid confusion with the B-flat bass flute. The development of this family of flutes facilitated the development of flute band part music which in many ways imitates the style of larger military bands.\n\nThe bugle replaced the drum mid-way through the 19th century as the most common means of communication on the battlefield. These duties were carried out by the battalion's corps of drums, whose drummers now each carry a bugle.\n\nAs the musical role of a corps of drums became more ceremonial in the 19th and 20th centuries, more instruments were added to make their output more musically complete. A modern corps of drums may thus have a range of percussion instruments such as a [[bass drum]], [[tenor drum]]s and [[cymbals]] in addition to the snare drum, flute and bugle.\n\n===Uniform===\n[[Image:DWR Colours, Erquinghem Lys, France (RLH) 2005-11-12.JPG|thumb|left|A corps of drums of the [[Duke of Wellington's regiment]] (since amalgamated into the [[Yorkshire Regiment]]), showing crown lace tunics, a leopard skin on the bass drummer, and rod-tension side drums with metal hoops.]]\nDrummers originally wore distinct uniforms so as to stand out on the battlefield. During the 18th century most British Army drummers were distinguished by wearing their regimental uniforms in \"reversed colours\" \u2013 thus an infantry regiment wearing [[Red coat (British Army)|red coat]]s with yellow [[facings]] would clothe its drummers in yellow coats with red facings. This practice tended to make drummers targets in battle and after 1812 was replaced by less conspicuous distinctions.<ref>page 71, \"Military Uniforms of Britain & the Empire\", Major R.M. Barnes, Sphere Books 1972</ref> These usually consisted of [[lace]], used liberally all over the standard uniform, in varying patterns. Many early patterns consisted of a \"Christmas-tree\" pattern in which the chest was covered in horizontal lace decreasing in width downwards, and chevrons of lace down each sleeve. The modern infantry pattern in the British Army is of \"crown-and-inch\" lace sewn over the seams down the sleeves, around the collar, and over the seams on the back of the tunic. The crown-and-inch lace itself is about {{convert|1/2|in}} thick with a repeating crown pattern. The [[Guards Division]]s drummers have the old-style \"Christmas-tree\" pattern, with [[fleurs-de-lis]] instead of crowns.\n\nWhilst corps of drums in the British Army often parade in [[Army Combat Uniform|combat uniforms]] and other forms of dress, they will usually parade in the [[full dress|full dress uniform]] as above, being one of a few formations which regularly wear full dress.\n\nIn some regiments, it has become custom for the percussion rank to wear leopard skins over their uniform. This has the dual purpose of protecting the uniform (cymbals have to be muffled against the chest, and therefore would leave vertical marks on a bare tunic) and protecting the instruments themselves (the bass drum can be scratched by uniform buttons). Modern \"leopard skins\" are made from synthetic fur. Other regiments opt for a simple leather or cloth apron.\n\nDrummers have traditionally been armed with \"drummers' swords\", a [[shortsword]] with a simple brass hilt bearing the [[Royal Cypher]]. The practice of wearing swords has been discontinued by some regiments, though many still do carry the swords, whilst some use an [[SA80]] [[bayonet]] as a modern alternative.\n\n===Honourable Artillery Company===\n[[File:HAC Corps of Drums at Wellington Barracks.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Corps of Drums]] of the Honourable Artillery Company at [[Wellington Barracks]].]]\nThe [[Honourable Artillery Company]] maintains a corps of drums as other British Army infantry regiments have, and as such is the only such sub-unit in an artillery unit in the British Army.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/10738.aspx<HAC Official Website>]</ref> Although the Honourable Artillery Company now fulfils an artillery role, historically it was originally an infantry regiment, with two battalions fighting during the Great War.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#History<HAC|wiki page, history>]]</ref> The last infantry battalion was disbanded in 1973, but the corps of drums remained. As the regiment still maintains the privilege granted to it by King William IV in 1830, that the H.A.C. should dress as the Grenadier Guards, except wearing silver where the Grenadiers wear gold, the corps of drums of the HAC dresses in a very similar fashion to that of the Grenadier Guards.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#Dress<HAC|wiki page, dress>]]</ref> Just as other corps of drums, its personnel carry out a soldiering role as their main function.\n\nSince the HAC is the oldest unit in existence in the British Army, and as drummers were on the establishment of infantry units at the latest during the 16th century, it may be assumed that the corps of drums of the HAC is the oldest in the British Army, though it has not been in continuous existence.\n\nIn addition, the HAC's veteran unit, the [[Company of Pikemen and Musketeers]] maintains an early form of Corps of Drums known as the 'Musik'. In this capacity, more basic fifes and larger rope-tension drums are used and 17th century uniforms are worn in keeping with the rest of the Company.\n\n===Royal Logistic Corps===\n[[Image:rlc2013-0018.jpg|thumb|RLC Drums with Battle honours.]]\nThe [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC) also maintains a corps of drums in the form of several side drummers, drawn from soldiers who serve a short tour as drummers before returning to a field unit. This is not a conventional corps of drums, as it has no flautists, and comes under the command of regimental headquarters of the RLC, rather than forming a separate entity. It frequently plays with the Band of the RLC, but often performs in isolation. It is famed for its \"black light\" display. These drummers stem from the 12 drummers placed on [[the Royal Waggon Train]] (RWT) in 1803. There are reserve soldiers within the Corps of Drums of 157 Regiment RLC, based at Cardiff in Wales.\n\nAt the time of Waterloo, in the period of deployment to the Low Countries, the RWT introduced drums made of brass. These originated on the Indian sub-continent. The size {{convert|14|by|12|in|mm}}. They weighed {{convert|16|lb}}. They were faced in blue and carried the cypher of King George, with the title below. A few drums of the period survive today. The drumsticks were of Canadian maple, following the campaigns in North America during the Napoleonic era. The drums had drag ropes purchased from unit funds. Whilst drummers carried the bugle, the common instrument for the \"Waggoners\" was the [[fanfare trumpet]] on account of their cavalry traditions, and inclusion in the light cavalry. During that period the corps was then being divided between the foot soldiers, which used drums and fifes, and the mounted soldiers, with cavalry fanfare trumpets as signalling instruments. The drum sling was still that of the hook.\n\n===Royal Marines===\n[[File:USMC-10212009-M-3403K-011.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Marines Corps of Drums]]\n[[Royal Marines Band Service|Royal Marines Bands]] are led by 'buglers', who are trained on both the side drum and the bugle as well as the Herald Fanfare Trumpet (natural trumpet); this section of the band is referred to as \"the Corps of Drums\", which since 1903 is now situated at the front of the band. Whilst similar to Army corps of drums, these are members of the Royal Marines Band Service (RMBS), although they retain their own rank structure.  Members of the RMBS are primarily musicians; however, they also carry out secondary roles (e.g. medics, drivers, force protection etc.) when required to, like their Army counterparts.\n\nRM Buglers have a similar history to Army 'drummers' in that they were used to convey orders on a ship on drums and bugles, and would then mass onshore into corps of drums, though they were still expected to work as individual soldiers,<ref>[http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm Fact Sheet - The Drums of the RM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}</ref> also known in slang by the Royal Navy as drummers.\n\nThese drummer-buglers trace themselves back to the raising of the Royal Marines in 1664 as a maritime foot regiment, with six drummers attached to its battalions.\n\n===History of maritime drums===\nDrums were, in 1664, used for the raising of the Duke of York's and Albany's maritime regiment of foot, the ''Admiral's Regiment''. The regiment's 1,200 personnel had per company six snare drummers, the ancestors of the Royal Marines Band's corps of drums. The Holland Regiment soon came after them. They were later to be called ''The Buffs'', the ''Old Buffs'' and ''Howards's Buffs''.\n\nEach time a maritime regiment, or from 1672 onward, a marine regiment, is disbanded and a new one appears in its place, drummers come in, especially the young ones who liked playing drums and wanted to serve playing them. The 1702 formation of the marine and sea-service foot regiments saw the drummers' greatest action at Gibraltar, when they played the drums to support their regiments.\n\nThe [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] saw into action ten British marine regiments and an all-American marine regiment, all units whose drummers and fifers played alongside their units.\n\nEven though part of the [[British Army]] which in the 18th century was led by the War Office, the Board of Ordnance and the Commissariat, marines were naval units. Royal Navy officers were at one point part of the marines. Due to two laws that regulated them and other army and navy units, marine drummers faced a loyalty problem over what drum calls they would have to do, and for what branch and on what occasion they might be required to play drums for orders, commands, etc.\n\nIn 1755, the problem was solved. The Admiralty took over what was then called ''His Majesty's Marine Forces''.  Even though at first Royal Navy officers filled the officer ranks, with lieutenant-colonel being perceived as the highest relevant rank, in 1771 a promotion to colonel occurred for the first time in the H.M.M.F.\n\nAfter their formation, the H.M.M.F's drummers and fifers of the three marine divisions played alongside their fellow soldiers in various landings worldwide on behalf of the Royal Navy. They joined their units in the American War of Independence, and a drummer was at James Cook's service during his sea travels.\n\nAt Adm. John Jervis's insistence, by King George III's order in 1802, the H.M.M.F. was transformed into the ''H.M.M.F.-Royal Marines'', albeit larger than today's establishment. Two years later, bomb vessel crews and gunners became part of the newly created ''Royal Marine Artillery'', in which bugle calls became a regular part of life from then on.\n\nThe Royal Navy in the 19th century was short of manpower in both the H.M.M.F.-R.M. and the R.M.A. For this, Army units joined the H.M.M.F.-R.M. as replacement units, carrying not only their drummers and fifers but also buglers.\n\nIn 1855, during the units' service in the Crimean War, the H.M.M.F.-R.M's foot units became one under the unified title of ''Royal Marines Light Infantry'', later known as the ''Royal Marine Light Infantry''. From then, bugles replaced drums as signallers and order beaters, but the latter would be still useful for drill, being then called ''drummers and buglers'', and from 1867 the R.M.L.I./R.M.A. drummers were called ''buglers'' only, serving individually in ships and the R.N's shore establishments and artillery units and massed into corps of drums for their units on the ground. Fifes fully declined and disappeared in usage. By then, a bugler playing both the drum and his bugle both to sound orders and do drum calls was a common sight in the RMLI and RMA. By the 1890s, even buglers also trained in using herald trumpets or Fanfare trumpets became commonplace in RMLI and RMA bases and facilities.\nA 1902 incident changed the buglers forever. A Coronation Review at [[Aldershot]] was due soon, and the then Sr. Bandmaster of the RMLI, Lt. George Miller, asked his fellow bandmasters to get buglers for his band for the review. The next day at a church parade, he asked 30 RMLI buglers to front the RMLI Massed Bands. They then marched to his own arrangement of Onward Christian Soldiers. Everyone was shocked by this and were amazed that the formation that he used would become a RMLI and RMA military band standard formation setup, and the precision stick drills that he made became a permanent fixture in military events where either or both the RMLI and RMA's presence were needed. Soon later, when the RM began operating the Royal Naval School of Music the next year as a training venue for future bandsmen of the RN, RMLI and RMA, they brought this formation for Royal Navy bands as well, inspiring the formations used by modern military bands of some Commonwealth countries like Australia,  Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n1923 would see the buglers of the R.M.L.I. and R.M.A. now belong to the ''Corps of Royal Marines'', the Royal Marines of today. Seeing action during the Second World War and in the growing crisis of the [[Cold War]] were the R.M.'s brave buglers of the new '''[[Royal Marines Band Service]]''', even through separate from the bands themselves. The R.M.A. and R.M.L.I. buglers' dress uniforms (dark blue trousers and tunic and red collars and trouser wells) became the full dress of the corps bands and buglers, with the addition of a Wolseley [[pith helmet]] as headdress, and yellow shoulder cords and slashed cuffs to indicate their long history, heritage and lineage from 1664.\n\nBy 1950, the R.N.S.o.M. became today's [[Royal Marines Band Service#Royal Marines School of Music|Royal Marines School of Music]], and the Royal Naval bands were dissolved. Beating retreats by both the Royal Marine bands and the R.M. Corps of Drums buglers would begin to occur annually, later triennially and as of today biannually, at [[Horse Guards Parade]], [[Portsmouth]] and other venues, playing for the entire Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. It would be only in 1978 that the R.M.B.S. would have buglers as well in its rosters. By the 1990s, however, only five R.M. corps of drums were left as the Deal Depot closed down in 1996, the Chatham band already dissolved in the 1940s, with three at the R.N. England bases in [[Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth]] and at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] till 2008 (The last is now assigned to {{HMS|Collingwood|establishment|6}}), one in the R.M.S.o.M. (then in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and now in Portsmouth since 1996) and another one in [[Scotland]] at HMS ''Caledonia''. By the 1950s, only the band carried the corps at the lead, as separate corps of drums, which played only bugles alongside the drums, were discontinued altogether (these were adopted in the 1880s when the RM began to transition from fifes to bugles).\n\nToday there are six R.M. Bands (plus the training company, R.M.S.o.M. Junior Musicians and Buglers) located around the UK, in Portsmouth (three in HMS Nelson, which includes the R.M.S.o.M.), Fareham (HMS Collingwood), Plymouth (HMS Raleigh), Lympstone (Commando Training Centre Royal Marines) and Scotland (HMS Caledonia) for a total of seven bands and attached corps of drums.  All members of the R.M.B.S. are trained at the Royal Marines School of Music (HMS Nelson). Buglers' training lasts two years. Basic military skills are taught during four months of initial military training and, if successful, trainee buglers are instructed on the bugle, drum and herald/fanfare trumpets. Musical skills are refined and supported with additional lessons in music theory and aural perception. Parade work forms a large part of the curriculum and considerable time is spent developing personal drill and bearing.\n\nToday's R.M. Corps of Drums contains approximately 60 buglers who carry out duties ranging from repatriation services (''Last Post'' and ''Reveille''), mess beatings (drum displays), beating retreat (marching displays) and concerts on behalf of the Royal Marines and the entire Royal Navy.\n\n===Instruments and leadership===\nLike the British Army, Military snare (side) drums (MSD) are the principal instrument of the corps of drums; however, another core instrument is the bugle. Bass drums are often used during parades and drum displays, while cymbals and single tenor drums are used during parades and ceremonies only. Herald Fanfare trumpets (natural trumpets) are also performed on such occasions where a bugle fanfare would be inappropriate for such. The corps is led by a drum major and a bugle major serves as the principal player for it.\n\n===British civilian and cadet corps of drums===\nIn addition to Army and Navy/Royal Marines Corps of Drums, in the [[United Kingdom]] there are also [[Cadet#United Kingdom|cadet]]- civilian corps who base their music on the military traditions of the country.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/> The [[Army Cadet Force]] corps use the Army-style formations and instrumentation (flutes/bugles, snare, bass and tenor drums, cymbals and [[Glockenspiel]]s), save for those with Scottish and Irish links that have [[Pipe band]]s instead and those affiliated with the light infantry (especially the now only LI regiment [[The Rifles]]) have a corps of drums without the fifes while using only bugles. Those corps of the [[Combined Cadet Force]], [[Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps]] and the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] use the RN/RM naval and ship-style corps (Snare drums/Bugles, Bass and Tenor drums, cymbals and glockenspiels) and are attached to the main band. This formation is also used by the military band of the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]]. Another example of a military style CoD is that of the [[Royal British Legion]], whose bands are modeled on the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Band Service. The Royal Air Force however does not have any such ensembles, and only Corps of Drums under the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]] are active, with their formation being similar to those of the RN and RM.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police restarted a Corps of Drums in 2011, when the central youth engagement unit purchased some drums and sent cadets on a \"band camp\". Greenwich borough subsequently took a caretaker role of the drums and expanded in a drum corp. 2015 saw Kensington and Chelsea and Hillingdon Boroughs expanding and creating more branches of the drum corp. It is the first band in the Metropolitan Police to be composed of members of the Metropolitan Police since 1988. It is also the first band in the name of the Metropolitan Police since 1997, when the civilianised Metropolitan Police Band was disbanded.\n\nCivilian corps of drums are also formatted after their respective services, with corps patterned after those of the Army, Navy and the Royal Marines in instrumentation and marching style becoming commonplace. These are staffed by both veteran and retired military drummers as well as civilian drummers playing the fifes, bugles and percussion. In Northern Ireland, civilian corps are mounted by Loyalist groups, which for the most part use flutes with no bugles at all.\n\n==United States==\nA '''corps of drums''' or '''field music band''' in the United States is a type of [[military band]], which originated in European [[Army|armies]] in the 16th century. The main instruments of a corps of drums are the [[drum]] and the [[flute]] or [[Fife (instrument)|fife]] and [[bugle]]. Unlike 'full' [[Military band|military marching bands]], corps of drums usually exist within an [[infantry]] [[battalion]]. A [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] is the leader of a corps of drums, and in the past a fife major served as the principal fifer or flautist with a bugle major serving the same purpose for the buglers.\n\n[[Valley Forge Military Academy and College]] has a corps of drums that is part of the regimental band. Uniforms and music are modelled on the Royal Marines Corps of Drums. VFMAC does have a similar but separate formation which is part of the Corps of Cadets (VFMAC Field Music) which only uses drums (snares, tenors and basses), cymbals and bugles and from 2011, fifes. Formed in 1956, it also provides the official guard-of-honour for visitors to the Delaware Valley area.\n\nThe [[United States Army]] [[Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps]], raised in 1960 and part of the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]] of the [[United States Army]], formally revived this very part of American military music history and its mission is to relive it for coming generations. This is the only musical unit of the US armed forces in which its drum major, wearing a classic 18th century infantry cap and carrying a [[spontoon]], the honor badge and weapon of 18th century senior non-commissioned officers, salutes using the left hand. Musicians assigned to this unit wear 18th century military uniforms reminiscent of those used in the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the [[Continental Army]] drummers and fifers. Another corps of drums is found as part of the [[West Point Band]] - the West Point Hellcats, which wear regulation uniforms from the 1820s, and since 2016 play using bugles, fifes and traditional rope tension snare and bass drums.  Until the late 19th century the US Army and the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained similar ensembles before switching to bugles.\n\n=== Formation of field music/corps of drums in the US Armed Forces and civilian organizations === \nWhile only the Old Guard FDC is the only field music formation in the US Armed Forces and thus more similar to a European corps of drums, in the past there had been similar formations armed forces-wide. Should such units be reactivated again not just in the Armed Forces but also as civilian, veterans or youth cadet formations, the formation of the ensemble is as follows (the formation is to be expected to be led by a drum major):\n\n* Field snare drums\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Cymbals (optional)\n* Single tenor drums (optional)\n* Glockenspiels (optional)\n* Fifes\n* Piccolos, Flutes\n* Bugles in B and/or G Major\n* Chromatic fanfare Trumpets in B or G Major (optional)\n* Single-valve bugles (Only in the Old Guard FDC)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald Fanfare Bugles (optional)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald fanfare trumpets (optional)\n* Soprano Bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* Flugelhorn Bugles\n* Mellophones\n* Baritone Bugles\n* Marching Baritones\n* Contrabass bugles\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, ''Spielmannszug'', ''Tambourkorps'' and  sometimes ''Trommlerkorps'' are the names given to the German corps of drums, whether it is a military formation or a civilian formation. The instrumentation of these are, commonly fifes and snare drums (just like the [[Bundeswehr]] corps of drums that are attached to the unit military bands), [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s, [[Glockenspiel]]s, Bass drums, cymbals and, on some corps, single and multiple tenor drums, and like their British counterparts, bugles (in several corps). [[Timpani]], [[vibraphone]]s and [[marimba]]s are used in concerts. Sometimes even a [[Turkish crescent]] is used to symbolize the band. Whatever the configuration, a drum major always leads the corps during military and civil parades and other events, and in modern corps even majorettes and pom pom dancers are a part of its roster.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong and are attached to the bands of the Bundeswehr [[Military bands of the Bundeswehr|Military Music Center]] under the Bundeswehr [[Streitkr\u00e4ftebasis]] while civilian corps are dedicated civil bands and youth bands assigned in cities and towns all over Germany.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1990, the [[National People's Army]] maintained corps of drums in the same manner as the Bundeswehr. During the Republic Day parades on 7 October in East Berlin from 1959 to 1989, the national corps included single tenor drums at the front.\n\n==Russia/CIS==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e \u0414\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0412\u041e (5).jpg|thumb|Drummers of the [[Minsk Suvorov Military School]] on the avenue during a parade in 2017.]]\nRussian '''{{transl|ru|Barabanshchiki}}''' or drummers are names that are used to refer to Russian military corps of drums ({{lang|ru|\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432}}, {{transl|ru|rota barabanshchikom}}), a practice that is of Imperial origin in the field drummers that marched at the lead of their units in parades and that is a part of the traditions of almost all former Soviet republics (save for the Baltics and Georgia). Russian drum corps are usually made up of snare drummers with one line of [[flute]] or [[fife]] players in the middle and two [[glockenspiel]]s in the front (with the option for a third one or a [[Turkish crescent]], plus chromatic fanfare trumpeters, buglers and trumpeters). Military corps of drums are usually made separate from the massed military bands of the unit or command that it is a part of, and are led by a drum major who is a commissioned officer of minimum junior officer rank.\n\n[[File:Azerbaijan Armed Forces.jpg|thumb|An Azerbaijani corps of drums]]\n\nHistorically, the corps of drums is a military unit that is formally a part of the junior military high schools of these countries. Uniquely, the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces]] follows the Turkish models by attaching a full bugle formation behind the corps of drums.\n\n===List of Post-Soviet units/institutions with corps of drums===\n*[[Moscow Military Music College]]\n*Kronstadt Sea Cadet Corps \n*Ussuriysk Suvorov Military School\n*Yekaterinburg Suvorov Military School\n*Vladivostok Nakhimov Naval School\n*Baltic Fleet Naval Training Center Sevastopol\n*[[Minsk Suvorov Military School]]\n*[[Ivan Bohun Military High School]]\n*[[Monte Melkonian Military College]]\n*[[Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy]]\n*[[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]]\n*[[Mastibek Tashmukhamedov Military Lyceum of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan]]\n*[[Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense of Turkmenistan]]\n*[[Military Music College of Mongolia]]\n*Georgi Atanasov Military Music School (until 2001<ref>https://m.dnevnik.bg/print/arhiv_pari/2001/08/01/1544686_zakrivat_uchilishte_zaradi_lipsa_na_pari/amp</ref>)\n\n== Sweden ==\nOnly the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]] King's Guard Battalion has a corps of drums organized as a platoon - the [[Svea Corps of Drums]] (''F\u00e4ltpipark\u00e5ren/Livgardets trumk\u00e5r'') which is part of the Life Guards Company. Until 2009 the Royal Swedish Army Drum Corps served as the official active field music unit of both the Army and the entire Armed Forces, and thus only the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard Command]] maintains the practice with dedicated ensembles in several areas of the country.\n\n== Canada ==\nThe sole corps of drums that is active within the [[Canadian Army]] today is the Corps of Drums of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]. Being a musical unit, it replaces the regimental band of the PPCLI, which was dissolved in 1994. Based on the British tradition for these units, it is modeled on the Corps of Drums of the [[Royal Logistics Corps]] of the [[British Army]]. The regimental drum corps is divided into three units which are assigned to different battalions in the PPCLI. These individual drum corps operate as small drum lines that serve during different ceremonies and events. Unlike their British and American counterparts, but more similar to the Corps of Drums of the RLC, the drum corps does not utilize [[flutes]] and bugles. An example of a historical corps of drums can be found through the [[Fort Henry Guard]] and the [[Fort York Guard]], both of which sport corps of drums that include [[fife]]s and are led by a Drum Major and a Drum Sergeant. Although it is not part of the Canadian Forces, it is designed to represent the units of the [[British Army]] in [[Upper Canada]]. During WWII, many regiments maintained small corps of drums that were stationed at all\nmajor bases. While most of them were staffed by active duty troops, others were staffed by volunteer bandsmen, consisting of reservists and professional civilian percussionists.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520erum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], corps of drums have been historically attached to military bands at the front-rank following the precedent the [[Royal Marines Band Service|bands]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Corps of Royal Marines]]. After the 1968 [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]], corps of drums in both the RCN, were dismantled and abolished, although notably making a return in the mid-1980s within the naval reserve. In July 2013, a five-person corps of drums was unveiled for the first time by the [[Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific]] a [[Victoria Day]] Parade.<ref>http://www.lookoutnewspaper.com/corps-of-drums-return-to-band/</ref>\n\n==Netherlands and in Indonesia==\n''Drum bands'' are the Dutch and Indonesian terms for the corps of drums, but in the [[Netherlands]] they are also called as ''drumfanfares'', ''tamboerkorps'', ''trompetterkorps'' and ''klaroenkorps'' (''drum and lyre bands, [[fanfare band]]s and drum and brass bands'') and in [[Indonesia]] as ''marching bands'' and ''drum corps''.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the basic instrumentation is\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Multiple and single tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Flutes, Fifes\n* Bugles, Natural trumpets, [[fanfare trumpet]]s\n* Natural horns (few bands only)\n* Turkish crescent (optional)\n* [[Brass section]]/[[Marching brass]] (in few bands)\n\nMilitary drum bands in the [[armed forces of the Netherlands]] would have only two to four of these basic instruments.\n\nOptional or permanent instruments in these bands are flutes and piccolos, bugles, natural horns, valved bugles and brass instruments (soprano bugles and trumpets, cornets, horns, mellophones, baritones, sousaphones and contrabass bugles).\n\nThese bands are attached to the main marching band, similar to French bands, but also perform as stand alone bands. They are led by a drum major, and can have [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s and [[colour guard]]s, the latter now more separated from the band.\n\nIn the 1990s however these bands became paramilitary-styled and even adopted the traditions of British military bands of the Guards Division and the Royal Marines, but several of these bands chose the American marching band and drum and bugle corps practice. Some of these bands also adopted woodwind instruments turning them into full-time military marching bands, and almost all drum bands use English voice commands and not Dutch commands and only a few use whistle commands and the mace movements.\n\nIn Indonesia, the corps, a military musical heritage from Dutch colonial times, may be treated as military, civil or school marching and show bands, and in some cases as [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]], and are either attached to the main marching band or as stand-alone bands, with instrumentation drawn from the following:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* [[Melodica]]s (in school marching bands)\n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]s (chromatic and/or herald) (optional)\n* [[Bugle]]s (optional)\n* Flutes, piccolos (in the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]])\n* Fifes (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Clarinet]]s (in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Trumpet]]s, [[cornet]]s and soprano bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* [[Flugelhorn]]s and flugel bugles\n* [[Trombone]]s (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[French horn|Horn]]s, [[mellophone]]s and horn bugles\n* Baritone bugles, [[baritone horn]]s and marching baritones\n* [[Wagner tuba]]s (optional)\n* [[Tuba]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[saxhorn]]s (optional)\n* [[Contrabass bugle]]s, [[sousaphone]]s\n''If a civilian front ensemble is present'':\n* [[Marimba]]\n* [[Vibraphone]]\n* Xylophone\n* Suspended cymbals\n* Tubular bells\n* Gong\n* Drum kit\n* Timpani\n\nThey are led by from one to six [[Drum major (military)|drum major]]s and can have a separate director of music (in civil and police bands only), majorettes and [[color guard (flag spinning)|Colour guard]]s (optional). The drum majors in these bands have a unique use of the mace in order to coordinate the timing and precision of the band like US marching band drum majors do. The Indonesian corps also has dancing bass drummers either wearing uniforms or costumes (such is the case in the corps of drums of the various Indonesian uniformed organizations, most especially the armed forces and the national police), a unique feature of these corps and are attached to it and are also a nod to Indonesian cultural traditions, plus dancing contrabass buglers and baritone buglers in some bands. The brass instruments are pitched in C, F or B major unlike US military DBCs, most notably that of the [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]] that use G major brasses and civilian corps in the past, and so too are the glockenspiels being used and the flutes and clarinets.\n\nAnother unique characteristic is that in military and police corps of drums, tenor and bass drummers, baritone buglers (optionally) and contrabass buglers wear combat, duty or everyday uniform (and optionally costumes for the tenor drummers) instead of the full dress uniform while playing, whether in performance, field practice or rehearsals, unlike their British counterparts do. They wear [[beret]]s, [[ball cap]]s or [[side cap]]s as head-dress, unlike the rest of the band, who wear [[peaked cap]]s, especially the drum majors and in civil bands, the director of music, the color guards and the pit section during field performances. Bands of the Armed Forces academies tend to have their single tenor drummers wear their specialty uniform and colored berets of the selected service arm or branch, with those of the Navy wearing free diving gear and the Air Force flightsuits.\n\n=== Ancient style corps of drums in Indonesia ===\n\nThe practice was introduced to the Netherlands East Indies in the early 1800s, and today both the [[Yogyakarta Kraton Guards]] and the Royal Guard of [[Pakualaman]] each sport an ancient form of the corps, alongside a recently reconstituted formation from the Royal Guard of the [[Surakarta Sunanate]]. Alongside them, both the southern regencies of Central Java and Yogyakarta have dedicated civilian corps, each serving the ''bregodo rakyat'' (''people's brigade'') companies that conserve the traditions of the armed services of the former sultanates. These corps, when formed up in parade, are composed of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Fifes, flutes, [[suling]] flutes\n* Bugle/s\n* Trumpet/s (in some civil bands)\n* One to three [[Kendang]]s\n* Single tenor drum/s (in civil bands)\n* Cymbals\n* Bass drum (in civil bands and in Surakarta)\n* Gong/s\n\n==South America==\nInspired by the German (and sometimes French) style corps of drums, South American corps differ in instrumentation, size and leadership.\n\n===Chile===\nSimilar to the German corps, the Chilean corps of drums are both military and civil bands, the ''Bandas de Guerra'' (War Bands) that the Chileans call them formally.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong to the Chilean Armed Forces' three services, the [[Carabineros de Chile]] and the [[Chilean Gendarmerie]] and differ in instrumentation and officers in charge (only in the Chilean Navy).\n\n*[[Chilean Army]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*[[Chilean Navy]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major)\n*[[Chilean Air Force]]: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Carabiners: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Gendarmerie: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n\nThe military style corps also inherit the British corps' tradition of carrying drummers' swords attached to belts in all their dress uniforms.\n\nCivilian corps are usually school based bands with the addition of a percussion section (Snare drums, bass drums and cymbals) and glockenspiels and are either part of a school marching band or as a standalone band in itself. In these separate bands, a fife major leads the band's fifers/flautists while on duty, and also assist the drum major and the bugle major. These positions also exists on corps which are now part of school bands, as well as in a few volunteer community fire departments. These civil corps perform on occasions when requested and participate in competitions.\n\n===Ecuador===\nCorps of drums in Ecuador are both military and civil bands. These corps are very similar to the German corps, but with the addition of bugles and the single tenor drum.\n\nLike the Chilean corps, these bands have differences in configuration and instrumentation in the Ecuadorian armed forces. But the corps snare and tenor (sometimes bass) drummers often play on drums that are painted in the service or unit colours (sometimes in the colours of Guayaquil, which are blue and white for the corps of the [[Ecuadorian Navy]]) and in the case of the Military Academy \"Eloy Alfaro\" and the Air Force Academy \"Cosme Rendella\", have the unit/school insignia attached to the bugles' and fifes' tabards.\n\nThe typical Ecuadorian corps, called as the ''Peloton Comando'' (Commando Platoon) but are also called as the ''Banda de Guerra'' (War Band), just like in Chile in several schools and colleges (many bands now fall under the ''Banda Escolar'' or ''Banda de Paz'' title due to recent state reforms), is led by a drum major (in several cases there would be 1 to 4 drum majors) and is composed of:\n\n*Snare drums\n*Fifes (common only in the Ecuadorian Army and Ecuadorian Air Force and school bands)\n*Bugles and natural trumpets (common in all three services, principal instrument in the Ecuadorian Navy)\n*Single tenor drums\n*Bass drums (optional and common in some corps)\n*Cymbals (optional and in some corps)\n*Glockenspiels\n*Multiple tenor drums (only in school bands)\n\nEcuadorian Civil corps of drums are similar only to the Army and Air Force corps but are based as youth bands stationed in schools across the nation. Notable exceptions include the Corps of Drums of the Ecuadorian National Police. Like military corps, they are led by a drum major in all their activities but there are cases of multiple drum majors leading, from a minimum of two to a maximum of four or five. But in some corps, there are some majorettes and tambourine players. Those that are based on the Navy's corps of drums (especially [[Guayaquil]]-based corps) use the same instrumentation as its corps have.\n\n===Venezuela===\nSimilar to Germany and Colombia's, the Venezuelan corps of drums are both military and civil bands, and like Colombia's, Peru's and Ecuador's contain the same instrumentation of :\n\n*Snare drums\n*Bass drums\n*Cymbals\n*Single tenor drums\n*Glockenspiels\n*Bugles (and optionally trumpets)\n\nThe corps is led by a single drum major. In some corps, especially in civil-based ones, other brass instruments may be added into the bugle section.\n\nMilitary corps have tabards applied on the bass drums, snare drums, glockenspiels and bugles on every occasion that it is performing. One such formation is the Military Academy of Venezuela Corps of Drums. Recently there's an effort to build up full-time military marching bands in the national armed forces with the percussion of the corps combined with brass and woodwind instruments.\n\n===Bolivia===\nCorps of drums in Bolivia, both military and civil, are inspired by German and French band practices and are part of the main band. The instruments used by them are snare drums, tenor drums (single and multiple), bass drums, cymbals and sometime glockenspiels. Turkish crescents are used as standards and are paraded as part of them. In military corps attached to bands there would be one to two drum majors and in some cases standards or vertical banners are used to distinguish the corps when on parade. Civil corps attached to [[marching band]]s would have one to eight drum majors (in some cases ten) and would also have a military-styled colour guard marching with the Turkish crescents and optionally the standards.\n\n===Peru===\nPeruvian corps of drums are both military (''Banda de guerra'') and civil bands (''Banda ritmica''), with differences in instrumentation. In whatever combination, it's a main part of the main school or military marching band led by the Director of Music, with the drum major or majorette or standard bearer leading led by the conductor or as a separate band led by the drum major or standard bearer at the front of the ensemble. These follow the Spanish and French influence.\n\nCorps of drums in the [[Peruvian Armed Forces]] and the [[National Police of Peru]] (formerly the Civil Guard of Peru, Peruvian Investigations Police and Peruvian Republican Guard), plus school or college based bands and corps attached to them or as separate bands are composed of snare and or field drums, single tenor drums, multiple tenor drum (in school corps), bugles and glockenspiels in addition to the regular snare and bass drums and cymbals. [[Tambourine]]s are common within the school-based corps, with female [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s assisting the conductor or the school band drum major or music director. Tabards are applied only on the bugles and glockenspiels, as well as in the snare and tenor drums if applicable.\n\n===Colombia===\nColombian corps of drums ar similar to those of Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela but are different in leadership, being led by a minimum of 3-7 drum majors or majorettes, and are composed instrumentally of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Field/precision snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums (civil corps)\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Bugles and trumpets\n* Natural trumpets (military corps only and in several civil corps)\n* [[Trombones]] (optional, only in select military corps)\n* [[Saxhorns]] (only in select military corps)\n* [[Bagpipes]] (in the corps of drums of the [[Colombian Naval Academy]] and the Basic School of the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]])\n* Tambourines (civil corps)\n* Conga drums (civil Corps)\n* Timbales (civil corps)\n* Cowbells (civil corps)\n* Suspended cymbals (civil corps)\n\nCivil corps would also have a separate conductor, occasionally standard bearers and [[colour guard]]s marching along.\n\nEven through separate from the main marching band, a part of the band itself or as a band of its own, they are both useful as military-based and civil-based marching bands. The drums are either covered with cloth tabards of the unit or band to which the corps belongs, or painted in various colours to suit its needs.  The bugles, trumpets and glockenspiels (and in military units and several civil bands, natural trumpets) are attached with small tabards with the military service, police, school or college insignia, name or emblem shown in them.\n\n== Central America ==\nKnown as ''Bandas de Guerra'' or ''banda tradicional'' in Spanish, the Corps of drums tradition is also active in the following Central American countries:\n\n* [[Guatemala]]\n* [[El Salvador]]\n* [[Honduras]]\n* [[Panama]]\n\nThe Guatemalan corps tradition is mostly active in school-based corps, which mirror drum and bugle corps of the US and Mexico. In Nicaragua, only the Nicaraguan Armed Forces sports a small corps manned by officer cadets. School based bands are known as ''bandas ritmicas'' following the Peruvian pattern and are percussion only.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200141/http://www.coldstreamguards.org.nz/ Coldstream Guards Corps of Drums website]\n*[http://www.royalwelshband.com/drums/drums.shtml Regimental Band of The Royal Welsh Guards Corps of Drums website]\n*[http://www.corpsofdrums.com/ Corps of Drums Society]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080325110007/http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc_band/corps_of_drums.htm Corps of Drums of The Royal Logistic Corps]\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XgwuPK4jEA0 Kirab Drum Corps Akpol]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military band]]\n* [[Marching band]]\n* [[Pipe band]]\n* [[Fife and drum corps]] for the US variant \n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]\n* [[Fanfare band]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corps Of drums}}\n[[Category:Types of musical groups]]\n[[Category:Marching bands]]\n[[Category:Military bands]]\n[[Category:Combat occupations]]\n", "name_user": "God Save Queen Elizabeth", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corps_of_drums"}

He served as the Acting President of Kenya between 5 and 8 October 2014 when President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] was at the Hague. He previously served in various ministerial positions, including the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Higher Education Science and Technology. He was Secretary General of [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]], the former ruling political party, and the MP for [[Eldoret North Constituency]] between December 1997 and January 2013. He won the seat in the [[1997 Kenyan general election|1997 Kenyan election]] after defeating Reuben Chesire. He was appointed to the position of Assistant Minister in the Office of the President by President [[Daniel arap Moi]] in 1998. He was promoted to be Minister for Home Affairs in August 2002. Ruto also previously served as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Constitutional Reform in the 9th Parliament.\n\nOn 4 March 2013, he became the first Deputy President of Kenya, when he and Uhuru Kenyatta were declared winners of the [[2013 Kenyan general election]]. The duo ran on a [[Jubilee Alliance]] ticket. The [[Jubilee Alliance]] was a coalition of his [[United Republican Party]] (URP) and Kenyatta's [[The National Alliance]]. \n\nRuto was among the list of people who were indicted to stand trial at the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) for their involvement in Kenya's 2007\u201308 political violence. However, the ICC case was faced with challenges especially concerning withdrawal of key prosecution witnesses.

She remembers that Donna blew a powder in her face called \u201cdevil\u2019s breath\u201d, which would've made her incapable of murdering Jughead. This means that the Stonewall kids murdered Jughead and planted the evidence on her. Jughead\u2019s body is found when a search party goes out for him, and Betty and F.P. identify it at the morgue. After, Betty, Archie, and Veronica go back to Pop\u2019s to discuss their next moves.\n | LineColor       = 5B94F6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber   = 72\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n | Title           = Chapter Seventy-Two: To Die For\n | DirectedBy      = Shannon Kohli \n | WrittenBy       = Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa \n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|4}}\n | ProdCode        = T13.21865\n | Viewers         = 0.66<ref name=\"4.15\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-4-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Wednesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.4.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 5, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 5, 2020}}</ref>\n | ShortSummary    = Alice begins to make a documentary about Jughead\u2019s alleged death as investigation is under way. At Stonewall Prep, F.P. is in Donna\u2019s room looking for evidence for the case when Donna tells him that the Core Three killed Jughead. F.P. then goes to Riverdale High and arrests them but lets them go when the test results on the rock reveal that the blood was fake. Betty plans a funeral for Jughead and Donna, Bret, and Joan attend. Donna, believing that Jughead is alive, orders Bret to open the casket, which gets them kicked out. Donna, believing that they are being fooled decides to dig a little deeper into the death of Jughead. At school, Cheryl creates a locker memorial for Jughead which makes Betty emotional. She runs to the music room, followed by Archie and they kiss. Cheryl tells Veronica; who angrily confronts them in the lounge. Donna follows Betty into Dilton\u2019s bunker that night to find her and Archie kissing. Knowing that Donna was following her, she hid a very alive Jughead under the cot as a diversion so Bret and Donna would crack under pressure. At home, Betty and Archie flirtatiously text and Hermosa finds evidence about Donna\u2019s identity to help take-down the Stonewall kids.\n | LineColor       = 5B94F6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber   = 73\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n | Title           = Chapter Seventy-Three: The Locked Room\n | DirectedBy      = Tessa Blake\n | WrittenBy       = Aaron Allen\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|11}}\n | ProdCode        = T13.21866\n | Viewers         = 0.66<ref name=\"4.16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-11-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Wednesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.11.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 12, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n | ShortSummary    = Jughead and Betty hold a locked room with the Stonewall kids and Mr. DuPont, explaining all. Mr. Chipping killed himself out of guilt as he orchestrated each student to commit the perfect murder. Whoever was assigned the ghostwriter job, would write their murder. Moose was supposed to be the murdered student. Betty and Jughead deduce that all four students had a hand in killing Jughead. Charles ordered the trio to burn their clothes and all evidence while he took Jughead in for injuries. Betty brings in Charles, FP, and Forsythe. Forsythe has been living in hiding, trying to prove Mr. DuPont murdered his original literary circle. Jughead was bait to lure out Forsythe so Mr. DuPont could finish the murder. DuPont kills himself to avoid jail, Joan leaves the country. Brett reveals the location of the tapes, while he faces charges. Betty blackmails Donna into disappearing, figuring out Donna's grandmother was murdered by DuPont, making her the mastermind behind everything. Betty starts to realize she might have feelings for Archie. FP and Forsythe begin talking.

Kevin wants to sing a song from the musical, Hedwig, at the school's Variety Show. Archie and the gang decide to sing as a band, however, Principal Honey believes the show to be too inappropriate. Hiram has been skipping his appointments which leads to him collapsing. Betty tutors Jughead, who is not taking it seriously and investigating the videotapes. Cheryl and Toni devise a plan to try to get Honey to accept the show, but he denies, threatening to ban students from Senior Prom. After a peaceful protest, Honey cancels the Variety Show. Veronica and Archie fight over Hiram going to the gym, just as Betty and Jughead fight over him taking school seriously. Only Archie and Betty show up to rehearsal, and they end up kissing. Later, Veronica and Jughead apologize for their blowup, as Betty and Archie look at each other nervously from their windows. Veronica hosts the Variety Show at La Bonne Nuit and the Archies perform there. Watching the tapes, Jughead sees a person tied up wearing a Jughead face mask who is brutally murdered by another person in a Betty face mask.\n | LineColor       = 5B94F6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber   = 75\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 18\n | Title           = Chapter Seventy-Five: Lynchian\n | RTitle          = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20200416cw08/|title=(#418) \"Chapter Seventy-Five: Lynchian\"|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n | DirectedBy      = [[Steven A.

The only permanent river, the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], flows into a [[river delta|delta]] in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds\u2014called [[omuramba]]\u2014traverse the central northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season.\n\nA semi-desert, with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the [[Namib Desert]] to the west. There are small amounts of rainfall and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive {{convert|110|-|200|mm}} of rain per year,<ref name=\"SAltena\" /> and the wettest just a little over {{convert|500|mm}}. The surrounding [[Kalahari Basin]] covers over {{convert|2500000|km2}} extending further into Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, and encroaching into parts of [[Angola]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].\n\nNumerous pans exist within the Kalahari, including the [[Groot-vloer Pan]] and [[Verneukpan]] where evidence of a wetter climate exists in the form of former contouring for capturing of water. This and other pans, as well as river bottoms, were written about extensively at Sciforums by an article by Walter Wagner regarding the extensive formerly wet areas of the Kalahari. The Kalahari is extensive and extends further north where abandoned extensive roadways also exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciforums.com/threads/ancient-namibian-freeway-overlays-ancient-agriculture-system.158967/|title=Ancient Namibian Freeway overlays Ancient Agriculture System|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sciforums.com|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{expand section|needs=Winter conditions, especially average and extreme temperatures; also add spring and fall averages; needs citations|date=December 2012}}\n\nNorth and east, approximately where the dry forests, savannahs and salt lakes prevail, the climate is sub-humid rather than semi-arid. South and west, where the vegetation is predominantly xeric savanna or even a semi-desert, the climate is \"Kalaharian\" [[semi-arid]]. The Kalaharian climate is subtropical (average annual temperature greater than or equal to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C, at peaks reaching 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and above, with mean monthly temperature of the coldest month strictly below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C), and is semi-arid with the dry season during the \"cold\" season, the coldest six months of the year. It is the southern tropical equivalent of the [[Sahel]]ian climate with the wet season during summer. The altitude has been adduced as the explanation why the Kalaharian climate is not tropical; its altitude ranges from 600 to 1600 meters (and generally from 800 to 1200 meters), resulting in a cooler climate than that of the Sahel or [[Sahara]]. For example, winter frost is common from June to August, something rarely seen in the warmer Sahelian regions.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Les milieux d\u00e9sertiques'', Jean Demangeot, Edmond Bernus, 2001. Editor: Armand Colin. {{ISBN|9782200251970}}, page 20 in particular.</ref> For the same reason, summer temperatures certainly can be very hot, but not in comparison to regions of low altitude in the Sahel or Sahara, where some stations record average temperatures of the warmest month around 38&nbsp;\u00b0C, whereas the average temperature of the warmest month in any region in the Kalahari never exceeds 29&nbsp;\u00b0C, though daily temperatures occasionally reach up to close to {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} (44.8&nbsp;\u00b0C at Twee Rivieren Rest Camp in 2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/records.htm|title=World Record Temperatures -Highest Lowest Hottest Coldest temperatures-|website=www.mherrera.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gewitter in der Kalahari.jpg|thumb|Heavy [[thunderstorm]] near [[Stampriet]]]]\nThe dry season lasts eight months or more, and the wet season typically from less than one month to four months, depending on location. The southwestern Kalahari is the driest area, in particular a small region located towards the west-southwest of Tsaraxaibis (Southeast of Namibia). The average annual rainfall ranging from around 110&nbsp;mm (close to aridity) to more than 500&nbsp;mm in some areas of the north and east. During summer time in all regions rainfall may go with heavy thunderstorms. In the driest and sunniest parts of the Kalahari, over 4,000 hours of sunshine are recorded annually on average.\n\nIn the Kalahari, there are two main mechanisms of atmospheric circulation, dominated by the [[Kalahari High]] [[anticyclone]]:<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Tropicalit\u00e9 Jean Demangeot G\u00e9ographie physique intertropicale, pages 44\u201345, Figure 19, source: Leroux 1989.</ref>\n\n* The North and North-west of the Kalahari is subject to the alternation \"[[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ)/\"Continental [[Trade winds]]\". The ITCZ is the meeting area of the boreal trade winds with their austral counterparts what meteorologists call \"Meteorological equator\" and the sailors \"Doldrum\" or \"Pot-au-noir\" : the ITCZ generates rains in the wet season, whereas the continental trade winds cause the dry season;\n* The rest of the Kalahari is subject to the maritime trade winds, that largely shed their moisture as they cross up and over the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Southern African Great Escarpment]] before arriving over the Kalahari.\n\nThere are huge subterranean water reserves beneath parts of the Kalahari; the [[Dragon's Breath Cave]], for example, is the largest documented non-subglacial underground lake on the planet. Such reserves may be in part the residues of ancient lakes; the Kalahari Desert was once a much wetter place. The ancient [[Lake Makgadikgadi]] dominated the area, covering the Makgadikgadi Pan and surrounding areas, but it drained or dried out some 10,000 years ago. It may have once covered as much as {{convert|120000|km2}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goudie|first1=Andrew|title=Great Warm Deserts of the World: Landscapes and Evolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=204}}</ref>  In ancient times, there was sufficient moisture for farming, with dikes and dams collecting the water.  These are now filled with sediment, breached, or no longer in use, though they can be readily seen via Google Earth.<ref>http://www.sciforums.com/threads/ancient-dikes-dams-and-reservoirs-of-the-kalahari-region.159050/</ref>\n\nThe Kalahari has had a complex climatic history over the past million or so years, in line with major global changes. Changes in the last 250,000 years have been reconstructed from various data sources, and provide evidence of both former extensive lakes and periods drier than now. During the latter the area of the Kalahari has expanded to include parts of western Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola.<ref>Thomas, D.S.G. and Shaw, P.A. 1991 'The Kalahari Environment'. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge</ref>\n\n==Vegetation and flora==\n[[File:Devil's thorn flower (Tribulus zeyheri), Kalahari.jpg|thumb|Devil's thorn flower ([[Tribulus]] zeyheri) growing in the Kalahari Desert]]\n[[File:Sand dune in the Kalahari Desert (Namibia).jpg|thumb|[[Vachellia erioloba|Camel thorn]] scattered on [[dune]]s in the Kalahari Desert]]\nDue to its low aridity, the Kalahari supports a variety of flora.

The only permanent river, the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], flows into a [[river delta|delta]] in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds\u2014called [[omuramba]]\u2014traverse the central northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season.\n\nA semi-desert, with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the [[Namib Desert]] to the west. There are small amounts of rainfall and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive {{convert|110|-|200|mm}} of rain per year,<ref name=\"SAltena\" /> and the wettest just a little over {{convert|500|mm}}. The surrounding [[Kalahari Basin]] covers over {{convert|2500000|km2}} extending further into Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, and encroaching into parts of [[Angola]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].\n\nNumerous pans exist within the Kalahari, including the [[Groot-vloer Pan]] and [[Verneukpan]] where evidence of a wetter climate exists in the form of former contouring for capturing of water. This and other pans, as well as river bottoms, were written about extensively at Sciforums by an article by Walter Wagner regarding the extensive formerly wet areas of the Kalahari. The Kalahari is extensive and extends further north where abandoned extensive roadways also exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciforums.com/threads/ancient-namibian-freeway-overlays-ancient-agriculture-system.158967/|title=Ancient Namibian Freeway overlays Ancient Agriculture System|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sciforums.com|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{expand section|needs=Winter conditions, especially average and extreme temperatures; also add spring and fall averages; needs citations|date=December 2012}}\n\nNorth and east, approximately where the dry forests, savannahs and salt lakes prevail, the climate is sub-humid rather than semi-arid. South and west, where the vegetation is predominantly xeric savanna or even a semi-desert, the climate is \"Kalaharian\" [[semi-arid]]. The Kalaharian climate is subtropical (average annual temperature greater than or equal to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C, at peaks reaching 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and above, with mean monthly temperature of the coldest month strictly below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C), and is semi-arid with the dry season during the \"cold\" season, the coldest six months of the year. It is the southern tropical equivalent of the [[Sahel]]ian climate with the wet season during summer. The altitude has been adduced as the explanation why the Kalaharian climate is not tropical; its altitude ranges from 600 to 1600 meters (and generally from 800 to 1200 meters), resulting in a cooler climate than that of the Sahel or [[Sahara]]. For example, winter frost is common from June to August, something rarely seen in the warmer Sahelian regions.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Les milieux d\u00e9sertiques'', Jean Demangeot, Edmond Bernus, 2001. Editor: Armand Colin. {{ISBN|9782200251970}}, page 20 in particular.</ref> For the same reason, summer temperatures certainly can be very hot, but not in comparison to regions of low altitude in the Sahel or Sahara, where some stations record average temperatures of the warmest month around 38&nbsp;\u00b0C, whereas the average temperature of the warmest month in any region in the Kalahari never exceeds 29&nbsp;\u00b0C, though daily temperatures occasionally reach up to close to {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} (44.8&nbsp;\u00b0C at Twee Rivieren Rest Camp in 2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/records.htm|title=World Record Temperatures -Highest Lowest Hottest Coldest temperatures-|website=www.mherrera.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gewitter in der Kalahari.jpg|thumb|Heavy [[thunderstorm]] near [[Stampriet]]]]\nThe dry season lasts eight months or more, and the wet season typically from less than one month to four months, depending on location. The southwestern Kalahari is the driest area, in particular a small region located towards the west-southwest of Tsaraxaibis (Southeast of Namibia). The average annual rainfall ranging from around 110&nbsp;mm (close to aridity) to more than 500&nbsp;mm in some areas of the north and east. During summer time in all regions rainfall may go with heavy thunderstorms. In the driest and sunniest parts of the Kalahari, over 4,000 hours of sunshine are recorded annually on average.\n\nIn the Kalahari, there are two main mechanisms of atmospheric circulation, dominated by the [[Kalahari High]] [[anticyclone]]:<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Tropicalit\u00e9 Jean Demangeot G\u00e9ographie physique intertropicale, pages 44\u201345, Figure 19, source: Leroux 1989.</ref>\n\n* The North and North-west of the Kalahari is subject to the alternation \"[[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ)/\"Continental [[Trade winds]]\". The ITCZ is the meeting area of the boreal trade winds with their austral counterparts what meteorologists call \"Meteorological equator\" and the sailors \"Doldrum\" or \"Pot-au-noir\" : the ITCZ generates rains in the wet season, whereas the continental trade winds cause the dry season;\n* The rest of the Kalahari is subject to the maritime trade winds, that largely shed their moisture as they cross up and over the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Southern African Great Escarpment]] before arriving over the Kalahari.\n\nThere are huge subterranean water reserves beneath parts of the Kalahari; the [[Dragon's Breath Cave]], for example, is the largest documented non-subglacial underground lake on the planet. Such reserves may be in part the residues of ancient lakes; the Kalahari Desert was once a much wetter place. The ancient [[Lake Makgadikgadi]] dominated the area, covering the Makgadikgadi Pan and surrounding areas, but it drained or dried out some 10,000 years ago. It may have once covered as much as {{convert|120000|km2}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goudie|first1=Andrew|title=Great Warm Deserts of the World: Landscapes and Evolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=204}}</ref>  In ancient times, there was sufficient moisture for farming, with dikes and dams collecting the water.

Changes in the last 250,000 years have been reconstructed from various data sources, and provide evidence of both former extensive lakes and periods drier than now. During the latter the area of the Kalahari has expanded to include parts of western Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola.<ref>Thomas, D.S.G. and Shaw, P.A. 1991 'The Kalahari Environment'.

The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. [[Computer simulation|Numerical models]] simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions.<ref name=\":1\" /> On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their [[Estuarine water circulation|estuarine circulation]].<ref name=\":8\" /> Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Stratification ====\nStratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, [[thermohaline circulation]] and [[upwelling]] prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased [[Primary production|productivity]] in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to [[biological pump]]ing. Rising sea level can exacerbate this process by increasing the amount of deep water entering a silled basin and enhancing estuarine circulation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Middelburg|first=J.

This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of [[bioturbation]], meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration.<ref name=\":2\" /> There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface.

Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Geochemistry ===\nSome researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in [[sedimentary rock]] created under euxinic conditions.

Low \u03b4<sup>34</sup>S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean.<ref name=\":1\" /> The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (<sup>32</sup>S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (<sup>34</sup>S).

Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more [[marine snow]] and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVolcanism has also been proposed to be a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) released during [[Volcanism|volcanic]] outgassing causes [[global warming]] which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\n== Evidence for euxinic events ==\n\n=== Black shale ===\n[[File:Black shale, Kansas City MO - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Black shale is one of the preliminary indicators of anoxia and perhaps euxinia]]\nBlack shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of [[bioturbation]], meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration.<ref name=\":2\" /> There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Geochemistry ===\nSome researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in [[sedimentary rock]] created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Isotopes ====\n[[Stable isotope ratio]]<nowiki/>s can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using [[stoichiometry]] and knowledge of [[redox]] pathways, paleogeologists can use [[isotope]]<nowiki/>s ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stable isotope geochemistry|last=Jochen.|first=Hoefs|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319197159|oclc=945435170}}</ref>\n\nSulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low \u03b4<sup>34</sup>S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean.<ref name=\":1\" /> The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (<sup>32</sup>S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (<sup>34</sup>S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe<sup>2+</sup> to form FeS<sub>2</sub> which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS<sub>2</sub>) become equal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMolybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia.<ref name=\":2\" /> Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2013</sup> into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2013</sup>  is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the [[Black Sea]], molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoO<sub>4\u2212x</sub>S<sub>x</sub><sup>2\u2013</sup> ).<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=G.

As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''After the Ball'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England.  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Ian's younger brother Robin accompanied him on drums in their first bands, notably The Ragtime Suwanee Six (1960\u201362) whose manager was [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nGrowing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Music and writing career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. In the early 1960s, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], he became a founding member of Dublin's first{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville. Their second record release, \"This Sporting Life\" (written by [[Brownie McGhee]]), charted in the United States in 1965. Whitcomb's next single, \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached Billboard's number 8 spot in July 1965.<ref name=Dixon>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Daniel|title=Ukulele: The World's Friendliest Instrument|year=2011|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=978-1-4236-0369-6|pages=90\u201391}}</ref> During his summer vacation in 1965, Whitcomb went to America to appear on such television programs as ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Whitcomb played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with [[The Beach Boys]] in 1965 and then toured with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], and [[Sam the Sham]] and the Pharaohs.\n\n\"N-Nervous!\", Whitcomb's next release, was recorded in Hollywood and reached No. 59 in Billboard and No. 47 in Cash Box. He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for the Tower label and producing [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]], Whitcomb returned to the UK where he began his writing career with ''After the Ball'', published  in 1972. He later wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California''.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Whitcomb starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974). He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]].

19 April 2020) was an English entertainer, singer-songwriter, record producer, writer and actor. As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''After the Ball'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England.  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Ian's younger brother Robin accompanied him on drums in their first bands, notably The Ragtime Suwanee Six (1960\u201362) whose manager was [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nGrowing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Music and writing career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. In the early 1960s, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], he became a founding member of Dublin's first{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville. Their second record release, \"This Sporting Life\" (written by [[Brownie McGhee]]), charted in the United States in 1965. Whitcomb's next single, \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached Billboard's number 8 spot in July 1965.<ref name=Dixon>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Daniel|title=Ukulele: The World's Friendliest Instrument|year=2011|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=978-1-4236-0369-6|pages=90\u201391}}</ref> During his summer vacation in 1965, Whitcomb went to America to appear on such television programs as ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Whitcomb played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with [[The Beach Boys]] in 1965 and then toured with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], and [[Sam the Sham]] and the Pharaohs.\n\n\"N-Nervous!\", Whitcomb's next release, was recorded in Hollywood and reached No. 59 in Billboard and No. 47 in Cash Box. He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for the Tower label and producing [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]], Whitcomb returned to the UK where he began his writing career with ''After the Ball'', published  in 1972. He later wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California''.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Whitcomb starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974). He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]]. During that time he also wrote and produced singles for Warner Bros.' country division, most notably \"Hands\", a [[massage parlour]] story, and \"A Friend of a Friend of Mine\".\n\nIn the 1980s Whitcomb published ''Rock Odyssey: A Chronicle of the Sixties: Ian Whitcomb'', a memoir of the 1960s and described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the best personal account of this period. He also published ''Ragtime America'' (Limelight Editions, 1988), followed by a memoir of life as a British expatriate living in Los Angeles, ''Resident Alien'' (Century, 1990). \n\nHe produced a British documentary on black music, ''Legends of Rhythm and Blues'' (part of the series ''Repercussions'', made by Third Eye Productions for [[Channel Four]] in 1984).
