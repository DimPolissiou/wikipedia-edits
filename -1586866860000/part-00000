Three white men died in the confrontation, with at least one said to have been shot by his own side. \n\nIn the wake of the contested 1872 election for [[governor of Louisiana]] and local offices, a group of white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] armed with rifles and a small [[cannon]], overpowered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[freedmen]] and state [[militia]] (also black) occupying the Grant Parish [[courthouse]] in Colfax.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\">[[Eric Foner]], ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877'', p. 437</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant/peopleevents/e_colfax.html ''Ulysses S. Grant'', People and Events: \"The Colfax Massacre\", PBS Website], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref> Most of the [[freedmen]] were killed after they surrendered; nearly 50 were killed later that night after being held as prisoners for several hours. Estimates of the number of dead have varied, ranging from 62 to 153; three whites died but the number of black victims was difficult to determine because many bodies were thrown into the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] or removed for burial. There were rumors of mass graves at the site.\n\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] described the massacre as the worst instance of racial violence during Reconstruction.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/> In Louisiana, it had the most fatalities of any of the numerous violent events following the disputed gubernatorial contest in 1872 between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Foner wrote, \"...every election [in Louisiana] between 1868 and 1876 was marked by rampant violence and pervasive fraud.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\">Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', New York: Perennial Library, 1989, p. 550</ref> Although the [[Electoral fusion|Fusionist]]-dominated state \"returning board,\" which ruled on vote validity, initially declared [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]] and his Democratic slate the winners, the board eventually split, with a faction declaring Republican [[William P.

A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=b13}}</ref>\n\nFederal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the [[Enforcement Acts]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In a key case, the court ruled in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876) that protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] to prosecute actions by [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history.\n\n==State and national background==\n\nIn March 1865, Unionist planter [[James Madison Wells]] became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By One Vote|last=Holt|first=Michael|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2008|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=195\u201396}}</ref>\n\nIt was postponed because of the [[New Orleans Massacre]] that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reconstruction|last=Craven|first=Avery|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1969|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=186\u201387}}</ref> \n\nWhen President [[Andrew Johnson]] blamed the [[massacre]] on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] over Andrew Johnson's veto. Earlier the Freedmen's Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], which had limited the rights of freedmen and other blacks, (including their choices of work and living locations) from going into effect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the South|last=Simkins|first=Francis|last2=Roland|first2=Charles|publisher=Alfred A.

On March 2, 1867, they passed the [[Reconstruction Act]], over Johnson's veto, which required that blacks be given the franchise\u2014in Southern states but not in Northern states\u2014and that reconstructed Southern states ratify the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] before admission to the Union.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Randall|first=J.

Almost all of the victims were black and some white Republicans who were protecting the black Republican freedmen. Insurgents also attacked men physically or burned their homes to discourage them from voting. President Johnson, a Democrat, prevented the Republican governor of Louisiana from using either the state militia or U.S. forces to suppress the insurgent groups, such as the [[Knights of the White Camelia]].<ref name=\"Lane\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Background in Grant Parish==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{one source|section|date=June 2019}}\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\n}}\nThe Red River area of Winn and Rapides parishes was a combination of large plantations and subsistence farmers; before the war, African Americans had worked as slaves on the plantations.{{cn|date=June 2019}} William Smith Calhoun, a major planter, had inherited a {{convert|14000|acre|km2|adj=on}} plantation in the area.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 25</ref> A former slaveholder, he lived with a [[mixed-race]] woman as his common-law wife and had come to support black political equality.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn election day in November 1868, Calhoun led a group of freedmen to vote.{{cn|date=June 2019}} The ballot box was originally at a store owned by John Hooe,{{cn|date=June 2019}} who had threatened to whip freedmen \"if they voted Republican\".<ref> Lane 2008, p. 27</ref> Calhoun arranged for the ballot box to be switched to a plantation store owned by a Republican.{{cn|date=June 2019}} The Republicans received 318 votes, and the Democrats received 49.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 28</ref> A group of whites threw the ballot box into the Red River, and Democrats arrested Calhoun, alleging election fraud.{{cn|date=June 2019}} With the original ballot box gone, Democrat Michael Ryan went on to claimed a landslide victory.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 41</ref>{{what|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe election was also marked by violence.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Election commissioner Hal Frazier, a black Republican, was murdered by whites.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 41f</ref> After this, Calhoun drafted a bill to create a new parish out of parts of [[Winn Parish|Winn]] and [[Rapides Parish|Rapides]] parishes, which passed the Republican legislature; as a major planter, Calhoun thought he would have more political influence in the new parish, which had a black majority.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Other new parishes were created by the Republican state legislature to try to develop areas of Republican political support.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Enforcement against the Klan==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2019}}\nAccording to Lane, after [[Ulysses S.

Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In 1864 he escaped and went to [[Fortress Monroe]], where he joined the [[Union Army]] and served until after General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\n==Louisiana election of 1872==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nIn Louisiana, Republican governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] defected from the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]] (a group that opposed President Grant's [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A \"Fusionist\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]] to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a [[U.S. Senator]]. Opposing McEnery was Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]], one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.\n\nAfter failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in [[New Orleans]] to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.<ref>William Hesseltine, \"Grant the Politician\", 344</ref><ref>Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \"Edward Henry Durell,\" 167-68</ref>\n\nMcEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived.<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=General James Longstreet|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=416}}</ref> Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election.\n\nWarmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630.\n\nWarmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and [[Christopher Columbus Nash]], elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]]). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.\n\nWilliam Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nGrant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.<ref name=\"libertychapelcemetery.org\">[http://www.libertychapelcemetery.org/files/hogue-colfax.pdf James K.

Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks to defend the courthouse.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nBlack Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 154</ref> With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.\n\nWilliam Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=56}}</ref> He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat ''LaBelle'' down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse.\n\nThe black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/colfaxmassacreun00keit/page/117 Keith (2007), ''The Colfax Massacre''], p. 117</ref> On April 8 the anti-Republican ''[[Daily Picayune]]'' newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: \n\n{{quote|THE RIOT IN GRANT PARISH. FEARFUL ATROCITIES BY THE NEGROES. NO RESPECT SHOWN TO THE DEAD.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=84}}</ref>}}\n\nSuch news attracted more whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, \"Boys, this is a struggle for [[white supremacy]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=91}}</ref>\n\nSuffering from [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheumatism]], on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=57}}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nCazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white [[paramilitary]] group and veteran officers from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] and [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.\n\nAbout 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed [[white flag]]s for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.\n\nNash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\"<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18</ref> Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.<ref>Lemann (2007), ''Redemption,'' p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were [[Indictment|indicted]] for the attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=124}}</ref>\n\nKellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head was beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOn April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to [[Texas]] or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\"], ''Congressional Record''], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref>\n\nThe exact number of dead was never established: two U.S. Marshals, who visited the site on April 15 and buried dead, reported 62 fatalities;<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=265}}</ref> a military report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1875 identified 81 black men by name who had been killed,<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=vcsr&GSvcid=117316 Find a grave memorial on the Colfax Massacre has 80 names listed]</ref> and also estimated that between 15 and 20 bodies had been thrown into the Red River, and another 18 were secretly buried, for a grand total of \"at least 105\";<ref name=\"Lane 256-66\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=265\u201366}}</ref> a state historical marker from 1950 noted fatalities as three whites and 150 blacks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colfax Riot Historical Marker|author=Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism|year=1950 |url=http://www.stoppingpoints.com/louisiana/Grant/Colfax+Riot.html}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event:\n\n{{quote|The bloodiest single instance of racial carnage in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Colfax massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority.

The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=22}}</ref> Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]]. It had been designed to provide federal protection for [[civil rights]] of freedmen under the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] against actions by [[terrorist]] groups such as the Klan.\n\nThe men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. [[William Burnham Woods]] presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction\u2014one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. \n\nIn the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, [[Joseph Bradley]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ([[circuit justice|riding circuit]]), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the [[state actor]] doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were [[void for vagueness]]. ''[[Sua sponte]]'', he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (''See,'' [[Morrison Remick Waite]]). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen.  Thus, enforcement of criminal sanctions under the act ended.<ref name=\"Velez\"/>\n\nThe publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white [[paramilitary organizations]]. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the [[White League]] from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Other paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] also arose, especially in [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]], which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.\n\nParamilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]], assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.<ref>Eric Foner (2002),''Reconstruction'', p. 551</ref> Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana.\n\n==Memorials==\nThe scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Finally, without [[archeological]] work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial.{{cn|date=June 2019}} \n\nIn 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died.

A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=b13}}</ref>\n\nFederal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the [[Enforcement Acts]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In a key case, the court ruled in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876) that protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] to prosecute actions by [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history.\n\n==State and national background==\n\nIn March 1865, Unionist planter [[James Madison Wells]] became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By One Vote|last=Holt|first=Michael|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2008|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=195\u201396}}</ref>\n\nIt was postponed because of the [[New Orleans Massacre]] that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reconstruction|last=Craven|first=Avery|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1969|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=186\u201387}}</ref> \n\nWhen President [[Andrew Johnson]] blamed the [[massacre]] on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] over Andrew Johnson's veto. Earlier the Freedmen's Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], which had limited the rights of freedmen and other blacks, (including their choices of work and living locations) from going into effect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the South|last=Simkins|first=Francis|last2=Roland|first2=Charles|publisher=Alfred A.

Almost all of the victims were black and some white Republicans who were protecting the black Republican freedmen. Insurgents also attacked men physically or burned their homes to discourage them from voting.

Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In 1864 he escaped and went to [[Fortress Monroe]], where he joined the [[Union Army]] and served until after General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\n==Louisiana election of 1872==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nIn Louisiana, Republican governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] defected from the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]] (a group that opposed President Grant's [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A \"Fusionist\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]] to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a [[U.S. Senator]]. Opposing McEnery was Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]], one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.\n\nAfter failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in [[New Orleans]] to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.<ref>William Hesseltine, \"Grant the Politician\", 344</ref><ref>Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \"Edward Henry Durell,\" 167-68</ref>\n\nMcEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived.<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=General James Longstreet|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=416}}</ref> Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election.\n\nWarmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630.\n\nWarmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and [[Christopher Columbus Nash]], elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]]). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.\n\nWilliam Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nGrant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.<ref name=\"libertychapelcemetery.org\">[http://www.libertychapelcemetery.org/files/hogue-colfax.pdf James K.

Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks to defend the courthouse.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nBlack Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 154</ref> With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.\n\nWilliam Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=56}}</ref> He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat ''LaBelle'' down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse.\n\nThe black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/colfaxmassacreun00keit/page/117 Keith (2007), ''The Colfax Massacre''], p. 117</ref> On April 8 the anti-Republican ''[[Daily Picayune]]'' newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: \n\n{{quote|THE RIOT IN GRANT PARISH. FEARFUL ATROCITIES BY THE NEGROES. NO RESPECT SHOWN TO THE DEAD.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=84}}</ref>}}\n\nSuch news attracted more whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, \"Boys, this is a struggle for [[white supremacy]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=91}}</ref>\n\nSuffering from [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheumatism]], on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=57}}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nCazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white [[paramilitary]] group and veteran officers from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] and [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.\n\nAbout 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed [[white flag]]s for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.\n\nNash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\"<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18</ref> Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.<ref>Lemann (2007), ''Redemption,'' p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were [[Indictment|indicted]] for the attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=124}}</ref>\n\nKellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head was beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOn April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to [[Texas]] or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\"], ''Congressional Record''], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref>\n\nThe exact number of dead was never established: two U.S. Marshals, who visited the site on April 15 and buried dead, reported 62 fatalities;<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=265}}</ref> a military report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1875 identified 81 black men by name who had been killed,<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=vcsr&GSvcid=117316 Find a grave memorial on the Colfax Massacre has 80 names listed]</ref> and also estimated that between 15 and 20 bodies had been thrown into the Red River, and another 18 were secretly buried, for a grand total of \"at least 105\";<ref name=\"Lane 256-66\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=265\u201366}}</ref> a state historical marker from 1950 noted fatalities as three whites and 150 blacks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colfax Riot Historical Marker|author=Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism|year=1950 |url=http://www.stoppingpoints.com/louisiana/Grant/Colfax+Riot.html}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event:\n\n{{quote|The bloodiest single instance of racial carnage in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Colfax massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority. Among blacks in Louisiana, the incident was long remembered as proof that in any large confrontation, they stood at a fatal disadvantage.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/>}}\n\n<blockquote>\"The organization against them is too strong. ...\" Louisiana black teacher and Reconstruction legislator [[John G. Lewis]] later remarked. \"They attempted [armed self-defense] in Colfax. The result was that on [[Easter Sunday]] of 1873 when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two hundred and eighty negroes.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[James Roswell Beckwith]], the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. Attorney General]]. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=22}}</ref> Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]]. It had been designed to provide federal protection for [[civil rights]] of freedmen under the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] against actions by [[terrorist]] groups such as the Klan.\n\nThe men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. [[William Burnham Woods]] presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction\u2014one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. \n\nIn the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, [[Joseph Bradley]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ([[circuit justice|riding circuit]]), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the [[state actor]] doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were [[void for vagueness]]. ''[[Sua sponte]]'', he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (''See,'' [[Morrison Remick Waite]]). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen.  Thus, enforcement of criminal sanctions under the act ended.<ref name=\"Velez\"/>\n\nThe publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white [[paramilitary organizations]]. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the [[White League]] from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Other paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] also arose, especially in [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]], which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.\n\nParamilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]], assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.<ref>Eric Foner (2002),''Reconstruction'', p. 551</ref> Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana.\n\n==Memorials==\nThe scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Finally, without [[archeological]] work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial.{{cn|date=June 2019}} \n\nIn 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died.

{"title_page": "Battle of Loos", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2018}}\n{{EngvarB|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Loos''' took place from {{nowrap|25 September \u2013 8 October}} 1915 in France on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], during the [[First World War]]. It was the biggest British attack of 1915, the first time that the British used [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] and the first mass engagement of [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] units. The French and British tried to break through the German defences in [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]] and restore a war of movement. Despite improved methods, more ammunition and better equipment, the Franco-British attacks were contained by the German armies, except for local losses of ground. British casualties at Loos were about twice as high as German losses.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic developments===\nThe battle was the British part of the [[Third Battle of Artois]], an Anglo-French offensive (known to the Germans as the {{lang|de|Herbstschlacht}} (Autumn Battle). Field Marshal Sir  [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] (GOC [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]]), regarded the ground south of La Bass\u00e9e Canal, which was overlooked by German-held slag heaps and colliery towers, as unsuitable for an attack, particularly given the discovery in July that the Germans were building a second defensive position behind the front position. At the Fr\u00e9vent Conference on 27 July, Field Marshal French failed to persuade [[Ferdinand Foch]] that an attack further north offered greater prospects for success. The debate continued into August, with Joffre siding with Foch and the British commanders being over-ruled by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]], the British [[Secretary of State for War]], on 21 August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=120\u2013129}} On 3 May, the British decided to use poison gas in military operations in France. At a conference on 6 September, Haig announced to his subordinates that extensive use of chlorine gas might facilitate an advance on a line towards Douai and Valenciennes, despite the terrain, as long as the French and British were able to keep the attack secret.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British offensive preparations===\nThe battle was the third time that specialist [[Royal Engineers|Royal Engineer]] [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies|tunnelling companies]] were used to dig under no-man's-land, to plant [[mining (military)|mines]] under the parapets of the German front line trenches, ready to be detonated at zero hour.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=162, 252\u2013263}}\n\n===British plan===\n[[File:Battle of Loos, 1915 png.png|thumb|<center>Battle of Loos, 1915</center>]]\nFrench decided to keep a reserve consisting of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]], the [[Indian Cavalry Corps]] and [[XI Corps (United Kingdom)|XI Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Richard Haking]]), which consisted of the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] and the New Army [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]] and [[24th Division (United Kingdom)|24th Division]], recently arrived in France and a corps staff (some of whom had never worked together or served on a staff before). [[Archibald Murray]], the Deputy [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (DCIGS) advised French that as troops fresh from training, they were suited for the long marches of an exploitation rather than for trench warfare. French was doubtful that a breakthrough would be achieved. Haig and Foch, commander of the {{lang|fr|groupe des arm\u00e9es du nord}} ([[Army Group North (France)|Northern Army Group]]), wanted the reserves closer, to exploit a breakthrough on the first day; French agreed to move them nearer to the front but still thought they should not be committed until the second day.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=300\u2013302}}\n\nHaig was hampered by the shortage of [[artillery]] ammunition, which meant the preliminary bombardment, essential for success in trench warfare, was insufficient. Prior to the British attack, about {{convert|140|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of chlorine gas was released with mixed results; in places the gas was blown back onto British trenches, while in others it caused the Germans considerable difficulty. Due to the inefficiency of contemporary gas masks, many soldiers removed them as they could not see through the fogged-up eyepieces or could barely breathe with them on, which led to some being affected by their own gas. Wanting to be closer to the battle, French had moved to a forward command post at Lilliers, less than {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind the First Army front. He left most of his staff behind at GHQ and had no direct telephone to the First Army, which attacked at {{nowrap|6:30 a.m.}} on 25 September, sending an officer by car to request the release of the reserves at {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}}{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=302\u2013305}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n{{See also|Hohenzollern Redoubt}}\n\n===25 September===\n[[File:Hohenzollern Redoubt October 1915 map.jpg|thumb|<center>Map, Hohenzollern Redoubt, October 1915</center>]]\nIn many places British artillery had failed to cut the German wire before the attack.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=163\u2013167}} Advancing over open fields, within range of German machine guns and artillery, the British suffered many casualties.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=191, 207, 223, 258, 261, 264}} The British were able to break through the weaker German defences and capture the village of [[Loos-en-Gohelle]], mainly due to numerical superiority. Supply and communications problems, combined with the late arrival of reserves, meant that the breakthrough could not be exploited. Haig did not hear until {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} that the divisions were moving up to the front. French visited Haig from {{nowrap|11:00 to 11:30 a.m.}} and agreed that Haig could have the reserve but rather than using the telephone he drove to Haking's headquarters and gave the order at {{nowrap|12:10 p.m.}} Haig then heard from Haking at {{nowrap|1:20 p.m.}} that the reserves were moving forward.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=302\u2013305}}\n\n===26\u201328 September===\nWhen the battle resumed the following day, the Germans had recovered and improved their defensive positions.

It was the biggest British attack of 1915, the first time that the British used [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] and the first mass engagement of [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] units. The French and British tried to break through the German defences in [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]] and restore a war of movement. Despite improved methods, more ammunition and better equipment, the Franco-British attacks were contained by the German armies, except for local losses of ground. British casualties at Loos were about twice as high as German losses.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic developments===\nThe battle was the British part of the [[Third Battle of Artois]], an Anglo-French offensive (known to the Germans as the {{lang|de|Herbstschlacht}} (Autumn Battle). Field Marshal Sir  [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] (GOC [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]]), regarded the ground south of La Bass\u00e9e Canal, which was overlooked by German-held slag heaps and colliery towers, as unsuitable for an attack, particularly given the discovery in July that the Germans were building a second defensive position behind the front position. At the Fr\u00e9vent Conference on 27 July, Field Marshal French failed to persuade [[Ferdinand Foch]] that an attack further north offered greater prospects for success. The debate continued into August, with Joffre siding with Foch and the British commanders being over-ruled by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]], the British [[Secretary of State for War]], on 21 August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=120\u2013129}} On 3 May, the British decided to use poison gas in military operations in France. At a conference on 6 September, Haig announced to his subordinates that extensive use of chlorine gas might facilitate an advance on a line towards Douai and Valenciennes, despite the terrain, as long as the French and British were able to keep the attack secret.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British offensive preparations===\nThe battle was the third time that specialist [[Royal Engineers|Royal Engineer]] [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies|tunnelling companies]] were used to dig under no-man's-land, to plant [[mining (military)|mines]] under the parapets of the German front line trenches, ready to be detonated at zero hour.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=162, 252\u2013263}}\n\n===British plan===\n[[File:Battle of Loos, 1915 png.png|thumb|<center>Battle of Loos, 1915</center>]]\nFrench decided to keep a reserve consisting of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]], the [[Indian Cavalry Corps]] and [[XI Corps (United Kingdom)|XI Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Richard Haking]]), which consisted of the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] and the New Army [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]] and [[24th Division (United Kingdom)|24th Division]], recently arrived in France and a corps staff (some of whom had never worked together or served on a staff before). [[Archibald Murray]], the Deputy [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (DCIGS) advised French that as troops fresh from training, they were suited for the long marches of an exploitation rather than for trench warfare. French was doubtful that a breakthrough would be achieved. Haig and Foch, commander of the {{lang|fr|groupe des arm\u00e9es du nord}} ([[Army Group North (France)|Northern Army Group]]), wanted the reserves closer, to exploit a breakthrough on the first day; French agreed to move them nearer to the front but still thought they should not be committed until the second day.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=300\u2013302}}\n\nHaig was hampered by the shortage of [[artillery]] ammunition, which meant the preliminary bombardment, essential for success in trench warfare, was insufficient. Prior to the British attack, about {{convert|140|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of chlorine gas was released with mixed results; in places the gas was blown back onto British trenches, while in others it caused the Germans considerable difficulty. Due to the inefficiency of contemporary gas masks, many soldiers removed them as they could not see through the fogged-up eyepieces or could barely breathe with them on, which led to some being affected by their own gas. Wanting to be closer to the battle, French had moved to a forward command post at Lilliers, less than {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind the First Army front.

Simultaneously, a [[low-pressure area]] and associated [[cold front]] were anticipated to shift eastward across an unstable environment, leading to the formation of severe thunderstorms. Forecasters noted that while the overall environment supported the potential for significant ([[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF2+]]) tornadoes, questions about whether storms would be supercellular or instead evolve into a [[quasi-linear convective system]] prevented the addition a significant risk area.<ref name=\"d1\" /> By the late afternoon hours of October&nbsp;20, thunderstorms began to develop across eastern Oklahoma within a rapidly-moistening environment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|author2=Jeremy Grams|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2089|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2089.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> At 7:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT, the first [[tornado watch]] was issued across the [[Ark-La-Tex]] region;<ref>{{cite web|title=Tornado Watch 676|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2019/ww0676.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> several more watches were introduced over subsequent hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Severe Weather Event Review for Sunday October 20 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/archive/event.php?date=20191020|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> A pair of long-tracked supercells developed across [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] and [[Johnson County, Texas|Johnson]] counties, intersecting a very unstable regime and producing significant tornadoes as a result.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2090|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2090.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A squall line formed along the cold front farther west, producing a wide swath of damaging winds and additional tornadoes as it tracked across the South-Central United States.<ref name=\"dallas\">{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Fort Worth, Texas|title=Texas Event Report: EF3 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=856409|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2019|accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Storm Reports for 10/20/19|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/191020_rpts.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 36\n|FU = 0\n|F0 = 13\n|F1 = 20\n|F2 = 2\n|F3 = 1\n|F4 = 0\n|F5 = 0\n|Enhanced=yes\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Confirmed tornadoes during the tornado outbreak of October 20\u201322, 2019{{efn|All dates are based on the local [[time zone]] where the tornado touched down; however, all times are in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] for consistency.|group=note|name=Date/Time}}\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|[[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF#]]\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:7%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:5%; text-align:center;\"|State\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Start Coord.\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"7%\" align=\"center\"|Date\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Path length\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Max width\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:48%; text-align:center;\"|Summary\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|Refs\n|-\n|bgcolor={{storm colour|storm}} | EF0\n|SW of [[Beckville, Texas|Beckville]]\n|[[Panola County, Texas|Panola]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|{{Coord|32.1470|-94.5443|name=Beckville (Oct. 20, EF0)}}\n|{{Sort|001|October&nbsp;20}}\n|00:36\u201300:38\n|{{convert|0.8|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|Several trees were snapped or uprooted.

This was the only EF3 damage found along the path.]]\nAt 8:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT on October 20, a tornado began in [[Dallas County, Texas]], near the interaction of State Highway 348 and Luna Road, snapping large tree limbs. The tornado moved east-northeast across [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] reaching high-end EF2 strength. A strip mall was severely damaged, sustaining roof loss and collapse of multiple exterior walls. Several other retail businesses were also damaged in this area. Along Walnut Hill Lane, a multi-story apartment complex and a commercial building had their roofs ripped off, and also sustained loss of some exterior walls. Numerous homes, along with churches and gas station also sustained heavy damage in this area. Maintaining EF2 strength, the tornado moved across Marsh Lane and through areas east, heavily damaging [[List of Dallas ISD schools|Cary Middle School]] and [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Dallas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]]. The tornado produced a mixture of EF1 and EF2 damage as it moved through residential neighborhoods to the northeast of this area, downing numerous trees, and causing moderate to significant damage to many houses. Dozens of homes along this portion of the path had their roofs torn off, several of which sustained some failure of exterior walls. The most intense pocket of damage occurred along Northhaven Road, where one well-built brick home had its roof torn off, and sustained collapse of most exterior walls. Given the degree of damage, damage surveyors assigned low-end EF3 damage to that home, the only EF3 damage point assigned along the path of the tornado. The tornado then moved into southern [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], where several businesses, including a car dealership, a Home Depot, and office low-rise buildings, suffered EF2 damage. It crossed the [[Texas Instruments]] campus, now on a more northeasterly course, causing mainly EF1 damage. [[Walnut Hill Elementary School (Dallas)|Walnut Hill Elementary School]] was also moderately damaged. At an apartment complex near Walnut Street and Greenville Avenue, dozens of units had sections of roof missing. The nearby Cutters Point apartment complex was also affected, with significant roof loss consistent with EF2 damage. A low-rise office building had numerous windows blown out. Many north of [[Richland College]] also suffered EF2 damage before the tornado began to weaken. Widespread tree and roof damage consistent with an EF1 tornado was observed across the Richland Park, Lakes of Buckingham, Richland Meadows, and College Park subdivisions. A few homes had their roofs blown off at high-end EF1 intensity. The weakening tornado then curved sharply to the north, continuing into the Huffhines Park area. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of minor damage to homes, along with numerous trees and tree limbs downed. Weakening further to EF0 strength, the tornado decreased in width and finally dissipated while crossing Jupiter Road. In total, the tornado was on the ground for {{convert|15.76|mi|km|abbr=on}}, reached a maximum width of {{convert|1300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and remained on the ground for 32&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, the tornado caused about $1.55&nbsp;billion in damage, making it the costliest tornado event in Texas history.<ref name=\"dallas\" />\n\nAround 8:00 a.m. the next morning, approximately 242,000 people were without power.

A later [[squall line]] contributed to additional tornadoes and a widespread swath of damaging winds as the system tracked eastward.\n\n==Meteorological synopsis==\nThe first signs of organized severe weather across the [[South Central United States]] came on October&nbsp;16, when the [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC) first delineated a risk area across portions of northern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, and adjacent portions of Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elizabeth Leitman|title=Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook Issued on Oct 16, 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/archive/2019/day4-8_20191016.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 16, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In their day&nbsp;3 outlook on October&nbsp;18, the organization introduced a broad Marginal risk for much of the same areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Oct 18, 2019 0730 UTC Day 3 Severe Thunderstorm Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day3otlk_20191018_0730.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A small Slight risk was added across northeastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, and western Arkansas on October&nbsp;19,<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Oct 19, 2019 0600 UTC Day 2 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day2otlk_20191019_0600.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 19, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> but as confidence in a higher-end event increased, these same areas were raised to an Enhanced risk.<ref name=\"d1\">{{cite web|author=Roger Edwards|author2=Andy Dean|title=Oct 20, 2019 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day1otlk_20191020_1300.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In advance of the outbreak, the SPC monitored several weather features of interest. In the upper levels of the atmosphere, an upper-level [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] was expected to amplify as it progressed eastward into the U.S. Plains, providing increasing wind shear throughout the region. Simultaneously, a [[low-pressure area]] and associated [[cold front]] were anticipated to shift eastward across an unstable environment, leading to the formation of severe thunderstorms. Forecasters noted that while the overall environment supported the potential for significant ([[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF2+]]) tornadoes, questions about whether storms would be supercellular or instead evolve into a [[quasi-linear convective system]] prevented the addition a significant risk area.<ref name=\"d1\" /> By the late afternoon hours of October&nbsp;20, thunderstorms began to develop across eastern Oklahoma within a rapidly-moistening environment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|author2=Jeremy Grams|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2089|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2089.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> At 7:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT, the first [[tornado watch]] was issued across the [[Ark-La-Tex]] region;<ref>{{cite web|title=Tornado Watch 676|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2019/ww0676.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> several more watches were introduced over subsequent hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Severe Weather Event Review for Sunday October 20 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/archive/event.php?date=20191020|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> A pair of long-tracked supercells developed across [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] and [[Johnson County, Texas|Johnson]] counties, intersecting a very unstable regime and producing significant tornadoes as a result.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2090|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2090.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A squall line formed along the cold front farther west, producing a wide swath of damaging winds and additional tornadoes as it tracked across the South-Central United States.<ref name=\"dallas\">{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Fort Worth, Texas|title=Texas Event Report: EF3 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=856409|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2019|accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Storm Reports for 10/20/19|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/191020_rpts.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 36\n|FU = 0\n|F0 = 13\n|F1 = 20\n|F2 = 2\n|F3 = 1\n|F4 = 0\n|F5 = 0\n|Enhanced=yes\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Confirmed tornadoes during the tornado outbreak of October 20\u201322, 2019{{efn|All dates are based on the local [[time zone]] where the tornado touched down; however, all times are in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] for consistency.|group=note|name=Date/Time}}\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|[[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF#]]\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:7%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:5%; text-align:center;\"|State\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Start Coord.\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"7%\" align=\"center\"|Date\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Path length\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Max width\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:48%; text-align:center;\"|Summary\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|Refs\n|-\n|bgcolor={{storm colour|storm}} | EF0\n|SW of [[Beckville, Texas|Beckville]]\n|[[Panola County, Texas|Panola]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|{{Coord|32.1470|-94.5443|name=Beckville (Oct. 20, EF0)}}\n|{{Sort|001|October&nbsp;20}}\n|00:36\u201300:38\n|{{convert|0.8|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|Several trees were snapped or uprooted.

This was the only EF3 damage found along the path.]]\nAt 8:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT on October 20, a tornado began in [[Dallas County, Texas]], near the interaction of State Highway 348 and Luna Road, snapping large tree limbs. The tornado moved east-northeast across [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] reaching high-end EF2 strength. A strip mall was severely damaged, sustaining roof loss and collapse of multiple exterior walls. Several other retail businesses were also damaged in this area. Along Walnut Hill Lane, a multi-story apartment complex and a commercial building had their roofs ripped off, and also sustained loss of some exterior walls. Numerous homes, along with churches and gas station also sustained heavy damage in this area. Maintaining EF2 strength, the tornado moved across Marsh Lane and through areas east, heavily damaging [[List of Dallas ISD schools|Cary Middle School]] and [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Dallas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]]. The tornado produced a mixture of EF1 and EF2 damage as it moved through residential neighborhoods to the northeast of this area, downing numerous trees, and causing moderate to significant damage to many houses. Dozens of homes along this portion of the path had their roofs torn off, several of which sustained some failure of exterior walls. The most intense pocket of damage occurred along Northhaven Road, where one well-built brick home had its roof torn off, and sustained collapse of most exterior walls. Given the degree of damage, damage surveyors assigned low-end EF3 damage to that home, the only EF3 damage point assigned along the path of the tornado. The tornado then moved into southern [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], where several businesses, including a car dealership, a Home Depot, and office low-rise buildings, suffered EF2 damage. It crossed the [[Texas Instruments]] campus, now on a more northeasterly course, causing mainly EF1 damage. [[Walnut Hill Elementary School (Dallas)|Walnut Hill Elementary School]] was also moderately damaged. At an apartment complex near Walnut Street and Greenville Avenue, dozens of units had sections of roof missing. The nearby Cutters Point apartment complex was also affected, with significant roof loss consistent with EF2 damage. A low-rise office building had numerous windows blown out. Many north of [[Richland College]] also suffered EF2 damage before the tornado began to weaken. Widespread tree and roof damage consistent with an EF1 tornado was observed across the Richland Park, Lakes of Buckingham, Richland Meadows, and College Park subdivisions. A few homes had their roofs blown off at high-end EF1 intensity. The weakening tornado then curved sharply to the north, continuing into the Huffhines Park area. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of minor damage to homes, along with numerous trees and tree limbs downed. Weakening further to EF0 strength, the tornado decreased in width and finally dissipated while crossing Jupiter Road. In total, the tornado was on the ground for {{convert|15.76|mi|km|abbr=on}}, reached a maximum width of {{convert|1300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and remained on the ground for 32&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, the tornado caused about $1.55&nbsp;billion in damage, making it the costliest tornado event in Texas history.<ref name=\"dallas\" />\n\nAround 8:00 a.m. the next morning, approximately 242,000 people were without power.
