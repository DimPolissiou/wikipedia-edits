He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too. With his third wife, Rajathi Ammal, Karunanidhi had a daughter, [[Kanimozhi]], who is seen as his literary heir.<ref name=\"Family\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/aug/07/life-and-family-of-dmk-supremo-kalaignar-m-karunanidhi-1854601.html|title=Life and family of DMK supremo 'Kalaignar' M Karunanidhi|work=[[The New Indian Express]] |date = 7 August 2018}}</ref><ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Screenwriting==\n[[File:Kalaimamani Award.jpg|left|thumb|Karunanidhi awarding Kalaimamani]]\n{{See also|Parasakthi (1952 film)|Tamil cinema and Dravidian politics}}\nKarunanidhi began his career as a screenwriter in the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?Storyid=817&StoryStyle=FullStory |title=The Last Lear \u2013 The Long Profile of Karunanidhi in The Caravan |publisher=[[The Caravan (magazine)|The Caravan India]] |accessdate=22 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326130359/http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?Storyid=817&StoryStyle=FullStory |archivedate=26 March 2012  }}</ref> His first movie as screenwriter was [[Rajakumari (1947 film)|Rajakumari]] produced by Coimbatore-based [[Jupiter Pictures]] directed by [[A.

The movie was opposed by orthodox Hindus since it contained elements that criticised Hinduism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/12/stories/2006061206151100.htm|title=Films and the politics of convenience |newspaper=The Hindu|last=A.|first= Srivathsan|location=Chennai, India|date=12 June 2006|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTwo other movies written by Karunanidhi that contained such messages were [[Panam (film)|Panam]] (1952) directed by famous comedian and political activist [[N. S. Krishnan]] and Thangarathnam (1960) produced and acted by [[S. S. Rajendran]] another popular actor and DMK activist.<ref name=rethink/> These movies contained themes such as widow remarriage, abolition of [[untouchability]], [[self-respect marriages]], abolition of [[zamindari]] and abolition of religious hypocrisy.<ref name=Hardgrave/> Another memorable hit movie was [[Manohara (film)|Manohara (1954)]] starring Sivaji Ganesan, S. S. Rajendran and P. Kannamba known for its crisp dialogues.\n\n===Writing and narration style===\nThrough his wit and oratorical skills he rapidly rose as a popular politician. As his movies and plays with strong social messages became popular, they suffered from increased censorship; two of his plays in the 1950s were banned.<ref name=Hardgrave/> He was famous for writing historical and social (reformist) stories which propagated the socialist and [[rationalism|rationalist]] ideals of the [[Dravidian movement]] to which he belonged. Alongside [[C. N. Annadurai]] he began using [[Tamil cinema]] to propagate his political ideals through his movies.\n\n===Filmography===\nAt the age of 20, Karunanidhi went to work for Jupiter Pictures as a scriptwriter. His first film, ''[[Rajakumaari]]'', gained him much popularity. It was here that his skills as a scriptwriter were honed, which extended to several films. He was active in screenwriting even during his later political career till 2011 when he last wrote for historic movie [[Ponnar Shankar (film)|Ponnar Shankar]].\n;Films\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*''[[Ponnar Shankar (film)|Ponnar Shankar]]'' (2011)\n*''[[Ilaignan]]'' (2011)\n*''[[Pen Singam]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Uliyin Osai]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Pasa Kiligal]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Kannamma (film)|Kannamma]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Mannin Maindhan]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Puthiya Parasakthi]]'' (1996)\n*''[[Madurai Meenakshi (film)|Madurai Meenakshi]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Kavalukku Kettikaran]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Paasa Mazhai]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Nyaya Tharasu]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Thendral Sudum]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Poruthadhu Pothum]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Ithu Engal Neethi]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Paasa Paravaigal (1988 film)|Paasa Paravaigal]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Paadatha Thenikkal]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Makkal Aanaiyittal]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Ore Raththam]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Veeran Veluthambi]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Neethikku Thandanai]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Sattam Oru Vilayaattu]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Puyal Paadum Paattu]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Palaivana Rojakkal]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Meendum Parasakthi]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Kaaval Kaithigal]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Thooku Medai]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Maadi Veettu Ezhai]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Kaalam Pathil Sollum]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Aadu Paambe]]'' (1979)\n*''[[Nenjukku Needhi]]'' (1979)\n*''[[Vandikaran Magan]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Pillaiyo Pillai (film)|Pillaiyo Pillai]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Thanga Thambi]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Valiba Virundhu]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Avan Pithana?]]'' (1966)\n*''[[Marakka Mudiyumaa]]'' (1966)\n*''[[Mani Magudam]]'' (1966)\n*''[[Poomalai]]'' (1965)\n*''[[Poompuhar (film)|Poompuhar]]'' (1964)\n*''[[Kaanchi Thalaivan]]'' (1963)\n*''[[Iruvar Ullam]]'' (1963)\n*''[[Thayilla Pillai (1961 film)|Thayilla Pillai]]'' (1961)\n*''[[Arasilangkumari]]'' (1961)\n*''[[Kuravanji]]'' (1960)\n*''[[Ellorum Innaattu Mannar]]'' (1960)\n*''[[Pudhumai Pithan (1957 film)|Pudhumai Pithan]]'' (1957)\n*''[[Pudhaiyal]]'' (1957)\n*''[[Raja Rani (1956 film)|Raja Rani]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Rangoon Radha]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Malaikkallan]]'' (1954)\n*''[[Manohara (film)|Manohara]]'' (1954)\n*''[[Ammaiyappan (film)|Ammaiyappan]]'' (1954)\n*''[[Thirumbi Paar (1953 film)|Thirumbi Paar]]'' (1953)\n*''[[Naam (1953 film)|Naam]]'' (1953)\n*''[[Panam (1952 film)|Panam]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Manamagal]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Devaki (1951 film)|Devaki]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Manthiri Kumari]]'' (1950)\n*''[[Marudhanaattu Ilavarasi]]'' (1950)\n*''[[Abhimanyu (1948 film)|Abimanyu]]'' (1948)\n*''[[Rajakumaari]]'' (1947)\n{{div col end|4}}\nSivajiGanesan/Karunanidhi Movie List\n* ''[[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[Panam (1952 film)|Panam]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[Thirumbi Paar (1953 film)|Thirumbi Paar]]'' (1953)\n* ''[[Manohara (film)|Manohara]]'' (1954)\n* ''[[Raja Rani (1956 film)|Raja rani]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Rangoon Radha]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Pudhaiyal]]'' (1957)\n* ''[[Kuravanji]]'' (1960)\n* ''[[Iruvar Ullam]]'' (1963)\n* ''[[Maadi Veettu Ezhai]]'' (1981)\n\n;Television\n*''Romapuri Pandian'' (Kalaignar TV)\n*''Ramanujar'' (Kalaignar TV)\n\n==Literature==\n[[File:Sivaji Kalingar Sakthi .jpg|thumb|right|Karunanidhi (middle) with actor Sivaji Ganesan (left)]]\nKarunanidhi is known for his contributions to [[Tamil literature]]. His contributions cover a wide range: poems, letters, screenplays, novels, biographies, historical novels, stage-plays, dialogues and movie songs. He has written ''Kuraloviam'' for [[Thirukural]], Tholkaappiya Poonga, Poombukar, as well as many poems, essays and books. Apart from literature, Karunanidhi has also contributed to the [[Tamil language]] through art and architecture. Like the Kuraloviyam, in which Kalaignar wrote about Thirukkural, through the construction of [[Valluvar Kottam]] he gave an architectural presence to [[Thiruvalluvar]], in Chennai. At [[Kanyakumari]], Karunanidhi constructed a 133-foot-high statue of Thiruvalluvar in honour of the scholar.\n\n===Books===\nThe books written by Karunanidhi include ''Sanga Thamizh'', ''Thirukkural Urai'', ''[[Ponnar Sankar]]'', ''Romapuri Pandian'', ''[[Thenpandi Singam]]'', ''Vellikizhamai'', ''Nenjukku Needhi'', ''Iniyavai Irubathu'' and ''Kuraloviam''.  His books of prose and poetry number more than 100.\n\n===Stage plays===\nKarunanidhi's stage plays include: ''Manimagudam'', ''Ore Ratham'', ''Palaniappan'', ''Thooku Medai'', ''Kagithapoo'', ''Naane Arivali'', ''Vellikizhamai'', ''Udhayasooriyan'' and ''[[Silappathikaram]]''.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Entry into politics===\n[[File:2016 Toyota Alphard 2.5 G van (AGH30R; 12-22-2018), South Tangerang.jpg|thumb|right|Karunanidhi's car Toyota Alphard]]\nKarunanidhi entered politics at the age of 14, inspired by a speech by Alagirisamy of the [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], and participated in [[Anti-Hindi agitations]]. He founded an organisation for the local youth of his locality. He circulated a handwritten newspaper called ''Manavar Nesan'' to its members. Later he founded a student organisation called Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, which was the first student wing of the Dravidan Movement. Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains. Two people died in the protest and Karunanidhi was arrested.<ref name=\"ramaswamy2210\">[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 1997]], p. 226</ref>\n\n===Rise to power===\nAt the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the [[Kulithalai]] seat in the 1957 election. He became the DMK treasurer in 1961 and deputy leader of opposition in the state assembly in the year 1962 and when the DMK came to power in 1967, he became the Minister for Public Works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-45093900|title=M Karunanidhi: The radical wordsmith who shook up Indian politics|last=|first=|date=7 August 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=8 August 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n====Chief Minister====\nWhen Annadurai died in 1969, Karunanidhi became the [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu]] and the first leader of DMK, since the leader post was customarily left vacant for [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] during Annadurai time as Annadurai was party general secretary only. He has held various positions in the party and government during his long career in Tamil Nadu political arena.\n\n====70's and Emergency====\nDuring the [[Emergency]], the DMK was the only ruling party across India that opposed the Emergency,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} for which his government was summarily dismissed by [[Indira Gandhi]]'s government and many of his party leaders were arrested and jailed till the Emergency was lifted. Later, the D.M.K teamed up with the [[Janata Party]] post-Emergency, but suffered defeat at the assembly elections under accusations of corruption .\n\nHis one time friend [[M. G. Ramachandran]], who floated his [[AIADMK]] party after being sacked by Karunanidhi from DMK a few years earlier, would come to power in Tamil Nadu. The DMK then suffered multiple electoral defeats against his primary opponent M.G.Ramachandran's AIADMK, until the latter's death in 1987.\n[[File:The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalaignar M.

Following a five-year rule, his party again lost at the elections to [[J.

Jayalalithaa's AIADMK.\n\nHe {{As of|2006|alt=currently}} represented the constituency of Tiruvarur in the Tamil Nadu state Legislative Assembly.  He has been elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly 13 times (from 1957 to 2016 elections) and once to the now abolished Tamil Nadu Legislative Council.\n\n===World Tamil Conference===\nHe delivered the special address on the inaugural day of 3rd World Tamil Conference held in Paris in 1970, and also on the inaugural day of 6th World Tamil Conference held in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) in 1987.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too.

Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains.

Auks live on the open sea, only deliberately coming ashore to nest. \n\n*[[Thick-billed murre]], ''Uria lomvia'' (A)\n\n==Gulls, terns, and skimmers==\n'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Laridae]]\n\nGulls are typically medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and [[webbed feet]]. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible.
