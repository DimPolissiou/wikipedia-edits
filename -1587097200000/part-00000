Hannity is the host of ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'', a [[radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] talk radio show. He also hosts a commentary program, ''[[Hannity]]'', on [[Fox News]].\n\nSean worked as a general contractor, and volunteer talk show host at [[UC Santa Barbara]] in 1989. He later joined [[WVNN (AM)|WVNN]] in [[Athens, Alabama]], and shortly afterward, [[WGST]] in [[Atlanta]]. In 1996, he was hired by [[Fox News|Fox]] and was accompanied by [[Alan Colmes]] when he received his show ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]''. After leaving WGST, he worked at [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in New York until 2013. Since 2014, he has worked at [[WOR (AM)|WOR]]. After Colmes announced his departure in January 2008, he merged his ''Hannity & Colmes'' show into ''[[Hannity]]''.\n\nHannity has received several awards and honors, including an honorary degree from [[Liberty University]]. He has written three books: ''[[Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism]]''; ''[[Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism]]''; and ''[[Conservative Victory: Defeating Obama's Radical Agenda]]''.\n\nHannity has promoted [[conspiracy theories]], such as [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|casting doubt on Barack Obama's birthplace]] and the [[murder of Seth Rich]], and falsehoods, including untrue accounts about [[Hillary Clinton]]'s health. He was an early supporter of [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]. Since Trump's election, Hannity has often acted as a conduit for Trump's messaging, criticizing the media and attacking the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019)|special counsel inquiry]]. He reportedly speaks to the president on the phone most weeknights.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-sean-hannity-talk-before-bed-2018-5|title=Trump reportedly talks to Sean Hannity most nights before bed|last=Cranley|first=Ellen|website=Business Insider}}</ref> He has spoken at the president's lectern during a Trump rally and White House advisors have characterized him as the \"shadow\" chief-of-staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hannitys-rising-role-in-trumps-world-he-basically-has-a-desk-in-the-place/2018/04/17/e2483018-4260-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html|title=Hannity's rising role in Trump's world: 'He basically has a desk in the place'|website=Washington Post|accessdate=August 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/06/19/sean_hannity_im_not_a_republican/|title=Sean Hannity: \"I'm not a Republican\"|date=2013-06-19|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> According to ''[[Forbes]]'', by 2018 Hannity had become one of the most-watched hosts in cable news and most-listened-to hosts in talk radio due to his closeness and access to President Donald Trump.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-sean-hannity-talk-before-bed-2018-5|title=Trump reportedly talks to Sean Hannity most nights before bed|last=Cranley|first=Ellen|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHannity was born in New York City, New York, the son of Lillian (Flynn) and Hugh Hannity.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njdbBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT33|title=Let Freedom Ring|work=google.ca|isbn=9780060514556|last1=Hannity|first1=Sean|date=2002-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/nov/06/sean-hannity/hannity-vows-not-appear-onstage-trump-rally-then-h/|title=PolitiFact - Sean Hannity vows not to appear onstage at Trump rally, then he does|last=Washington|first=District of Columbia 1100 Connecticut Ave NW Suite 1300B|last2=Dc 20036|website=@politifact|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> Lillian worked as a stenographer and a corrections officer at a county jail, while Hugh was a family-court officer.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/magazine/how-far-will-sean-hannity-go.html|title=How Far Will Sean Hannity Go?|last=Shaer|first=Matthew|date=November 28, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 29, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129003856/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/magazine/how-far-will-sean-hannity-go.html|url-status=live|archive-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> He is the youngest of four siblings.<ref name=\":24\" /> All his grandparents immigrated to the United States from [[Ireland]].

As of July 2019 it has one of the highest [[Earth Similarity Index]] scores, with a score of 0.95. Together with Teegarden c, GJ 1061 c, d, GJ 273 b and Tau ceti e, it is the fourth-closest potentially habitable exoplanet as of April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/182419/descobreixen/dos/planetes/similars/terra|title=Descobreixen dos planetes similars a la Terra {{!}} Naci\u00f3Digital|last=Naci\u00f3Digital|website=www.naciodigital.cat|language=ca|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Discovery ==\nTeegarden b was discovered in June 2019. The alignment and dimness of Teegarden didn't allow for the transit method to be of much use, so astronomers instead used the CARMENES next-generation telescope. Located at Spain's Calar Alto Observatory, the instrument allowed the researchers to look for small changes in the star's velocity. After three years of close observation, watching for any wobbles produced by potential orbiting objects, more than 200 measurements indicate the existence of two new planets, known as Teegarden b and [[Teegarden c]].<ref name=\"sciencealert\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/two-earth-like-planets-found-orbiting-a-star-just-12-light-years-away |title=We Just Found 2 of The Most Earth-Like Exoplanets Yet, Only 12.5 Light Years Away |last=Cassella |first=Carly |date=June 19, 2019 |website=Science Alert }}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nTeegarden b is the innermost known planet orbiting Teegarden's Star, with an orbital period of just 4.91 days. The minimum mass of the planet is about 1 Earth mass, and because of this is likely to be rocky. Teegarden b may even have an ocean of water on its surface.<ref name=\"sciencealert\" />\n\n== Habitability ==\n{{Puffery|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Artist&#039;s impression of the planet Ross 128 b.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ross 128]], an example of quiet red dwarf that can support habitable planet, like [[Teegarden's Star]].]]\n[[File:Kepler-438 b superflare.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kepler-438]], an example for active red dwarf with powerful flares that can strip the atmosphere of planet, making it uninhabitable.]]\nTeegarden b orbits within the optimistic habitable zone of its host star. It has a 60 percent chance of having a habitable surface temperature, between 0\u00b0 and 50\u00b0C, though probably closer to 28\u00b0C.<ref name=\"sciencealert\" /> \n\nAnother factor for Teegarden b's potential habitability is its host star. Most red dwarfs emit powerful flares, which can strip the atmospheres off their planets and cause them to be uninhabitable. A good example is [[Kepler-438b]], which has an ESI score of 0.88, but because of its active star it is likely uninhabitable, and another example is [[Proxima Centauri]], the closest star to us. However, Teegarden's Star is relatively inactive and quiet, increasing the chance that Teegarden b may be habitable. Other quiet red dwarfs with potentially habitable exoplanets are [[Ross 128]] and [[Luyten's Star]].\n\n== Host star ==\nTeegarden\u2019s star is a low-mass red dwarf, with a mass of around 9 percent the mass of the Sun's, and with a temperature of around 2,900 Kelvin (2,623\u00b0C or 4,760 F). The very low temperature and luminosity of Teegarden's Star explains why it was not discovered earlier, since it has an apparent magnitude of only 15.1 (and an absolute magnitude of 17.22). Like most red and brown dwarfs it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It is also older than the [[Sun]], with age of 8 billion years.\n\nIt was discovered in 2003. Astronomers had long thought it was likely that many undiscovered dwarf stars existed within 20 light-years of Earth, because stellar-population surveys show the count of known nearby dwarf stars to be lower than otherwise expected, and these stars are dim and easily overlooked. Teegarden's team thought that these dim stars might be found by data mining some of the huge optical sky survey data sets taken by various programs for other purposes in previous years. So they reexamined the NEAT asteroid tracking data set and found this star. The star was then located on photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey taken in 1951. This discovery is significant as the team did not have direct access to any telescopes and did not include professional astronomers at the time of the discovery.\n\nThe parallax was initially measured as 0.43 \u00b1 0.13 arcseconds. This would have placed its distance at only 7.50 light-years, making [[Teegarden's Star]] only the third star system in order of distance from the Sun, ranking between [[Barnard's Star]] and [[Wolf 359]]. However, even at that time the anomalously low luminosity (the absolute magnitude would have been 18.5) and high uncertainty in the parallax suggested that it was in fact somewhat farther away, still one of the [[Sun]]'s nearest neighbors but not nearly as high in the ranking in order of distance. A more accurate parallax measurement of 0.2593 arcseconds was made by George Gatewood in 2009, yielding the now accepted distance of 12.578 light-years.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/07/aa35460-19/aa35460-19.html The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs: Two temperate Earth-mass planet candidates around Teegarden\u2019s Star]\n\n[[Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2019]]\n[[Category:Aries (constellation)]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2020}}\n{{short description|Exoplanet}}\n{{Infobox planet\n| name                     = Teegarden b\n| website                  = Teegardenb.com\n| https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/art_red_dwarf_planets.jpg                = \n<!-- IMAGE               -->\n| image = [[File:Teegarden&#039;s star proper motion.gif|300 px]]\n| caption = Teegarden's Star proper motion\n<!-- DISCOVERY           -->\n| discoverer               = \n| discovery_site           = [[Calar Alto Observatory]]\n| discovered               = June 2019\n| discovery_method         = [[Doppler spectroscopy]]\n<!-- DESIGNATIONS        -->\n<!-- ORBITAL             --> \n| apsis                    = \n| semimajor                = {{val|0.0252|0.0008|0.0009}} [[astronomical unit|AU]]\n| eccentricity             = {{val|0|+0.16|0}}\n| period                   = {{val|4.91|0.0014}} days\n<!-- PHYS CHARS          --> \n| mean_radius  \n| single_temperature       = {{convert|301|K|C}}\n<!-- ATMOSPHERE          --> \n<!-- NOTES               --> \n}}\n'''Teegarden b''' is an [[exoplanet]] found orbiting within the habitable zone of [[Teegarden's star]], an M-type [[red dwarf]] star around 12 light years away from the [[Solar system|Solar System]].
