For the race, ten [[Hurdling|hurdles]] of a height of {{convert|83.8|cm|in}} are placed along a straight course of {{convert|100|m|yds|2}}. The first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13 metres from the starting line. The next 9 hurdles are set at a distance of 8.5 metres from each other, and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 10.5 metres long. The hurdles are set up so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner, but weighted so this is disadvantageous. Fallen hurdles do not count against runners provided that they do not run into them on purpose. Like the [[100 metres]] sprint, the 100 m hurdles begins with athletes in [[starting blocks]].\n\nThe fastest 100 m hurdlers run the distance in a time of around 12.5 seconds. The [[world record]] set by [[Kendra Harrison]] stands at 12.20 seconds.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0531-035, Cornelia Oschkenat, Heike Thoelo, Kerstin Knabe.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Cornelia Oschkenat]] (nearest camera), [[Heike Theele]] and [[Kerstin Knabe]] (1986)]]\n\nThe [[Olympic Games]] had included the 80 m hurdles in the program from 1932 to 1968. Starting with the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] the women's race was lengthened to 100 m hurdles.\n\nThe hurdles sprint race has been run by women since the beginning of women's athletics, just after the end of World War I. The distances and hurdle heights varied widely in the beginning. While the men had zeroed in on the [[110 m hurdles]], the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive F\u00e9minine Internationale|International Women's Sport Federation]] had registered records for eight different disciplines by 1926 (60 [[yards]]/75&nbsp;cm height, 60 yards/61&nbsp;cm, 65 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 83 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 100 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 100 yards/61&nbsp;cm, 120 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 110 metres/75&nbsp;cm). At the first [[Women's World Games]] in 1922 a 100 m hurdles race was run.\n\nFrom 1926 until 1968 on only the 80 m distance was run. For the 80 m race women had to clear eight hurdles placed at a distance of 8 metres from each other and a height of 76.2&nbsp;cm.\n\nJust like with the men's races, until 1935 no more than three hurdles could be knocked over (or the runner was disqualified) and records were only officially registered if the runner had cleared all her hurdles clean. In 1935, this rule was abandoned, and L-shaped hurdles were introduced that fell over forward easily and greatly reduced the risk of injury to the runner.  Hurdles are weighted, so when properly set for the height (for women, closer to the fulcrum of the \"L\"), they serve as a consistent disadvantage to making contact with the barrier.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float: right; text-align:right\"\n|+ Comparison of 80&nbsp;m and 100&nbsp;m hurdles\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Distance\n! rowspan=2 | Number<br>of hurdles\n! rowspan=2 | Height\n! colspan=3 | Distance made up of\n|-\n!

Starting with 1949, the 80 m hurdles was one of the disciplines included in the [[women's pentathlon]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, some experimental races were run over a distance of 100 metres using hurdles with a height of 76.2&nbsp;cm. During the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], a decision was made to introduce the 100 m hurdles using hurdles with a height of 84&nbsp;cm. The first international event in the 100 m hurdles occurred at the European Athletics Championships, which were won by [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]]. The modern 100&nbsp;m race has an extra 2 hurdles compared to the 80&nbsp;m race, which are higher and spaced slightly further apart. The home stretch is shorter by 1.5&nbsp;m.\n\n==Masters athletics==\nA version of the 100 metres hurdles is also used for 50- to 59-year-old men in [[Masters athletics]]. They run the same spacing as women, which coordinates with existing markings on most tracks, but run over 36-inch (0.915 m) hurdles.  In the 60-69 age range, the spacings are changed. Women over age 40 and men over age 70 run 80 metre versions with different heights and spacings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trackinfo.org/hurdles101.html|title=Hurdles 101|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/files/laws_rules/Appendix-A-K.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122064124/http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/files/laws_rules/Appendix-A-K.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Milestones==\n100 m hurdles:\n*First official time registered with hurdles of reduced height (76.2&nbsp;cm): [[Pam Kilborn|Pamela Kilborn]], [[Australia|AUS]], November 26, 1961\n*First official time with hurdles of standard height (83.8&nbsp;cm): 15.1 seconds, [[Connie Pettersson]], USA, May 28, 1966\n*First official world record: 13.3 seconds, [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]], June 20, 1969\n*First runner under 13 seconds: 12.9 seconds, [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]], September 5, 1969\n*First runner under 12.5 seconds:\n**12.3 seconds, [[Annelie Ehrhardt]] [[East Germany|GDR]], July 20, 1973 (last hand timed world record; electronically timed at 12.68 seconds)\n**12.48 seconds, [[Gra\u017cyna Rabsztyn]], [[Poland|POL]], June 10, 1978\n*First runner under 12.3 seconds: 12.29 seconds, [[Yordanka Donkova]] [[Bulgaria|BUL]], August 17, 1986\n*First country to win gold, silver, and bronze in the women's 100 m hurdles in one Olympics: America ([[Brianna Rollins]], [[Nia Ali]] and [[Kristi Castlin]]), 2016; this was also the first time American women achieved such a sweep in any Olympic event<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37120618 |title=Rio Olympics 2016: US women sweep medals in 100m hurdles -

- Kazan (RUS)]]\nThe '''100 metres hurdles''', or '''100-meter hurdles''', is a [[track and field]] event run mainly by women (the male counterpart is the [[110 metres hurdles]]). For the race, ten [[Hurdling|hurdles]] of a height of {{convert|83.8|cm|in}} are placed along a straight course of {{convert|100|m|yds|2}}. The first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13 metres from the starting line. The next 9 hurdles are set at a distance of 8.5 metres from each other, and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 10.5 metres long. The hurdles are set up so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner, but weighted so this is disadvantageous. Fallen hurdles do not count against runners provided that they do not run into them on purpose. Like the [[100 metres]] sprint, the 100 m hurdles begins with athletes in [[starting blocks]].\n\nThe fastest 100 m hurdlers run the distance in a time of around 12.5 seconds. The [[world record]] set by [[Kendra Harrison]] stands at 12.20 seconds.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0531-035, Cornelia Oschkenat, Heike Thoelo, Kerstin Knabe.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Cornelia Oschkenat]] (nearest camera), [[Heike Theele]] and [[Kerstin Knabe]] (1986)]]\n\nThe [[Olympic Games]] had included the 80 m hurdles in the program from 1932 to 1968. Starting with the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] the women's race was lengthened to 100 m hurdles.\n\nThe hurdles sprint race has been run by women since the beginning of women's athletics, just after the end of World War I. The distances and hurdle heights varied widely in the beginning. While the men had zeroed in on the [[110 m hurdles]], the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive F\u00e9minine Internationale|International Women's Sport Federation]] had registered records for eight different disciplines by 1926 (60 [[yards]]/75&nbsp;cm height, 60 yards/61&nbsp;cm, 65 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 83 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 100 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 100 yards/61&nbsp;cm, 120 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 110 metres/75&nbsp;cm). At the first [[Women's World Games]] in 1922 a 100 m hurdles race was run.\n\nFrom 1926 until 1968 on only the 80 m distance was run. For the 80 m race women had to clear eight hurdles placed at a distance of 8 metres from each other and a height of 76.2&nbsp;cm.\n\nJust like with the men's races, until 1935 no more than three hurdles could be knocked over (or the runner was disqualified) and records were only officially registered if the runner had cleared all her hurdles clean. In 1935, this rule was abandoned, and L-shaped hurdles were introduced that fell over forward easily and greatly reduced the risk of injury to the runner.  Hurdles are weighted, so when properly set for the height (for women, closer to the fulcrum of the \"L\"), they serve as a consistent disadvantage to making contact with the barrier.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float: right; text-align:right\"\n|+ Comparison of 80&nbsp;m and 100&nbsp;m hurdles\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Distance\n! rowspan=2 | Number<br>of hurdles\n! rowspan=2 | Height\n! colspan=3 | Distance made up of\n|-\n!

Starting with 1949, the 80 m hurdles was one of the disciplines included in the [[women's pentathlon]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, some experimental races were run over a distance of 100 metres using hurdles with a height of 76.2&nbsp;cm. During the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], a decision was made to introduce the 100 m hurdles using hurdles with a height of 84&nbsp;cm. The first international event in the 100 m hurdles occurred at the European Athletics Championships, which were won by [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]]. The modern 100&nbsp;m race has an extra 2 hurdles compared to the 80&nbsp;m race, which are higher and spaced slightly further apart. The home stretch is shorter by 1.5&nbsp;m.\n\n==Masters athletics==\nA version of the 100 metres hurdles is also used for 50- to 59-year-old men in [[Masters athletics]]. They run the same spacing as women, which coordinates with existing markings on most tracks, but run over 36-inch (0.915 m) hurdles.  In the 60-69 age range, the spacings are changed. Women over age 40 and men over age 70 run 80 metre versions with different heights and spacings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trackinfo.org/hurdles101.html|title=Hurdles 101|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/files/laws_rules/Appendix-A-K.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122064124/http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/files/laws_rules/Appendix-A-K.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Milestones==\n100 m hurdles:\n*First official time registered with hurdles of reduced height (76.2&nbsp;cm): [[Pam Kilborn|Pamela Kilborn]], [[Australia|AUS]], November 26, 1961\n*First official time with hurdles of standard height (83.8&nbsp;cm): 15.1 seconds, [[Connie Pettersson]], USA, May 28, 1966\n*First official world record: 13.3 seconds, [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]], June 20, 1969\n*First runner under 13 seconds: 12.9 seconds, [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]], September 5, 1969\n*First runner under 12.5 seconds:\n**12.3 seconds, [[Annelie Ehrhardt]] [[East Germany|GDR]], July 20, 1973 (last hand timed world record; electronically timed at 12.68 seconds)\n**12.48 seconds, [[Gra\u017cyna Rabsztyn]], [[Poland|POL]], June 10, 1978\n*First runner under 12.3 seconds: 12.29 seconds, [[Yordanka Donkova]] [[Bulgaria|BUL]], August 17, 1986\n*First country to win gold, silver, and bronze in the women's 100 m hurdles in one Olympics: America ([[Brianna Rollins]], [[Nia Ali]] and [[Kristi Castlin]]), 2016; this was also the first time American women achieved such a sweep in any Olympic event<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37120618 |title=Rio Olympics 2016: US women sweep medals in 100m hurdles -

Organizations may use telecommuting to reduce costs (telecommuting employees do not require an office or [[cubicle]], a space which needs to be rented or purchased, and incurs additional costs such as lighting, climate control, etc.). Some organizations adopt telecommuting to improve workers' quality of life, as teleworking typically reduces commuting time and time stuck in [[traffic jam]]s. Along with this, teleworking may make it easier for workers to balance their work responsibilities with their personal life and family roles (e.g., caring for children or elderly parents). Some organizations adopt teleworking for environmental reasons, as telework can reduce [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[air pollution]], with less cars on the roads.\n\n==Terminology==\nAlthough the concepts of \"telecommuting\" and \"telework\" are closely related, there is a difference between the two. All types of technology-assisted work conducted outside a centrally located work space (including work undertaken in the home, outside calls, etc.) are regarded as telework.

The ongoing and exponential decreases in cost along with the increases in performance and usability of personal computers, forged the way for moving the office to the home. By the early 1980s, branch offices and home workers were able to connect to organizational mainframes using personal computers and terminal emulation. Telework is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, [[videotelephony|videoconferencing]], virtual call centre, Voice over IP (VOIP), and by the decreasing cost of good quality laptop computers. It can be efficient and useful for companies since it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal phone networks.\n\nThe adoption of local area networks promoted the sharing of resources, and client\u2013server model client\u2013server computing allowed for even greater decentralization. Today, telecommuters can carry laptops which they can use both at the office, at home, and nearly anywhere else. The rise of cloud computing technology and Wi-Fi availability have enabled access to remote servers via a combination of portable hardware and software.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watad|first=Mahmoud M.|author2=Gregory T.

Feedback refers to the degree that an individual receives direct and clear information about his or her performance related to work activities.<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> Feedback is particularly important so that the employees continuously learn about how they are performing.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Electronic communication provides fewer cues for teleworkers and thus, they may have more difficulties interpreting and gaining information, and subsequently, receiving feedback.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> When a worker is not in the office, there is limited information and greater ambiguity, such as in assignments and expectations.<ref name=\"Golden11\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0018726711418387|title=Does it matter where your manager works?

The clarity, speed of response, richness of the communication, frequency, and quality of the feedback are often reduced when managers telework.<ref name=\"Golden11\"/>\n\n===Skill variety, task identity, and task significance===\nThree of the five job attributes: skill variety, task identity, and task significance, influence how much employees think their jobs are meaningful.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Skill variety is the degree that a job requires a variety of activities and skills to complete the task. An increase in skill variety is thought to increase the challenge of the job. Increasing the challenge of the job increases the individual's experienced meaningfulness, how much the individual cares about work, and finds it worthwhile.<ref name =\"Oldham 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Telework may not directly affect skill variety and task meaningfulness for the individual compared to when he or she worked in an office; however, skill variety and meaningfulness of individual tasks can increase when working in a group. If the work done at home is focused on the individual rather than the team, there may be fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills.<ref name=\"Shamir\">{{cite journal|doi=10.5465/amr.1985.4278957|title=Work-At-Home and the Quality of Working Life|year=1985|last1=Shamir|first1=Boas|last2=Salomon|first2=Ilan|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=10|issue=3|pages=455\u2013464}}</ref>\n\nTask identity is the degree that the individual sees work from beginning to end or completes an identifiable or whole piece of work rather than only a small piece. Task significance is the degree that the individual feels his or her work has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people within the organization or outside the organization.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/><ref name=\"Shamir\"/> Telework may not change the job characteristics of skill variety, task identity, and task significance compared to working in an office; however, the presence of these characteristics will influence teleworkers\u2019 work outcomes and attitudes.\n\n===Individual difference===\nIndividuals may differ in their reactions to the job characteristics in telecommuting. According to job characteristics theory, the personal need for accomplishment and development (growth need strength)<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> influences how much an individual will react to the job dimensions of telecommuting. For instance, those individuals high in growth need strength will have a more positive reaction to increased autonomy and a more negative reaction to decreased feedback in telecommuting than those individuals low in growth need strength.\n\n==Other theories==\nTelecommuting is a new work situation with a flexible structure that makes it different from traditional work environments.<ref name=\"Torraco\" >{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/hrdq.1125|title=Work design theory: A review and critique with implications for human resource development|year=2005|last1=Torraco|first1=Richard J.|journal=Human Resource Development Quarterly|volume=16|pages=85\u2013109}}</ref> Various job design theories, in addition to job characteristics theory, can help explain the differences between telecommuting and traditional job settings.\n\n===Motivator-hygiene theory===\n[[Motivator-hygiene theory]]<ref name=\"Herzberg\">Herzberg, F., Mausner, B., & Snyderman, B.B., (1959).

A working-from-home-related experiment conducted using 242 employees of a large Chinese [[travel agency]] by professors at [[Stanford]] and [[Beijing University]] found that employees randomly assigned to work at home for 9 months increased their output by 13.5% versus the office-based control group. This improvement in output arose from working 9% more hours from saved commuting time and from 3.5% improved efficiency from quieter working conditions. The study also found that home-workers reported significantly higher job-satisfaction scores and their quit rates fell by almost 50%. However, home workers' promotion rates dropped by half due to apparent performance declines, indicating a potential career cost of home-working.<ref>Bloom, Nicholas, Liang, James, Roberts, John and Ying, Jenny [http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/WFH.pdf \"Does working from home work? Evidence from a Chinese experiment\"] Stanford Research Paper, February 2013.</ref>\n\nTelework flexibility is a desirable prerequisite for employees. A 2008 Robert Half International Financial Hiring Index, a survey of 1,400 [[CFO]]s by recruitment firm Robert Half International, indicated that 13% consider telework the best recruiting incentive today for accounting professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roberthalffinance.com/portal/site/rhf-us/template.PAGE/menuitem.b55c61eb41144dbf9a64e9c302f3dfa0/?javax.portlet.tpst=7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0&javax.portlet.prp_7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0_releaseId=2108&javax.portlet.prp_7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0_request_type=RenderPressRelease&javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken|title=Survey Finds Salary Is Top Draw for Job Candidates but Benefits Nearly As Popular\n|author=Robert Half International  |date=2008-02-06}}</ref> In earlier surveys, 33% considered telework the best recruiting incentive, and half considered it second best.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Group-touts-telecommuting-s-green-benefits-3286958.php\n|title=SF Chronicle \"Group touts telecommuting's green benefits\"\n|author=Tom Abate  |publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.  |date=April 22, 2008  |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince work hours are less regulated in telework, employee effort and dedication are far more likely to be measured purely in terms of output or results. Fewer, if any, traces of non-productive work activities (research, self-training, dealing with technical problems or equipment failures) and time lost on unsuccessful attempts (early drafts, fruitless endeavors, abortive innovations) are visible to employers. Piece rate, commissions, or other performance-based compensation also become more likely for telecommuters. Furthermore, major chunks of per-employee expenses are absorbed by the telecommuter himself - from simple coffee, water, electricity, and telecommunications services, to huge capital expenses like office equipment or software licenses. Thus, hours spent on the job tend to be underestimated and expenses under-reported, creating overly optimistic figures of productivity gains and savings, some or all of those in fact coming out of the telecommuter's time and pocket.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20141210926\n   |title=Richie v.

Telework is a shift in the way business is accomplished which can make a difference overtime. As an example, a recent Australian study revealed that telework enabled by the National Broadband Network is expected to add $8.3 billion to Gross Domestic Product by 2020, creating the equivalent of an additional 25,000 full-time jobs. Around 10,000 of these jobs will be in regional Australia. When it comes to environment, it has been estimated that if 10 per cent of Australian employees were to telework 50 percent of the time, it would save 120 million litres of fuel and 320,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. That rate of telework would also deliver a productivity benefit of between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |title=NBN - Telework (defunct) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309010053/http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |archivedate=2013-03-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Turnover intention===\n[[Turnover intention]], or the desire to leave the organization, is lower for teleworkers.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Those teleworkers who experienced greater professional isolation actually had lower turnover intent.<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> One study found that by increasing feedback and task identity through clear communication of goals, objectives, and expectations, turnover intent decreased in teleworkers and quality of work output increased.<ref name=\"Ilozor\"/>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages meta-analysis===\nA meta-analysis of 46 studies of telecommuting involving 12,833 employees conducted by Ravi Gajendran and David A. Harrison in the ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', published by the American Psychological Association (APA), found that telecommuting has largely positive consequences for employees and employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/11/telecommuting.aspx|title=APA Press Release \"Telecommuting has Mostly Positive Consequences for Employees and Employers, Say Researchers\"\n|author=APA  |publisher=American Psychological Association  |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Gaj\" /> In their meta-analytic study, Gajendran and Harrison found that telecommuting had modest but beneficial effects on employees' job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, stress levels, manager-rated job performance, and (lower) work-family conflict. Telecommuting also reduces turnover intent, or the intention to quit one's job. Increased job satisfaction, decreased turnover intent and role stress related to telecommuting partly because of a decrease in work-family conflict. Additionally, the increase in autonomy from teleworking in turn increases job satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a number of scholars and managers had previously expressed fears that employee careers might suffer and workplace relationships might be damaged because of telecommuting, the meta-analysis found that there are no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships and career outcomes.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Telecommuting actually was found to positively affect employee-supervisor relations and the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intent was in part due to supervisor relationship quality.  Only high-intensity telecommuting (where employees work from home for more than 2.5 days a week) harmed employee relationships with co-workers, even though it did reduce work-family conflict.\n\n==Potential drawbacks and concerns==\nSkill variety has the strongest relationship with internal [[work motivation]].<ref name=\"Fried\"/> Jobs that allow workers to use a variety of skills increase workers\u2019 internal work motivation. If teleworkers are limited in teamwork opportunities and have fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills,<ref name=\"Shamir\"/> they may have lower internal motivation towards their work. Also, perceived social isolation can lead to less motivation.<ref name=\"Maruy\" /> It can be argued that without a work climate or manager nearby, the ability to motivate oneself is even more important when telecommuting than when working in an office. Though working in an office has its distractions, it is often argued that telecommuting involves even greater distractions. According to one study, children are ranked as the number one distractions, followed by spouses, pets, neighbors, and solicitors. The lack of proper tools and facilities also serves as a major distraction,<ref>{{cite web|title=3 Reasons Why Working From Home Can be Unproductive|url=http://www.corporatesuites.com/3-reasons-working-home-can-unproductive/|publisher=Corporate Suites|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> though this can be mitigated by using short-term [[coworking]] rental facilities.\n\nFace-to-face interactions increase interpersonal contact, connectedness, and trust<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> Therefore, 54% of teleworkers thought they lost out on social interaction and 52.5% felt they lost out on professional interaction in a 2012 study.<ref name=\"Maruy\"/> Teleworking can hurt working relationships between the teleworker and their coworkers, especially if their coworkers do not telework. Coworkers who do not telework can feel resentful and jealous because they may consider it unfair if they are not allowed to telework as well.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/><ref name=\"Morganson, V. J. 2010\"/> However, despite fewer interpersonal actions and professional isolation,<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> a meta-analysis of telecommuting did not find support for negative telecommuter-coworker relationships or telecommuter-supervisor relationships.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Employers' largest concerns about telecommuting are fear of loss of control; 75% of managers say they trust their employees, but a third say they would like to be able to see them, \"just to be sure\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://undress4success.com/research/pros-cons/|title=Lister, Kate, Undress For Success--The Naked Truth About Making Money at Home, (John Wiley & Sons 2009, {{Text|ISBN}} 978-0-470-38332-2) quoting Management-Issues.com (July 30, 2007) survey|accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>\n\nEmployees who telework may feel pressure to produce more output in order to be seen as valuable, and reduce the idea that they are doing less work than others. This pressure to produce output, as well as a lack of social support from limited coworker relationships and feelings of isolation, leads to lower job engagement in teleworkers.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> Additionally, higher-quality relationships with teammates decreased job satisfaction of teleworkers, potentially because of frustrations with exchanging interactions via technology.<ref name=\"golden006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Golden | first1 = T.

Reports finding that all 87 agencies participating in the Data Cell had established telework policies and 73 percent of the policies met the Telework Act Requirements. More than 684,000 federal employees were deemed eligible to telework, this represents approximately 32 percent of all federal employees. More than 144,000 federal employees had written teleworking agreements with their agencies. 27 percent of teleworkers worked remotely three or more days per week.<ref name=\"mnn.com\">{{cite web |title=Federal Teleworking Report Released |url=http://www.mnn.com/money/green-workplace/blogs/federal-teleworking-report-released}}</ref> In addition to the findings, the reports examine teleworking at the Department of Defense. According to the report, there are more than 793,000 employees in the DoD and of those employees, 134,477 were deemed eligible for teleworking. Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced teleworking and is attempting to create more remote working opportunities for employees. In closing, the report listed several ways that the government could make more jobs available through telework. Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.<ref name=\"mnn.com\"/>\n\n===Centers===\nTelework centers are offices that are generally set up close to a majority of people who might otherwise drive or take [[public transit]]. They usually feature the full complement of office equipment and a high-speed Internet connection for maximum [[productivity]]. Some feature support staff, including receptionists or administrators. For example, a number of telework centers have been set up around the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]]: 7 in Maryland, 8 in Virginia, 3 in Washington, D.C. and 1 in West Virginia. Telework centers allow people to reduce their commute yet still work in a traditional office setting. Some telework centers are set up by individual companies while others are established by independent organizations for use by many organizations. Telework centers are attractive to people who do not have the space or inclination to work from home. They offer employers the ability to maintain a more formal structure for their workforce.\n\nThese work arrangements are more likely to become more popular with current trends towards greater customization of services and virtual organizing. Distributed work offers great potential for firms to reduce costs, enhance competitive advantage and agility, access a greater variety of scarce talents, and improve employee flexibility, effectiveness and productivity.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.38.12.1687|title=An Emerging Distributed Work Arrangement: An Investigation of Computer-Based Supplemental Work at Home|year=1992|last1=Venkatesh|first1=Alladi|last2=Vitalari|first2=Nicholas P.|journal=Management Science|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1687\u20131706}}</ref><ref>Korte, W.

A remote office center provides professional grade network access, phone system, security system, mail stop and optional services for additional costs.  ROCs are generally located in areas near to where people live throughout population centers, so that workers do not have to commute more than a couple of miles.  The telecommuter works in a real office but accesses the company network across the internet using a VPN just as in traditional telecommuting.\n\nThis type of arrangement does not share fully in the benefits of home-based telecommuting, but can address the needs of employees who are unable or unwilling to work from home.\n\n===Information Security for Teleworkers===\n\"To hackers who make a living stealing information from unsecured computers and network connections, the teleworker could be an open the door to the organization\u2019s most sensitive data. Security and privacy have become increasingly rare commodities these days thanks to the ability of hackers to stay one step ahead of just about every security measure that technicians can create.  Security breaches are a significant enough threat in a standard office environment; however, when an organization has employees working from home or on the go, these risks become even greater.\n\nIt is vital for organizations to convey to teleworkers that data protection and information security are important to an organization, and employees\u2019 actions make a difference in achieving the overall goal of protection of sensitive data. Despite increased awareness and training on security issues, many employees do not take the necessary precautions for deterring security risks.\n\nReal security begins with security policy. The Information Security professional must ensure that the security policy covers telecommuting/teleworking and who may telework, services available to teleworkers, information restrictions, identification/authentication/authorization, equipment and software specifications, integrity and confidentiality, maintenance guidelines, and robust user education.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Improving Information Security for Teleworkers |first=Tim |last=Godlove |url=https://www.ufairfax.edu/news/Improving-Information-Security-for-Teleworkers-20170113-0022 |publisher=University of Fairfax }}</ref>\n\n===Other countries===\nAccording to an article from the ''New York Times'', telecommuting now takes about 2.6 percent of the American workforce not including remote works like drivers. The article also mentions an experiment done by Nicholas Bloom. Nicholas Bloom is an economics professor from Stanford University. During this experiment, 250 workers were picked randomly from Ctrip to work either at home or at an office. Ctrip is a large China travel agency.  The result showed that those who telecommuted worked longer hours than those who worked at an office. The telecommuters were also more productive and happier. Ctrip saved around 2K from telecommuting. Although the quitting rate decreased for telecommuters, the promotion rate also decreased. Many telecommuters asked to be back in the office at the end with reasoning like loneliness and desire for promotion. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, came to the conclusion that most workers prefer telecommuting and office work combined. Telecommuting increases efficiency and workers\u2019 flexibility.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Marilynn K.|title=It's Unclearly Defined, but Telecommuting Is Fast on the Rise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAmerica has an increasing trend of using teleworking  due to its strong economics and multimedia services.

One of the ethical issues behind telecommuting is who should have the chance to telecommute? One may have more chance to work at home because he/she has young children. The other one may argue he/she also has personal problems. It is favored by most workers to combine telecommuting and office work. Many think that telecommuting once or twice a week is a reasonable schedule. Businesses also favor this suggestion because workers are more satisfied and companies save money from it.\n\n===Effects of 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic===\nAnalysts have suggested that the ongoing [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] could be a \"tipping point\" for telecommuting.<ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/coronavirus-tipping-point-finally-telecommuting/</ref> In [[Seattle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], and [[Google]] have mandated employees work from home.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166686/coronavirus-amazon-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter-seattle-staff-remote-work</ref><ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/seattle-morning-traffic-disappears-amazon-microsoft-others-enforce-remote-work-policies/</ref> Others have suggested that an increase in telecommuting as a result of the outbreak could result in an expanded [[right to Internet access]] in the United States.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-03-06/coronavirus-telecommute-work-from-home</ref>\n\n==Related terms and concepts==\n\n===Coworking===\n{{main|Coworking}}\nCoworking is a social gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share a common working area as well as the synergy that can happen from working with people in the same space. Coworking facilities can range from shared space in formal offices to social areas such as a coffee shop. Entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs often cowork in shared office and workshop facilities provided by [[business incubator]]s and [[business accelerator]] organizations. In entrepreneurship, coworking allows creative start-up founders, researchers and knowledge workers to [[business network|meet and share ideas]], collaborate, share new research, and find potential partners.\n\n===Distributed work===\nDistributed work entails the conduct of organizational tasks in places that extend beyond the confines of traditional [[office]]s or workspaces. It can refer to organizational arrangements that permit or require workers to perform work more effectively at any appropriate location&mdash;such as their homes or [[customer|customers']] sites&mdash;through the application of information and communication technology. An example is [[financial planner]]s who meet clients during the client's lunchtime at the client's workplace; even though this is an out-of-the-office, meeting, the [[Internet]] enables the planner to present financial planning tools and presentations on their mobile computers. Another example is a [[publishing]] executives who recommends books and places orders for the latest book offerings to libraries and university professors from the executive's home using e-mail or an online system. If this type of distributed work replaces the worker's commute, it would be considered telecommuting. If not, it would be telework (see [[#Definition|\u00a71. Definition]]).\n\n===Hoteling===\nSome companies, particularly those where employees spend a great deal of time on the road and at remote locations, offer a [[hotdesking]] or [[hoteling]] arrangement where employees can reserve the use of a temporary traditional office, [[cubicle]] or [[meeting room]] at the company headquarters, a [[remote office center]], or other shared office facility.\n\n== {{anchor|Homeworker}}Homeworker ==\n'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].\n\nHomeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes. Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for. Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers,<ref> https://www.salesoutsourcingservice.com/en/3-ways-to-support-remote-sales-team/\n</ref>\n\n and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Media richness theory]]\n* [[Work\u2013family conflict]]\n* [[Canadian Telework Association]] (CTA)\n* [[Comparison of office suites]]: the online versions of office suites mentioned there are useful for telecommuters)\n* [[Comparison of FTP client software]]: for file upload to a server\n* [[Comparison of file hosting services]]: for file upload to a server and sharing\n* [[Comparison of cross-platform instant messaging clients]]: for communication and p2p file sharing\n* [[Comparison of web conferencing software]]: for communication with groups\n* [[Corporate wiki]]\n* [[Coworking]]\n* [[Distance learning]]\n* [[Flextime]]\n* [[Home Work Convention, 1996]]\n* [[Hot desking]]\n* [[Hoteling]]\n* [[Job characteristic theory]]\n* [[Labour market flexibility]]\n* [[Outsourcing]]\n* [[Putting-out system]]\n* [[Small office/home office]]\n* [[Study (room)]]\n* [[Telecentre]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Virtual assistant (occupation)|Virtual assistant]]\n* [[Virtual team]]\n* [[Virtual volunteering]]\n* [[Work at home scheme]]\n* [[Work-life balance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[John O'Duinn|O'Duinn, J.]], (2018) Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart, {{ISBN|978-1732254909}}\n* Thomas L.

Organizations may use telecommuting to reduce costs (telecommuting employees do not require an office or [[cubicle]], a space which needs to be rented or purchased, and incurs additional costs such as lighting, climate control, etc.). Some organizations adopt telecommuting to improve workers' quality of life, as teleworking typically reduces commuting time and time stuck in [[traffic jam]]s. Along with this, teleworking may make it easier for workers to balance their work responsibilities with their personal life and family roles (e.g., caring for children or elderly parents). Some organizations adopt teleworking for environmental reasons, as telework can reduce [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[air pollution]], with less cars on the roads.\n\n==Terminology==\nAlthough the concepts of \"telecommuting\" and \"telework\" are closely related, there is a difference between the two. All types of technology-assisted work conducted outside a centrally located work space (including work undertaken in the home, outside calls, etc.) are regarded as telework. Telecommuters often maintain a traditional office and usually work from an alternative work site from 1 to 3 days a week.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = J.

The ongoing and exponential decreases in cost along with the increases in performance and usability of personal computers, forged the way for moving the office to the home. By the early 1980s, branch offices and home workers were able to connect to organizational mainframes using personal computers and terminal emulation. Telework is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, [[videotelephony|videoconferencing]], virtual call centre, Voice over IP (VOIP), and by the decreasing cost of good quality laptop computers. It can be efficient and useful for companies since it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal phone networks.\n\nThe adoption of local area networks promoted the sharing of resources, and client\u2013server model client\u2013server computing allowed for even greater decentralization. Today, telecommuters can carry laptops which they can use both at the office, at home, and nearly anywhere else. The rise of cloud computing technology and Wi-Fi availability have enabled access to remote servers via a combination of portable hardware and software.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watad|first=Mahmoud M.|author2=Gregory T.

Feedback refers to the degree that an individual receives direct and clear information about his or her performance related to work activities.<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> Feedback is particularly important so that the employees continuously learn about how they are performing.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Electronic communication provides fewer cues for teleworkers and thus, they may have more difficulties interpreting and gaining information, and subsequently, receiving feedback.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> When a worker is not in the office, there is limited information and greater ambiguity, such as in assignments and expectations.<ref name=\"Golden11\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0018726711418387|title=Does it matter where your manager works?

An increase in skill variety is thought to increase the challenge of the job. Increasing the challenge of the job increases the individual's experienced meaningfulness, how much the individual cares about work, and finds it worthwhile.<ref name =\"Oldham 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Telework may not directly affect skill variety and task meaningfulness for the individual compared to when he or she worked in an office; however, skill variety and meaningfulness of individual tasks can increase when working in a group. If the work done at home is focused on the individual rather than the team, there may be fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills.<ref name=\"Shamir\">{{cite journal|doi=10.5465/amr.1985.4278957|title=Work-At-Home and the Quality of Working Life|year=1985|last1=Shamir|first1=Boas|last2=Salomon|first2=Ilan|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=10|issue=3|pages=455\u2013464}}</ref>\n\nTask identity is the degree that the individual sees work from beginning to end or completes an identifiable or whole piece of work rather than only a small piece. Task significance is the degree that the individual feels his or her work has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people within the organization or outside the organization.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/><ref name=\"Shamir\"/> Telework may not change the job characteristics of skill variety, task identity, and task significance compared to working in an office; however, the presence of these characteristics will influence teleworkers\u2019 work outcomes and attitudes.\n\n===Individual difference===\nIndividuals may differ in their reactions to the job characteristics in telecommuting. According to job characteristics theory, the personal need for accomplishment and development (growth need strength)<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> influences how much an individual will react to the job dimensions of telecommuting. For instance, those individuals high in growth need strength will have a more positive reaction to increased autonomy and a more negative reaction to decreased feedback in telecommuting than those individuals low in growth need strength.\n\n==Other theories==\nTelecommuting is a new work situation with a flexible structure that makes it different from traditional work environments.<ref name=\"Torraco\" >{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/hrdq.1125|title=Work design theory: A review and critique with implications for human resource development|year=2005|last1=Torraco|first1=Richard J.|journal=Human Resource Development Quarterly|volume=16|pages=85\u2013109}}</ref> Various job design theories, in addition to job characteristics theory, can help explain the differences between telecommuting and traditional job settings.\n\n===Motivator-hygiene theory===\n[[Motivator-hygiene theory]]<ref name=\"Herzberg\">Herzberg, F., Mausner, B., & Snyderman, B.B., (1959).

A working-from-home-related experiment conducted using 242 employees of a large Chinese [[travel agency]] by professors at [[Stanford]] and [[Beijing University]] found that employees randomly assigned to work at home for 9 months increased their output by 13.5% versus the office-based control group. This improvement in output arose from working 9% more hours from saved commuting time and from 3.5% improved efficiency from quieter working conditions. The study also found that home-workers reported significantly higher job-satisfaction scores and their quit rates fell by almost 50%. However, home workers' promotion rates dropped by half due to apparent performance declines, indicating a potential career cost of home-working.<ref>Bloom, Nicholas, Liang, James, Roberts, John and Ying, Jenny [http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/WFH.pdf \"Does working from home work? Evidence from a Chinese experiment\"] Stanford Research Paper, February 2013.</ref>\n\nTelework flexibility is a desirable prerequisite for employees. A 2008 Robert Half International Financial Hiring Index, a survey of 1,400 [[CFO]]s by recruitment firm Robert Half International, indicated that 13% consider telework the best recruiting incentive today for accounting professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roberthalffinance.com/portal/site/rhf-us/template.PAGE/menuitem.b55c61eb41144dbf9a64e9c302f3dfa0/?javax.portlet.tpst=7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0&javax.portlet.prp_7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0_releaseId=2108&javax.portlet.prp_7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0_request_type=RenderPressRelease&javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken|title=Survey Finds Salary Is Top Draw for Job Candidates but Benefits Nearly As Popular\n|author=Robert Half International  |date=2008-02-06}}</ref> In earlier surveys, 33% considered telework the best recruiting incentive, and half considered it second best.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Group-touts-telecommuting-s-green-benefits-3286958.php\n|title=SF Chronicle \"Group touts telecommuting's green benefits\"\n|author=Tom Abate  |publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.  |date=April 22, 2008  |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince work hours are less regulated in telework, employee effort and dedication are far more likely to be measured purely in terms of output or results. Fewer, if any, traces of non-productive work activities (research, self-training, dealing with technical problems or equipment failures) and time lost on unsuccessful attempts (early drafts, fruitless endeavors, abortive innovations) are visible to employers. Piece rate, commissions, or other performance-based compensation also become more likely for telecommuters. Furthermore, major chunks of per-employee expenses are absorbed by the telecommuter himself - from simple coffee, water, electricity, and telecommunications services, to huge capital expenses like office equipment or software licenses. Thus, hours spent on the job tend to be underestimated and expenses under-reported, creating overly optimistic figures of productivity gains and savings, some or all of those in fact coming out of the telecommuter's time and pocket.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20141210926\n   |title=Richie v.

Telework is a shift in the way business is accomplished which can make a difference overtime. As an example, a recent Australian study revealed that telework enabled by the National Broadband Network is expected to add $8.3 billion to Gross Domestic Product by 2020, creating the equivalent of an additional 25,000 full-time jobs. Around 10,000 of these jobs will be in regional Australia. When it comes to environment, it has been estimated that if 10 per cent of Australian employees were to telework 50 percent of the time, it would save 120 million litres of fuel and 320,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. That rate of telework would also deliver a productivity benefit of between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |title=NBN - Telework (defunct) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309010053/http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |archivedate=2013-03-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Turnover intention===\n[[Turnover intention]], or the desire to leave the organization, is lower for teleworkers.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Those teleworkers who experienced greater professional isolation actually had lower turnover intent.<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> One study found that by increasing feedback and task identity through clear communication of goals, objectives, and expectations, turnover intent decreased in teleworkers and quality of work output increased.<ref name=\"Ilozor\"/>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages meta-analysis===\nA meta-analysis of 46 studies of telecommuting involving 12,833 employees conducted by Ravi Gajendran and David A. Harrison in the ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', published by the American Psychological Association (APA), found that telecommuting has largely positive consequences for employees and employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/11/telecommuting.aspx|title=APA Press Release \"Telecommuting has Mostly Positive Consequences for Employees and Employers, Say Researchers\"\n|author=APA  |publisher=American Psychological Association  |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Gaj\" /> In their meta-analytic study, Gajendran and Harrison found that telecommuting had modest but beneficial effects on employees' job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, stress levels, manager-rated job performance, and (lower) work-family conflict. Telecommuting also reduces turnover intent, or the intention to quit one's job. Increased job satisfaction, decreased turnover intent and role stress related to telecommuting partly because of a decrease in work-family conflict. Additionally, the increase in autonomy from teleworking in turn increases job satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a number of scholars and managers had previously expressed fears that employee careers might suffer and workplace relationships might be damaged because of telecommuting, the meta-analysis found that there are no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships and career outcomes.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Telecommuting actually was found to positively affect employee-supervisor relations and the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intent was in part due to supervisor relationship quality.  Only high-intensity telecommuting (where employees work from home for more than 2.5 days a week) harmed employee relationships with co-workers, even though it did reduce work-family conflict.\n\n==Potential drawbacks and concerns==\nSkill variety has the strongest relationship with internal [[work motivation]].<ref name=\"Fried\"/> Jobs that allow workers to use a variety of skills increase workers\u2019 internal work motivation. If teleworkers are limited in teamwork opportunities and have fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills,<ref name=\"Shamir\"/> they may have lower internal motivation towards their work. Also, perceived social isolation can lead to less motivation.<ref name=\"Maruy\" /> It can be argued that without a work climate or manager nearby, the ability to motivate oneself is even more important when telecommuting than when working in an office. Though working in an office has its distractions, it is often argued that telecommuting involves even greater distractions. According to one study, children are ranked as the number one distractions, followed by spouses, pets, neighbors, and solicitors. The lack of proper tools and facilities also serves as a major distraction,<ref>{{cite web|title=3 Reasons Why Working From Home Can be Unproductive|url=http://www.corporatesuites.com/3-reasons-working-home-can-unproductive/|publisher=Corporate Suites|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> though this can be mitigated by using short-term [[coworking]] rental facilities.\n\nFace-to-face interactions increase interpersonal contact, connectedness, and trust<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> Therefore, 54% of teleworkers thought they lost out on social interaction and 52.5% felt they lost out on professional interaction in a 2012 study.<ref name=\"Maruy\"/> Teleworking can hurt working relationships between the teleworker and their coworkers, especially if their coworkers do not telework. Coworkers who do not telework can feel resentful and jealous because they may consider it unfair if they are not allowed to telework as well.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/><ref name=\"Morganson, V. J. 2010\"/> However, despite fewer interpersonal actions and professional isolation,<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> a meta-analysis of telecommuting did not find support for negative telecommuter-coworker relationships or telecommuter-supervisor relationships.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Employers' largest concerns about telecommuting are fear of loss of control; 75% of managers say they trust their employees, but a third say they would like to be able to see them, \"just to be sure\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://undress4success.com/research/pros-cons/|title=Lister, Kate, Undress For Success--The Naked Truth About Making Money at Home, (John Wiley & Sons 2009, {{Text|ISBN}} 978-0-470-38332-2) quoting Management-Issues.com (July 30, 2007) survey|accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>\n\nEmployees who telework may feel pressure to produce more output in order to be seen as valuable, and reduce the idea that they are doing less work than others. This pressure to produce output, as well as a lack of social support from limited coworker relationships and feelings of isolation, leads to lower job engagement in teleworkers.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> Additionally, higher-quality relationships with teammates decreased job satisfaction of teleworkers, potentially because of frustrations with exchanging interactions via technology.<ref name=\"golden006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Golden | first1 = T.

Reports finding that all 87 agencies participating in the Data Cell had established telework policies and 73 percent of the policies met the Telework Act Requirements. More than 684,000 federal employees were deemed eligible to telework, this represents approximately 32 percent of all federal employees. More than 144,000 federal employees had written teleworking agreements with their agencies. 27 percent of teleworkers worked remotely three or more days per week.<ref name=\"mnn.com\">{{cite web |title=Federal Teleworking Report Released |url=http://www.mnn.com/money/green-workplace/blogs/federal-teleworking-report-released}}</ref> In addition to the findings, the reports examine teleworking at the Department of Defense. According to the report, there are more than 793,000 employees in the DoD and of those employees, 134,477 were deemed eligible for teleworking. Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced teleworking and is attempting to create more remote working opportunities for employees. In closing, the report listed several ways that the government could make more jobs available through telework. Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.<ref name=\"mnn.com\"/>\n\n===Centers===\nTelework centers are offices that are generally set up close to a majority of people who might otherwise drive or take [[public transit]]. They usually feature the full complement of office equipment and a high-speed Internet connection for maximum [[productivity]]. Some feature support staff, including receptionists or administrators. For example, a number of telework centers have been set up around the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]]: 7 in Maryland, 8 in Virginia, 3 in Washington, D.C. and 1 in West Virginia. Telework centers allow people to reduce their commute yet still work in a traditional office setting. Some telework centers are set up by individual companies while others are established by independent organizations for use by many organizations. Telework centers are attractive to people who do not have the space or inclination to work from home. They offer employers the ability to maintain a more formal structure for their workforce.\n\nThese work arrangements are more likely to become more popular with current trends towards greater customization of services and virtual organizing. Distributed work offers great potential for firms to reduce costs, enhance competitive advantage and agility, access a greater variety of scarce talents, and improve employee flexibility, effectiveness and productivity.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.38.12.1687|title=An Emerging Distributed Work Arrangement: An Investigation of Computer-Based Supplemental Work at Home|year=1992|last1=Venkatesh|first1=Alladi|last2=Vitalari|first2=Nicholas P.|journal=Management Science|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1687\u20131706}}</ref><ref>Korte, W.

A remote office center provides professional grade network access, phone system, security system, mail stop and optional services for additional costs.  ROCs are generally located in areas near to where people live throughout population centers, so that workers do not have to commute more than a couple of miles.  The telecommuter works in a real office but accesses the company network across the internet using a VPN just as in traditional telecommuting.\n\nThis type of arrangement does not share fully in the benefits of home-based telecommuting, but can address the needs of employees who are unable or unwilling to work from home.\n\n===Information Security for Teleworkers===\n\"To hackers who make a living stealing information from unsecured computers and network connections, the teleworker could be an open the door to the organization\u2019s most sensitive data. Security and privacy have become increasingly rare commodities these days thanks to the ability of hackers to stay one step ahead of just about every security measure that technicians can create.  Security breaches are a significant enough threat in a standard office environment; however, when an organization has employees working from home or on the go, these risks become even greater.\n\nIt is vital for organizations to convey to teleworkers that data protection and information security are important to an organization, and employees\u2019 actions make a difference in achieving the overall goal of protection of sensitive data. Despite increased awareness and training on security issues, many employees do not take the necessary precautions for deterring security risks.\n\nReal security begins with security policy. The Information Security professional must ensure that the security policy covers telecommuting/teleworking and who may telework, services available to teleworkers, information restrictions, identification/authentication/authorization, equipment and software specifications, integrity and confidentiality, maintenance guidelines, and robust user education.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Improving Information Security for Teleworkers |first=Tim |last=Godlove |url=https://www.ufairfax.edu/news/Improving-Information-Security-for-Teleworkers-20170113-0022 |publisher=University of Fairfax }}</ref>\n\n===Other countries===\nAccording to an article from the ''New York Times'', telecommuting now takes about 2.6 percent of the American workforce not including remote works like drivers. The article also mentions an experiment done by Nicholas Bloom. Nicholas Bloom is an economics professor from Stanford University. During this experiment, 250 workers were picked randomly from Ctrip to work either at home or at an office. Ctrip is a large China travel agency.  The result showed that those who telecommuted worked longer hours than those who worked at an office. The telecommuters were also more productive and happier. Ctrip saved around 2K from telecommuting. Although the quitting rate decreased for telecommuters, the promotion rate also decreased. Many telecommuters asked to be back in the office at the end with reasoning like loneliness and desire for promotion. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, came to the conclusion that most workers prefer telecommuting and office work combined. Telecommuting increases efficiency and workers\u2019 flexibility.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Marilynn K.|title=It's Unclearly Defined, but Telecommuting Is Fast on the Rise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAmerica has an increasing trend of using teleworking  due to its strong economics and multimedia services.

One of the ethical issues behind telecommuting is who should have the chance to telecommute? One may have more chance to work at home because he/she has young children. The other one may argue he/she also has personal problems. It is favored by most workers to combine telecommuting and office work. Many think that telecommuting once or twice a week is a reasonable schedule. Businesses also favor this suggestion because workers are more satisfied and companies save money from it.\n\n===Effects of 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic===\nAnalysts have suggested that the ongoing [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] could be a \"tipping point\" for telecommuting.<ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/coronavirus-tipping-point-finally-telecommuting/</ref> In [[Seattle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], and [[Google]] have mandated employees work from home.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166686/coronavirus-amazon-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter-seattle-staff-remote-work</ref><ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/seattle-morning-traffic-disappears-amazon-microsoft-others-enforce-remote-work-policies/</ref> Others have suggested that an increase in telecommuting as a result of the outbreak could result in an expanded [[right to Internet access]] in the United States.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-03-06/coronavirus-telecommute-work-from-home</ref>\n\n==Related terms and concepts==\n\n===Coworking===\n{{main|Coworking}}\nCoworking is a social gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share a common working area as well as the synergy that can happen from working with people in the same space. Coworking facilities can range from shared space in formal offices to social areas such as a coffee shop. Entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs often cowork in shared office and workshop facilities provided by [[business incubator]]s and [[business accelerator]] organizations. In entrepreneurship, coworking allows creative start-up founders, researchers and knowledge workers to [[business network|meet and share ideas]], collaborate, share new research, and find potential partners.\n\n===Distributed work===\nDistributed work entails the conduct of organizational tasks in places that extend beyond the confines of traditional [[office]]s or workspaces. It can refer to organizational arrangements that permit or require workers to perform work more effectively at any appropriate location&mdash;such as their homes or [[customer|customers']] sites&mdash;through the application of information and communication technology. An example is [[financial planner]]s who meet clients during the client's lunchtime at the client's workplace; even though this is an out-of-the-office, meeting, the [[Internet]] enables the planner to present financial planning tools and presentations on their mobile computers. Another example is a [[publishing]] executives who recommends books and places orders for the latest book offerings to libraries and university professors from the executive's home using e-mail or an online system. If this type of distributed work replaces the worker's commute, it would be considered telecommuting. If not, it would be telework (see [[#Definition|\u00a71. Definition]]).\n\n===Hoteling===\nSome companies, particularly those where employees spend a great deal of time on the road and at remote locations, offer a [[hotdesking]] or [[hoteling]] arrangement where employees can reserve the use of a temporary traditional office, [[cubicle]] or [[meeting room]] at the company headquarters, a [[remote office center]], or other shared office facility.\n\n== {{anchor|Homeworker}}Homeworker ==\n'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].\n\nHomeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes. Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for. Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.

He also holds a Belgian passport.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nFadiga moved to France when he was six years old. Fadiga began his career at [[Paris Saint-Germain]] in France, but failed to make an impression, and so was transferred to fellow Parisian club, [[Red Star 93]], before moving to Belgian club [[FC Li\u00e8ge]].\n\n===Lommel===\nIt was in Belgium that he found the profile that was to launch his international career. After one season he moved from [[FC Li\u00e8ge]] to Lommel, which is now [[KVSK United]]. He played two seasons at Lommel before he was spotted by [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]].\n\n===Club Brugge===\nFadiga quickly became a fan favorite. He scored nine goals in 67 appearances. In September 2000, the midfielder returned to France when he signed for [[AJ Auxerre]].\n\n===Auxerre===\nIn all, he played in 82 league games for the French club, scoring 10 goals as well as appearing in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Cup]] during season 2002\u201303. In his final season at Auxerre he helped them win the [[2002-03 Coupe de France]], playing in the final as they defeated [[Paris St Germain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.europe1.fr/sport/psg-auxerre-cetait-deja-il-y-a-12-ans-1339522 |title=PSG-Auxerre, c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 il y a 12 ans |website=europe1.fr |accessdate=8 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Internazionale===\nFadiga moved to [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Inter Milan]] in the summer of 2003, but the discovery of heart problems did not allow him to feature for the Italian club, apart from appearing in a few friendly games during the Summer. He was released from the [[San Siro (stadium)|San Siro]] side after just one season, but decided against retirement despite the heart problems.\n\n===Bolton Wanderers===\nEnglish club [[Bolton Wanderers FC|Bolton Wanderers]] signed Fadiga for the 2004\u201305 season, after he passed a medical. However, before he made an appearance for Bolton, he collapsed prior to a match in October, and had to be fitted with a [[defibrillator]] due to an irregular heartbeat. Despite stating his desire to return to the game, medical specialists urged him to retire, warning that if during a game his chest was knocked the defibrillator could fail, leading to instant death. However, following a period of rest and passing a medical, Fadiga returned to the Bolton squad in early 2005 and played in five games.\n\nAt the start of the 2005\u201306 campaign Fadiga was loaned to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] of the [[Football League Championship]], making four appearances. On his return to the [[Reebok Stadium]] he took part in ten games, two of them in the [[UEFA Cup]], before eventually being released in May 2006.\n\n===Coventry City===\nWithout a club at the start of the 2006\u201307 season, he went on trial with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and played for their reserve team. He also had trials at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] before eventually signing a four-month contract with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on 23 February 2007. In April 2007 he suffered a serious Achilles injury in the home game against Preston and it ended his time at Coventry.\n\n===Return to Belgium===\nHe has since been released and returned to his wife's homeland signing with [[AA Gent]]. After one year he moved in June 2008 to [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot]], but left Beerschot after short time in December 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.transfermarketweb.com/?action=read&idsel=29226 | title = OFFICIAL, Fadiga quits Germinal Beerschot | accessdate = 24 December 2008 | date = 23 December 2008 | publisher = transfermarketweb.com}}</ref> He signed for [[Belgian Third Division|Third Division]] club [[KSV Temse]] in 2011 before retiring from the game.\n\n==Personal life==\nFadiga is married with a Belgian and has two kids Noah and Naoel.

There are several \u2013 often contradictory and sometimes unreliable \u2013 Janams\u0101kh\u012bs and they are not held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.\n\n==Observances==\n[[File:InsideSikhGurdwara.jpg|thumb|The [[Darbar Sahib Hall|Darbar Sahib]] of a [[Gurdwara]]]]\nObservant Sikhs adhere to long-standing practices and traditions to strengthen and express their faith. The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%).

The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\".

The ''Dasam Granth'' is important to a great number of Sikhs, however it does not have the same authority as the ''Guru Granth Sahib''. Some compositions of the ''Dasam Granth'' like [[Jaap Sahib]], ([[Amrit Savaiye]]), and [[Chaupai (Sikhism)|Benti Chaupai]] are part of the daily prayers ([[Nitnem]]) for Sikhs.<ref>Robert Zaehner (1988), The Hutchinson Encyclopedia of Living Faiths, Hutchinson, {{ISBN|978-0091735760}}, pp. 426\u2013427</ref> The ''Dasam Granth'' is largely versions of Hindu mythology from the [[Puranas]], secular stories from a variety of sources called ''Charitro Pakhyan'' \u2013 tales to protect careless men from perils of lust.<ref>Christopher Shackle and Arvind Mandair (2005), Teachings of the Sikh Gurus, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266048}}, p. xx</ref><ref>William McLeod (2009), The A to Z of Sikhism, Toronto: Rowman & Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0810868281}}, p. 151</ref>\n\nFive versions of ''Dasam Granth'' exist, and the authenticity of the ''Dasam Granth'' is amongst the most debated topics within Sikhism.

Although not scripture in the strictest sense, they provide a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] look at Nanak's life and the early start of Sikhism. There are several \u2013 often contradictory and sometimes unreliable \u2013 Janams\u0101kh\u012bs and they are not held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.\n\n==Observances==\n[[File:InsideSikhGurdwara.jpg|thumb|The [[Darbar Sahib Hall|Darbar Sahib]] of a [[Gurdwara]]]]\nObservant Sikhs adhere to long-standing practices and traditions to strengthen and express their faith. The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism.
