However, it is not clear how these numbers were calculated or whether they disaggregate civilian and soldier deaths. Others' attempts to verify the numbers suggest a lower number. Demographer Patrick Heuveline has produced evidence suggesting a range of 150,000 to 300,000 violent deaths from 1970 to 1975. In an article reviewing different sources about civilian deaths during the civil war, Bruce Sharp argues that the total number is likely to be around 250,000 violent deaths.&nbsp;... Many attempts have been made to count or estimate the scale of deaths under the KR. While the KR officials claim that only around 20,000 civilians were killed, the true estimate likely falls somewhere between 1-3 million total deaths, with upper range estimates of those directly killed by the regime approaching 1 million.&nbsp;... One of the more thorough demographic studies, conducted by Patrick Heuveline, also attempts to separate out violent civilian deaths from a general increase in mortality caused by famine, disease, working conditions, or other indirect causes. He does so by grouping deaths within different age and sex brackets and analyzing treatment of these age and sex groups by the Khmer Rouge and violent regimes in general. His conclusion is that an average of 2.52 million people (range of 1.17-3.42 million) died as a result of regime actions between 1970 and 1979, with an average estimate of 1.4 million (range of 1.09-2.16 million) directly violent deaths.}}</ref>\n\nThe number of Cambodian civilian and Khmer Rouge deaths caused by U.S. bombing is disputed and difficult to disentangle from the broader [[Cambodian Civil War]].<ref name=\"Sliwinski\"/> Estimates range from 30,000 to 500,000.<ref name=Valentino>{{cite book|last=Valentino|first=Benjamin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQfeXVU_EvgC&q=30%2C000-150%2C000#v=onepage&q=30%2C000&f=false|title=Final Solutions: Mass Killing and Genocide in the 20th Century|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=9780801472732|p=84}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT97&dq=nixon,+cambodia,+killed,+civilians&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXnbKPua7YAhUikeAKHW1VAd0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=over%20500%2C000&f=false James A.

Ils oscillent, pour le nombre des morts, entre 600 000 et 700 000, soit entre 7.7 % et 9.6 % de la population du pays selon les \u00e9valuations les plus extr\u00eames. La cause principale de ces pertes serait les bombardements massifs de l'aviation am\u00e9ricaine dont le but principal \u00e9tait l'an\u00e9antissement des pistes Ho-Chi-Minh et la destruction d'un mythique Q.G. du Vi\u00eat-cong. A cet \u00e9gard, il est int\u00e9ressant de rappeler que la population de toutes les r\u00e9gions travers\u00e9es par les pistes Ho-Chi-Minh, r\u00e9gions situ\u00e9es sur la rive gauche du M\u00e9kong, ne comptait au total qu'environ 1 165 000 personnes, et que les trois plus grandes provinces longeant la fronti\u00e9re laotienne et vietnamienne, Stung Treng, Ratanakiri et Mondolkiri, \u00e9taient pratiquement inhabit\u00e9es. L'impact des bombardments am\u00e9ricains sur l'\u00e9tat de la population du Cambodge durant les ann\u00e9es 1970\u20131975 ne para\u00eet donc pas aussi \u00e9vident que certain auteurs le supposent. Nos propres statistiques sur les causes pr\u00e9cises des d\u00e9c\u00e9s ne situent d'ailleurs les victimes des bombardments qu'\u00e0 la troisi\u00e9me place, loin derri\u00e9re les victimes des armes \u00e0 feu portatives et des assassinats.&nbsp;... Pour la p\u00e9riode de guerre civile, l'augmentation totale de la mortalit\u00e9 est donc de 7.5% Si l'on consid\u00e9re que la mortalit\u00e9 naturelle frappe chaque ann\u00e9 quelque 132 000 personnes, on pourrait facilement en d\u00e9duire que la surmortalit\u00e9 due \u00e0 la guerre se chiffre par un nombre de d\u00e9c\u00e9s ne d\u00e9passant pas 50 000 personnes durant la p\u00e9riod allant de mars 1970 \u00e0 avril 1975. Toutefois, en tenant compte du fait que la guerre a eu une forte incidence tant sur la dimunution de la mortalit\u00e9 naturelle que sur l'agumentation de la mortalit\u00e9 infantile, on peut estimer la proportion annuelle des victimes elles-m\u00eames de cette guerre \u00e0 0,64% de la population du pays, soit, pour toutes ces ann\u00e9es, 240 000 personnes environ.}}</ref> Judith Banister and E.

For instance, [[Michael Vickery]] opined that the killings were \"largely the result of the spontaneous excesses of a vengeful, undisciplined peasant army.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cambodia: 1975\u20131982|last=Vickery|first=Michael|publisher=South End Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=}}</ref> Such view was also supported by [[Alexander Hinton]], who related an account by a former Khmer Rouge cadre who claimed that the killings were acts of retribution for the injustices of the Lon Nol soldiers when they killed people who were known to be former [[Viet Minh]] agents<ref>{{Cite book|title=After the Killing Fields: Lessons from the Cambodian Genocide|last=Etcheson|first=Craig|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|isbn=|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=45\u201347}}</ref> before the rise of Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge to power.

This indicates that Chandler does not believe in the argument of charging the Khmer Rouge regime with the crime of genocide. Similarly, Michael Vickery holds a similar position to Chandler\u2019s, and refuses to acknowledge the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime as genocide; Vickery regarded the Khmer Rouge a \"chauvinist\" regime, due to its anti-Vietnam and anti-religion policies.<ref>Kiernan, 2002:252; see Vickery\u2019s ''Cambodia 1975\u20131982'', pp.&nbsp;181\u201382, 255, 258, 264\u201365)</ref> Stephen Heder also conceded that the Khmer Rouge were not guilty of genocide, stating that the atrocities of the regime were not motivated by race.<ref>Kiernan, 2002:252; see Heder\u2019s ''From Pol Pot to Pen Sovan to the Villages'', p.&nbsp;1</ref>\n\nBen Kiernan makes the argument that it was indeed a genocide and disagrees with these three scholars, by bringing forth examples from the history of the Cham people in Cambodia, as did an international tribunal finding [[Nuon Chea]] and Khieu Samphan guilty 92 and 87 counts of said crime respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beech |first1=Hannah |title=Khmer Rouge's Slaughter in Cambodia Is Ruled a Genocide Photographs of victims of the Khmer Rouge at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on Thursday.

He then returned home to the Eastern Zone in 1970 and joined the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] (CPK), and co-established the Eastern Zone Islamic Movement with his son, Mat Ly. Together, they became the mouthpiece of the CPK to get the Cham people to take part in the revolution (2002:258). Sos Man\u2019s Islamic Movement was also tolerated by CPK\u2019s leadership between 1970\u201375 (2002:258). The Chams were gradually made to abandon their faith and distinct practices as early as 1972 in the Southwest (2002:258).\n\nTen Cham villages were taken over by the CPK in 1972\u201373, where new Cham leaders were instated and led the villagers to work in the fields away from their hometowns. A witness interviewed by Kiernan asserts that they were well-treated by the CPK then, and allowed to return to their homes in 1974 (2002:259). On top of that, the Cham were also classified as \"depositee base people,\" which makes them further vulnerable to prosecution.\n\nDespite that, the Cham in many areas do live side by side with the locals, speaking the Khmer language, and even inter-marrying with the majority Khmers as well as the minority Chinese and Vietnamese (Kiernan, 2002:257). The diverse ethnic and cultural practices of Cambodians began to deteriorate with the rise of the CPK in 1972, when the Cham were prohibited from practising their faith and culture \u2013 Cham women were required to keep their hair short like the Khmers did; Cham men were not allowed to put on the sarong; farmers were made to put on rudimentary dark or black clothing; religious activities like the mandatory daily prayers were curbed (Kiernan, 2002:258\u2013259). Vickery notes that the Cambodian Cham were discriminated against by the Khmer before the beginning of the war \"in some localities,\" partly because the Cham were stereotyped as being practitioners of black magic (Kiernan, 2002:256; see also Vickery\u2019s ''Cambodia 1975\u20131982'', pp.&nbsp;181.) However, in other localities, the Cham were well-assimilated within the host communities, speaking the Khmer language and inter-marrying to Khmers, Vietnamese, and the Chinese (2002:256).\n\nBetween 1972 and 1974, the enforcement of such restrictions was further amplified as the Khmer Rouge found the Cham to be a threat to its communist agenda due to their unique language, culture, belief, and independent communal system. Not only that, the Cham were also renamed \"Islamic Khmers,\" to disassociate them with their ancestral heritage and ethnicity, and assimilating them into the larger Khmer-dominated Democratic Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge believed that the Cham would jeopardise the communist efforts of establishing close-knit communities where everyone could be easily monitored. As such, the regime had decided to disperse the Cham by deporting them from their respective localities to work as peasants across Cambodia, hence contributing directly to the new DK economy. This move was undertaken to ensure that the Cham will not congregate to form its own community again, which undermines the regime\u2019s plan of establishing central economic cooperatives. Slowly, those who defied these restrictions were arrested by the regime. Hence in October 1973, Cham Muslims in the Eastern Zone of DK demonstrated their displeasure towards the CPK restrictions by beating the drums \u2013 which are traditionally used to inform local of the time for daily prayers \u2013 at the local mosques. This act of communal defiance prompted the blanket arrest of many leaders and religious teachers from the Cham Muslim community <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|url=http://archive.org/details/specterofgenocid00robe|title=The specter of genocide : mass murder in historical perspective|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|date=2003|publisher=New York : Cambridge University Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=260-261}}</ref>.\n\nIn February 1974, the Cham in Region 31, which is in the Western Zone of DK, protested the CPK policy which required the fishermen to register their daily catch with the local cooperative and sell them to the cooperative at a low price. At the same time, the locals were also made to buy those fishes from the cooperative at a higher price. This prompted the locals to confront the cooperative to express their discontent, only to be shot at, \"killing and wounding more than 100,\" as one account put it. By December 1974, a rebellion by the Cham in Region 21 of the Eastern Zone had broken out against the CPK after community leaders were arrested. The rebellion was repressed forcefully by the regime with no records of casualties documented.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nAs much as there are records of these restrictions, resistance, and repressions, there were also accounts from the Cham community which deny the oppression by the regime between 1970 and early 1975. While restrictions on certain activities like trade and travel were in place during that period, they were understood to be by-products of the ongoing civil war. Moreover, some Cham had also joined the revolution as soldiers and members of the CPK. According to some local accounts, people had confidence in the Khmer Rouge when they first came to the village communities who assisted the locals with food and provisions, and there were no bans on local culture or religion; even if restrictions were imposed, the consequences were not harsh.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|url=http://archive.org/details/specterofgenocid00robe|title=The specter of genocide : mass murder in historical perspective|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|date=2003|publisher=New York : Cambridge University Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=262}}</ref> The CPK were considered heroes of the revolution as they struggled for the cause of the peasantry and nation against the United States (Hinton, 2005:58). As the Cham communities were to be found across DK, various Cham communities might have experienced the effects of the CPK pre-1975 differently; some communities experienced the repressions and restrictions while others did not. Only when Pol Pot had consolidated power by the end of 1975 that the prosecutions became more severe and affected all of the Cham people indiscriminately.\n\nThis could well be one of the simpler factors as to why the Cambodian government and the [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal|Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]] (ECCC) do not prosecute the pre-1975 Khmer Rouge perpetrators before Pol Pot consolidated his power. As such, the accounts of those who experienced the repressions prior to 1975 were not considered to be part of the genocide as the case for a systematic annihilation of a people based on ethnic or religious profiling was not concrete enough.\n\nIn 1975, upon the victory of the CPK over the Khmer Republic forces, two brothers of Cham descent who had joined the Khmer Rouge as soldiers returned home to Region 21 within the Kampong Cham province, where the largest Cham Muslim community could be found. The brothers then told their father of the adventures they had experienced being part of the revolution which included killing Khmers and consuming pork, in the hopes of convincing their father to join the communist cause. The father who had remained silent, was clearly not intrigued by the accounts related by his sons. Instead, he grabbed a cleaver, killed his sons, and told his fellow villagers that he had killed the enemy. When the villagers pointed out that he had indeed murdered his own sons, he recounted the stories he was told by his sons earlier, citing the Khmer Rouge\u2019s hatred for Islam and the Cham people. This prompted a unanimous agreement amongst the villagers to kill all Khmer Rouge soldiers within the area on that night. The next morning, more Khmer Rouge forces descended the area with heavy weapons and surrounded the village, killing every single villager in it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|url=http://archive.org/details/specterofgenocid00robe|title=The specter of genocide : mass murder in historical perspective|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|date=2003|publisher=New York : Cambridge University Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=263}}</ref> Similarly in June or July 1975, the CPK authorities in Region 21 of the Eastern Zone tried to confiscate all copies of the Qur'an from the people, while at the same time impose a mandatory short haircut for Cham women. The authorities were met with mass demonstration staged by the local Cham community who were shot at by the regime soldiers. The Cham retaliated forcefully with swords and blades killing a few soldiers, only to be met with military reinforcement from the regime which annihilated the villagers and their properties<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|url=http://archive.org/details/specterofgenocid00robe|title=The specter of genocide : mass murder in historical perspective|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|date=2003|publisher=New York : Cambridge University Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=263-264}}</ref>. In another account by Cham refugees in Malaysia, thirteen leading figures within the Cham Muslim community were killed by the regime in June 1975. The reasons behind the killings was supposedly because some of them were \"leading prayers instead of attending a CPK meeting,\" while the others were purportedly \"petitioning for the permission on marriage ceremonies\" (Kiernan, 2002:263).\n\nEvents went from bad to worse in mid-1976 due to the rebellion, when the ethnic minorities were obliged to pledge loyalty only to the Khmer nationality and religion \u2013 there were to be no other identities besides Khmer. Consequently, the Cham language were not uttered, communal eating where everyone shares the same food became mandatory, forcing the Cham Muslims to raise pigs and consume pork against their religious belief (Kiernan, 2002:269). One explanation for the rise of such rebellions offered by that locals is that some of the Cham were involved in the Khmer Rouge as soldiers who were anticipating positions of power once Pol Pot consolidated power. In 1975, these Cham soldiers were dismissed from the Khmer Rouge forces, deprived from their Islamic practices and robbed of their ethnic identity (Kiernan, 2002:264).\n\nHere, we could point out that the patterns were consistent throughout the killings of the Cham people; first, the dismantling of the communal structure through the murder of the leaders of the Cham Muslim communities, which include the Muftis, Imams, and other learned men of influence; second, the dismantling of the Cham\u2019s Islamic and ethnic identities through the restrictions against distinct practices which distinguished the Cham from the Khmers; third, the dispersal of the Cham from their respective communities, either by forced labour in the fields, or arresting them for alleged plots of resistance or rebellion against the CPK.\n\nDuring the Khmer Rouge era, all religions, including both Buddhism and Islam were persecuted. According to Cham sources, 132 mosques were destroyed during the Khmer Rouge era, many others were desecrated, and Muslims were not allowed to worship. Muslims were forced to eat [[pork]] and were murdered when they refused. Whole Cham villages were exterminated. Chams were not permitted to speak their language. Cham children were taken away from their parents and raised as Khmers.\n\nOrders given by the Khmer Rouge government in 1979 stated: \"The Cham nation no longer exists on Kampuchean soil belonging to the Khmer. Accordingly, Cham nationality, language, customs and religious beliefs must be immediately abolished. Those who fail to obey this order will suffer all the consequences for their acts of opposition to Angkar [the Khmer Rouge high command].\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Le Coz |first1=Clothilde |title=The question of genocide and Cambodia's Muslims |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/question-genocide-cambodia-muslims-151110072431950.html |website=Aljazeera |date=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of Khmer Rouge rule all religions were restored. Vickery believes that about 185,000 Cham lived in Cambodia in the mid-1980s and that the number of mosques was about the same then as it was before 1975. In early 1988, there were six mosques in the Phnom Penh area and a \"good number\" in the provinces, but Muslim dignitaries were thinly stretched; only 20 of the previous 113 most prominent Cham clergy in Cambodia survived the Khmer Rouge period.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perrin |first1=Andrew |title=Weakness in Numbers |url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,428133,00.html |publisher=TIME |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129040814/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,428133,00.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 |date=16 November 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Religious groups====\nUnder the leadership of Pol Pot, who was an ardent [[atheist]],<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.543</ref> the Khmer Rouge had a policy of [[state atheism]].

When it was believed that they could not provide any further useful information, they were blindfolded and sent to the [[Killing Fields]], which were mass graves where prisoners were killed at night with metal tools such as scythes or nails and hammers (since the bullets were too expensive). Oftentimes, their screams were covered with loudspeakers playing propaganda music of Democratic Kampuchea and noise from generator sets.\n[[File:ChoeungEk-Darter-7.jpg|thumb|A [[Chankiri Tree]]. The sign reads \"Chankiri Tree against which executioners beat children\"]]\nInside S-21, a special treatment was given to babies and children; they were taken away from their mothers and relatives, and sent to the Killing Fields, where they were smashed against the so-called [[Chankiri Tree]]. A similar treatment is supposed to have been given to babies of other prisons like S-21, spread all over Democratic Kampuchea.\n\nS-21 also had a few Westerners, who had been captured by the regime.

Since 1979, the so-called Pol Pot regime has been equated to Hitler and the Nazis. This is why the word 'genocide' (associated with Nazism) has been used for the first time in a distinctly Communist regime by the invading Vietnamese to distance themselves from a government they had overturned. This 'revisionism' was expressed in several ways. The Khmer Rouge were said to have killed 3.3 million, some 1.3 million more people than they had in fact killed. There was one abominable state prison, S\u201321, now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. In fact, there were more than 150 on the same model, at least one per district.&nbsp;... For the United States in particular, denouncing the crimes of the Khmer Rouge was not at the top of their agenda in the early 1980s. Instead, as in the case of Afghanistan, it was still at times vital to counter what was perceived as the expansionist policies of the Soviets. The USA prioritised its budding friendship with the Democratic Republic of China to counter the 'evil' influence of the USSR in Southeast Asia, acting through its client state, revolutionary Vietnam. All the ASEAN countries shared that vision. So it became vital, with the military and financial help of China, to revive and develop armed resistance to the Vietnamese troops, with the resurrected KR at its core.&nbsp;...

Premier [[Lon Nol]] deposed Sihanouk with the support of the [[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]], establishing the pro-United States [[Khmer Republic]]. On the advice of [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), Sihanouk, who was in exile in [[Beijing]], made an alliance with the Khmer Rouge and became the nominal head of a Khmer Rouge\u2013dominated government-in-exile (known by its French acronym [[GRUNK]]) backed by China. Although thoroughly aware of the weakness of Lon Nol's forces and loath to commit American military force to the new conflict in any form other than air power, the [[Nixon administration]] announced its support for the newly proclaimed Khmer Republic.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 181\u201382, 194.

By June, three months after the removal of Sihanouk, they had swept government forces from the entire northeastern third of the country. After defeating those forces, the North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the local insurgents. The Khmer Rouge also established \"liberated\" areas in the south and the southwestern parts of the country, where they operated independently of the North Vietnamese.<ref>Sutsakhan, Lt. Gen.

However, it is not clear how these numbers were calculated or whether they disaggregate civilian and soldier deaths. Others' attempts to verify the numbers suggest a lower number. Demographer Patrick Heuveline has produced evidence suggesting a range of 150,000 to 300,000 violent deaths from 1970 to 1975. In an article reviewing different sources about civilian deaths during the civil war, Bruce Sharp argues that the total number is likely to be around 250,000 violent deaths.&nbsp;... Many attempts have been made to count or estimate the scale of deaths under the KR. While the KR officials claim that only around 20,000 civilians were killed, the true estimate likely falls somewhere between 1-3 million total deaths, with upper range estimates of those directly killed by the regime approaching 1 million.&nbsp;... One of the more thorough demographic studies, conducted by Patrick Heuveline, also attempts to separate out violent civilian deaths from a general increase in mortality caused by famine, disease, working conditions, or other indirect causes. He does so by grouping deaths within different age and sex brackets and analyzing treatment of these age and sex groups by the Khmer Rouge and violent regimes in general. His conclusion is that an average of 2.52 million people (range of 1.17-3.42 million) died as a result of regime actions between 1970 and 1979, with an average estimate of 1.4 million (range of 1.09-2.16 million) directly violent deaths.}}</ref>\n\nThe number of Cambodian civilian and Khmer Rouge deaths caused by U.S. bombing is disputed and difficult to disentangle from the broader [[Cambodian Civil War]].<ref name=\"Sliwinski\"/> Estimates range from 30,000 to 500,000.<ref name=Valentino>{{cite book|last=Valentino|first=Benjamin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQfeXVU_EvgC&q=30%2C000-150%2C000#v=onepage&q=30%2C000&f=false|title=Final Solutions: Mass Killing and Genocide in the 20th Century|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=9780801472732|p=84}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT97&dq=nixon,+cambodia,+killed,+civilians&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXnbKPua7YAhUikeAKHW1VAd0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=over%20500%2C000&f=false James A.

Les chiffres avanc\u00e9s ne sont pas irr\u00e9futables, et ils peuvent bien avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins de propagande ou d'intoxication. Ils oscillent, pour le nombre des morts, entre 600 000 et 700 000, soit entre 7.7 % et 9.6 % de la population du pays selon les \u00e9valuations les plus extr\u00eames. La cause principale de ces pertes serait les bombardements massifs de l'aviation am\u00e9ricaine dont le but principal \u00e9tait l'an\u00e9antissement des pistes Ho-Chi-Minh et la destruction d'un mythique Q.G. du Vi\u00eat-cong. A cet \u00e9gard, il est int\u00e9ressant de rappeler que la population de toutes les r\u00e9gions travers\u00e9es par les pistes Ho-Chi-Minh, r\u00e9gions situ\u00e9es sur la rive gauche du M\u00e9kong, ne comptait au total qu'environ 1 165 000 personnes, et que les trois plus grandes provinces longeant la fronti\u00e9re laotienne et vietnamienne, Stung Treng, Ratanakiri et Mondolkiri, \u00e9taient pratiquement inhabit\u00e9es. L'impact des bombardments am\u00e9ricains sur l'\u00e9tat de la population du Cambodge durant les ann\u00e9es 1970\u20131975 ne para\u00eet donc pas aussi \u00e9vident que certain auteurs le supposent.

This is because the earlier scholarship which came about right after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 had claimed that the victims could have killed due to the circumstances they were in. For instance, [[Michael Vickery]] opined that the killings were \"largely the result of the spontaneous excesses of a vengeful, undisciplined peasant army.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cambodia: 1975\u20131982|last=Vickery|first=Michael|publisher=South End Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=}}</ref> Such view was also supported by [[Alexander Hinton]], who related an account by a former Khmer Rouge cadre who claimed that the killings were acts of retribution for the injustices of the Lon Nol soldiers when they killed people who were known to be former [[Viet Minh]] agents<ref>{{Cite book|title=After the Killing Fields: Lessons from the Cambodian Genocide|last=Etcheson|first=Craig|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|isbn=|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=45\u201347}}</ref> before the rise of Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge to power.

This indicates that Chandler does not believe in the argument of charging the Khmer Rouge regime with the crime of genocide. Similarly, Michael Vickery holds a similar position to Chandler\u2019s, and refuses to acknowledge the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime as genocide; Vickery regarded the Khmer Rouge a \"chauvinist\" regime, due to its anti-Vietnam and anti-religion policies.<ref>Kiernan, 2002:252; see Vickery\u2019s ''Cambodia 1975\u20131982'', pp.&nbsp;181\u201382, 255, 258, 264\u201365)</ref> Stephen Heder also conceded that the Khmer Rouge were not guilty of genocide, stating that the atrocities of the regime were not motivated by race.<ref>Kiernan, 2002:252; see Heder\u2019s ''From Pol Pot to Pen Sovan to the Villages'', p.&nbsp;1</ref>\n\nBen Kiernan makes the argument that it was indeed a genocide and disagrees with these three scholars, by bringing forth examples from the history of the Cham people in Cambodia, as did an international tribunal finding [[Nuon Chea]] and Khieu Samphan guilty 92 and 87 counts of said crime respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beech |first1=Hannah |title=Khmer Rouge's Slaughter in Cambodia Is Ruled a Genocide Photographs of victims of the Khmer Rouge at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on Thursday.

He then returned home to the Eastern Zone in 1970 and joined the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] (CPK), and co-established the Eastern Zone Islamic Movement with his son, Mat Ly. Together, they became the mouthpiece of the CPK to get the Cham people to take part in the revolution (2002:258). Sos Man\u2019s Islamic Movement was also tolerated by CPK\u2019s leadership between 1970\u201375 (2002:258). The Chams were gradually made to abandon their faith and distinct practices as early as 1972 in the Southwest (2002:258).\n\nTen Cham villages were taken over by the CPK in 1972\u201373, where new Cham leaders were instated and led the villagers to work in the fields away from their hometowns. A witness interviewed by Kiernan asserts that they were well-treated by the CPK then, and allowed to return to their homes in 1974 (2002:259). On top of that, the Cham were also classified as \"depositee base people,\" which makes them further vulnerable to prosecution.\n\nDespite that, the Cham in many areas do live side by side with the locals, speaking the Khmer language, and even inter-marrying with the majority Khmers as well as the minority Chinese and Vietnamese (Kiernan, 2002:257). The diverse ethnic and cultural practices of Cambodians began to deteriorate with the rise of the CPK in 1972, when the Cham were prohibited from practising their faith and culture \u2013 Cham women were required to keep their hair short like the Khmers did; Cham men were not allowed to put on the sarong; farmers were made to put on rudimentary dark or black clothing; religious activities like the mandatory daily prayers were curbed (Kiernan, 2002:258\u2013259). Vickery notes that the Cambodian Cham were discriminated against by the Khmer before the beginning of the war \"in some localities,\" partly because the Cham were stereotyped as being practitioners of black magic (Kiernan, 2002:256; see also Vickery\u2019s ''Cambodia 1975\u20131982'', pp.&nbsp;181.) However, in other localities, the Cham were well-assimilated within the host communities, speaking the Khmer language and inter-marrying to Khmers, Vietnamese, and the Chinese (2002:256).\n\nBetween 1972 and 1974, the enforcement of such restrictions was further amplified as the Khmer Rouge found the Cham to be a threat to its communist agenda due to their unique language, culture, belief, and independent communal system. Not only that, the Cham were also renamed \"Islamic Khmers,\" to disassociate them with their ancestral heritage and ethnicity, and assimilating them into the larger Khmer-dominated Democratic Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge believed that the Cham would jeopardise the communist efforts of establishing close-knit communities where everyone could be easily monitored. As such, the regime had decided to disperse the Cham by deporting them from their respective localities to work as peasants across Cambodia, hence contributing directly to the new DK economy. This move was undertaken to ensure that the Cham will not congregate to form its own community again, which undermines the regime\u2019s plan of establishing central economic cooperatives. Slowly, those who defied these restrictions were arrested by the regime. Hence in October 1973, Cham Muslims in the Eastern Zone of DK demonstrated their displeasure towards the CPK restrictions by beating the drums \u2013 which are traditionally used to inform local of the time for daily prayers \u2013 at the local mosques. This act of communal defiance prompted the blanket arrest of many leaders and religious teachers from the Cham Muslim community <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|url=http://archive.org/details/specterofgenocid00robe|title=The specter of genocide : mass murder in historical perspective|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|date=2003|publisher=New York : Cambridge University Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=260-261}}</ref>.\n\nIn February 1974, the Cham in Region 31, which is in the Western Zone of DK, protested the CPK policy which required the fishermen to register their daily catch with the local cooperative and sell them to the cooperative at a low price. At the same time, the locals were also made to buy those fishes from the cooperative at a higher price. This prompted the locals to confront the cooperative to express their discontent, only to be shot at, \"killing and wounding more than 100,\" as one account put it. By December 1974, a rebellion by the Cham in Region 21 of the Eastern Zone had broken out against the CPK after community leaders were arrested. The rebellion was repressed forcefully by the regime with no records of casualties documented.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nAs much as there are records of these restrictions, resistance, and repressions, there were also accounts from the Cham community which deny the oppression by the regime between 1970 and early 1975. While restrictions on certain activities like trade and travel were in place during that period, they were understood to be by-products of the ongoing civil war. Moreover, some Cham had also joined the revolution as soldiers and members of the CPK. According to some local accounts, people had confidence in the Khmer Rouge when they first came to the village communities who assisted the locals with food and provisions, and there were no bans on local culture or religion; even if restrictions were imposed, the consequences were not harsh.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|url=http://archive.org/details/specterofgenocid00robe|title=The specter of genocide : mass murder in historical perspective|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|date=2003|publisher=New York : Cambridge University Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=262}}</ref> The CPK were considered heroes of the revolution as they struggled for the cause of the peasantry and nation against the United States (Hinton, 2005:58). As the Cham communities were to be found across DK, various Cham communities might have experienced the effects of the CPK pre-1975 differently; some communities experienced the repressions and restrictions while others did not. Only when Pol Pot had consolidated power by the end of 1975 that the prosecutions became more severe and affected all of the Cham people indiscriminately.\n\nThis could well be one of the simpler factors as to why the Cambodian government and the [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal|Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]] (ECCC) do not prosecute the pre-1975 Khmer Rouge perpetrators before Pol Pot consolidated his power. As such, the accounts of those who experienced the repressions prior to 1975 were not considered to be part of the genocide as the case for a systematic annihilation of a people based on ethnic or religious profiling was not concrete enough.\n\nIn 1975, upon the victory of the CPK over the Khmer Republic forces, two brothers of Cham descent who had joined the Khmer Rouge as soldiers returned home to Region 21 within the Kampong Cham province, where the largest Cham Muslim community could be found. The brothers then told their father of the adventures they had experienced being part of the revolution which included killing Khmers and consuming pork, in the hopes of convincing their father to join the communist cause. The father who had remained silent, was clearly not intrigued by the accounts related by his sons. Instead, he grabbed a cleaver, killed his sons, and told his fellow villagers that he had killed the enemy. When the villagers pointed out that he had indeed murdered his own sons, he recounted the stories he was told by his sons earlier, citing the Khmer Rouge\u2019s hatred for Islam and the Cham people. This prompted a unanimous agreement amongst the villagers to kill all Khmer Rouge soldiers within the area on that night. The next morning, more Khmer Rouge forces descended the area with heavy weapons and surrounded the village, killing every single villager in it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|url=http://archive.org/details/specterofgenocid00robe|title=The specter of genocide : mass murder in historical perspective|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|date=2003|publisher=New York : Cambridge University Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=263}}</ref> Similarly in June or July 1975, the CPK authorities in Region 21 of the Eastern Zone tried to confiscate all copies of the Qur'an from the people, while at the same time impose a mandatory short haircut for Cham women. The authorities were met with mass demonstration staged by the local Cham community who were shot at by the regime soldiers. The Cham retaliated forcefully with swords and blades killing a few soldiers, only to be met with military reinforcement from the regime which annihilated the villagers and their properties<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gellately|first=Robert|url=http://archive.org/details/specterofgenocid00robe|title=The specter of genocide : mass murder in historical perspective|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|date=2003|publisher=New York : Cambridge University Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=263-264}}</ref>. In another account by Cham refugees in Malaysia, thirteen leading figures within the Cham Muslim community were killed by the regime in June 1975. The reasons behind the killings was supposedly because some of them were \"leading prayers instead of attending a CPK meeting,\" while the others were purportedly \"petitioning for the permission on marriage ceremonies\" (Kiernan, 2002:263).\n\nEvents went from bad to worse in mid-1976 due to the rebellion, when the ethnic minorities were obliged to pledge loyalty only to the Khmer nationality and religion \u2013 there were to be no other identities besides Khmer. Consequently, the Cham language were not uttered, communal eating where everyone shares the same food became mandatory, forcing the Cham Muslims to raise pigs and consume pork against their religious belief (Kiernan, 2002:269). One explanation for the rise of such rebellions offered by that locals is that some of the Cham were involved in the Khmer Rouge as soldiers who were anticipating positions of power once Pol Pot consolidated power. In 1975, these Cham soldiers were dismissed from the Khmer Rouge forces, deprived from their Islamic practices and robbed of their ethnic identity (Kiernan, 2002:264).\n\nHere, we could point out that the patterns were consistent throughout the killings of the Cham people; first, the dismantling of the communal structure through the murder of the leaders of the Cham Muslim communities, which include the Muftis, Imams, and other learned men of influence; second, the dismantling of the Cham\u2019s Islamic and ethnic identities through the restrictions against distinct practices which distinguished the Cham from the Khmers; third, the dispersal of the Cham from their respective communities, either by forced labour in the fields, or arresting them for alleged plots of resistance or rebellion against the CPK.\n\nDuring the Khmer Rouge era, all religions, including both Buddhism and Islam were persecuted. According to Cham sources, 132 mosques were destroyed during the Khmer Rouge era, many others were desecrated, and Muslims were not allowed to worship. Muslims were forced to eat [[pork]] and were murdered when they refused. Whole Cham villages were exterminated. Chams were not permitted to speak their language. Cham children were taken away from their parents and raised as Khmers.\n\nOrders given by the Khmer Rouge government in 1979 stated: \"The Cham nation no longer exists on Kampuchean soil belonging to the Khmer. Accordingly, Cham nationality, language, customs and religious beliefs must be immediately abolished. Those who fail to obey this order will suffer all the consequences for their acts of opposition to Angkar [the Khmer Rouge high command].\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Le Coz |first1=Clothilde |title=The question of genocide and Cambodia's Muslims |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/question-genocide-cambodia-muslims-151110072431950.html |website=Aljazeera |date=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of Khmer Rouge rule all religions were restored. Vickery believes that about 185,000 Cham lived in Cambodia in the mid-1980s and that the number of mosques was about the same then as it was before 1975. In early 1988, there were six mosques in the Phnom Penh area and a \"good number\" in the provinces, but Muslim dignitaries were thinly stretched; only 20 of the previous 113 most prominent Cham clergy in Cambodia survived the Khmer Rouge period.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perrin |first1=Andrew |title=Weakness in Numbers |url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,428133,00.html |publisher=TIME |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129040814/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,428133,00.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 |date=16 November 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Religious groups====\nUnder the leadership of Pol Pot, who was an ardent [[atheist]],<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.543</ref> the Khmer Rouge had a policy of [[state atheism]].

When it was believed that they could not provide any further useful information, they were blindfolded and sent to the [[Killing Fields]], which were mass graves where prisoners were killed at night with metal tools such as scythes or nails and hammers (since the bullets were too expensive). Oftentimes, their screams were covered with loudspeakers playing propaganda music of Democratic Kampuchea and noise from generator sets.\n[[File:ChoeungEk-Darter-7.jpg|thumb|A [[Chankiri Tree]].

Since 1979, the so-called Pol Pot regime has been equated to Hitler and the Nazis. This is why the word 'genocide' (associated with Nazism) has been used for the first time in a distinctly Communist regime by the invading Vietnamese to distance themselves from a government they had overturned. This 'revisionism' was expressed in several ways. The Khmer Rouge were said to have killed 3.3 million, some 1.3 million more people than they had in fact killed. There was one abominable state prison, S\u201321, now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. In fact, there were more than 150 on the same model, at least one per district.&nbsp;... For the United States in particular, denouncing the crimes of the Khmer Rouge was not at the top of their agenda in the early 1980s. Instead, as in the case of Afghanistan, it was still at times vital to counter what was perceived as the expansionist policies of the Soviets. The USA prioritised its budding friendship with the Democratic Republic of China to counter the 'evil' influence of the USSR in Southeast Asia, acting through its client state, revolutionary Vietnam. All the ASEAN countries shared that vision. So it became vital, with the military and financial help of China, to revive and develop armed resistance to the Vietnamese troops, with the resurrected KR at its core.&nbsp;... [France] was instrumental in forcing the Sihanoukists and the Republicans to form an obscene alliance with its former tormentors, the KR, under the name of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) in 1982.

Rizza.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Giovanni Battista Rizza at work in his home office, in 2003.]]\nGiovanni Battista Rizza has authored 53 research papers and 30 other scientific works, including research announcements, short notes, surveys and reports: he also wrote didactic notes and papers on historical topics, including commemorations of other scientists.<ref>See, for example, {{harv|Rizza|1984}}, {{harv|Rizza|1986}} and {{harv|Rizza|2002}}.</ref> His main fields of research are the [[Hypercomplex analysis|theory of functions on algebras]], the [[Several complex variables|theory of functions of several complex variables]], and [[differential geometry]].\n\n====Theory of functions on algebras====\n\nThe theory of functions on algebras, also referred to as [[hypercomplex analysis]], is the study of [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s whose [[Domain of a function|domain]] is a [[subset]] of an [[algebra over a field|algebra]].<ref>For more information see the survey article by {{harvtxt|Rizza|1973}} and the references cited therein.</ref> The first works of Giovanni Battista Rizza belong to this field of research, and he was awarded the [[Premio Ottorino Pomini]] for his contributions.<ref name=\"Pomini_motivation\" />\n\nHis first main result is the extension of [[Cauchy's integral theorem]] to every [[monogenic function]] {{math|F}} on a general [[algebra over a field|complex algebra]] {{math|'''''A'''''}},<ref>See {{harv|Rizza|1950}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\Gamma_1} \\mathrm{F}(\\mathrm{X}) \\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{X}=0</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u0393{{sub|1}}}} is a [[Cycle (algebraic topology)|1-dimensional cycle]] homologous to zero, and also satisfying other technical conditions.\n\nFew years later, he extended [[Cauchy's integral formula]] to every [[monogenic function]] {{math|F}} on a [[Commutative algebra (structure)|commutative]] [[Normed algebra|normed]] [[algebra over a field|real algebra]] {{math|'''''A'''''{{sup|*}}}},<ref>See

For example, verbs that end with ''-era'' in Swedish are often French loanwords, where the French word ends with a stressed ''-er''. The Swedish word gets its stress point at the same place, but this is not true in English. A native Swedish speaker might mispronounce ''generate'' as {{IPA-endia|d\u0292\u025bn\u0259\u02c8\u0279e\u026at|}}  by following the pattern of the Swedish {{lang|sv|generera}} {{IPA-sv|j\u025bn\u025b\u02c8r\u011b\u02d0ra|}}.\n\nSwedish is a [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] language.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Niemeyer|first=T\u00fcbingen|title=Phonology and Morphology of the Germanic Languages|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Accent 1 is a low-high-low contour and accent 2 is an high-low-high-low contour, with the second peak in the second syllable.<ref name=\":0\" /> This can give Swenglish speakers a \"singing\" quality to their speech. Particularly when exaggerating their Swedish accent in English, speakers add an extra cadence to their words that most native English speakers lack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrzwpZfONXY|title=Alexander Skarsgard Swedish Accent on Jimmy Fallon|last=Skarsgard|first=Alex|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=13 July 2012|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSwedish lacks many common English [[phonemes]]. These are sometimes replaced by similar-sounding Swedish phonemes, or other English phonemes that are easier to pronounce. For example, when using the nearest Swedish vowels for the English words ''[[beer]]'' and ''[[bear]]'', a native Swedish speaker might pronounce both as {{IPA-sv|be\u02d0r|}}.

For example, verbs that end with ''-era'' in Swedish are often French loanwords, where the French word ends with a stressed ''-er''. The Swedish word gets its stress point at the same place, but this is not true in English. A native Swedish speaker might mispronounce ''generate'' as {{IPA-endia|d\u0292\u025bn\u0259\u02c8\u0279e\u026at|}}  by following the pattern of the Swedish {{lang|sv|generera}} {{IPA-sv|j\u025bn\u025b\u02c8r\u011b\u02d0ra|}}.\n\nSwedish is a [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] language.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Niemeyer|first=T\u00fcbingen|title=Phonology and Morphology of the Germanic Languages|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Accent 1 is a low-high-low contour and accent 2 is an high-low-high-low contour, with the second peak in the second syllable.<ref name=\":0\" /> This gives Swenglish speakers a \"singing\" quality to their speech.

These are sometimes replaced by similar-sounding Swedish phonemes, or other English phonemes that are easier to pronounce. For example, when using the nearest Swedish vowels for the English words ''[[beer]]'' and ''[[bear]]'', a native Swedish speaker might pronounce both as {{IPA-sv|be\u02d0r|}}.

Never before had two Great Powers like Germany and Austria found themselves so much at the mercy of the military resources of a country which had scarcely one twentieth of the population of the two great states. Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years. Thus everything seemed to depend on whether Rumania was ready to make any sort of use of her momentary advantage.|author=Paul von Hindenburg|source=''Out of My Life''<ref>Paul von Hindenburg, Out of My Life, Vol. I, trans.

On September 15, [[Paul von Hindenburg]] issued the following order, stating that: \"The main task of the Armies is now to hold fast all positions on the Western, Eastern, Italian and Macedonian Fronts, and to employ all other available forces against Rumania.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Gilbert, Martin|title=The First World War: A Complete History|year=1994|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|page=287}}</ref> Fortunately for the Central Powers, the quantity and quality of the Romanian Army was overestimated. Although numbering half a million men, the Romanian Army suffered from poor training and a lack of appropriate equipment.\n\nThe initial success of the Romanian Army in Austria-Hungarian territory was quickly undermined by the Central Powers. German and Austro-Hungarian troops advanced from the north, while Bulgarian-Turkish-German forces marched into Romania from the south. Although thought to be a tactical blunder by contemporaries, the Romanians opted to mount operations in both directions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosier, John|title=The Myth of the Great War|year=2002|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|page=259}}</ref> By the middle of November the German force passed through the Carpathians, suffering significant casualties due to determined Romanian resistance. By December 5, Bulgarian troops had crossed the Danube and were approaching the capital, [[Bucharest]].

They received help from the Allies, notably from France which sent a [[French military mission to Romania (1916-1918)|military mission]] of more than a thousand officers, health and support staff.\n\n=== Aftermath of 1916 ===\nBy January 1917, the ranks of the Romanian army had been significantly thinned. Roughly 150,000 Romanian soldiers had been taken prisoner, 200,000 men were dead or wounded, and lost two thirds of their country, including the capital.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosier, John|title=The Myth of the Great War|year=2002|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|page=260}}</ref> Importantly, the [[Ploie\u0219ti]] oilfields, the only significant source of oil in Europe west of the Black Sea, had been destroyed before they were abandoned to the Central Powers.\n\n== 1917 ==\n[[File:Eastern Front As of 1917.jpg|thumb|Eastern Front as of 1917]]\n\n=== Russia \u2013 the February Revolution ===\nThe Russian [[February Revolution]] aimed to topple the Russian monarchy and resulted in the creation of the Provisional Government. The revolution was a turning point in Russian history, and its significance and influence can still be felt in many countries today.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=79}} Although many Russians wanted a revolution, no one had expected it to happen when it did \u2013 let alone how it did.\n\nOn International Women's Day, Thursday, February 23, 1917/March 8, 1917, as many as 90,000 female workers in the city of Petrograd left their factory jobs and marched through the streets, shouting \"Bread\", \"Down with the autocracy!\" and \"Stop the War!\" These women were tired, hungry, and angry,{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=84}} after working long hours in miserable conditions to feed their families because their menfolk were fighting at the front. They were not alone in demanding change; more than 150,000 men and women took to the streets to protest the next day.\n\nBy Saturday, February 25, the city of Petrograd was essentially shut down. No one was allowed to work or wanted to work.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=87}} Even though there were a few incidents of police and soldiers firing into the crowds, those groups soon mutinied and joined the protesters.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=86}} Tsar Nicholas II, who was not in Petrograd during the revolution, heard reports of the protests but chose not to take them seriously. By March 1, it was obvious to everyone except the czar himself, that his rule was over. On March 2 it was made official.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=88}}\n\n=== Romania \u2013 the Summer Campaign and aftermath ===\nIn early July 1917, on the [[Romania during World War I#1917 campaign and armistice|Romanian front]], a relatively small area, there was one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries, whose effectives numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate [[Military reserve|reserve]]. The three great battles, decisive for the Romanian nation's destiny, delivered at [[R\u0103coasa|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Oituz]] represented a turning point in the [[World War I|world war]] on the Eastern front. These battles, named by the localities and zones where they took place, were fought approximately on the front alignment stabilized in early 1917, which the conflicting sides had thoroughly consolidated for half a year.<ref name=\"Romania834\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 834</ref>\n\nBetween late July and early September, the Romanian Army fought the battles of [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Second Battle of Oituz|Oituz]], managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance, inflicting heavy losses in the process and winning the most important Allied victories on the Eastern Front in 1917.\n\nAs a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting ''[[The Times]]'' to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\".\n\nOn May 7, 1918, in light of the existing politico-military situation, Romania was forced to conclude the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] with the Central Powers, imposing harsh conditions on the country but recognizing its [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with Bessarabia]]. [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] became the new German-sponsored Prime Minister. King Ferdinand, however, refused to sign the treaty.\n\nThe Germans were able to repair the oil fields around [[Ploie\u0219ti]] and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.<ref>John Keegan, ''World War I'', pg. 308</ref>\n\n=== Russia \u2013 the October Revolution ===\n{{Main|October Revolution}}\n\nBy September 1917, just months after the February Revolution, Lenin believed the Russian people were ready for another revolution, this time on Marxist principles.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=89}} On October 10, at a secret meeting of the Bolshevik party leaders, Lenin used all his power to convince the others that it was time for armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=92}}\n\nPetrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup d'\u00e9tat.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=94}} On October 24, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of November 7, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace. After an almost bloodless coup, the Bolsheviks were the new leaders of Russia.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=94}} Lenin announced that the new regime would end the war, abolish all private land ownership, and create a system for workers' control over the factories.\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n== 1918 ==\n[[File:Map Treaty of Brest-Litovsk-en.jpg|thumb|Territory lost by Russia under the 1918 [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ]]\n\n{{Main|Operation Faustschlag}}\n{{See also|Russian Civil War|Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War}}\n\nOn 7 November 1917, the Communist [[Bolsheviks]] took power under their leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Lenin's new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a [[Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers|ceasefire being declared on 15 December 1917]] along lines agreed in November. At the same time Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]] and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between Soviets and Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on 17 February 1918. At the same time the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces. {{Sfn|Kowalski|1997|p=115}} The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events during 1917, many groups opposed to Lenin's Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]]. Finland declared itself independent 6 December 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later.\nThe Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic, and was aided by Russian forces still in Finland.\nThe Whites of Finland were led by General Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsars service since he was 15 years old.\nThe Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by the German General Goltz. Though Mannerheim never accepted the offer, the German corps landed in Finland in April 1918.\n\n=== Formation of the Red Army ===\nAfter the disintegration of the Russian imperial army and navy in 1917, the Council of People's Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army. By a decree on 28 January 1918 the council created the Workers' and Peoples' Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on 22 April, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. While the majority of the army was made up of workers and peasants, many of the Red Army's officers had served a similar function in the imperial army before its collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Army|title=Red Army - Soviet history|website=britannica.com|access-date=22 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629212429/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Army|archive-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) ===\nWith the German Army just {{convert|85|mi}} from the Russian capital [[Petrograd]] (St. Petersburg) on 3 March 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone. While the treaty was practically obsolete before the end of the year, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, who were embroiled in a civil war, and affirmed the independence of [[Ukraine]]. However, [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] were intended to become a [[United Baltic Duchy]] to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser. [[Finland]]'s sovereignty had already been declared in December 1917, and accepted by most nations, including France and the Soviet Union, but not by the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Armistice  ==\n\nWith the end of the Eastern Front, the Germans were able to transfer substantial forces to the west in order to mount an [[Spring Offensive|offensive in France]] in the spring of 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThis offensive on the Western Front failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the arrival of more and more [[American Expeditionary Force|American units]] in Europe was sufficient to offset the German advantage. Even after the Russian collapse, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until the end of the war, attempting to run a short-lived addition to the German Empire in Europe. In the end, Germany and Austria lost all their captured lands, and more, under various treaties (such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]]) signed after the armistice in 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n== Role of women on the Eastern Front ==\n[[File:EcaterinaTeodoroiu.jpg|thumb|2nd Lt. [[Ecaterina Teodoroiu]], killed in action at [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] in 1917, regarded as a national heroine in Romania]]\n{{see also|Capture and escape of Ecaterina Teodoroiu}}\n{{globalize|section|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn comparison to the attention directed to the role played by women on the Western Front during the First World War, the role of women in the east has garnered limited scholarly focus. It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women's share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman |first=W. Z.|title=Women at the Gates: Gender and Industry in Stalin's Russia|year=2002|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nWomen also fought on the Eastern Front. In the later stages of Russia's participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the [[Women's Battalion]]s, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women's willingness to fight. In Romania, [[Ecaterina Teodoroiu]] actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero.\n\nBritish nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the \"Gray partridges\" in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of [[Elsie Inglis]]. In addition to nursing injured personnel, Scottish nurses manned transport vehicles and acted as regimental cooks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coroban |first=Costel|title=Potarnichile gri.

During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many [[POWs]] were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor.<ref name=\"Project Muse\">{{cite journal|last=Gatrell|first=Peter|title=Prisoners of War on the Eastern Front during World War I|journal=Kritika|year=2005|volume=6|issue=3|pages=557\u2013566|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/kritika/v006/6.3gatrell.html|accessdate=March 18, 2014|doi=10.1353/kri.2005.0036}}</ref> Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government's inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others.<ref name=\"Project Muse\" />\n\n== Disease on the Eastern Front ==\nDisease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=22}} Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhus fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions, along with general lack of knowledge about proper medical care was evident in the German occupied [[Ober Ost]].{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}}\n\nUltimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named ''Sanitit\u00e4tswesen'' (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhus fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A \"sanitary police\" was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}} Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection.\n\nTo avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}} Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of [[Kowno]] emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}}\n\n== Casualties ==\n{{Details|topic=Russian losses|World War I casualties#endnote Russia}}\nThe Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics.\n\nCornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of ''over 1,500,000'' is not unlikely. He has over five million men ''passing into captivity'', the majority during 1915.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cornish | first = Nik | title = The Russian Army and the First World War | publisher = Tempus | location = Stroud | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-86227-288-3|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Russian_Army_and_the_First_World_War.html?id=BeVmAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nWhen Russia withdrew from the war, 2,500,000 Russian POWs were in German and Austrian hands. This by far exceeded the total number of prisoners of war (1,880,000) lost by the armies of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], France and Germany combined. Only the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], with 2,200,000 POWs, came even close.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/greatwar/resources/casdeath_pop.html |title=WWI Casualties and Deaths |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=2014-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003230916/https://www.pbs.org/greatwar/resources/casdeath_pop.html |archive-date=2016-10-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Territorial changes ==\n{{See also|Austria-Hungary#Territorial legacy}}\n\n=== Austria ===\nThe empire of Austria lost approximately 60% of its territory as a result of the war, and evolved into a smaller state with a small homogeneous population of 6.5 million people. With the loss Vienna was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. The states that were formed around Austria feared the return of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and put measures into place to prevent it from re-forming.<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n=== Czechoslovakia ===\n[[Czechoslovakia]] was created through the merging of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, previously under Austrian rule, united with Slovakia and Ruthenia, which were part of Hungary. Although these groups had many differences between them, they believed that together they would create a stronger state.\nThe new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and [[Rusyns]] (4%), with other ethnic groups making up 2%.<ref>\"The War of the World\", Niall Ferguson Allen Lane 2006.</ref> Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles<ref name=\"pp\">{{cite web |url=http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php |title=Playing the blame game |accessdate=2008-06-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630084718/http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php |archivedate=June 30, 2008 }}, ''[[Prague Post]]'', 6 July 2005</ref> and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups.\nThe state proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see [[Czechoslovakism]]), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the [[Czechs]] and the [[Slovaks]] surfaced again.\n\n=== Hungary ===\nAfter the war Hungary was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The loss of territory was similar to that of Austria after the breaking up the Austria-Hungary territory. They lost the territories of Transylvania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slavonia, [[Syrmia]], and [[Banat]].<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n=== Italy ===\nItaly incorporated the regions of Trieste and South Tyrol from Austria.\n\n=== Poland ===\nThe creation of a free and Independent Poland was one of [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's fourteen points]]. At the end of the 18th century the state of Poland was broken apart by Prussia, Russia, and Austria. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], the [[Commission on Polish Affairs]] was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would cut off 1.5 million Germans in East Prussia from the rest of Germany. Poland also received Upper Silesia. British [[Foreign Office|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] proposed [[Curzon Line|Poland's eastern border with Russia]].

As a result of the Paris peace conference Romania kept the [[Dobrudja]] and Transylvania. Between the states of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania an alliance named the [[Little Entente]] was formed. They worked together on matters of foreign policy in order to prevent a Habsburg restoration.<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\nInitially [[Yugoslavia]] began as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State secured its territory at the Paris peace talks after the end of the war.

It stretched from the [[Baltic Sea]] in the north to the [[Black Sea]] in the south, involved  most of [[Eastern Europe]] and stretched deep into [[Central Europe]] as well. The term contrasts with \"[[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]\", which was being fought in [[Belgium]] and [[French Third Republic|France]].\n\nDuring 1910, Russian General [[Yuri Danilov]] developed \"Plan 19\" under which four armies would invade [[East Prussia]]. This plan was criticised as Austria-Hungary could be a greater threat than the German Empire. So instead of four armies invading East Prussia, the Russians planned to send two armies to East Prussia, and two armies to defend against Austro-Hungarian forces invading from [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]. In the opening months of the war, the [[Imperial Russian Army]] attempted an [[Russian invasion of East Prussia (1914)|invasion]] of eastern Prussia in the [[Northwestern Front (Russian Empire)|northwestern theater]], only to be [[Battle of Tannenberg|beaten back]] by the Germans after some [[Battle of Gumbinnen|initial success]].

The Entente promised the region of [[Transylvania]] (which was part of Austria-Hungary) in return for Romanian support. The Romanian Army [[Battle of Transylvania|invaded Transylvania]] and had initial successes, but was forced to stop and was pushed back by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians when Bulgaria attacked them in the south. Meanwhile, a [[February Revolution|revolution]] occurred in Russia in February 1917 (one of the several causes being the hardships of the war). Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and a [[Russian Provisional Government]] was founded, with [[Georgy Lvov]] as its first leader, who was eventually replaced by [[Alexander Kerensky]].\n\nThe newly formed [[Russian Republic]] continued to fight the war alongside Romania and the rest of the Entente until it was [[October Revolution|overthrown]] by the [[Bolsheviks]] in October 1917. Kerensky oversaw the [[Kerensky Offensive|July Offensive]], which was largely a failure and caused a collapse in the Russian Army. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|new government]] established by the Bolsheviks signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with the Central Powers, taking it out of the war and making large territorial concessions. Romania was also forced to surrender and signed a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|similar treaty]], though both of the treaties were nullified with the surrender of the Central Powers in November 1918.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe front in the east was much longer than that in the west. The theater of war was roughly delimited by the [[Baltic Sea]] in the west and [[Minsk]] in the east, and [[Saint Petersburg]] in the north and the [[Black Sea]] in the south, a distance of more than {{convert|1600|km|mi}}. This had a drastic effect on the nature of the warfare.\n[[File:Timeline of WWI Eastern Front.jpg|thumb|580px|A timeline of events on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern]] and [[Middle-Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle-Eastern]] theatres of World War I]]\n\nWhile the war on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] developed into [[trench warfare]], the battle lines on the Eastern Front were much more fluid and trenches never truly developed. This was because the greater length of the front ensured that the density of soldiers in the line was lower so the line was easier to break. Once broken, the sparse communication networks made it difficult for the defender to rush reinforcements to the rupture in the line, mounting rapid counteroffensives to seal off any breakthrough.\n\n== Propaganda ==\nPropaganda was a key component of the culture of World War I. It was most commonly deployed through the state-controlled media to glorify the homeland and demonize the enemy. Propaganda often took the form of images which portrayed stereotypes from folklore about the enemy or from glorified moments from the nation's history. On the Eastern Front, propaganda took many forms such as opera, film, spy fiction, theater, spectacle, war novels and graphic art. Across the Eastern Front the amount of propaganda used in each country varied from state to state. Propaganda took many forms within each country and was distributed by many different groups. Most commonly the state produced propaganda, but other groups, such as anti-war organizations, also generated propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Roshwald|editor1-first=Aviel|editor2-last=Stites|editor2-first=Richard|title=European Culture in the Great War:The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda 1914\u20131918|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uteV3ytfmqQC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=European+Culture+in+the+Great+War#v=onepage&q=European%20Culture%20in%20the%20Great%20War&f=false|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|pages=6,349\u2013358|isbn=978-0-521-01324-6}}</ref>\n\n== Initial situation in belligerent countries ==\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|German entry into World War I}}\nPrior to the outbreak of war, German strategy was based almost entirely on the so-called [[Schlieffen Plan]]. With the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Franco-Russian Agreement]] in place, Germany knew that war with either of these combatants would result in war with the other, which meant that there would be war in both the west and the east. Therefore, the German General Staff, under Alfred von Schlieffen and then [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]], planned a quick, all-out ground war on the Western Front to take France and, upon victory, Germany would turn its attention to Russia in the east.\n\nSchlieffen believed Russia would not be ready or willing to move against and attack Germany due to the huge losses of military equipment that Russia had suffered in the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1904\u20131905, its low population density and lack of railroads.\n\nConversely, the German Navy believed it could be victorious over Britain with Russian neutrality, something which Moltke knew would not be possible.\n\n=== Romania ===\n[[File:Greater Rumania, New York Times, 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Border changes in favor of Romania as stipulated in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|Treaty of Bucharest]]]]\nIn the immediate years preceding the [[First World War]], the Kingdom of Romania was involved in the [[Second Balkan War]] on the side of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria. The [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], signed on August 10, 1913, ended the Balkan conflict and added 6,960 square kilometers to Romania's territory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller, William|title=The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro|year=1922|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Ltd|location=London|page=474}}</ref> Although militarized, Romania decided upon a policy of neutrality at the start of the First World War, mainly due to having territorial interests in both Austria-Hungary ([[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]]) and in Russia ([[Bessarabia]]). Strong cultural influences also affected Romanian leanings, however. King [[Carol I]], as a [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], favoured his Germanic roots, while the Romanian people, influenced by their Orthodox church and Latin-based language, were inclined to join France. Perhaps King Carol's attempts at joining the war on the side of the Central powers would have been fruitful had he not died in 1914, but Romanian disenchantment with Austria-Hungary had already influenced public and political opinion. French endorsement of Romanian action against Bulgaria, and support of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was particularly effective at inclining Romania towards the Entente. Furthermore, Russian courting of Romanian sympathies, exemplified by the visit of the Tsar to [[Constan\u021ba]] on June 14, 1914, signaled in a new era of positive relations between the two countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hitchins, Keith|title=Rumania:1866\u20131947|year=1994|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=153\u20134}}</ref> Nevertheless, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] of Romania maintained a policy of neutrality, intending to gain the most for Romania by negotiating between competing powers. The result of the negotiations with the Entente was the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)]], which stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in [[Austria-Hungary]]: Transylvania, [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Maramure\u0219 (historical region)|Maramure\u0219]], the whole [[Banat]] and most of Bukovina. According to historian John Keegan, these enticements offered by the Allies were never concrete, for in secret, Russia and France agreed not to honor any conventions when the end of the war came.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keegan, John|title=the First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|pages=306}}</ref>\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Russian entry into World War I}}\nThe immediate reason for Russia's involvement in the First World War was a direct result of the decisions made by the statesmen and generals during July 1914. The [[July crisis]] was the culmination of a series of diplomatic conflicts that took place in the decades prior to 1914, and this is fundamental to an understanding of Russia's position immediately prior to the War. According to [[Dominic Lieven|D. C. Lieven]], Russia was formidable and was able to back up her diplomatic policies with force. One of the most significant factors in bringing Russia to the brink of war was the downfall of her economy.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=5}} The 20 percent jump in defense expenditure during 1866\u201377 and in 1871-5 forced them to change their position within Europe and shift the balance of power out of her favour.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=8}} At the time, Russian infrastructure was backward and the Russian government had to invest far more than its European rivals in structural changes. In addition there were overwhelming burdens of defense, which would ultimately result in an economic downfall for the Russians. This was a major strain on the Russian population, but also served as a direct threat to military expenditure.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=27}} Thus the only way the Russians could sustain the strains of European war would be to place more emphasis on foreign investment from the French who essentially came to Russia's aid for industrial change.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=28}} The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] allowed for the Russian defense to grow and aid the European balance of power during the growth of the German Empire's might. Nevertheless, one of the key factors was that of the Russian foreign policy between 1890 and 1914.\n\n==== Russian propaganda ====\n[[File:\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b.jpg|thumb|upright|World War I caricature from Russia depicting [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] and [[Mehmed V]].

Their main aim was to help overcome the legend of the \"invincible\" German war machine, in order to boost the morale of civilians and soldiers. Russian propaganda often took the form of showing the Germans as a civilized nation, with barbaric \"inhuman\" traits. Russian propaganda also exploited the image of the Russian [[POW]]s who were in the German camps, again in order to boost the morale of their troops, serving as encouragement to defeat the enemy and to get their fellow soldiers out of the \"inhuman\" German POW camps.<ref name=\"oxana475\">{{cite journal|last=Oxana Nagornaja|first=Jeffrey Mankoff|title=United by Barbed Wire: Russian POWs in Germany, National Stereotypes, and International Relations|journal=Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History|year=2009|volume=10|issue=3|pages=475\u2013498|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/kritika/v010/10.3.nagornaja.html|accessdate=February 14, 2014|doi=10.1353/kri.0.0111|last2=Jeffrey Mankoff}}</ref>\n\nAn element of the Russian propaganda was the Investigate Commission formed in April 1915.

This commission published photographs of letters that were allegedly found on fallen German soldiers.

Approximately a month later, on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This act led to a series of events that would quickly expand into the First World War; thus, the Habsburg government in Vienna initiated the pivotal decision that would begin the conflict.<ref name=\"Williamson 1991 1\" />\n\nThe causes of the Great War have generally been defined in diplomatic terms, but certain deep-seated issues in Austria-Hungary undoubtedly contributed to the beginnings of the First World War.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason|first=John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=61}}</ref> The Austro-Hungarian situation in the Balkans pre-1914 is a primary factor in its involvement in the war. The [[Pan-Slavism|movement towards South Slav unity]] was a major problem for the Habsburg Empire, which was facing increasing nationalist pressure from its multinational populace. As Europe's third largest state, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was hardly homogeneous; comprising over fifty million people and eleven nationalities, the Empire was a conglomeration of a number of diverse cultures, languages, and peoples.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mamatey|first=Albert|title=The Situation in Austria-Hungary|journal=The Journal of Race Development|year=1915|volume=6|issue=2|page=204}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, the South Slavic people of Austria-Hungary desired to amalgamate with Serbia in an effort to officially solidify their shared cultural heritage. Over seven million South Slavs lived inside the Empire, while three million lived outside it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason|first=John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=67}}</ref> With the growing emergence of nationalism in the twentieth century, unity of all South Slavs looked promising. This tension is exemplified by [[Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]]'s letter to Franz Ferdinand:\n\n<blockquote>The unification of the South Slav race is one of the powerful national movements which can neither be ignored nor kept down. The question can only be, whether unification will take place within the boundaries of the Monarchy \u2013 that is at the expense of Serbia's independence \u2013 or under Serbia's leadership at the expense of the Monarchy. The cost to the Monarchy would be the loss of its South Slav provinces and thus of almost its entire coastline. The loss of territory and prestige would relegate the Monarchy to the status of a small power.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason, John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=67}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Bosnian crisis|annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] in 1908 by Austrian foreign minister Baron von Aehrenthal in an effort to assert domination over the Balkans inflamed Slavic nationalism and angered Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a \"rallying cry\" for South Slavs, with hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia steadily increasing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Samuel R.|title=Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War|year=1991|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|page=72}}</ref> The situation was ripe for conflict, and when the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian imperial heir, Franz Ferdinand, these longstanding hostilities culminated into an all-out war.\n\nThe Allied Powers wholeheartedly supported the Slavs' nationalistic fight. George Macaulay Trevelyan, a British historian, saw Serbia's war against Austria-Hungary as a \"war of liberation\" that would \"free South Slavs from tyranny.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trevelyan|first=George Macaulay|title=Austria-Hungary and Serbia|journal=The North American Review|date=June 1915|volume=201|issue=715|page=860}}</ref> In his own words: \"If ever there was a battle for freedom, there is such a battle now going on in Southeastern Europe against Austrian and Magyar.

The triumphs of Britain and Germany in the martial, diplomatic and economic spheres put these countries in the front rank of the world's leading nations.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=35}} This was a source of national pride, self-confidence and unity. It helped reconcile the worker to the state and the Bavarian or Scotsman to rule from Berlin or London.\nIn the years prior to 1914, Austro-Russian co-operation was both crucial for European peace and difficult to maintain. Old suspicions exacerbated by the [[Bosnian crisis]] stood in the way of agreement between the two empires, as did ethnic sensitivities. Russia's historical role as liberator of the Balkans was difficult to square with Austria's determination to control adjacent territories. {{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=39}} In 1913\u20131914 Saint Petersburg was too concerned with its own weakness and what it saw as threats to vital Russian interests, to spare much thought for Vienna's feelings. The Russians were, with some justice, indignant that the concessions they had made after the First [[Balkan War]] in the interest of European peace had not been reciprocated by the Central Powers.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=42}}\n\nThis was doubly dangerous given the growing evidence flowing into Petersburg about Germany's aggressive intentions. Both Bazarov and the agents of the Russian secret political police in Germany reported the concern aroused in public opinion by the press war against Russia, which raged in the spring of 1914.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=49}}\n\nThe Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men prior to the war. They could also mobilize up to 5 million men, but only had 4.6 million rifles to give them.

At the end of 1914, the main focus of the fighting shifted to central part of [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]], west of the river [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Dupuy|Onacewicz|1967|p=31}} The October [[Battle of the Vistula River]] and the November [[Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1914)|Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] brought little advancement for the Germans, but at least kept the Russians at a safe distance.{{sfn|Dupuy|Onacewicz|1967|p=3}}\n\nThe Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies continued to clash in and near the [[Carpathian Mountains]] throughout the winter of 1914\u20131915.

They made some progress, crossing the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in February and March 1915, but then the German relief helped the Austrians stop further Russian advances. In the meantime, Przemysl was almost entirely destroyed and the [[Siege of Przemysl]] ended in a defeat for the Austrians.{{sfn|Dupuy|Onacewicz|1967|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n== 1915 ==\n[[File:Russian Troops NGM-v31-p372.jpg|thumb|Russian troops going to the front: Support for the imperial guard being hurried into the fighting line]]\n\nIn 1915 the German command decided to make its main effort on the Eastern Front, and accordingly transferred considerable forces there. To eliminate the Russian threat the [[Central Powers]] began the campaign season of 1915 with the successful [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive]] in Galicia in May 1915.\n\nAfter the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]], the German and Austro-Hungarian troops in the Eastern Front functioned under a unified command. The offensive soon turned into a general advance and a [[Great Retreat (Russian)|corresponding strategic retreat]] by the Russian Army. The cause of the reverses suffered by the Russian Army was not so much errors in the tactical sphere, as the deficiency in technical equipment, particularly in artillery and ammunition as well as the corruption and incompetence of the Russian officers. Only by 1916 did the buildup of Russian war industries increase production of war material and improve the supply situation.\n\nBy mid-1915, the Russians had been expelled from [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] and hence pushed hundreds of kilometers away from the borders of the Central Powers, removing the threat of Russian invasion of Germany or Austria-Hungary. At the end of 1915 German-Austrian advance was stopped on the line [[Riga]]\u2013[[J\u0113kabpils|Jakobstadt]]\u2013[[D\u00fcnaburg]]\u2013[[Baranovichi]]\u2013[[Pinsk]]\u2013[[Dubno]]\u2013[[Ternopil]].

The Turks were concerned with reorganizing their army and committing the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 38\">{{cite book|last=Jukes, Geoffrey|title=Essential Histories: The First World War, The Eastern Front 1914\u20131918|year=2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|page=38}}</ref> Meanwhile, Russia was preoccupied with other armies on the Eastern Front. However, the appointment of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]] as Viceroy and Commander in the Caucasus in September 1915 revived the situation of the Russo-Turkish front.\n\nWhen the Allies withdrew from Gallipoli in December, the Caucasus Army's Chief of Staff General [[Nikolai Yudenich]] believed Turkish forces would take action against his army. This concern was legitimate: Bulgaria's entry into the war as Germany's ally in October caused serious alarm, as a land route from Germany to Turkey was now open and would allow for an unrestricted flow of German weapons to the Turks.<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 38\" /> A \"window of opportunity\" appeared that would allow the Russians to destroy the Turkish Third Army, as the British required assistance in Mesopotamia (now modern day Iraq). Britain's efforts to besiege Baghdad had been halted at Ctesiphon, and they were forced to retreat. This led to an increasing number of attacks by Turkish forces. The British requested the Russians to attack in an attempt to distract the Turks, and Yudenich agreed. [[Erzurum Offensive|The resulting offensive]] began on January 10, 1916.<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 39\">{{cite book|last=Jukes, Geoffrey|title=Essential Histories: The First World War, The Eastern Front 1914\u20131918|year=2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|page=39}}</ref>\n\nThis offensive was unanticipated by the Turks, as it was in the middle of winter. The Turkish situation was exacerbated by the Third Army's commander Kamil Pasha and Chief of Staff Major Guse absence. Coupled with an imbalance of forces \u2013 the Russians had 325 000 troops, while the Turks only 78 000 \u2013 the situation appeared grim for the Central Powers.<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 39\" /> After three months of fighting, the Russians captured the city of [[Trabzon]] on April 18, 1916.\n\n== 1916 ==\nAllied operations in 1916 were dictated by an urgent need to force Germany to transfer forces from its Western to Eastern fronts, to relieve the pressure on the French at the [[Battle of Verdun]]. This was to be accomplished by a series of Russian offensives which would force the Germans to deploy additional forces to counter them. The first such operation was the [[Lake Naroch Offensive]] in March\u2013April 1916, which ended in failure.\n\n=== Brusilov Offensive ===\n{{See also|Brusilov Offensive}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1916-8.jpg|thumb|Brusilov Offensive]]\nThe Italian operations during 1916 had one extraordinarily positive result: Austrian divisions were pulled away from the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces to organize a counter-offensive. The Brusilov Offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General [[Aleksei Brusilov]] believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close attention was paid to preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere seventy-five yard away from Austrian trenches.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keegan, John|title=The First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|pages=303\u20134}}</ref>\n\nBrusilov's plan worked impeccably. The Russians outnumbered the Austrians 200,000 to 150,000, and held a considerable advantage in guns, with 904 large guns to 600. Most importantly innovative new tactics similar to those independently invented by [[Erwin Rommel]] were used to perform quick and effective close-range surprise attacks that allowed a steady advance.<ref name=\"Keegan, John 1998 304\">{{cite book|last=Keegan |first=John|title=The First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|page=304}}</ref> The Russian Eighth Army overwhelmed the Austrian Fourth and pushed on to Lutsk, advancing forty miles beyond the starting position.

By March 1, it was obvious to everyone except the czar himself, that his rule was over. On March 2 it was made official.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=88}}\n\n=== Romania \u2013 the Summer Campaign and aftermath ===\nIn early July 1917, on the [[Romania during World War I#1917 campaign and armistice|Romanian front]], a relatively small area, there was one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries, whose effectives numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate [[Military reserve|reserve]]. The three great battles, decisive for the Romanian nation's destiny, delivered at [[R\u0103coasa|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Oituz]] represented a turning point in the [[World War I|world war]] on the Eastern front. These battles, named by the localities and zones where they took place, were fought approximately on the front alignment stabilized in early 1917, which the conflicting sides had thoroughly consolidated for half a year.<ref name=\"Romania834\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 834</ref>\n\nBetween late July and early September, the Romanian Army fought the battles of [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Second Battle of Oituz|Oituz]], managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance, inflicting heavy losses in the process and winning the most important Allied victories on the Eastern Front in 1917.\n\nAs a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting ''[[The Times]]'' to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\".\n\nOn May 7, 1918, in light of the existing politico-military situation, Romania was forced to conclude the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] with the Central Powers, imposing harsh conditions on the country but recognizing its [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with Bessarabia]]. [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] became the new German-sponsored Prime Minister. King Ferdinand, however, refused to sign the treaty.\n\nThe Germans were able to repair the oil fields around [[Ploie\u0219ti]] and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.<ref>John Keegan, ''World War I'', pg. 308</ref>\n\n=== Russia \u2013 the October Revolution ===\n{{Main|October Revolution}}\n\nBy September 1917, just months after the February Revolution, Lenin believed the Russian people were ready for another revolution, this time on Marxist principles.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=89}} On October 10, at a secret meeting of the Bolshevik party leaders, Lenin used all his power to convince the others that it was time for armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=92}}\n\nPetrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup d'\u00e9tat.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=94}} On October 24, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of November 7, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace. After an almost bloodless coup, the Bolsheviks were the new leaders of Russia.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=94}} Lenin announced that the new regime would end the war, abolish all private land ownership, and create a system for workers' control over the factories.\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n== 1918 ==\n[[File:Map Treaty of Brest-Litovsk-en.jpg|thumb|Territory lost by Russia under the 1918 [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ]]\n\n{{Main|Operation Faustschlag}}\n{{See also|Russian Civil War|Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War}}\n\nOn 7 November 1917, the Communist [[Bolsheviks]] took power under their leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Lenin's new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a [[Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers|ceasefire being declared on 15 December 1917]] along lines agreed in November. At the same time Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]] and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between Soviets and Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on 17 February 1918. At the same time the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces. {{Sfn|Kowalski|1997|p=115}} The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events during 1917, many groups opposed to Lenin's Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]]. Finland declared itself independent 6 December 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later.\nThe Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic, and was aided by Russian forces still in Finland.\nThe Whites of Finland were led by General Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsars service since he was 15 years old.\nThe Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by the German General Goltz. Though Mannerheim never accepted the offer, the German corps landed in Finland in April 1918.\n\n=== Formation of the Red Army ===\nAfter the disintegration of the Russian imperial army and navy in 1917, the Council of People's Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army. By a decree on 28 January 1918 the council created the Workers' and Peoples' Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on 22 April, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. While the majority of the army was made up of workers and peasants, many of the Red Army's officers had served a similar function in the imperial army before its collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Army|title=Red Army - Soviet history|website=britannica.com|access-date=22 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629212429/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Army|archive-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) ===\nWith the German Army just {{convert|85|mi}} from the Russian capital [[Petrograd]] (St. Petersburg) on 3 March 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone. While the treaty was practically obsolete before the end of the year, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, who were embroiled in a civil war, and affirmed the independence of [[Ukraine]]. However, [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] were intended to become a [[United Baltic Duchy]] to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser. [[Finland]]'s sovereignty had already been declared in December 1917, and accepted by most nations, including France and the Soviet Union, but not by the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Armistice  ==\n\nWith the end of the Eastern Front, the Germans were able to transfer substantial forces to the west in order to mount an [[Spring Offensive|offensive in France]] in the spring of 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThis offensive on the Western Front failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the arrival of more and more [[American Expeditionary Force|American units]] in Europe was sufficient to offset the German advantage. Even after the Russian collapse, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until the end of the war, attempting to run a short-lived addition to the German Empire in Europe. In the end, Germany and Austria lost all their captured lands, and more, under various treaties (such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]]) signed after the armistice in 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n== Role of women on the Eastern Front ==\n[[File:EcaterinaTeodoroiu.jpg|thumb|2nd Lt. [[Ecaterina Teodoroiu]], killed in action at [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] in 1917, regarded as a national heroine in Romania]]\n{{see also|Capture and escape of Ecaterina Teodoroiu}}\n{{globalize|section|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn comparison to the attention directed to the role played by women on the Western Front during the First World War, the role of women in the east has garnered limited scholarly focus. It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women's share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman |first=W. Z.|title=Women at the Gates: Gender and Industry in Stalin's Russia|year=2002|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nWomen also fought on the Eastern Front. In the later stages of Russia's participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the [[Women's Battalion]]s, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women's willingness to fight. In Romania, [[Ecaterina Teodoroiu]] actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero.\n\nBritish nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the \"Gray partridges\" in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of [[Elsie Inglis]]. In addition to nursing injured personnel, Scottish nurses manned transport vehicles and acted as regimental cooks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coroban |first=Costel|title=Potarnichile gri.

During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many [[POWs]] were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor.<ref name=\"Project Muse\">{{cite journal|last=Gatrell|first=Peter|title=Prisoners of War on the Eastern Front during World War I|journal=Kritika|year=2005|volume=6|issue=3|pages=557\u2013566|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/kritika/v006/6.3gatrell.html|accessdate=March 18, 2014|doi=10.1353/kri.2005.0036}}</ref> Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government's inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others.<ref name=\"Project Muse\" />\n\n== Disease on the Eastern Front ==\nDisease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=22}} Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhus fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions, along with general lack of knowledge about proper medical care was evident in the German occupied [[Ober Ost]].{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}}\n\nUltimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named ''Sanitit\u00e4tswesen'' (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhus fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A \"sanitary police\" was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}} Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection.\n\nTo avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}} Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of [[Kowno]] emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}}\n\n== Casualties ==\n{{Details|topic=Russian losses|World War I casualties#endnote Russia}}\nThe Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics.\n\nCornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of ''over 1,500,000'' is not unlikely.

During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], the [[Commission on Polish Affairs]] was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would cut off 1.5 million Germans in East Prussia from the rest of Germany. Poland also received Upper Silesia. British [[Foreign Office|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] proposed [[Curzon Line|Poland's eastern border with Russia]].

In exchange for his support, in the [[Treaty of Gallipoli]] the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the [[Chalcidice]] peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers [[Strymon River|Strymon]] and [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Pineios]].{{sfn|Vacalopoulos|1973|pp=67, 75}}{{sfn|Bryer|1998|pp=777\u2013778}} Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous [[appanage]] to [[John VII Palaiologos]].

Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and [[the Levant]].\nMerchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include [[Vitaliano Poselli]], [[Pietro Arrigoni]], [[Xenophon Paionidis]], [[Salvatore Poselli]], [[Leonardo Gennari]], [[Eli Modiano]], [[Mosh\u00e9 Jacques]], [[:fr:Joseph Pleyber|Joseph Pleyber]], [[Frederic Charnot]], [[Ernst Ziller]], [[Roubens Max]], [[Levi Ernst]], [[Angelos Siagas]], [[Alexandros Tzonis]] using mainly the styles of [[Eclecticism]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Neobaroque]].\n\n[[File:Thessaloniki Aerial.png|thumb|Overview of the city's centre]]\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the [[White Tower of Thessaloniki|White Tower]], which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thessaloniki.gr/portal/page/portal/DioikitikesYpiresies/PolitistikesYpiresies/DnsiBibliothikwn/TmimaKentrIstorias/PeripatoiKlironomiassthThessaloniki/Thessaloniki.pdf|title=thessaloniki.gr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113204658/http://www.thessaloniki.gr/portal/page/portal/DioikitikesYpiresies/PolitistikesYpiresies/DnsiBibliothikwn/TmimaKentrIstorias/PeripatoiKlironomiassthThessaloniki/Thessaloniki.pdf|archivedate=13 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of [[Eleftherias Square]] towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city.

When [[Paul the Apostle]] came in Thessaloniki he taught in the area of what today is called ''Upper City''. Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest center in Europe of the [[Sephardic]] Jews, who nicknamed the city ''la madre de Israel'' (Israel's mother)<ref name=\"Holocaust\"/> and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\".<ref>Abrams, Dennis (2009); ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YkKVeMIMOmoC&pg=PA26&dq=sarkozy+jewish&hl=en&ei=eYaETe3tLsOxhAerjPGzBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sarkozy%20jewish&f=false Nicolas Sarkozy (Modern World Leaders)]'', Chelsea House Publishers, p. 26, Library Binding edition, {{ISBN|1-60413-081-4}}</ref> It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] community. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community of was half the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of [[Sephardic Jews]], followers of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], had converted to [[Islam]], becoming a sect known as the ''[[D\u00f6nmeh]]'' (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade.<ref>Kirsch, Adam [http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews ''The Other Secret Jews''] \u2013 Review of Marc David Baer's ''The D\u00f6nme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks'', ''The New Republic'', 15 February 2010.

Many French and especially [[Italian Jews]] (from [[Livorno]] and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] and other food industries, [[brick]]making and processing plants for [[tobacco]]. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the [[Allatini (company)|Allatini]]. [[Benrubi SA|Benrubis]] founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.\n\nAfter the [[Balkan Wars]], Thessaloniki was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in 1913. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-[[Venizelism|Venizelist]] and pro-royalist/conservative. The [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]] during [[World War I]] burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out.<ref name=\"History\"/> Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris.

Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same [[civil rights]] as other Greek citizens.<ref name=\"History\"/> In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay.

In exchange for his support, in the [[Treaty of Gallipoli]] the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the [[Chalcidice]] peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers [[Strymon River|Strymon]] and [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Pineios]].{{sfn|Vacalopoulos|1973|pp=67, 75}}{{sfn|Bryer|1998|pp=777\u2013778}} Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous [[appanage]] to [[John VII Palaiologos]].

Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and [[the Levant]].\nMerchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include [[Vitaliano Poselli]], [[Pietro Arrigoni]], [[Xenophon Paionidis]], [[Salvatore Poselli]], [[Leonardo Gennari]], [[Eli Modiano]], [[Mosh\u00e9 Jacques]], [[:fr:Joseph Pleyber|Joseph Pleyber]], [[Frederic Charnot]], [[Ernst Ziller]], [[Roubens Max]], [[Levi Ernst]], [[Angelos Siagas]], [[Alexandros Tzonis]] using mainly the styles of [[Eclecticism]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Neobaroque]].\n\n[[File:Thessaloniki Aerial.png|thumb|Overview of the city's centre]]\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the [[White Tower of Thessaloniki|White Tower]], which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thessaloniki.gr/portal/page/portal/DioikitikesYpiresies/PolitistikesYpiresies/DnsiBibliothikwn/TmimaKentrIstorias/PeripatoiKlironomiassthThessaloniki/Thessaloniki.pdf|title=thessaloniki.gr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113204658/http://www.thessaloniki.gr/portal/page/portal/DioikitikesYpiresies/PolitistikesYpiresies/DnsiBibliothikwn/TmimaKentrIstorias/PeripatoiKlironomiassthThessaloniki/Thessaloniki.pdf|archivedate=13 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of [[Eleftherias Square]] towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city.

When [[Paul the Apostle]] came in Thessaloniki he taught in the area of what today is called ''Upper City''. Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest center in Europe of the [[Sephardic]] Jews, who nicknamed the city ''la madre de Israel'' (Israel's mother)<ref name=\"Holocaust\"/> and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\".<ref>Abrams, Dennis (2009); ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YkKVeMIMOmoC&pg=PA26&dq=sarkozy+jewish&hl=en&ei=eYaETe3tLsOxhAerjPGzBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sarkozy%20jewish&f=false Nicolas Sarkozy (Modern World Leaders)]'', Chelsea House Publishers, p. 26, Library Binding edition, {{ISBN|1-60413-081-4}}</ref> It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] community. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community of was half the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of [[Sephardic Jews]], followers of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], had converted to [[Islam]], becoming a sect known as the ''[[D\u00f6nmeh]]'' (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade.<ref>Kirsch, Adam [http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews ''The Other Secret Jews''] \u2013 Review of Marc David Baer's ''The D\u00f6nme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks'', ''The New Republic'', 15 February 2010.

Many French and especially [[Italian Jews]] (from [[Livorno]] and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] and other food industries, [[brick]]making and processing plants for [[tobacco]]. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the [[Allatini (company)|Allatini]]. [[Benrubi SA|Benrubis]] founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.\n\nAfter the [[Balkan Wars]], Thessaloniki was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in 1913. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-[[Venizelism|Venizelist]] and pro-royalist/conservative. The [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]] during [[World War I]] burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out.<ref name=\"History\"/> Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris.

Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same [[civil rights]] as other Greek citizens.<ref name=\"History\"/> In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay.

It is found in a very small section in the South-Western Cape of [[South Africa]].\n\n==Identification==\nIt has a very strong, black and yellow patterned carapace, used for defense against predators. The patterns are arranged in ray-like markings and help the tortoise blend in with its environment. From a birds eye view the shell has geometrical symbols on it thus giving it its name. This tortoise is very small, and a full grown tortoise can only reach about 5 to 6&nbsp;inches in diameter.  The tortoise is one of the rarest species of tortoise of earth, only about 2,000 to 3,000 are alive today. However, because of its cryptic coloration and lack of activity, it makes it hard to create an accurate estimate of the population size.\n\nWhile it shares much of its superficial outer appearance with its relatives in the genus ''[[Psammobates]]'', it can be distinguished by the distinctively brightly coloured yellow stars of its shell scutes, the small nuchal and single axillary, the lack of buttock tubercles, and the only slightly upturned rear margins of the shell.\n\n==Habitat==\n\"I a cool tortoise.\" The geometric tortoise is naturally restricted to the far south-western corner of the [[Western Cape]] Province, South Africa. It used to occur as far north as Picketberg, as far south as Gordons Bay and eastwards into the Breede River valley.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sabap2.adu.org.za/news.php?id=3019 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144206/http://sabap2.adu.org.za/news.php?id=3019 |archive-date=2014-04-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The habitat type of geometric tortoise is known as the [[renosterveld]], which is located at the extreme southwestern part of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The renosterveld forms part of the [[Fynbos]] Biomes, a vegetation zone characterized by a [[Mediterranean climate]]. There is a fusion of heathlands and shrublands with beginning and ending points hard to distinguish. Shrublands can then be further broken down into strandveld, coastal renosterveld and intercoastal renosterveld.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baard|first1=E.H.W.|title=A Preliminary Analysis of the Habitat of the Geometric Tortoise|date=November 5, 1994|pages=8\u201313}}</ref>\n\nThe Geometric tortoise is able to have specific dietary preferences, adaptation to wet habitats and topographical factors to survival in the habitat. The distribution range of the Geometric tortoise lies within a winter rainfall area, which has 350\u2013600&nbsp;mm annual precipitation. The agriculture utilization and urban development of the renosterveld are the major factors responsible for the massive decline on the number of tortoise. The destruction of renosterveld reduced the habitat of geometric tortoises to less than 3% of its original size, which has only 4000-5000 hectares remaining. Namely food, cover, nesting and the ability to move around in the habitat are four main biological factors, which are important for the survival of geometric tortoises in their habitat. Geometric tortoises prefer low-lying and well-drained areas, which have a higher percentage of shrub cover and canopy cover at 50&nbsp;cm above ground level.\n\nThe last population in Cape Town died out in the tiny [[Harmony Flats Reserve]]. The species was believed to be extinct in the 1960s, but a surviving population was discovered in 1972 and it now occurs in three isolated pockets where it is conserved. A population in the [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres valley]], one in the [[Tulbagh]]-[[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]] valley, and a group surviving on the coastal lowlands to the southwest.\n\nThese colourful tortoises live only in lowland [[fynbos]] and [[renosterveld]] vegetation, meaning that their populations are easily isolated by mountains which they cannot cross.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://etd.uwc.ac.za/usrfiles/modules/etd/docs/etd_init_6020_1173955498.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172048/http://etd.uwc.ac.za/usrfiles/modules/etd/docs/etd_init_6020_1173955498.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\nThe geometric tortoise's diet consists mainly of the leaves, geophytes, flowers, and shoots of a wide range of indigenous fynbos and renosterveld plant and grass species. Some of its more common food plants include ''[[Crassula ciliata]]'', ''[[Oxalis]]'' species, local geophyte species, such as ''[[Cyanella hyacinthoides]]'', ''[[Babiana angustifolia]]'' and ''[[Lachenalia contaminata]]''; as well as a variety of grass species such as ''[[Themeda triandra]]'', ''[[Briza maxima]]'', ''[[Cynodon dactylon]]'', ''[[Ehrharta calycina]]'', ''[[Pentaschistis curvifolia]]'' and ''[[Eragrostis curvula]]''. A failure to have the full range of these, and other specific local plant species, means that the Geometric tortoise soon dies when taken out of its natural habitat or kept in captivity. The specific diet, together with climate, humidity and soil differences, are the principal reasons why the species does not survive for long outside of its habitat. It also means that the Geometric tortoise is restricted to south-western Cape Alluvial Fynbos and Shale Renosterveld vegetation types.<ref>B.A. Walton: ''Vegetation patterns and dynamics of Renosterveld at Agter Groeneberg Conservancy.''  Stellenbosch University. p.21.</ref> The geometric tortoise consumes at least 14 plant species as food, which includes 64% of Aspalathus species, 60% of Oxalis species and 66% of Berkheya species occur in West Coast renosterveld. Since the distribution range of geometric tortoise lies within a winter rainfall area, the annual grasses, geophytes and other herbaceous taxa are important food items during winter. During the summer, the annual green component is reduced and therefore the perennial grass, shrub and succulent components would serve geometric tortoise as the major food resource. Food sources tend to have a higher concentration of iron and had lower failure load and tensile strength than non-food plants. When eating the tortoise uses a grab and pull method that tends to be used more in larger herbivores. They take small bites that increase surface area to be exposed to enzymes making digestion easier.\n\n==Behavior==\nThey are said to aestivate in the months of June through September, or when their natural environment is not normal, or when in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]]. Little is known about their reproductive behavior. When the female is ready to lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]], she digs a hole in the ground and covers it with grass or other vegetation.  The Geometric tortoise tends to feed during cooler parts of the morning and afternoon. They tend to be shy and seek shelter when they notice observers.\n\n==Threats and conservation==\nThis species is one of the rarest land tortoises in the world, classified as [[Critically Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Redlist>{{Cite iucn  | url = https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/18398/0/  | title = Psammobates geometricus  | access-date = 2016-01-10}}</ref> In addition to its Red List listing, the geometric tortoise is now protected under international law and listed on Appendix I of [[CITES]], prohibiting international trade in the species.\n\nWith South Africa being home to the most tortoise species in the world, it's not surprising that it has the world's rarest tortoise species as well. Protecting these tortoises is primarily the job of the country's conservation officials. These officials work with nature preserves to help keep the tortoise's status of \u201cendangered\u201d from changing to \u201cextinct.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Sugnet|last2=Baard|first2=E.H.W.|last3=Roux|first3=Niel J. le|title=Estimating the detection probability of the geometric tortoise|date=June 16, 1999}}</ref>\nIts habitat is under constant threat of destruction and fragmentation as a result of, frequent fires, increase in the predation rates, and an increase in vegetation not native to the region. Its environment is now reduced to 31 habitat fragments which include 7 reserves. The Conservation authority of western cape province has made the conservation of the geometric tortoise one of its highest priorities. The areas that are left survive primarily because they are in less optimal farming areas.\n\nCape Nature Conservation is one of the four provincial nature preserves that the tortoises reside in.  The tortoise is marked as a high priority for the nature preserve, so they continually monitor the population of the animals to track their conservation efforts.  Cape Nature Conservation believes that tracking the population of a certain special is an early alert system to help determine which animals are more critical than others and helps determine what the animals thrive from and what hurts them.  Observation of the population is the foundation to any conservation efforts made to help this species. The population is documented annually. These counts are taken by officials walking through the preserve and hand-counting the number of tortoises they see.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/electronic_journals/wild/wild_v29_n3_a2.pdf |title = Estimating the detection probability of the geometric tortoise|journal = South African Journal of Wildlife Research - 24-Month Delayed Open Access|volume = 29|issue = 3|pages = 62\u201371|date = January 1999|last1 = Roux|first1 = Niel J. Le|last2 = Baard|first2 = Ernst H. W.|last3 = Gardner|first3 = Sugnet}}</ref>\n\nOther conservation efforts are taking place in order to insure the survival of the species. These efforts include studying the types of food that the Geometric tortoise eats in order to understand their environmental needs, and the problems with the non-native plant species.\n\nPublic support for government run conservation efforts is very low, as a result private conservation efforts have become more prevalent as a way of supplementing the limited funding that the government has for conservation efforts. This is known as wildlife ranching, and it allows for large areas of land home to be preserved at minimal expense to the government. \n<ref>http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3386/ES-2008-2655.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090522010240/http://library.thinkquest.org/J0112124/geometric_tortoise.htm Library.thinkquest.org entry]\n* Baard, E.

Shrublands can then be further broken down into strandveld, coastal renosterveld and intercoastal renosterveld.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baard|first1=E.H.W.|title=A Preliminary Analysis of the Habitat of the Geometric Tortoise|date=November 5, 1994|pages=8\u201313}}</ref>\n\nThe Geometric tortoise is able to have specific dietary preferences, adaptation to wet habitats and topographical factors to survival in the habitat. The distribution range of the Geometric tortoise lies within a winter rainfall area, which has 350\u2013600&nbsp;mm annual precipitation. The agriculture utilization and urban development of the renosterveld are the major factors responsible for the massive decline on the number of tortoise. The destruction of renosterveld reduced the habitat of geometric tortoises to less than 3% of its original size, which has only 4000-5000 hectares remaining. Namely food, cover, nesting and the ability to move around in the habitat are four main biological factors, which are important for the survival of geometric tortoises in their habitat. Geometric tortoises prefer low-lying and well-drained areas, which have a higher percentage of shrub cover and canopy cover at 50&nbsp;cm above ground level.\n\nThe last population in Cape Town died out in the tiny [[Harmony Flats Reserve]]. The species was believed to be extinct in the 1960s, but a surviving population was discovered in 1972 and it now occurs in three isolated pockets where it is conserved. A population in the [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres valley]], one in the [[Tulbagh]]-[[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]] valley, and a group surviving on the coastal lowlands to the southwest.\n\nThese colourful tortoises live only in lowland [[fynbos]] and [[renosterveld]] vegetation, meaning that their populations are easily isolated by mountains which they cannot cross.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://etd.uwc.ac.za/usrfiles/modules/etd/docs/etd_init_6020_1173955498.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172048/http://etd.uwc.ac.za/usrfiles/modules/etd/docs/etd_init_6020_1173955498.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\nThe geometric tortoise's diet consists mainly of the leaves, geophytes, flowers, and shoots of a wide range of indigenous fynbos and renosterveld plant and grass species. Some of its more common food plants include ''[[Crassula ciliata]]'', ''[[Oxalis]]'' species, local geophyte species, such as ''[[Cyanella hyacinthoides]]'', ''[[Babiana angustifolia]]'' and ''[[Lachenalia contaminata]]''; as well as a variety of grass species such as ''[[Themeda triandra]]'', ''[[Briza maxima]]'', ''[[Cynodon dactylon]]'', ''[[Ehrharta calycina]]'', ''[[Pentaschistis curvifolia]]'' and ''[[Eragrostis curvula]]''. A failure to have the full range of these, and other specific local plant species, means that the Geometric tortoise soon dies when taken out of its natural habitat or kept in captivity. The specific diet, together with climate, humidity and soil differences, are the principal reasons why the species does not survive for long outside of its habitat. It also means that the Geometric tortoise is restricted to south-western Cape Alluvial Fynbos and Shale Renosterveld vegetation types.<ref>B.A. Walton: ''Vegetation patterns and dynamics of Renosterveld at Agter Groeneberg Conservancy.''  Stellenbosch University. p.21.</ref> The geometric tortoise consumes at least 14 plant species as food, which includes 64% of Aspalathus species, 60% of Oxalis species and 66% of Berkheya species occur in West Coast renosterveld. Since the distribution range of geometric tortoise lies within a winter rainfall area, the annual grasses, geophytes and other herbaceous taxa are important food items during winter. During the summer, the annual green component is reduced and therefore the perennial grass, shrub and succulent components would serve geometric tortoise as the major food resource. Food sources tend to have a higher concentration of iron and had lower failure load and tensile strength than non-food plants. When eating the tortoise uses a grab and pull method that tends to be used more in larger herbivores. They take small bites that increase surface area to be exposed to enzymes making digestion easier.\n\n==Behavior==\nThey are said to aestivate in the months of June through September, or when their natural environment is not normal, or when in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]]. Little is known about their reproductive behavior. When the female is ready to lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]], she digs a hole in the ground and covers it with grass or other vegetation.  The Geometric tortoise tends to feed during cooler parts of the morning and afternoon. They tend to be shy and seek shelter when they notice observers.\n\n==Threats and conservation==\nThis species is one of the rarest land tortoises in the world, classified as [[Critically Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Redlist>{{Cite iucn  | url = https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/18398/0/  | title = Psammobates geometricus  | access-date = 2016-01-10}}</ref> In addition to its Red List listing, the geometric tortoise is now protected under international law and listed on Appendix I of [[CITES]], prohibiting international trade in the species.\n\nWith South Africa being home to the most tortoise species in the world, it's not surprising that it has the world's rarest tortoise species as well. Protecting these tortoises is primarily the job of the country's conservation officials. These officials work with nature preserves to help keep the tortoise's status of \u201cendangered\u201d from changing to \u201cextinct.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Sugnet|last2=Baard|first2=E.H.W.|last3=Roux|first3=Niel J. le|title=Estimating the detection probability of the geometric tortoise|date=June 16, 1999}}</ref>\nIts habitat is under constant threat of destruction and fragmentation as a result of, frequent fires, increase in the predation rates, and an increase in vegetation not native to the region. Its environment is now reduced to 31 habitat fragments which include 7 reserves. The Conservation authority of western cape province has made the conservation of the geometric tortoise one of its highest priorities. The areas that are left survive primarily because they are in less optimal farming areas.\n\nCape Nature Conservation is one of the four provincial nature preserves that the tortoises reside in.  The tortoise is marked as a high priority for the nature preserve, so they continually monitor the population of the animals to track their conservation efforts.  Cape Nature Conservation believes that tracking the population of a certain special is an early alert system to help determine which animals are more critical than others and helps determine what the animals thrive from and what hurts them.  Observation of the population is the foundation to any conservation efforts made to help this species. The population is documented annually. These counts are taken by officials walking through the preserve and hand-counting the number of tortoises they see.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/electronic_journals/wild/wild_v29_n3_a2.pdf |title = Estimating the detection probability of the geometric tortoise|journal = South African Journal of Wildlife Research - 24-Month Delayed Open Access|volume = 29|issue = 3|pages = 62\u201371|date = January 1999|last1 = Roux|first1 = Niel J.

These efforts include studying the types of food that the Geometric tortoise eats in order to understand their environmental needs, and the problems with the non-native plant species.\n\nPublic support for government run conservation efforts is very low, as a result private conservation efforts have become more prevalent as a way of supplementing the limited funding that the government has for conservation efforts. This is known as wildlife ranching, and it allows for large areas of land home to be preserved at minimal expense to the government. \n<ref>http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3386/ES-2008-2655.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090522010240/http://library.thinkquest.org/J0112124/geometric_tortoise.htm Library.thinkquest.org entry]\n* Baard, E.
