Two of the most widely known examples of Mesoamerican religion are the [[Aztec religion]] and the [[Mayan religion]].\n\n== Cosmology ==\n[[File:Codex F\u00e9jervary-Mayer (Lacambalam 2014).jpg|thumb|Religious [[Aztec calendar|calendar]] from the Codex F\u00e9jervary-Mayer (Codex Pochteca). (Lacambalam 2014)]]{{Main|Mesoamerican cosmovision}}\nThe cosmological view in Mesoamerica is strongly connected to the Mesoamerican gods and the spiritual world. The construction and division of the universe, therefore, is a visual and symbolic set up for their religious beliefs.\nLike the many different peoples of Mesoamerica, the detailed surface of the Mesoamerican cosmological views tends to vary greatly. These views do have some similarities, such as belief in a fundamental cosmic order, in which the elements of time and space are the most important. These two elements are seen as the center of the universe and make the center of the quadruplicity, known as the [[Mesoamerican world tree]], quite close to the [[quincunx]].\n\n===Space and time===\nThe importance of time is seen in the cycles of life, death and regeneration, which are similarly worshiped in most religions. Time is symbolized in the cycle of the sun, for Mesoamericans believed that the sun separates night and day, and that the death and regeneration of the sun is the reason for a new era.\n\nAs an expansion of quincunx, which symbolizes space, two axes combine the universe with the inclusion of both the natural and the spiritual, vertically and horizontally.  It is called the [[axis mundi]], which in the case of mesoamerican cosmology, vertically consists of three worlds and horizontally of four directions and a center.\n\nIn the vertical axis; the world on the surface of earth, in the middle; a world above where the stars are, and then a world below our surface. These three worlds are not to be confused with the Christian division of a heaven and a hell, although the Spaniards, in trying to convert the native Mesoamerican, made the two comparable by doing so.<ref>Markman and Markman, The flayed god (page number?)</ref>\n\n==Pantheon==\nThe Mesoamerican pantheon includes dozens of gods and goddesses in addition to the major deities described below.\n\n[[Tlaloc]] (Aztec) / [[Chaac]] (Maya) / [[Dzahui]] (Mixtec) / [[Cocijo]] (Zapotec) - Chief rain god; deity of water, fertility, rain, and storms, also with mountain associations. Recognizable by his goggle-like eyes and distinctive fangs.\n\n[[Quetzalcoatl]] (Aztec) / [[Kukulkan]] (Yucatec Maya) / [[Q'uq'umatz]] (K'iche' Maya) - Plumed Serpent; god of wind, priests, merchants, and the link between the earth and the sky.\n\n[[Tezcatlipoca]] (Aztec) - \"Smoking Mirror\"; guileful omnipresent deity of cosmic struggle, feuds, rulers, sorcerers, and warriors; the [[jaguar]] is his animal counterpart.\n\n[[God K]] (Maya) - Some similarities with Tezcatlipoca, but also connected with lightning and agriculture, and exhibits serpentine features.\n\n[[Huitzilopochtli]] (Aztec) - Preeminent god and tutelary deity of the Aztecs in [[Tenochtitlan]], where his temple with adjoined Tlaloc's atop a great pyramid constituting the dual [[Templo Mayor]]. Deity of the sun, fire, war and the ruling lineage.<ref>Miller, Mary and Karl Taube. 1993. The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya.</ref>\n\n==Colonized Mesoamerica==\nWhen the Spanish first arrived in Mesoamerica, they ransacked the indigenous peoples' territory, often pillaging their temples and places of worship. Beyond this, the devoutly Catholic Spaniards found the standing Mesoamerican spiritual observances deeply offensive, and sought to either cover up or eradicate their practice. This resulted in the erasure of Mayan religious institutions, especially those centered on human sacrifice and propitiation of the multi-deistic pantheon.\n\nMartial values and human sacrifice were a ritualistic core of Mesoamerican spirituality prior to European incursion, but quickly dissolved in the early stages of Imperial rule. Pre-Hispanic warrior culture in Mesoamerica placed high value on capturing enemies on the battlefield; killing on the battlefield therefore was not encouraged and in fact considered brutish and sloppy. This emphasis on non-lethal combat is evidenced in the fact that Aztec warriors were promoted on the basis of however many captive warriors they could bring back from the battlefield, not on sheer destructive ability to kill. Prisoner capture between rival cultures provided both sides with sacrificial victims for deity propitiation, wars even being pre-arranged by both sides, the so-called [[Flower war]]s. This practice was ultimately made impossible once Spain had subjugated the [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The deity [[Huitzilopochtli]] in particular had a devoted blood cult, as it was believed that without his continued sustenance the cosmos would be plunged into darkness. Less violent rituals were calculatedly suppressed as well, with the Spanish authorities deeming them anathema in light of their own spiritual preconceptions.\n\nWhen the Spaniards and their [[Tlaxcallan|Tlaxcalteca]] allies besieged [[Tenochtitlan]] after having been forced out for preemptively massacring unarmed celebrants, the Aztecs struck back and sacrificed their Iberian captives to Huitzilopochtli, but ultimately the Aztecs could not defend the city after a devastating smallpox epidemic killed many warriors and leaders including the [[tlatoani]] himself. Even though the Aztecs continued to worship some of their own gods after the conquest, worshipping in secret and even disguising deities as nominal Catholic saints, the cult of the war god was totally suppressed. Indeed, Huitzilopochtli is still much less well understood than other major deities such as Tlaloc or Quetzalcoatl, and little was written about him in what sources survive from the decades following the conquest.<ref>Handbook of Middle American Indians Volume 6. 1967. University of Texas Press. Pp 370-371</ref>\n\nThe early friars in colonized Mesoamerica wrote manuals describing indigenous rituals and practices, to define precisely what was acceptable and unacceptable, and to recognize the unacceptable when they saw it. From the start, authorities recognized the subversive potential of recording the details of \"idolatry\" and discouraged putting anything down in writing that might preserve pre-conquest religion. If tolerated at all, the recording these observations was a very subjective project, and only few of the manuals have even survived. Things considered to be \"diabolical\" varied depending on the reporting friar, one manuscript justifying a practice that another manuscript might condemn.<ref>Burkhart, Louise M. 1997.

But at the same time they also demonized other elements, which were considered to not comply with Christian beliefs. They did this to make it easier to convert the Mesoamericans to Christianity.\n\nBefore the Spanish conquest each village had a patron deity whose idol was worshipped, presented with offerings and adorned with jewelry and fine robes.

Sayre is the principal city of the ''[[Sayre, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area]].''\n\n== History ==\nIn May 1870, a Waverly banker named Howard Elmer, along with Charles Anthony and James Fritcher, bought the Pine Plains area between Waverly and Athens.  Elmer convinced [[Asa Packer]] to locate a new [[railroad]] repair facility on the Pine Plains for the expanding [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], which was making a push north to connect to the [[Erie Railroad]] at Waverly. Robert Heysham Sayre, president of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania and New York Railroad]], helped cement the deal. The town was named in his honor. Sayre was incorporated on January 27, 1891.\n\nIn 1904 when the locomotive shops were built at Sayre, the main shop building was believed to be the largest structure in the world under one roof, but held that title for only a brief time. The railroad operated from 1870 until 1976, but maintenance facilities were shifted away before that. With the decline of industry, population has declined since 1940.\n\n==Geography==\nSayre is located at {{coord|41|59|1|N|76|31|15|W|type:city}} (41.983567, -76.520845)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in a river valley in the [[Allegheny Plateau]] just north of the confluence of the [[Susquehanna River]] and the [[Chemung River]], along with [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], [[South Waverly, Pennsylvania]], and [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly, New York]].

Officially founded in 1855 by James Saxton, the area now known as Saxton has been inhabited for centuries. Before Anglos arrived, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] camped along the river that flows through the area. As the United States grew and pushed the frontier west, a few settlers began building homesteads, farms, and mills throughout the valley that Saxton is located in. The region being rich in [[bituminous coal]], a railroad was soon built to export the commodity. Saxton was the hub of the [[Huntingdon and Broad Top Railroad]] (H&BT) and for almost 100 years it shipped coal from Saxton to places like [[Bedford, Pennsylvania|Bedford]], [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania|Huntingdon]] and [[Everett, Pennsylvania|Everett]]. From there it went on to industrial centers, such as [[Pittsburgh]] or [[Baltimore]].\n\nThe thriving railroad attracted thousands of workers and their families to the town and surrounding area. In its heyday Saxton had a bowling alley, a toy factory, a candy factory, a coal power plant, dozens of shops and businesses, and even a [[7 Up]] bottling plant. Saxton and the surrounding area were full of industry and other businesses. These included a [[pig iron]] furnace, [[coke (fuel)|coke ovens]], a [[tannery]], [[brickyard]]s, [[dairy|dairies]], and others. However, the prosperity would not last, as the mines began to become exhausted of coal after [[World War Two]]. This in conjunction with the [[recession of 1949]] caused the railroad to shut down in 1955. Most of the buildings and infrastructure owned by the railroad were abandoned, and has subsequently been salvaged or left to erode away.\n\nSaxton was chosen to be the home of the [[Saxton Nuclear Generating Station]], the nation's fourth nuclear power plant, which was commissioned in 1961. It was one of the first test facilities for peace-time [[plutonium]] use, as well as cooling methods that would be used to relieve meltdown situations such as the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in 2011. The facility was decommissioned in 1972, and the radioactive core removed in 2005.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1870= 318\n|1880= 369\n|1890= 712\n|1900= 937\n|1910= 1195\n|1920= 1165\n|1930= 1128\n|1940= 1152\n|1950= 1093\n|1960= 977\n|1970= 858\n|1980= 814\n|1990= 838\n|2000= 803\n|2010= 736\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=691\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 803 people, 357 households, and 213 families residing in the borough.

Officially founded in 1855 by James Saxton, the area now known as Saxton has been inhabited for centuries. Before Anglos arrived, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] camped along the river that flows through the area. As the United States grew and pushed the frontier west, a few settlers began building homesteads, farms, and mills throughout the valley that Saxton is located in. The region being rich in [[bituminous coal]], a railroad was soon built to export the commodity. Saxton was the hub of the [[Huntingdon and Broad Top Railroad]] (H&BT) and for almost 100 years it shipped coal from Saxton to places like [[Bedford, Pennsylvania|Bedford]], [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania|Huntingdon]] and [[Everett, Pennsylvania|Everett]]. From there it went on to industrial centers, such as [[Pittsburgh]] or [[Baltimore]].\n\nThe thriving railroad attracted thousands of workers and their families to the town and surrounding area. In its heyday Saxton had a bowling alley, a toy factory, a candy factory, a coal power plant, dozens of shops and businesses, and even a [[7 Up]] bottling plant. Saxton and the surrounding area were full of industry and other businesses. These included a [[pig iron]] furnace, [[coke (fuel)|coke ovens]], a [[tannery]], [[brickyard]]s, [[dairy|dairies]], and others. However, the prosperity would not last, as the mines began to become exhausted of coal after [[World War Two]]. This in conjunction with the [[recession of 1949]] caused the railroad to shut down in 1955. Most of the buildings and infrastructure owned by the railroad were abandoned, and has subsequently been salvaged or left to erode away.\n\nSaxton was chosen to be the home of the [[Saxton Nuclear Generating Station]], the nation's fourth nuclear power plant, which was commissioned in 1961. It was one of the first test facilities for peace-time [[plutonium]] use, as well as cooling methods that would be used to relieve meltdown situations such as the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in 2011. The facility was decommissioned in 1972, and the radioactive core removed in 2005.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1870= 318\n|1880= 369\n|1890= 712\n|1900= 937\n|1910= 1195\n|1920= 1165\n|1930= 1128\n|1940= 1152\n|1950= 1093\n|1960= 977\n|1970= 858\n|1980= 814\n|1990= 838\n|2000= 803\n|2010= 736\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=691\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 803 people, 357 households, and 213 families residing in the borough.
