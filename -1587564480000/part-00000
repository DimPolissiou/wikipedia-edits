Other names used included Stevenage Link and Transit Group.\n\nIts original depot was at Hare Street, near [[Buntingford]], [[Hertfordshire]]. In 2004, another base was established at Stansted Business Park, and Hare Street closed in 2006. The Braintree depot was opened in December 2007, and the Stansted site was vacated during 2008.

The emf ''\u2130'' of the source is defined as the work ''dW'' done per charge ''dq'': {{nowrap|''\u2130'' {{=}} ''dW/dq''}}.\n\nIn the case of an electrical generator, a time-varying magnetic field inside the generator creates an electric field via [[electromagnetic induction]], which in turn creates a voltage difference between the generator terminals. Charge separation takes place within the generator, with electrons flowing away from one terminal and toward the other, until, in the open-circuit case, sufficient electric field builds up to make further charge separation impossible. Again, the emf is countered by the electrical voltage due to charge separation. If a load is attached, this voltage can drive a current. The general principle governing the emf in such electrical machines is [[Faraday's law of induction]].\n\n==History==\nAround 1830, [[Michael Faraday]] established that the reactions at each of the two electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces provide the \"seat of emf\" for the voltaic cell, that is, these reactions drive the current and are not an endless source of energy as was initially thought.<ref name=cajori/> In the open-circuit case, charge separation continues until the electrical field from the separated charges is sufficient to arrest the reactions. Years earlier, [[Alessandro Volta]], who had measured a contact potential difference at the metal\u2013metal (electrode\u2013electrode) interface of his cells, had held the incorrect opinion that contact alone (without taking into account a chemical reaction) was the origin of the emf.\n\n== Notation and units of measurement ==\nElectromotive force is often denoted by <math>\\mathcal{E}</math> or ''\u2130'' (script capital E, Unicode U+2130).\n\nIn a device without internal resistance, if an [[electric charge]] ''Q'' passes through that device, and gains an [[energy]] ''W'', the net emf for that device is the energy gained per unit [[electric charge|charge]], or ''W''/''Q''.

A time-dependent magnetic field can be produced either by motion of a magnet relative to a circuit, by motion of a circuit relative to another circuit (at least one of these must be carrying a current), or by changing the current in a fixed circuit. The effect on the circuit itself, of changing the current, is known as self-induction; the effect on another circuit is known as [[mutual induction]].\n\nFor a given circuit, the electromagnetically induced emf is determined purely by the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit according to [[Faraday's law of induction]].\n\nAn emf is induced in a coil or conductor whenever there is change in the [[flux linkage]]s. Depending on the way in which the changes are brought about, there are two types: When the conductor is moved in a stationary magnetic field to procure a change in the flux linkage, the emf is ''statically induced''. The electromotive force generated by motion is often referred to as ''motional emf''. When the change in flux linkage arises from a change in the magnetic field around the stationary conductor, the emf is ''dynamically induced.'' The electromotive force generated by a time-varying magnetic field  is often referred to as ''transformer emf''.\n\n===Contact potentials===\n{{See also|Volta potential|Electrochemical potential}}\nWhen solids of two different materials are in contact, [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] requires that one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other.

Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the [[bandgap]] of the material), creates mobile [[electron\u2013hole pair]]s in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the [[p-n junction]] in thermal equilibrium. (This electric field is created from a [[p\u2013n junction#Equilibrium (zero bias)|built-in potential]], which arises from the [[Volta potential|contact potential]] between the two different materials in the junction.) The charge separation between positive [[Electron hole|hole]]s and negative [[electron]]s across a [[p-n junction]] (a [[diode]]) yields a ''forward voltage'', the ''photo voltage'', between the illuminated diode terminals,<ref name=\"Dhir\">{{cite book |author-first=S.

The emf ''\u2130'' of the source is defined as the work ''dW'' done per charge ''dq'': {{nowrap|''\u2130'' {{=}} ''dW/dq''}}.\n\nIn the case of an electrical generator, a time-varying magnetic field inside the generator creates an electric field via [[electromagnetic induction]], which in turn creates a voltage difference between the generator terminals. Charge separation takes place within the generator, with electrons flowing away from one terminal and toward the other, until, in the open-circuit case, sufficient electric field builds up to make further charge separation impossible. Again, the emf is countered by the electrical voltage due to charge separation. If a load is attached, this voltage can drive a current. The general principle governing the emf in such electrical machines is [[Faraday's law of induction]].\n\n==History==\nAround 1830, [[Michael Faraday]] established that the reactions at each of the two electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces provide the \"seat of emf\" for the voltaic cell, that is, these reactions drive the current and are not an endless source of energy as was initially thought.<ref name=cajori/> In the open-circuit case, charge separation continues until the electrical field from the separated charges is sufficient to arrest the reactions. Years earlier, [[Alessandro Volta]], who had measured a contact potential difference at the metal\u2013metal (electrode\u2013electrode) interface of his cells, had held the incorrect opinion that contact alone (without taking into account a chemical reaction) was the origin of the emf.\n\n== Notation and units of measurement ==\nElectromotive force is often denoted by <math>\\mathcal{E}</math> or ''\u2130'' (script capital E, Unicode U+2130).\n\nIn a device without internal resistance, if an [[electric charge]] ''Q'' passes through that device, and gains an [[energy]] ''W'', the net emf for that device is the energy gained per unit [[electric charge|charge]], or ''W''/''Q''.

The effect on the circuit itself, of changing the current, is known as self-induction; the effect on another circuit is known as [[mutual induction]].\n\nFor a given circuit, the electromagnetically induced emf is determined purely by the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit according to [[Faraday's law of induction]].\n\nAn emf is induced in a coil or conductor whenever there is change in the [[flux linkage]]s. Depending on the way in which the changes are brought about, there are two types: When the conductor is moved in a stationary magnetic field to procure a change in the flux linkage, the emf is ''statically induced''. The electromotive force generated by motion is often referred to as ''motional emf''. When the change in flux linkage arises from a change in the magnetic field around the stationary conductor, the emf is ''dynamically induced.'' The electromotive force generated by a time-varying magnetic field  is often referred to as ''transformer emf''.\n\n===Contact potentials===\n{{See also|Volta potential|Electrochemical potential}}\nWhen solids of two different materials are in contact, [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] requires that one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other.

Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the [[bandgap]] of the material), creates mobile [[electron\u2013hole pair]]s in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the [[p-n junction]] in thermal equilibrium. (This electric field is created from a [[p\u2013n junction#Equilibrium (zero bias)|built-in potential]], which arises from the [[Volta potential|contact potential]] between the two different materials in the junction.) The charge separation between positive [[Electron hole|hole]]s and negative [[electron]]s across a [[p-n junction]] (a [[diode]]) yields a ''forward voltage'', the ''photo voltage'', between the illuminated diode terminals,<ref name=\"Dhir\">{{cite book |author-first=S.

In addition, the induced voltage tends to [[p-n junction#Forward bias|forward bias]] the junction. At high enough levels, this forward bias of the junction will cause a forward current, I<sub>\nD</sub> in the diode opposite that induced by the light. Consequently, the greatest current is obtained under short-circuit conditions, and is denoted as ''I''<sub>L</sub> (for light-induced current) in the equivalent circuit.<ref name=Lorenzo>{{cite book\n |title=Solar Electricity: Engineering of photovoltaic systems\n |editor=Eduardo Lorenzo\n |author= Gerardo L.

His father died in [[Exeter]] a month before his birth, en route to serve in [[Peninsular War]].{{sfn|Moody |1966|pp=5-6}} His mother was Protestant, but also related to the Chief's of Clan [[O'Sullivan#E\u00f3ganachta dynasty|O'Sullivan Beares]], members of the [[Gaelic nobility of Ireland]].{{sfn|Mulvey |2003|p=22}} \n\nHis mother had enough money to live on her own and moved back to Dublin in 1818, taking up residence at 67 Lower Baggot Street in 1830, where Davis lived until his death in 1845. He attended school in Lower Mount Street, then went to [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He became auditor of the [[College Historical Society]],{{sfn|various|1892|p=127,253}} and graduated in 1835 with a degree in Logic. From 1836 to 1838, he studied law in [[London]] and Europe; although he [[King's Inns|qualified as a lawyer]] in 1838, he never practised.{{sfn|Moody |1966|p=6}}\n\n==Writings==\nDavis gave a voice to the 19th-century foundational culture of modern [[Irish nationalism]]. Formerly it was based on the republicans of the 1790s and on the Catholic emancipation movement of [[Daniel O'Connell]] in the 1820s-30s, which had little in common with each other except for independence from Britain; Davis aimed to create a common and more inclusive base for the future. \n\nAs a Protestant, Davis preached religious unity, often building on ideas promoted by the secular [[Society_of_United_Irishmen|United Irishmen]] prior to the [[Irish_Rebellion_of_1798|1798 Rebellion]]. He was heavily influenced by [[Romantic nationalism]] and the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] (1744\u20131803), who argued nationality was not genetic but the product of climate, geography and inclination.{{sfn|King|2016|p=112}}\n\nIn September 1842, he established [[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|''The Nation'']] newspaper with [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] and [[John Blake Dillon]]. Ostensibly designed to support O'Connell's campaign for repeal of the 1801 Union, Davis made it a vehicle for promoting the Irish language, and an Irish cultural identity separate from that of Britain.{{sfn|Penet |2007|pp=433-434}} This focus can be seen in several letters written shortly before his death in 1843, that emphasise the uniqueness of the Irish countryside, and its inhabitants as a \"rising, not declining, people.\"{{sfn|Cullen |1854|pp=63-65}}    \n\nHis June 1840 speech as the outgoing [[College Historical Society#Presidents and vice-presidents|president]] of the College Historical Society,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.from-ireland.net/address-historical-society-thomas-osborne-davis/ |title=Address to the Historical Society, Thomas Osborne Davis |last=Davis |first=Thomas Osborne |date=June 1840 |access-date=19 February 2020 |via=From-Ireland.net}}</ref> contains the first explicit statement of belief in the Irish nation.{{sfn|Moody|1966|p=7}}\n<blockquote>\"The country of our birth, our educations, our recollections, ancestral, personal, national; the country of our loves, our friendships, our hopes; our country: the cosmopolite is unnatural, base - I would fain say, impossible. To act on a world is for those above it, not of it. Patriotism is human philanthropy.\"{{sfn|Potter|2017|p=27}}</blockquote> \n\nThis placed him in the fore of Irish nationalist thinking; later notables, chiefly [[Patrick Pearse]], suggest [[Wolfe Tone]] laid out the basic premise that Ireland as a nation must be free, but Davis expanded this by also promoting the Irish identity.\n\n==Relationship with Daniel O'Connell==\nDavis supported O'Connell's [[Repeal Association]] from 1840, hoping to recreate the old [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. They split during a debate on the proposed new [[Queen's University of Ireland]], when Davis was reduced to tears by O'Connell's superior debating skill. Davis was in favour of a university that would inclusively educate all Irish students; O'Connell and the Catholic hierarchy preferred a separate system for Catholic students within Ireland that would remain under church control (see: [[Catholic University of Ireland]])\n\nO'Connell generally referred to his inexperienced allies as \"Young Ireland\", initially as a dismissive term, that from the 1870s became the accepted term for nationalists inspired by Davis. He also preferred a federal arrangement with Britain in the 1840s while Davis sought a greater degree of autonomy. Both agreed that a gradual and non-violent process was the best way forward. Despite their differences O'Connell was distraught at Davis's early death.<ref>[http://cdn.radiocms.net/media/001/audio/000011/63109_media_player_audio_file.mp3 Podcast by \"Newstalk\" radio, accessed 7 January 2015]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHe died from [[scarlet fever]], in 1845 at the age of 30, and was buried in [[Mount Jerome Cemetery]], Dublin.{{sfn|Hachey |2010|p=62}} \n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Dame Street - Thomas Davis.jpg|thumb|120px|Dame Street - Thomas Davis]]\nDavis composed a number of [[Irish rebel song]]s, and songs, including ''The West's Asleep'', ''[[A Nation Once Again]]'' and ''In Bodenstown Churchyard'', and the ''[[Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill]]''.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/250/108.html 108.

His father died in [[Exeter]] a month before his birth, en route to serve in [[Peninsular War]].{{sfn|Moody |1966|pp=5-6}} His mother was Protestant, but also related to the Chief's of Clan [[O'Sullivan#E\u00f3ganachta dynasty|O'Sullivan Beares]], members of the [[Gaelic nobility of Ireland]].{{sfn|Mulvey |2003|p=22}} \n\nHis mother had enough money to live on her own and moved back to Dublin in 1818, taking up residence at 67 Lower Baggot Street in 1830, where Davis lived until his death in 1845. He attended school in Lower Mount Street, then went to [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He became auditor of the [[College Historical Society]],{{sfn|various|1892|p=127,253}} and graduated in 1835 with a degree in Logic. From 1836 to 1838, he studied law in [[London]] and Europe; although he [[King's Inns|qualified as a lawyer]] in 1838, he never practised.{{sfn|Moody |1966|p=6}}\n\n==Writings==\nDavis gave a voice to the 19th-century foundational culture of modern [[Irish nationalism]]. Formerly it was based on the republicans of the 1790s and on the Catholic emancipation movement of [[Daniel O'Connell]] in the 1820s-30s, which had little in common with each other except for independence from Britain; Davis aimed to create a common and more inclusive base for the future. \n\nAs a Protestant, Davis preached religious unity, often building on ideas promoted by the secular [[Society_of_United_Irishmen|United Irishmen]] prior to the [[Irish_Rebellion_of_1798|1798 Rebellion]]. He was heavily influenced by [[Romantic nationalism]] and the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] (1744\u20131803), who argued nationality was not genetic but the product of climate, geography and inclination.{{sfn|King|2016|p=112}}\n\nIn September 1842, he established [[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|''The Nation'']] newspaper with [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] and [[John Blake Dillon]]. Ostensibly designed to support O'Connell's campaign for repeal of the 1801 Union, Davis made it a vehicle for promoting the Irish language, and an Irish cultural identity separate from that of Britain.{{sfn|Penet |2007|pp=433-434}} This focus can be seen in several letters written shortly before his death in 1843, that emphasise the uniqueness of the Irish countryside, and its inhabitants as a \"rising, not declining, people.\"{{sfn|Cullen |1854|pp=63-65}}    \n\nHis June 1840 speech as the outgoing [[College Historical Society#Presidents and vice-presidents|president]] of the College Historical Society,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.from-ireland.net/address-historical-society-thomas-osborne-davis/ |title=Address to the Historical Society, Thomas Osborne Davis |last=Davis |first=Thomas Osborne |date=June 1840 |access-date=19 February 2020 |via=From-Ireland.net}}</ref> contains the first explicit statement of belief in the Irish nation.{{sfn|Moody|1966|p=7}}\n<blockquote>\"The country of our birth, our educations, our recollections, ancestral, personal, national; the country of our loves, our friendships, our hopes; our country: the cosmopolite is unnatural, base - I would fain say, impossible. To act on a world is for those above it, not of it. Patriotism is human philanthropy.\"{{sfn|Potter|2017|p=27}}</blockquote> \n\nThis placed him in the fore of Irish nationalist thinking; later notables, chiefly [[Patrick Pearse]], suggest [[Wolfe Tone]] laid out the basic premise that Ireland as a nation must be free, but Davis expanded this by also promoting the Irish identity.\n\n==Relationship with Daniel O'Connell==\nDavis supported O'Connell's [[Repeal Association]] from 1840, hoping to recreate the old [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. They split during a debate on the proposed new [[Queen's University of Ireland]], when Davis was reduced to tears by O'Connell's superior debating skill. Davis was in favour of a university that would inclusively educate all Irish students; O'Connell and the Catholic hierarchy preferred a separate system for Catholic students within Ireland that would remain under church control (see: [[Catholic University of Ireland]])\n\nO'Connell generally referred to his inexperienced allies as \"Young Ireland\", initially as a dismissive term, that from the 1870s became the accepted term for nationalists inspired by Davis.

In 1756 Carl Friedrich Eckleff established the first St Andrew's lodge in [[Stockholm]] to work additional degrees, beyond the three initial degrees of Craft Freemasonry. A Grand Chapter was erected in 1759.

As Grand Master of the Swedish Order of Freemasons he developed the system, which by 1800 had fully evolved into the [[Swedish Rite]] system, which has since experienced only very minor development.

He also received from the Supreme Council in Leipzig warrants to work the [[Scottish Rite]] and the [[Rite_of_Memphis-Misraim |Memphis Rite]]. Five lodges were established during the 1950s at [[Lund]], [[Halmstad]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Helsingborg]] in southern Sweden. Even at its 1960s highpoint membership was just 350, and during the 1970s and 1980s both membership and activity decreased. All five lodges closed, the last in 2006. A small group of former members revived the order in 2009 with lodges in [[Stockholm]] and [[Simrishamn]]. It accepts male members who believe in a Supreme Being. It works the craft degrees, the [[Holy Royal Arch]], the [[Order of Mark Master Masons]], the [[Order of Royal and Select Masters]], the Order of High Priests, and the [[Masonic bodies#Rites, Orders and Degrees|Royal Ark Mariner]] degree. It has a goal of reviving in Sweden the [[Scottish Rite | Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]] and [[Rite of Memphis-Misraim#The Rite of Memphis|the Rite of Memphis]].\n\n===Gran Oriente Latinoamericano===\nGran Oriente Latinoamericano is a co-masonic (mixed male and female) system introduced into Sweden in 1984.

It admits only Christian men who are VII grade (or above) members of the Swedish Order of Freemasons, and strictly by invitation only.<ref>Svenska Frimurare Orden: ''Utl\u00e4ndskt frimureri'', {{ISBN|91-631-6635-6}}</ref>\n\n==Other masonic systems==\nSeveral other masonic orders have or had a minority presence in Sweden.\n\n===Female adoption lodge: ''Le v\u00e9ritable et constante amiti\u00e9''===\n\nWomen Freemasons seem to have been introduced early in Sweden, though the information in scarce: according to documents of the Swedish Freemasons, [[Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht]] was in 1747 the Grand Mistress of in a certain ''Ordre de la resemblance'', which can thus be interpreted as a Women's Lodge of Adoption.<ref name=\"Kjell Lekeby\">Kjell Lekeby (2010).

Sala S\u00f6dermalm: Vertigo F\u00f6rlag</ref>  However, a confirmed Women's Lodge does not appear until the 1770s. \n\nOn 2 May 1776, the Grand Master of the Swedish Freemasonic Order, [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Duke Charles]], had his spouse, [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp]], inaugurated as the Grand Mistress of a female lodge of adoption to his own lodge at the [[Royal Palace, Stockholm]], named ''Le v\u00e9ritable et constante amiti\u00e9''.<ref name=\"Kjell Lekeby\">Kjell Lekeby (2010).

Reuterholm, hertig Carl och hertiginnan Charlotta 1776-1803.. Sala S\u00f6dermalm: Vertigo F\u00f6rlag</ref>    This new woman's lodge of adoption was confirmed by seal from Grand Master of the French Freemasonic Order, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], and the Grand Mistress of the French Woman's Lodge of Adoption, [[Bathilde d'Orl\u00e9ans]], on 8 May 1776.<ref name=\"Kjell Lekeby\"/>  \nThe Woman's Lodge of Adoption was organized by rules set by Duchess Charlotte in three grades with a ritual in five grades after a French role model, and had their meetings in the same rooms in the apartments of Duke Charles in the Royal Palace where the male lodge also had their meetings.<ref name=\"Kjell Lekeby\"/>    Except Duchess Charlotte herself, [[Sophie von Fersen]] and [[Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen]], both introduced in 1776, are confirmed as members of the Lodge of Adoption, and [[Charlotte Stierneld]] are likely to have been member of the same lodge, as she was named as \"already a Freemason\" when she was introduced in the [[Yellow Rose (society)|Yellow Rose Lodge]].<ref name=\"Kjell Lekeby\"/>    It is unknown how long the Lodge of Adoption was active, but it is likely that is functioned at least until 1789, when duchess Charlotte mention how duke Charles allowed her to participate in \"secret gatherings\" to explore the occult, and perhaps as long as until the foundation of the short lived Co-Masonic Lodge [[Yellow Rose (society)|Yellow Rose Lodge]] in 1802, but was surely abolished in 1803, when all secret societies at court was banned.<ref name=\"Kjell Lekeby\"/>    \n\n===Le Droit Humain===\nThe International Order of Co-Masonry, or [[Le Droit Humain]], came to Sweden in 1918, when a lodge was established in Stockholm. A second lodge in Gothenburg was short-lived. Being a [[Co-Freemasonry|co-masonic]] obedience it admits both men and women. Today, there are four Le Droit Humain lodges in Sweden (two in Stockholm, one in [[V\u00e4nersborg]] and one in [[Malm\u00f6]]), which are linked administratively with others across Scandinavia.<ref>Details at the [https://www.droithumain.se/vara-loger/ official website of LDH in Sweden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712150740/https://www.droithumain.se/vara-loger/ |date=2019-07-12 }}.</ref> Lodges use either the \"Lauderdale\" or \"George Martin\" versions of the three craft degrees, as well as various high degrees (especially of the [[Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]], which is the main ritual system for the entirety of Le Droit Humain).<ref>Details at the [https://www.droithumain.se/skotska-riten/ official website of LDH in Sweden].</ref>\n\n===Swedish Masonic Camp===\nThe Swedish Masonic Camp ({{lang-sv|Svenska Frimurare L\u00e4gret}}) was a system established in 1951 using Craft and Royal Arch warrants that John Trolln\u00e4s had received in the 1930s from the Grand Lodge of Hamburg. He also received from the Supreme Council in Leipzig warrants to work the [[Scottish Rite]] and the [[Rite_of_Memphis-Misraim |Memphis Rite]]. Five lodges were established during the 1950s at [[Lund]], [[Halmstad]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Helsingborg]] in southern Sweden. Even at its 1960s highpoint membership was just 350, and during the 1970s and 1980s both membership and activity decreased. All five lodges closed, the last in 2006. A small group of former members revived the order in 2009 with lodges in [[Stockholm]] and [[Simrishamn]]. It accepts male members who believe in a Supreme Being. It works the craft degrees, the [[Holy Royal Arch]], the [[Order of Mark Master Masons]], the [[Order of Royal and Select Masters]], the Order of High Priests, and the [[Masonic bodies#Rites, Orders and Degrees|Royal Ark Mariner]] degree. It has a goal of reviving in Sweden the [[Scottish Rite | Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]] and [[Rite of Memphis-Misraim#The Rite of Memphis|the Rite of Memphis]].\n\n===Gran Oriente Latinoamericano===\nGran Oriente Latinoamericano is a co-masonic (mixed male and female) system introduced into Sweden in 1984. It has lodges in Stockholm, [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] and [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]]. It works the [[French Rite]] (Rite Fran\u00e7ais), and does not require a belief in a Supreme Being amongst its members.\n\n===Grand Lodge of Finland===\nSince early 2010s, the Grand Lodge of Finland has operated a district grand lodge of Sweden with the permission of the Swedish Rite. The lodges chartered by the Grand Lodge of Finland work using a Swedish-language version of the Finnish ritual, which is a close successor of the ritual used by the Grand Lodge of State of New York. The lodges require that candidates are men who profess faith in a Supreme Being and the immortality of soul.<ref>Ray, Jan (2014) Reflektioner kring det bl\u00e5a frimureriet i Sverige.
