In the early 1990s, he was a part of the tag team [[The Bad Breed]] with [[Ian Rotten]]. He had a short stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1991, but he was best known for his appearances with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) from 1993 to 1999.<ref name=\"Eck\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-06-12/sports/0506120091_1_knighton-professional-wrestling-matches-pro-wrestling|title=After 'Rotten' past, he returns to center stage|date=June 12, 2005|author=Eck, Kevin|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBad Breed competed in ECW's tag team division in the early years of the company until the team was forced to disband after losing to [[The Pitbulls]] and engaged in a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] against each other that ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' named [[List of Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards#Feud of the Year|Feud of the Year]] in 1995. After an unsuccessful singles career, Rotten formed short-lived tag teams with [[Hack Meyers]] and [[D-Von Dudley]] before forming Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks with [[Balls Mahoney]] in 1997. The team lasted until Rotten departed ECW in 1999. Knighton then wrestled on the independent circuit and appeared at [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] pay-per-view in 2005.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n[[image:AxlRottenApril2009Turnbuckle.png|left|thumb|250px|Rotten wrestling on the [[independent circuit]] in 2009]]\n\n===Training and independent circuit (1986\u20131993)===\nKnighton was trained to wrestle by [[Ricky Lawless]] at a gym on Baltimore's [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|North Avenue]], receiving supplementary training from [[Joey Maggs]]. He debuted on the [[independent circuit]] at the age of 17, adopting the ring name \"Axl Rotten\", a [[portmanteau]] of the [[Rock music|rockers]] [[Axl Rose]] and [[Johnny Rotten]].<ref name=\"Eck\"/> Rotten won his first championship teaming with Lawless to win the tag team titles in Frank Cain's Star Cavalcade Wrestling during the summer of 1988. He also succeeded Lawless as the promotion's heavyweight champion when, shortly after reigning champion Ricky Lawless was murdered, he won the vacant title from The Psycho in [[Thomasville, Georgia]] on November 30, 1988.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nIn the early 1990s, Rotten trained [[Ian Rotten]], who formed a [[tag team]] with Axl, masquerading as his brother and taking his stage name from [[Tommy Chong]]'s character in ''[[Get Out of My Room]]''. The duo, known as [[The Bad Breed]], wrestled primarily in the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. Axl later opened his own [[professional wrestling promotion]] in Maryland called Universal Independent Wrestling. The promotion featured wrestlers such as the Bad Breed, [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and [[Raven (wrestler)|Scotty The Body]]. It had a television series that aired on Saturday nights on the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] channel. The promotion closed in the mid-1990s.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, Axl and Ian Rotten had a run with the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF) in Texas, being featured on their daily [[ESPN]] show. While in GWF, Axl succeeded in winning both the GWF Commonwealth title and the GWF Tag Team Championship, with Ian Rotten.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1991)===\n[[image:AxlRottenChair2009.png|thumb|right|300px|Rotten holding one of his signature chairs in 2009]]\nIn 1991, Rotten had a short stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), where he feuded with [[P.N.

In the early 1990s, he was a part of the tag team [[The Bad Breed]] with [[Ian Rotten]]. He had a short stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1991, but he was best known for his appearances with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) from 1993 to 1999.<ref name=\"Eck\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-06-12/sports/0506120091_1_knighton-professional-wrestling-matches-pro-wrestling|title=After 'Rotten' past, he returns to center stage|date=June 12, 2005|author=Eck, Kevin|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBad Breed competed in ECW's tag team division in the early years of the company until the team was forced to disband after losing to [[The Pitbulls]] and engaged in a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] against each other that ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' named [[List of Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards#Feud of the Year|Feud of the Year]] in 1995. After an unsuccessful singles career, Rotten formed short-lived tag teams with [[Hack Meyers]] and [[D-Von Dudley]] before forming Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks with [[Balls Mahoney]] in 1997. The team lasted until Rotten departed ECW in 1999. Knighton then wrestled on the independent circuit and appeared at [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] pay-per-view in 2005.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n[[image:AxlRottenApril2009Turnbuckle.png|left|thumb|250px|Rotten wrestling on the [[independent circuit]] in 2009]]\n\n===Training and independent circuit (1986\u20131993)===\nKnighton was trained to wrestle by [[Ricky Lawless]] at a gym on Baltimore's [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|North Avenue]], receiving supplementary training from [[Joey Maggs]]. He debuted on the [[independent circuit]] at the age of 17, adopting the ring name \"Axl Rotten\", a [[portmanteau]] of the [[Rock music|rockers]] [[Axl Rose]] and [[Johnny Rotten]].<ref name=\"Eck\"/> Rotten won his first championship teaming with Lawless to win the tag team titles in Frank Cain's Star Cavalcade Wrestling during the summer of 1988. He also succeeded Lawless as the promotion's heavyweight champion when, shortly after reigning champion Ricky Lawless was murdered, he won the vacant title from The Psycho in [[Thomasville, Georgia]] on November 30, 1988.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nIn the early 1990s, Rotten trained [[Ian Rotten]], who formed a [[tag team]] with Axl, masquerading as his brother and taking his stage name from [[Tommy Chong]]'s character in ''[[Get Out of My Room]]''. The duo, known as [[The Bad Breed]], wrestled primarily in the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. Axl later opened his own [[professional wrestling promotion]] in Maryland called Universal Independent Wrestling. The promotion featured wrestlers such as the Bad Breed, [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and [[Raven (wrestler)|Scotty The Body]]. It had a television series that aired on Saturday nights on the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] channel. The promotion closed in the mid-1990s.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, Axl and Ian Rotten had a run with the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF) in Texas, being featured on their daily [[ESPN]] show. While in GWF, Axl succeeded in winning both the GWF Commonwealth title and the GWF Tag Team Championship, with Ian Rotten.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1991)===\n[[image:AxlRottenChair2009.png|thumb|right|300px|Rotten holding one of his signature chairs in 2009]]\nIn 1991, Rotten had a short stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), where he feuded with [[P.N.
