When she was 12 years old, her mother Rona (Isay Alvarez) goes to the United States to work for their family's better future. Life eventually becomes better for Leah, her sister, Tiffany ([[Bianca Manalo]]), and their father, Sol ([[Joel Torre]]). However, a tragedy changes their lives forever. For Leah, Rona's death creates a desire for her to go to the America and fulfill her mother's \"American dream\".\n\nTen years later, this dream comes true as Leah gets her visa to compete in a choir competition in San Francisco, California. After the contest, Leah extends her stay in San Francisco with the intention of visiting her mother's grave, and to find a way to legally work in the United States. However to her surprise, Leah does not find her mother's grave, and as her visa expires, finding a job that will allow her to remain in the United States also becomes elusive.\n\nWith the urging of Jack ([[Cherry Pie Picache]]), the mother of Leah's ex-boyfriend, Jigs ([[Albie Casi\u00f1o]]), and out of desperation, Leah agrees to a [[marriage of convenience]] so that she can get her visa. But with Leah's limited resources, it will be hard for Jack to find her a partner. The only suitable person that would agree to the small amount that Leah is willing to pay is Jack's nephew, Clark ([[James Reid (entertainer)|James Reid]]), who has been living in San Francisco for the past 11 years. His life has been full of heartbreaks as he went to the United States with his mother, Ofelia ([[Katya Santos]]), to be introduced to his American father, Kenneth. Soon after, Kenneth refuses to recognize Clark as his son, and Ofelia suddenly dies. Clark gets placed into foster homes, where he was abused. Later, because of his love for his siblings in the Philippines, Clark persevered and survived in the U.S. These misfortunes and responsibilities in life deprived Clark of romantic love.\n\nDespite their disastrous first meeting, Leah and Clark spend time as a fake couple and learn about each other's past, quirks and habits in order to pass the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) interview. As time passes, Leah and Clark discover a certain fondness for each other. They also realize that both have the same goals in life and that is to make a better life for their family.\n\nThey also start to sympathize with each other, as both reveal their deepest secrets. Soon, the sham marriage between Leah and Clark becomes real.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<!--Official cast billing from ABS-CBN.-->\n\n===Main cast ===\n<!--Do NOT create your own personal casting billing.

When she was 12 years old, her mother Rona (Isay Alvarez) goes to the United States to work for their family's better future. Life eventually becomes better for Leah, her sister, Tiffany ([[Bianca Manalo]]), and their father, Sol ([[Joel Torre]]). However, a tragedy changes their lives forever. For Leah, Rona's death creates a desire for her to go to the America and fulfill her mother's \"American dream\".\n\nTen years later, this dream comes true as Leah gets her visa to compete in a choir competition in San Francisco, California. After the contest, Leah extends her stay in San Francisco with the intention of visiting her mother's grave, and to find a way to legally work in the United States. However to her surprise, Leah does not find her mother's grave, and as her visa expires, finding a job that will allow her to remain in the United States also becomes elusive.\n\nWith the urging of Jack ([[Cherry Pie Picache]]), the mother of Leah's ex-boyfriend, Jigs ([[Albie Casi\u00f1o]]), and out of desperation, Leah agrees to a [[marriage of convenience]] so that she can get her visa. But with Leah's limited resources, it will be hard for Jack to find her a partner. The only suitable person that would agree to the small amount that Leah is willing to pay is Jack's nephew, Clark ([[James Reid (entertainer)|James Reid]]), who has been living in San Francisco for the past 11 years. His life has been full of heartbreaks as he went to the United States with his mother, Ofelia ([[Katya Santos]]), to be introduced to his American father, Kenneth. Soon after, Kenneth refuses to recognize Clark as his son, and Ofelia suddenly dies. Clark gets placed into foster homes, where he was abused. Later, because of his love for his siblings in the Philippines, Clark persevered and survived in the U.S. These misfortunes and responsibilities in life deprived Clark of romantic love.\n\nDespite their disastrous first meeting, Leah and Clark spend time as a fake couple and learn about each other's past, quirks and habits in order to pass the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) interview. As time passes, Leah and Clark discover a certain fondness for each other. They also realize that both have the same goals in life and that is to make a better life for their family.\n\nThey also start to sympathize with each other, as both reveal their deepest secrets. Soon, the sham marriage between Leah and Clark becomes real.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<!--Official cast billing from ABS-CBN.-->\n\n===Main cast ===\n<!--Do NOT create your own personal casting billing.

The Joint Board acting as an \"advisory committee\" was created to plan joint operations and resolve problems of common [[interservice rivalry|rivalry]] between the two services.<ref name=\"Millett\"/><ref name=jcs/>\n\nYet, the Joint Board accomplished little as its charter gave it no authority to enforce its decisions. The Joint Board also lacked the ability to originate its own opinions and was thus limited to commenting only on the problems submitted to it by the [[United States Secretary of War|secretaries of war]] and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy]]. As a result, the Joint Board had little to no impact on the manner in which the United States conducted World War I.\n\nAfter World War I, in 1919 the two secretaries agreed to reestablish and revitalize the Joint Board. The mission of the General Staff was to develop plans for mobilization for the next war; the US was always designated \"blue\" and [[United States color-coded war plans|potential enemies were assigned various other colors]].<ref>{{cite book |page=26 |first=John H. |last=Bradley |first2=Thomas E. |last2=Griess |first3=Jack W. |last3=Dice |others=[[United States Military Academy]], Dept. of History |title=The Second World War: Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Square One |year=2002 |isbn=0-7570-0162-9 }}</ref>\n\nThis time, the Joint Board's membership would include the chiefs of staff, their deputies, and the chief of [[War Plans Division|war plans division]] for the Army and director of plans division for the Navy. Under the Joint Board would be a staff called the Joint Planning Committee to serve the board. Along with new membership, the Joint Board could initiate recommendations on its own initiative. However, the Joint Board still did not possess the legal authority to enforce its decisions.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:World War II Joint Chiefs of Staff 1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting (circa 1943).

The Joint Board's lack of authority made it of little use to the CCS, although its 1935 publication, Joint Action of the Army and Navy, did give some guidance for the joint operations during World War II. The Joint Board had little influence during the war and was ultimately disbanded in 1947.\n\nAs a counterpart to the UK's Chiefs of Staff Committee in the CCS, and to provide better coordinated effort and coordinated staff work for America's military effort, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] proposed a \"unified high command\" in what would come to be called the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Arnold was later appointed to the grade of [[General of the Air Force]].\n\nOne of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's committees was the Joint Strategic Survey Committee (JSSC). The JSSC was an extraordinary JCS committee that existed from 1942 until 1947. It was \"one of the most influential planning agencies in the wartime armed forces.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Stoler |title=From Continentalism to Globalism: General Stanley D.

Fairchild]], U.S. Army Air Force, 1942\u2013?.\n\n===National Security Act of 1947===\n[[File:US Joint Chiefs of Staff Jul 1983.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Joint Chiefs of Staff and several Commanders in Chief gathered at the Pentagon on 1 July 1983.]]\n\nWith the end of World War II, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was officially established under the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. Per the National Security Act, the JCS consisted of a chairman, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|chief of staff of the Army]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|chief of staff of the Air Force]] (which was established as a separate service by the same Act), and the [[Chief of Naval Operations|chief of naval operations]]. The [[commandant of the Marine Corps]] was to be consulted on matters concerning the Corps, but was not a regular member; General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.]], Commandant in 1952\u201355, was the first to sit as an occasional member. The law was amended during the term of General [[Louis H. Wilson, Jr.]] (1975\u201379), making the commandant a full-time JCS member in parity with the other three DoD services.\n\nThe position of vice chairman was created by the [[Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act]] of 1986 to complement the CJCS, as well as to delegate some of the chairman's responsibilities, particularly resource allocation through the [[Joint Requirements Oversight Council]] (JROC).\n\nGeneral [[Colin Powell|Colin L. Powell]] (1989\u20131993) was the first and, as of 2011, the only African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General [[Peter Pace]] (Vice Chairman 2001\u20132005; Chairman, 2005\u20132007) was the first Marine to serve in either position. No woman has ever served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n===National Defense Authorization Act of 2012===\nA provision in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act added the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Guard historians called it the \"most significant development\" for the National Guard since the [[Militia Act of 1903]].<ref name=\"armytimes\"/>\n\n==Organization and leadership positions==\n\n===Chairman===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Colin Powell]] -->\n{{Main|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff}}\n\nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is, by law, the highest-ranking military officer of the [[United States Armed Forces]],<ref name=\"CJCS\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/152-] 10 USC 152.

Leahy]] became the chief of staff to the commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy (20 July 1942 \u2013 21 March 1949). He was not technically the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Leahy's office was the precursor to the post of ''Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff''. That post was established and first held by General of the Army [[Omar Bradley]] in 1949.\n\nThe current (20th) chairman is General [[Mark A. Milley]], who began his tenure on September 30, 2019.\n\n===Vice Chairman===\n{{Main|Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff}}\n\nThe position of [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] was created by the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] of 1986. The vice chairman is a four-star-[[General (United States)|general]] or [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] and, by law, is the second highest-ranking member of the U.S. Armed Forces (after the [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]). In the absence of the chairman, the vice chairman presides over the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He may also perform such duties as the chairman may prescribe. It was not until the National Defense Authorization Act in 1992 that the position was made a full voting member of the JCS.<ref>[http://www.jcs.mil/about_cjs.html About the Joint Chiefs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705063957/http://www.jcs.mil/about_cjs.html |date= 5 July 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe current vice chairman is General [[John E.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff also act in a military advisory capacity for the president of the United States and the secretary of defense. In addition, the [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] acts as the chief military advisor to the president and the secretary of defense.

The Joint Board acting as an \"advisory committee\" was created to plan joint operations and resolve problems of common [[interservice rivalry|rivalry]] between the two services.<ref name=\"Millett\"/><ref name=jcs/>\n\nYet, the Joint Board accomplished little as its charter gave it no authority to enforce its decisions. The Joint Board also lacked the ability to originate its own opinions and was thus limited to commenting only on the problems submitted to it by the [[United States Secretary of War|secretaries of war]] and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy]]. As a result, the Joint Board had little to no impact on the manner in which the United States conducted World War I.\n\nAfter World War I, in 1919 the two secretaries agreed to reestablish and revitalize the Joint Board. The mission of the General Staff was to develop plans for mobilization for the next war; the US was always designated \"blue\" and [[United States color-coded war plans|potential enemies were assigned various other colors]].<ref>{{cite book |page=26 |first=John H. |last=Bradley |first2=Thomas E. |last2=Griess |first3=Jack W. |last3=Dice |others=[[United States Military Academy]], Dept. of History |title=The Second World War: Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Square One |year=2002 |isbn=0-7570-0162-9 }}</ref>\n\nThis time, the Joint Board's membership would include the chiefs of staff, their deputies, and the chief of [[War Plans Division|war plans division]] for the Army and director of plans division for the Navy. Under the Joint Board would be a staff called the Joint Planning Committee to serve the board. Along with new membership, the Joint Board could initiate recommendations on its own initiative. However, the Joint Board still did not possess the legal authority to enforce its decisions.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:World War II Joint Chiefs of Staff 1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting (circa 1943).

The Joint Board's lack of authority made it of little use to the CCS, although its 1935 publication, Joint Action of the Army and Navy, did give some guidance for the joint operations during World War II. The Joint Board had little influence during the war and was ultimately disbanded in 1947.\n\nAs a counterpart to the UK's Chiefs of Staff Committee in the CCS, and to provide better coordinated effort and coordinated staff work for America's military effort, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] proposed a \"unified high command\" in what would come to be called the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The [[commandant of the Marine Corps]] was to be consulted on matters concerning the Corps, but was not a regular member; General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.]], Commandant in 1952\u201355, was the first to sit as an occasional member. The law was amended during the term of General [[Louis H. Wilson, Jr.]] (1975\u201379), making the commandant a full-time JCS member in parity with the other three DoD services.\n\nThe position of vice chairman was created by the [[Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act]] of 1986 to complement the CJCS, as well as to delegate some of the chairman's responsibilities, particularly resource allocation through the [[Joint Requirements Oversight Council]] (JROC).\n\nGeneral [[Colin Powell|Colin L. Powell]] (1989\u20131993) was the first and, as of 2011, the only African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General [[Peter Pace]] (Vice Chairman 2001\u20132005; Chairman, 2005\u20132007) was the first Marine to serve in either position. No woman has ever served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n===National Defense Authorization Act of 2012===\nA provision in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act added the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
